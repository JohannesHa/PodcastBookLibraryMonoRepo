00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
 The following is a conversation with Sheldon Solomon, a social psychologist, a philosopher,

00:05.760 --> 00:12.560
 co developer of terror management theory, and co author of The Warm at the Core on the role of

00:12.560 --> 00:18.480
 death in life. He further carried the ideas of Ernest Becker that can crudely summarize as the

00:18.480 --> 00:25.040
 idea that our fear of death is at the core of the human condition and the driver of most of the

00:25.040 --> 00:32.480
 creations of human civilization. Quick summary of the sponsors Blinkist, ExpressVPN, and Cash App.

00:43.120 --> 00:49.360
 big impact on my thinking about human cognition, consciousness, and the deep ocean currents of our

00:49.360 --> 00:55.280
 mind that are behind the surface behaviors we observe. Many people have told me that they think

00:55.280 --> 01:00.960
 about death, or don't think about death, fear death, or don't fear death, but I think not many

01:00.960 --> 01:08.320
 people think about this topic deeply, rigorously, in the way that Nietzsche suggested. This topic,

01:08.320 --> 01:15.360
 like many that lead to deep personal self reflection, frankly is dangerous for the mind.

01:15.360 --> 01:20.560
 As all first principles thinking about the human condition is, if you gaze long into the abyss,

01:20.560 --> 01:26.240
 like Nietzsche said, the abyss will gaze back into you. I have been recently reading a lot

01:26.240 --> 01:32.160
 about World War II, Stalin, and Hitler. It feels to me that there is some fundamental truth there

01:32.160 --> 01:38.800
 to be discovered, in the moments of history that changed everything, the suffering, the triumphs.

01:39.520 --> 01:43.760
 If I bring up Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin in these conversations, it is never through

01:43.760 --> 01:52.080
 a political lens. I'm not left nor right. I think for myself, deeply, and often question everything,

01:52.080 --> 01:58.320
 changing my mind as often as is needed. I ask for your patience, empathy, and rigorous thinking.

01:58.320 --> 02:04.160
 If you arrived to this podcast from a place of partisanship, if you hate Trump, or love Trump,

02:04.160 --> 02:09.760
 or any other political leader, no matter what he or they do, and see everyone who disagrees with

02:09.760 --> 02:16.000
 you as delusional, I ask that you unsubscribe, and don't listen to these conversations, because my

02:16.000 --> 02:21.920
 hope is to go beyond that kind of divisive thinking. I think we can only make progress

02:21.920 --> 02:27.680
 toward truth through deep, empathetic thinking and conversation, and as always, love.

05:04.080 --> 05:10.640
 fact about physical money. It costs 2.4 cents to produce a single penny. In fact, I think it costs

 people around the world. And now, here's my conversation with Sheldon Solomon.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.520
 What is the role of death and fear of death in life?

05:38.320 --> 05:48.960
 Well, from our perspective, the uniquely human awareness of death and our unwillingness to accept

05:48.960 --> 05:56.160
 that fact, we would argue, is the primary motivational impetus for almost everything

05:56.160 --> 05:59.920
 that people do, whether they're aware of it or not.

05:59.920 --> 06:06.080
 So that's kind of been your life work. Your view of the human condition is that death,

06:06.080 --> 06:09.280
 you've written the book Warm at the Core, that death is at the core of our

06:09.840 --> 06:14.560
 consciousness of everything, of how we see the world, of what drives us. Maybe can you,

06:14.560 --> 06:22.400
 can you elaborate how you see death fitting in? What does it mean to be at the core of our being?

06:22.400 --> 06:29.360
 So I think that's a great question. And, you know, to be pedantic, I usually start,

06:29.360 --> 06:35.760
 you know, my psychology classes and I say to the students, okay, you know, let's define our terms.

06:35.760 --> 06:42.240
 And the ology part, they get right away. You know, it's the study of, and then we get to the psyche

06:42.240 --> 06:49.440
 part. And understandably, you know, the students are like, oh, that means mind. And I'm like,

06:49.440 --> 06:59.360
 well, no, that's a modern interpretation. But in ancient Greek, it means soul, but not in the

06:59.360 --> 07:05.760
 Cartesian dualistic sense that most of us in the West think when that word comes to mind.

07:05.760 --> 07:14.000
 And so you hear the word soul and you're like, well, all right, that's the nonphysical part of

07:14.000 --> 07:21.760
 me that's potentially detachable from my corporal container when I'm no longer here. But Aristotle's

07:22.320 --> 07:31.840
 who coined the word psyche, I think, he was not a dualist. He was a monist. He thought that the soul

07:31.840 --> 07:39.760
 was inextricably connected to the body. And he defined soul as the essence of a natural body

07:40.320 --> 07:50.000
 that is alive. And then he goes on and he says, all right, let me give you an example. If an

07:50.560 --> 07:58.400
 axe was alive, the soul of an axe would be to chop. And if you can pluck your eyeball out of

07:58.400 --> 08:07.040
 your head and it was still functioning, then the soul of the eyeball would be to see, you know,

08:07.040 --> 08:12.640
 and then he's like, all right, the soul of a grasshopper is to hop. The soul of a woodpecker

08:12.640 --> 08:20.080
 is to pack, which raises the question, of course, what is the essence of what it means to be human?

08:20.080 --> 08:29.440
 And here, of course, there is no one universally accepted conception of the essence of our humanity.

08:29.440 --> 08:34.880
 All right, Aristotle, you know, gives us the idea of humans as rational animals. You know, we're

08:34.880 --> 08:42.800
 homo sapiens. But not the only game in town got Joseph Heusinger, an anthropologist in the 20th

08:42.800 --> 08:50.000
 century. He called us homo ludens that were basically fundamentally playful creatures. And

08:50.000 --> 08:57.200
 I think it was Hannah Arendt, homo faber, were tool making creatures. Another woman,

08:57.200 --> 09:03.200
 Ellen Dizanayake, wrote a book called Homo Aestheticus. And following Aristotle and his

09:03.200 --> 09:08.880
 poetics, she's like, well, we're not only rational animals, we're also aesthetic creatures that

09:08.880 --> 09:15.760
 appreciate beauty. There's another take on humans. I think they call us homo narratans.

09:16.480 --> 09:24.320
 We're storytelling creatures. And I think all of those designations of what it means to be human

09:24.880 --> 09:30.720
 are quite useful heuristically and certainly worthy of our collective cogitation. But what

09:30.720 --> 09:39.200
 garnered my attention when I was a young punk was just a single line in an essay by a Scottish guy,

09:39.200 --> 09:47.680
 who was Alexander Smith, in a book called Dreamthwarp. I think it's written in the 1860s.

09:47.680 --> 09:53.360
 He just says right in the middle of an essay, it is our knowledge that we have to die that makes

09:53.360 --> 10:01.920
 us human. And I remember reading that. And in my gut, I was like, oh, man, I don't like that. But

10:01.920 --> 10:08.720
 I think you're onto something. And then William James, the great Harvard philosopher and arguably

10:08.720 --> 10:16.880
 the first academic psychologist, he referred to death as the worm at the core of the human

10:16.880 --> 10:23.120
 condition. So that's where the worm at the core idea comes in. And that's just an allusion to

10:24.000 --> 10:32.240
 the story of Genesis back in the proverbial old days in the Garden of Eden. Everything was going

10:32.240 --> 10:39.200
 tremendously well until the serpent tempts Eve to take a chop out of the apple of the tree of

10:39.200 --> 10:47.680
 knowledge, and Adam partakes also. And this is, according to the Bible, what brings death into

10:47.680 --> 10:58.320
 the world. And from our vantage point, the story of Genesis is a remarkable allegorical recount of

10:58.320 --> 11:05.920
 the origin of consciousness, where we get to the point where, by virtue of our vast intelligence,

11:05.920 --> 11:12.640
 we come to realize the inevitability of death. And so, you know, the apple is beautiful and it's

11:12.640 --> 11:19.280
 tasty. But when you get right into the middle of it, there's that ugly reality, which is our

11:19.280 --> 11:27.040
 finitude. And then fast forward a bit, and I was a young professor at Skidmore College in 1980.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.560
 My PhD is in experimental social psychology, and I mainly did studies for the study of the

11:34.560 --> 11:41.360
 world. I mainly did studies with clinical psychologists evaluating the efficacy of

11:41.360 --> 11:47.200
 nonpharmacological interventions to reduce stress. And that was good work, and I found it

11:47.200 --> 11:54.080
 interesting. But in my first week as a professor at Skidmore, I'm just walking up and down the

11:54.080 --> 12:01.600
 shelves of the library, saw some books by a guy I had never heard of, Ernest Becker, a cultural

12:01.600 --> 12:11.920
 scientist, recently deceased. He died in 1974. After weeks before, actually, he was posthumously

12:12.480 --> 12:16.800
 awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Nonfiction for his book, The Denial of Death.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.760
 And that was his last book?

12:19.760 --> 12:24.640
 It's actually his next to last book. I don't know how you pull this off, but he had one more

12:24.640 --> 12:30.640
 after he died called Escape from Evil. And evidently, it was supposed to... Originally,

12:30.640 --> 12:35.760
 The Denial of Death was supposed to be this giant thousand page book that was both,

12:36.560 --> 12:44.160
 and they split it up, and what became Escape from Evil, his wife, Marie Becker, finished.

12:45.120 --> 12:53.520
 Well, be that as it may, it is in The Denial of Death where Becker just says in the first paragraph,

12:53.520 --> 13:02.880
 I believe that the terror of death and the way that human beings respond to it or decline

13:02.880 --> 13:10.080
 to respond to it is primarily responsible for almost everything we do, whether we're aware of

13:10.080 --> 13:19.120
 it or not, and mostly we're not. And so I read that first paragraph, Lex, and I was like, wow,

13:19.680 --> 13:20.480
 okay, this dude's...

13:20.480 --> 13:21.280
 You're onto something.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.240
 You're onto something.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.120
 It's the same thing here.

13:23.120 --> 13:31.120
 It's the same thing. And then it reminded me, I think, not to play psychologist, but

13:31.920 --> 13:40.080
 let's face it, I believe there's a reason why we end up drifting where we ultimately come to. So

13:40.080 --> 13:47.360
 I'm in my mid 20s. I got Ernest Becker's book in my hand. And the next thing I know, I'm remembering

13:47.360 --> 13:55.760
 that when I'm eight years old, the day that my grandmother died. And the day before, my mom said,

13:55.760 --> 14:04.320
 oh, say goodbye to grandma. She's not well. And so I was like, okay, grandma. And I knew she wasn't

14:04.320 --> 14:10.000
 well, but I didn't really appreciate the magnitude of her illness. Well, she dies the next day.

14:10.800 --> 14:17.200
 And it's in the evening and I'm just sitting there looking at my stamp collection. And I'm

14:17.200 --> 14:22.640
 like, wow, I'm going to miss my grandmother. And then I'm like, no, wait a minute. That means my

14:22.640 --> 14:29.040
 mother's going to die after she gets old. And that's even worse. After all, who's going to make

14:29.040 --> 14:34.800
 me dinner? And that bothered me for a while. But then I'm looking at the stamps, all the dead

14:34.800 --> 14:39.840
 American presidents. And I'm like, there's George Washington. He's dead. There's Thomas Jefferson.

14:39.840 --> 14:48.240
 He's dead. My mom's going to be dead. Oh, I'm going to get old and be dead someday. And at

14:48.240 --> 14:54.240
 eight years old, that was my first explicit existential crisis. I remember it being,

14:54.240 --> 15:03.280
 you know, one of these blood curdling realizations that I tried my best to ignore for the most of the

15:03.280 --> 15:10.160
 time I was subsequently growing up. But fast forward back to Skidmore College, mid twenties,

15:10.160 --> 15:18.160
 you know, reading Becker's book in the 1980s, thinking to myself, wow, one of the reasons

15:18.160 --> 15:23.520
 why I'm finding this so compelling is that it squares with my own personal experience.

15:23.520 --> 15:31.360
 And then to make a short story long, and I'll shut up, Lex, but what grabbed me about Becker,

15:31.360 --> 15:37.680
 and this is in part because I read a lot of his other books, there's another book, The Birth and

15:37.680 --> 15:45.280
 Death of Meaning, which is framed in from an evolutionary perspective. And then The Denial

15:45.280 --> 15:54.480
 of Death is really more framed from an existential psychodynamic vantage point. And as a young

15:54.480 --> 16:06.240
 academic, I was really taken by what I found to be a very potent juxtaposition that you really don't

16:06.240 --> 16:14.720
 see that often. Yet usually evolutionary types are eager to dismiss the psychodynamic types

16:14.720 --> 16:20.160
 and vice versa. And maybe only John Bowlby, you know, there's there's other folks. But

16:20.160 --> 16:27.280
 the attachment theorist, John Bowlby, was really one of the first serious academics to say these

16:27.920 --> 16:33.440
 these ways of thinking about things are quite compatible.

16:33.440 --> 16:39.200
 And can you comment on what's what a psychodynamics view of the world is versus an evolutionary view

16:39.200 --> 16:40.640
 of the world, just in case people are not?

16:40.640 --> 16:45.520
 Oh, yeah, absolutely. That's that's a fine question. Well, for the evolutionary types

16:45.520 --> 16:59.440
 in general are interested in how it is and why it is that we have adapted to our surroundings

16:59.440 --> 17:06.000
 in the service of persisting over time and being represented in the gene pool thereafter.

17:06.640 --> 17:13.280
 You used to be a fish. Yeah, we used to be a fish. And I'll end up talking on a podcast.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.160
 Yeah. How we came to be that way.

17:16.160 --> 17:22.560
 How we came to be that way. And so whereas the existential psychodynamic types, I would say,

17:22.560 --> 17:30.960
 are more interested in development across a single lifespan. And but but the evolutionary

17:30.960 --> 17:38.400
 types dismiss the psychodynamic types as overly speculative and devoid of empirical support for

17:38.400 --> 17:44.880
 their views. They, you know, they'll just say these guys are talking shit, if you'll pardon

17:44.880 --> 17:51.680
 the expression. And of course, you can turn right around and say the same about the evolutionary

17:51.680 --> 17:58.480
 types that they are often and rightfully criticized evolutionary psychologists for what are called the

17:58.480 --> 18:07.760
 just so stories that where it's like, oh, this is probably why fill in the blank is potentially

18:07.760 --> 18:20.000
 adaptive. And my thought again early on was I didn't see any intrinsic antithesis between

18:20.000 --> 18:27.200
 these viewpoints. I just found them dialectically compatible and very powerful when combined.

18:27.200 --> 18:33.680
 So one question I would ask here is about a science being speculative. You know,

18:33.680 --> 18:38.800
 we understand a little about the human mind. You said you picked up Becker's book and, you know,

18:38.800 --> 18:44.480
 it felt like it was onto something. That's the same thing I felt when I picked up Becker's book,

18:45.120 --> 18:50.960
 probably also in my early 20s. You know, I read a lot of philosophy, but it felt like the question

18:50.960 --> 18:58.480
 of the meaning of life kind of, you know, this seemed to be the most the closest to the truth

18:58.480 --> 19:06.240
 somehow. It was onto something. So I guess the question I want to ask also is like how speculative

19:06.240 --> 19:14.960
 is psychology? How like all of your life's work? How do you feel? How confident do you feel about

19:14.960 --> 19:25.680
 the whole thing? About understanding our mind? I feel confidently unconfident to have both ways.

19:25.680 --> 19:30.000
 Like what do we make of psychology? What do we make starting with Freud, you know,

19:30.000 --> 19:40.640
 starting just our, or even just philosophy, even the aspects of the sciences, like, you know,

19:40.640 --> 19:47.200
 my field of artificial intelligence, but also physics, you know, it often feels like, man,

19:47.200 --> 19:53.520
 we don't really understand most of what's going on here. And certainly that's true with the human

19:53.520 --> 19:58.640
 mind. Yeah. Well, to me, that's the proper epistemological stance. I don't know anything.

19:59.200 --> 20:08.400
 Well, it's the Socratic I know that I don't know, which is the first step on the path to wisdom.

20:08.400 --> 20:20.240
 I would argue forcefully that we know a lot more than we used to. I would argue equally forcefully,

20:20.240 --> 20:26.400
 but not that I have a PhD in the philosophy of science, but I believe that the Thomas

20:26.400 --> 20:33.920
 Kuhns of the world are right when they point out that change is not necessarily progress.

20:34.960 --> 20:42.320
 And so on the one hand, I do think we know a lot more than we did back in the day when if you

20:42.320 --> 20:49.120
 wanted to fly, you put on some wax wings and jumped off a mountain. On the other hand, I think

20:49.120 --> 20:59.280
 it's quite arrogant when scientists, I'll just speak about psychological scientists, when they

20:59.280 --> 21:11.200
 have the audacity to mistake statistical precision for knowledge and insight. And when they make the

21:11.200 --> 21:19.280
 mistake, in my estimation, that Einstein bemoaned, and that's this idea that the mere accumulation

21:19.840 --> 21:29.520
 of data will necessarily result in conceptual breakthroughs. And so I like the, well, we're all,

21:29.520 --> 21:35.200
 I hope, appreciative of the people who trained us. But I remember my first day in graduate school at

21:35.200 --> 21:40.560
 the University of Kansas, they brought us into a room and on one side of the board was a quote by

21:40.560 --> 21:48.080
 Kurt Lewin or Levine, famous German social psychologist. And the quote is,

21:48.080 --> 21:53.280
 there's nothing more useful than a good theory. And then on the other side was another quote by

21:53.280 --> 21:59.200
 a German physicist, his name eludes me, and it was all theories are wrong. And I'm like,

22:00.640 --> 22:09.760
 which is it? And of course, the point is that it's both. Our theories are, I believe,

22:09.760 --> 22:21.440
 powerful ways to direct our attention to aspects of human affairs that might render us better able

22:21.440 --> 22:29.440
 to understand ourselves in the world around us. Now, I also, as an experimental psychologist,

22:30.000 --> 22:38.000
 I adhere to the view that theories are essentially hypothesis generating devices.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.080
 And that at its best, science is a dialectical interplay where you have theoretical assertions

22:44.080 --> 22:52.160
 that yield testable hypotheses and that either results in the corroboration of the theory,

22:52.160 --> 22:59.680
 the rejection of it or the modification thereafter. If we look at the existentialists

23:01.280 --> 23:07.200
 or even like modern philosopher, psychologist types like Jordan Peterson, I'm not sure if

23:07.200 --> 23:14.000
 you're familiar with Jordan pretty well. We go way back. Actually, if he were here with us today,

23:14.000 --> 23:22.080
 we would he would be jumping in and I believe very interesting and important ways. But yeah,

23:22.080 --> 23:30.480
 we go back 30 years ago. He was basically saying our work is nonsense. Let's get into this. I'll

23:30.480 --> 23:35.600
 talk to Jordan eventually on this thing. Yeah, there's some rough times right now. Oh, absolutely.

23:35.600 --> 23:44.160
 And I and I wish him well. Jordan was working on his maps of meaning and we were publishing our

23:44.160 --> 23:56.080
 work. And I think Jordan at the time was concerned about our vague claims to the effect that all

23:56.080 --> 24:05.120
 meaning is arbitrary. He takes a more Jungian as well as evolutionary view that I don't think is

24:05.120 --> 24:16.320
 wrong, by the way, which is that there are certain kinds of meanings that are more important,

24:16.320 --> 24:25.840
 let's say religious types, and that we didn't pay sufficient attention to that in our early days.

24:25.840 --> 24:31.600
 So can you try to elucidate like what his worldview is? Because he's also a religious man.

24:31.600 --> 24:37.680
 And so what what was this? What was some of the interesting aspects of the disagreements

24:37.680 --> 24:42.480
 that then? Yeah, well, back in the day, I just said, you know, Jordan was a young punk. We were

24:42.480 --> 24:47.920
 young punks. He was just kind of flailing in an animated way at some conferences saying that

24:49.200 --> 24:53.840
 we you're still both kind of punks. Yeah, we are kind of punk. So I saw him three or four years

24:53.840 --> 25:00.160
 ago. We spoke on a it was an awesome day. We're in Canada at the Ontario Shakespeare Festival,

25:00.160 --> 25:06.800
 where we were asked to be on a Canadian broadcast system program. I think we were talking about

25:06.800 --> 25:14.880
 Macbeth from a psychodynamic perspective. And I hadn't seen him in a ton of years. And we spent

25:14.880 --> 25:20.880
 two days together, had a great time. You know, we had just written our book, The Worm at the Core.

25:20.880 --> 25:26.720
 And he's like, you know, you're you're missing a big opportunity. Every time you say something,

25:26.720 --> 25:32.720
 you have to have your phone and you have to film yourself and then you have to put it on YouTube.

25:32.720 --> 25:40.000
 Yeah, he was onto something that, you know, that just as a small tangent. Yeah. It's it's almost

25:40.000 --> 25:44.960
 sad to look at Jordan Peterson and somebody like yourself. After having done this podcast,

25:44.960 --> 25:51.520
 I've realized that there is really brilliant people in this world. And oftentimes, especially

25:51.520 --> 25:58.320
 like when they're, I mean, it would love are a little bit like punks. That's right. They kind

25:58.320 --> 26:03.840
 of do their own thing and make the world doesn't know they exist as much as they should. And it's

26:03.840 --> 26:11.360
 so interesting because most people are kind of boring. Yes. And then the interesting ones kind

26:11.360 --> 26:16.240
 of go on their own. And there's not a smartphone. No, that's that's so interesting. He was onto

26:16.240 --> 26:22.240
 something that I mean, it's interesting that I don't think he was thinking from a money perspective,

26:22.880 --> 26:27.040
 but he was probably thinking of like connecting with people or sharing his knowledge.

26:27.600 --> 26:33.760
 But people don't often think that way. That's right. So maybe we can try to get back to you're

26:33.760 --> 26:39.840
 both brilliant people. And I'd love to get some interesting disagreements earlier and later about

26:39.840 --> 26:46.960
 in your psychological work and your world views. Well, our disagreements today would be

26:50.000 --> 26:59.520
 along two dimensions. One is he is and again, I wish he was here to correct me. Yes. When I say

26:59.520 --> 27:09.680
 that he is more committed to the virtues of the Judeo Christian tradition, I see particularly

27:09.680 --> 27:17.840
 Christianity and in a sense is a contemporary Kierkegaard of sorts when he's saying there's only

27:17.840 --> 27:26.320
 one way to leap into faith. And I would take ardent issue with that claim on the grounds that

27:26.320 --> 27:37.600
 that is one, but by no means not the only way to find meaning and value in life. And so and I see

27:37.600 --> 27:43.840
 his. What's his warm at the core? What is like? So we're talking about a little bit of a higher

27:43.840 --> 27:49.840
 level of discovering meaning. Yeah. What's his? What does he make of death? Oh, I don't know.

27:49.840 --> 27:59.280
 And this is where it would be nice to have him here. He has, you know, from a distance criticized

27:59.280 --> 28:06.240
 our work as misguided. Having said that, though, when we were together, he said something along

28:06.240 --> 28:15.280
 the lines that there is no theoretical body of work in academic psychology right now for which

28:15.280 --> 28:22.160
 there is more empirical evidence. And so I appreciated that. He's a great researcher. He's

28:22.160 --> 28:30.240
 a good clinician. The other thing that we will agree to disagree about rather vociferously is

28:30.240 --> 28:39.040
 his ultimately political slash economic. So I remember being at dinner with him,

28:39.040 --> 28:44.480
 telling him that the next book that I wanted to write was going to be called Why Left and Right

28:44.480 --> 28:50.960
 are Both Beside the Point. And my argument was going to be and it is going to be that both

28:50.960 --> 28:59.040
 liberal and political liberal and conservative political philosophy are each intellectually and

28:59.040 --> 29:05.040
 morally bankrupt because they're both framed in terms of assumptions about human nature that are

29:05.040 --> 29:14.000
 demonstrably false. And Jordan didn't mind me knocking liberal political philosophy on those

29:14.000 --> 29:21.120
 grounds. That would basically be like Steven Pinker's blank slate. But he took issue when

29:21.120 --> 29:29.200
 I pointed out that actually it's conservative political philosophy, which starts with John

29:29.200 --> 29:35.200
 Locke's assumption that in a state of nature, there are no societies, just autonomous individuals

29:36.080 --> 29:45.760
 who are striving for survival. That's one of the most obviously patently wrong assertions in the

29:45.760 --> 29:55.040
 history of intellectual thought. And Locke uses that to justify his claims about the individual

29:55.040 --> 30:03.280
 right to acquire unlimited amounts of property, which is ultimately the justification for

30:03.280 --> 30:11.680
 neoliberal economics. Can you linger on that a little bit? Can you describe his philosophy

30:11.680 --> 30:19.120
 again as view of the world and what neoliberal economics is? Yeah, let me translate it in

30:19.120 --> 30:29.040
 English. So basically on all these days, anybody who says I'm a conservative free market type,

30:30.400 --> 30:35.520
 you're following John Locke and Adam Smith, whether you're aware of it or not. So here's

30:35.520 --> 30:42.000
 John Locke, who, by the way, all of these guys are great. So for me to appear to criticize any

30:42.000 --> 30:48.480
 of these folks, it is with the highest regard. And also, we need to understand in my estimation

30:49.280 --> 30:57.520
 how important their ideas are. Locke is working in a time where all rule was top down by divine

30:57.520 --> 31:05.680
 right. And he's trying desperately to come up with a philosophical justification to shift power

31:06.320 --> 31:14.880
 and autonomy to individuals. And he starts in his second treatise on government, 1690 or so,

31:16.240 --> 31:22.320
 he says, okay, let's start with a state of nature. And he's like, in a state of nature,

31:22.320 --> 31:29.760
 there's no societies, there's just individuals. And in a perfect universe,

31:29.760 --> 31:37.920
 there wouldn't be any societies, there would just be individuals who by the law of nature have a

31:37.920 --> 31:48.800
 right to survive. And in the service of survival, they have the right to acquire and preserve the

31:48.800 --> 31:56.080
 fruits of their own labor. But his point is, and it's actually a good one, he's following Hobbes

31:56.080 --> 32:02.480
 here. He's like, well, the problem with that is that people are assholes. And if they would

32:02.480 --> 32:08.000
 let each other alone, then we would still be living in a state of nature, everybody just

32:08.000 --> 32:16.400
 doing what they did to get by each day. But it's a whole lot easier if I see like an apple tree

32:16.400 --> 32:23.280
 a mile away. Well, I can go over and pick an apple. But if you're 10 meters away with an apple

32:23.280 --> 32:28.720
 in your hand, it's a lot easier if I pick up a rock and crack your head and take the apple.

32:29.360 --> 32:38.880
 And his point was that the problem is that people can't be counted on to behave. They will take each

32:38.880 --> 32:51.120
 other's property. Moreover, he argued, if someone takes your property, you have the right to retribution

32:52.000 --> 32:57.120
 in proportion to the degree of the magnitude of the transgression. English translation,

32:57.920 --> 33:04.480
 if I take your apple, you have the right to take an apple back. You don't have the right to kill

33:04.480 --> 33:13.440
 my firstborn. But people being people, they're apt to escalate retaliatory behavior, thus creating

33:13.440 --> 33:20.080
 what Locke called a state of war. So he said, in order to avoid a state of war, people reluctantly

33:20.080 --> 33:28.480
 give up their freedom in exchange for security. They agree to obey the law and that the sole

33:28.480 --> 33:34.400
 function of government is to keep domestic tranquility and to ward off foreign invasion in

33:34.400 --> 33:41.600
 order to protect our right to property. All right. So now here's the property thing. All right. So

33:42.960 --> 33:48.480
 Locke says, if you look in the Bible and in nature, there is no private property.

33:48.480 --> 33:58.480
 But Locke says, well, surely if there's anything that you own, it's your body. And surely you have

33:58.480 --> 34:07.680
 a right by nature to stay alive. And then by extension, anything that you do where you exert

34:07.680 --> 34:14.560
 effort or labor, that becomes your private property. So back to the apple tree. If I walk

34:14.560 --> 34:21.840
 over to an apple tree, that's everybody's apples until I pick one. And the minute I do,

34:21.840 --> 34:30.160
 that is my apple. And then he says, you can have as many apples as you want, as long as you don't

34:30.160 --> 34:39.600
 waste them. And as long as you don't impinge on somebody else's right to get apples. So far,

34:39.600 --> 34:54.320
 so good. Yep. And then he says, well, okay. In the early days, you could only eat so many apples

34:55.520 --> 35:01.920
 or you could only trade so many apples with somebody else. So he was like, well, if you put

35:01.920 --> 35:07.600
 a fence around a bunch of apple trees, those become your apples. That's your property.

35:07.600 --> 35:13.920
 Those become your apples. That's your property. If somebody else wants to put a fence around

35:13.920 --> 35:22.960
 Nebraska, that's their property. And everybody can have as much property as they want because

35:22.960 --> 35:33.680
 the world is so big that there is no limit to what you can have if you pursue it by virtue of

35:33.680 --> 35:41.040
 your own effort. But then he says money came into the picture. And this is important because he

35:41.040 --> 35:48.240
 noticed long before anybody, before the Freud's of the world, that money is funky because it has no

35:48.240 --> 35:55.440
 intrinsic value. He's like, ooh, look at that shiny piece of metal that actually has, if you're

35:55.440 --> 36:00.960
 hungry and you have a choice between a carrot and a lump of gold in the desert, most people are

36:00.960 --> 36:10.560
 going to go for the carrot. But his point is that the allure of money is that it's basically a

36:10.560 --> 36:18.000
 concentrated symbol of wealth, but because it doesn't spoil, Locke said, you're entitled to

36:18.000 --> 36:29.520
 have as much money as you're able to garner. Then he says, well, the reality is that some people

36:29.520 --> 36:36.160
 are more, the word that he used was industrious. He said some people more industrious than others.

36:36.640 --> 36:43.440
 All right, today we would say smarter, less lazy, more ambitious. He just said that's natural. It's

36:43.440 --> 36:52.640
 also true. Therefore, he argued, over time, some people are going to have a whole lot of property

36:52.640 --> 37:03.760
 and other people not much at all. Inequality for Locke is natural and beneficial for everyone.

37:04.400 --> 37:12.960
 His argument was that the rising tide lifts all boats and that the truly creative and innovative

37:13.760 --> 37:19.920
 are entitled to relatively unlimited worth because we're all better off as a result.

37:19.920 --> 37:29.520
 So the point very simply is that, and then you have Adam Smith in the next century with the

37:29.520 --> 37:36.320
 invisible hand where Adam Smith says, everyone pursuing their own selfish, that's not necessarily

37:36.320 --> 37:44.720
 pejorative, if everyone pursues their own selfish interests, we will all be better off as a result.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.040
 And what do you think is the flaw in that way of thinking?

37:47.040 --> 37:57.920
 Well, there's two flaws. One flaw is, first of all, that it is based on an erroneous assumption

37:57.920 --> 38:03.120
 to begin with, which is that there never was a time in human history when we were an asocial

38:03.920 --> 38:05.040
 species.

38:05.040 --> 38:12.160
 In a sense, you don't feel like there's this emphasis of individual autonomy is a flawed

38:12.160 --> 38:18.400
 promise. There's something fundamentally deeply interconnected between us.

38:18.400 --> 38:27.440
 I do. I think that Plato and Socrates in the Crito were closer to the truth when they started

38:27.440 --> 38:33.680
 with the assumption that we were interdependent, then they derived individual autonomy as a

38:33.680 --> 38:37.200
 manifestation of a functional social system.

38:37.200 --> 38:38.000
 That's fascinating.

38:38.000 --> 38:44.480
 So when Margaret Thatcher, you're too young, in the 1980s, she said, societies? There's

38:44.480 --> 38:51.040
 no such thing as societies. There's just individuals pursuing their self interest.

38:53.120 --> 38:57.360
 So that's one point where I would take issue respectfully with John Locke.

38:57.360 --> 39:06.400
 Point number two is when Locke says in 1690, well, England's filled up, so if you want

39:06.400 --> 39:11.840
 some land, just go to America, it's empty. Or maybe there's a few savages there, just

39:11.840 --> 39:12.480
 kill them.

39:13.120 --> 39:20.400
 So Melville does the same thing in Moby Dick where he thinks about, will there ever come

39:20.400 --> 39:26.720
 a time where we run out of whales? And he says, no, but we have run out of whales.

39:26.720 --> 39:36.000
 And so Locke was right maybe in 1690 that the world was large and had infinite resources.

39:36.640 --> 39:47.360
 He's certainly wrong today, in my opinion. Also wrong is the claim that the unlimited

39:47.360 --> 39:54.320
 pursuit of personal wealth does not harm those around us. There is no doubt that radical

39:54.320 --> 40:02.480
 inequality is tragic psychologically and physically. Poverty is not that terrible.

40:02.480 --> 40:07.360
 It's easy for me to say because I have a place to stay and something to eat. But as

40:07.360 --> 40:15.680
 long as you're not starving and have a place to be, poverty is not as challenging as having

40:15.680 --> 40:20.800
 the impoverished in close proximity to those who are obscenely wealthy.

40:20.800 --> 40:24.800
 LW So it's not the absolute measure of your

40:24.800 --> 40:29.120
 well being, it's the inequality of that well being is the penalty painful.

40:29.120 --> 40:37.040
 So maybe just to linger on the Jordan Peterson thing, in terms of your disagreement in his

40:37.040 --> 40:45.840
 world view. So he went through quite a bit, there's been quite a bit of fire in his defense

40:45.840 --> 40:52.240
 or maybe his opposition of the idea of equality of outcomes. So looking at the inequality

40:52.240 --> 40:59.440
 that's in our world, looking at, you know, certain groups, measurably having an outcome

40:59.440 --> 41:04.400
 that's different than other groups, and then drawing conclusions about fundamental

41:06.080 --> 41:13.360
 unfairness, injustice, inequality in the system. So like systematic racism, systematic sexism,

41:13.360 --> 41:20.320
 systematic anything else that creates inequality. And he's been kind of saying pretty simple

41:20.320 --> 41:28.240
 things to say that, you know, the system for the most part is not broken or flawed,

41:28.880 --> 41:34.880
 that the inequalities part, the inequality of outcomes is part of our world. What we

41:34.880 --> 41:39.120
 should strive for is the, you know, equality of opportunity.

41:39.120 --> 41:47.040
 Yeah, and I do not dispute that as an abstraction. But again, to back up for a second, I do take

41:47.040 --> 41:55.920
 issue with Jordan's fervent devotion to the free market and his cavalier dismissal of

41:55.920 --> 42:06.400
 Marxist ideas, which he has, in my estimation, mischaracterized in his public depictions.

42:06.400 --> 42:12.960
 Let's get into it. So he just seems to really not like socialism, Marxism, communism.

42:13.680 --> 42:19.440
 Historically speaking, sort of, I mean, how would I characterize it? I'm not exactly sure.

42:19.440 --> 42:24.000
 I don't want to, again, he'll eventually be here to defend himself. John Locke, unfortunately,

42:24.000 --> 42:34.960
 not here to defend himself. But what's your sense about Marxism and the way Jordan talks

42:34.960 --> 42:39.280
 about it, the way you think about it, from the economics, from the philosophical perspective?

42:39.280 --> 42:45.600
 Yeah, well, if we were all here together, I'd say we need to start with Marx's economic and

42:45.600 --> 42:54.560
 philosophical manuscripts of 1844, before Marx became more of a polemicist. And I would argue

42:54.560 --> 43:02.560
 that Marx's political philosophy, he's a crappy economist, I don't dispute that. But his arguments

43:02.560 --> 43:10.160
 about human nature, his arguments about the inevitably catastrophic psychological

43:10.160 --> 43:17.120
 and environmental and economic effects of capitalism, I would argue every one of those

43:17.120 --> 43:28.400
 has proven quite right. Marx maybe did not have the answer, but he saw in the 18, whenever he

43:28.400 --> 43:40.560
 was writing, that inevitably, capitalism would lead to massive inequity, that it was ultimately

43:41.280 --> 43:49.040
 based on the need to denigrate and dehumanize labor, to render them, in his language, a fleshy

43:49.040 --> 43:59.360
 cog in a giant machine. And it would create a tension and conflict between those who own things

43:59.360 --> 44:07.760
 and those who made things, that over time would always, the Thomas Pickardy guy who writes about

44:07.760 --> 44:17.360
 capital, and just makes the point that return on investment will always be greater than wages. That

44:17.360 --> 44:23.200
 means the people with money are gonna have a lot more. That means there's gonna come a point where

44:23.200 --> 44:29.280
 the economic house of cards falls apart. Now, the Joseph Schumpeters of the world, they're like,

44:29.280 --> 44:35.200
 that's creative destruction, bring it, that's great. So I think it's Niles Ferguson, he's a

44:35.200 --> 44:40.400
 historian, he may be at Stanford now, he was at Harvard. He writes about the history of money,

44:40.400 --> 44:48.320
 and he's like, yeah, there's been 20 or whatever depressions and big recessions in the last several

44:48.320 --> 44:56.560
 hundred years. And when that happens, half of the population or whatever is catastrophically

44:56.560 --> 45:05.920
 inconvenienced. But that's the price that we pay for progress. Other people would argue, and I

45:05.920 --> 45:16.720
 would agree with them that I will happily sacrifice the rate of progress in order to flatten

45:16.720 --> 45:28.560
 the curve of economic destruction. To put that in plainer English, I would direct our attention

45:28.560 --> 45:35.760
 to the social democracies that forgetting for the moment of whether it's possible to do this on a

45:35.760 --> 45:44.800
 scale in a country as big as ours, on all of the things that really matter, gross, domestic GDP

45:44.800 --> 45:50.960
 or whatever, that's just an abstraction. But when you look at whatever the United Nations says,

45:50.960 --> 46:00.720
 how we measure quality of life, life expectancy, education, rates of alcoholism, suicide, and so on,

46:00.720 --> 46:06.720
 the countries that do better are the mixed economies. They're market economies

46:07.520 --> 46:16.560
 that have high tax rates in exchange for the provision of services that come as a right

46:16.560 --> 46:22.800
 for citizens. Yeah, so I mean, I guess the question is, you've kind of mentioned that, you know,

46:24.000 --> 46:30.400
 as Marx described, capitalism with a slippery slope, eventually things go awry in some kind

46:30.400 --> 46:35.760
 of way. So that's the question is, when you have, when you implement a system, how does it go wrong

46:35.760 --> 46:43.360
 eventually? You know, eventually we'll all be dead. That's exactly right. No, that's right.

46:43.360 --> 46:50.320
 So, and then the criticism, I mean, I think these days, unfortunately, Marxism is a dirty word.

46:50.320 --> 46:58.240
 I say unfortunately, because even if you disagree with a philosophy, you should, like calling

46:58.240 --> 47:05.520
 somebody a Marxist should not be a thing that shuts down all conversation. No, that's right.

47:05.520 --> 47:13.840
 And the fact is, I'm sympathetic with Jordan's dismissal of the folks, the talking heads these

47:13.840 --> 47:22.320
 days who spew Marxist words. To me, it's like fashionable nonsense. Do you know that book that

47:22.320 --> 47:28.640
 the physicists wrote mocking? You're too young. So in the 20 or so years, we're all pretty young.

47:28.640 --> 47:33.760
 Well, yeah, that's right. But I think there were these NYU physicists, they wrote a paper just

47:33.760 --> 47:41.600
 mocking the kind of literary postmodern types. And it was, oh, those kinds of, yeah, it was just

47:41.600 --> 47:48.160
 nonsense. And of course it was made the lead article. And you know, my point is Marx wouldn't

47:48.160 --> 47:56.480
 be a Marxist. True. I have read and listened to some of the work of Richard Wolff. He speaks

47:56.480 --> 48:03.760
 pretty eloquently about Marxism. I like him. He's one of the only, you know, one of the only people

48:03.760 --> 48:10.480
 speaking about a lot about Marxism and the way we are now in a serious way, in a sort of saying,

48:10.480 --> 48:16.800
 you know, what are the flaws of capitalism? Not saying like, yeah, basically sounding very

48:16.800 --> 48:21.840
 different. People should check out his work. Because all this kind of work, this kind of

48:21.840 --> 48:30.720
 outrage mob culture of sort of demanding equality of outcome, that's not Marxism.

48:30.720 --> 48:37.120
 It is not Marxism. He didn't say that. You know, he literally said each, what was it like,

48:37.120 --> 48:42.240
 each according to their needs and each according to their abilities or something like that.

48:42.240 --> 48:47.600
 So the question is the implementation, like, humans are messy. So how does it go wrong?

48:47.600 --> 48:54.320
 Like, it is, there you go, Lex. Brilliant. It's messy. And this gets back to my rant about

48:54.880 --> 49:00.560
 the book that I want to try if I don't stroke out, why left and right are both beside the point.

49:01.120 --> 49:11.120
 You know, the people, the conservatives are right when they condemn liberals for being simple minded.

49:11.120 --> 49:19.840
 By assuming that a modification of external conditions will yield changes in human nature.

49:20.560 --> 49:27.360
 You know, again, that's where Marx and Skinner are odd bedfellows. You know, here they are just

49:27.360 --> 49:34.480
 saying, oh, let's change the surroundings and things will inevitably get better. On the other

49:34.480 --> 49:45.280
 hand, when conservatives say that people are innately selfish and they use that as the

49:45.280 --> 49:53.040
 justification for glorifying the unbridled pursuit of wealth, well, they're only half right because

49:53.040 --> 50:02.560
 it turns out that we can be innately selfish, but we are also innately generous and reciprocating

50:02.560 --> 50:08.880
 creatures. There's remarkable studies, I think they've been done at Yale, of, you know, babies,

50:08.880 --> 50:18.240
 14 month old babies. If someone hands them a toy and then wants something in return,

50:19.040 --> 50:23.600
 babies before they can walk and talk will reciprocate. All right, fine.

50:23.600 --> 50:30.000
 If someone, if they want a toy, let's say, or a bottle of water, baby wants a bottle of water,

50:30.800 --> 50:39.200
 and I look like I'm trying to give it to the baby, but I drop the bottle so the baby doesn't get

50:39.200 --> 50:47.440
 what she or he wanted. When given a chance to reciprocate, little babies will reciprocate

50:47.440 --> 50:54.480
 because they're aware of and are responding to intention. Similarly, if they see somebody

50:55.360 --> 51:04.400
 behaving unfairly to someone, they will not help that person in return. So my point is,

51:04.400 --> 51:14.560
 yeah, we are selfish creatures at times, but we are also simultaneously ubersocial creatures

51:14.560 --> 51:21.840
 who are eager to reciprocate, and in fact, we're congenitally prepared to be reciprocators to the

51:21.840 --> 51:28.960
 point where we will reciprocate on the basis of intentions above and beyond what actually happens.

51:28.960 --> 51:37.680
 How close, so, I mean, your work is on the fundamental role of the fear of mortality in

51:37.680 --> 51:44.400
 ourselves. How fundamental is this reciprocation, this human connection to other humans?

51:44.400 --> 51:50.800
 Oh, I think it's really innate. Yeah, I think it's because, yeah, bats reciprocate, not by intention,

51:50.800 --> 51:58.560
 but, you know, this, I'm going here from Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, you know, to, I love

51:58.560 --> 52:02.880
 the early Dawkins, I'm less enamored. I like the early Beatles.

52:02.880 --> 52:13.520
 Yeah, no, no, no. And again, I say this with great respect, but, you know, Dawkins just points out

52:13.520 --> 52:22.880
 that, you know, reciprocation is just fundamental, cooperation is fundamental. You know, it's a

52:22.880 --> 52:30.560
 one sided view of evolutionary takes on things when we see it solely in terms of individual

52:30.560 --> 52:36.560
 competition. It's almost, from a game theoretic perspective too, it's just easier to see the world

52:36.560 --> 52:43.600
 that way. It's easier to, I don't know, I mean, you see this in physics, there's a whole field of

52:43.600 --> 52:50.320
 folks, like complexity, that kind of embrace the fact that it's all an intricately connected mess,

52:50.320 --> 52:56.000
 and it's just very difficult to do anything with that kind of science. But it seems to be much

52:56.000 --> 52:58.800
 closer to actually representing what the world is like.

52:58.800 --> 53:02.480
 So like you put it earlier, Lex, it's messy.

53:02.480 --> 53:07.120
 So left and right, you mentioned, you're thinking of maybe actually putting it down on paper

53:07.120 --> 53:07.440
 or something?

53:07.440 --> 53:14.320
 Yeah, I would like to, because what I would like to point out, again, in admiration of all the

53:14.320 --> 53:19.680
 people that I will then try and have the gall to criticize is, look, these are all geniuses.

53:19.680 --> 53:28.800
 Locke, genius. Adam Smith, genius, when he uses the notion that we're bartering creatures. So he uses

53:28.800 --> 53:33.760
 that reciprocation idea as the basis of his way of thinking about things.

53:33.760 --> 53:37.200
 But that's not at the core. The bartering is not at the core of human nature.

53:37.200 --> 53:42.240
 It's not at, well, he says it is. He says we're fundamentally bartering creatures.

53:42.240 --> 53:48.320
 Well, that doesn't even make sense then, because then how can we then be autonomous individuals

53:48.320 --> 53:50.080
 autonomous individuals?

53:50.080 --> 53:52.320
 Well, because we're going to barter with an eye on

53:53.440 --> 53:55.600
 for ourselves, self interest.

53:55.600 --> 54:00.480
 Yeah. But all right. So, but back to Adam Smith for a second, Lex. He's like,

54:00.480 --> 54:05.360
 Adam Smith, here's, he's got the invisible hand and my conservative friends. I'm like,

54:05.360 --> 54:15.360
 you need to read his books because he is a big fan of the free market. And this is my other gripe

54:15.360 --> 54:23.600
 with folks who support just unbridled markets. Adam Smith understood that there was a role

54:23.600 --> 54:30.400
 for government for two reasons. One is, is that just like Locke, people are not going to behave

54:30.400 --> 54:38.320
 with integrity. And he understood that one role of government is to maintain a proverbial,

54:38.320 --> 54:44.960
 you know, even playing field. And then the other thing Smith said was that there's some things that

54:44.960 --> 54:51.600
 can't be done well for a profit. And I believe he talked about education and public health and

54:51.600 --> 55:01.520
 infrastructure as things that are best done by governments because you can't, you can make a

55:01.520 --> 55:06.720
 profit, but that doesn't mean that the institutions themselves will be maximally beneficial.

55:06.720 --> 55:16.800
 Yeah. So I would, I'm just eager to engage people by saying, let's start with our most

55:16.800 --> 55:27.200
 contemporary understanding of human nature, which is that we are both selfish and tend

55:27.200 --> 55:42.400
 to cooperate. And we also can be heroically helpful to folks in our own tribe. And of course,

55:42.400 --> 55:49.520
 how you define one's tribe becomes critically important. But what some people say is, look,

55:49.520 --> 55:58.080
 look, what would then be, what kind of political institutions and what kind of economic organization

55:59.600 --> 56:06.160
 can we think about to kind of hit that sweet spot? And that would be, in my opinion,

56:07.200 --> 56:16.640
 how do we maximize individual autonomy in a way that fosters creativity and innovation and the

56:16.640 --> 56:26.480
 self regard that comes from creative expression while engaging our more cooperative and reciprocal

56:27.120 --> 56:35.280
 tendencies in order to come up with a system that is potentially stable over time? Because

56:35.280 --> 56:41.280
 the other thing about all capital based systems is the stability. It's fundamentally unstable.

56:41.280 --> 56:47.200
 Yeah, because it's based on infinite growth. And it's a positive feedback loop. To be silly,

56:47.200 --> 56:53.040
 infinite growth is only good for malignant cancer cells and compound interest. But otherwise,

56:54.640 --> 57:03.040
 we want to seek a steady state. So when Steven Pinker writes, for example, again,

57:03.040 --> 57:08.800
 great scholar, but I'm going to disagree when he says the world has never been better,

57:08.800 --> 57:14.000
 and all we need to do is keep making stuff and buying stuff.

57:14.000 --> 57:21.280
 So your sense is the world sort of in disagreement with Steven Pinker, that the world is

57:23.120 --> 57:27.760
 like facing a potential catastrophic collapse in multiple directions.

57:27.760 --> 57:28.400
 Yes.

57:28.400 --> 57:33.760
 And the fact that there are certain like the rate of violence and aggregate is decreasing,

57:33.760 --> 57:40.240
 the death, you know, the quality of life, all those kinds of measures that you can plot across

57:40.240 --> 57:44.960
 centuries that it's improving. That doesn't capture the fact that our world might be this,

57:44.960 --> 57:51.200
 we might destroy ourselves in very painful ways in the in the in the next century.

57:51.200 --> 57:56.560
 So I'm with Jared Diamond, you know, in the book Collapse, where he points out studying

57:56.560 --> 58:03.440
 the collapse of major civilizations, that it often happens right after things appear to never

58:03.440 --> 58:11.440
 have been better. And in that regard, I mean, there are more known voices that have taken issue

58:12.640 --> 58:21.280
 with Dr. Pinker. I'm thinking of John Gray, who's a British philosopher and here in the States. I

58:21.280 --> 58:26.560
 don't know where he is these days, but Robert J. Lifton, the psycho historian. Yeah, they're both

58:26.560 --> 58:31.360
 of my view and which I hope is, by the way, wrong.

58:31.360 --> 58:32.880
 Me too.

58:32.880 --> 58:42.960
 Yeah, no, but you know, between, you know, ongoing ethnic tensions, environmental degradation,

58:42.960 --> 58:49.120
 economic instability, and the fact that, you know, the world has become a Petri dish of

58:49.120 --> 58:56.160
 psychopathology. Like what really worries me is the the quiet economic pain that people are going

58:56.160 --> 59:01.280
 through, the businesses that are closed, dreams that are broken, because you can no longer do the

59:01.280 --> 59:08.480
 thing that you've wanted to do and how I mentioned to you off camera that I've been reading The Rise

59:08.480 --> 59:21.120
 and Fall of the Third Reich. And I mean, the amount of anger and hatred and on the flip side of that,

59:21.120 --> 59:27.520
 sort of a nationalist pride that can arise from deep economic pain. Like what happens with that

59:27.520 --> 59:34.320
 economic pain is you become bitter. You start to find the other, whether it's other European

59:34.320 --> 59:39.200
 nations that mistreated you, whether it's other groups that mistreated you, it always ends up

59:39.200 --> 59:51.760
 being the Jews somehow or fault here. That's what worries me is where this quiet anger and pain goes

59:51.760 --> 59:59.920
 in 2021, 2022, 2030. If you look, sorry to see the parallels. No, no, no. Rise and fall of the

59:59.920 --> 1:00:05.760
 Third Reich, but you know what happens 10, 15 years from now from what's because of the COVID

1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:12.400
 pandemic that's happening now. And Lex, you make a, I think a really profoundly important point,

1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:18.480
 you know, back to our work for a bit or Ernest Becker rather, you know, his point is, is that

1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:25.680
 the way that we manage existential terror is to embrace culturally constructed belief systems

1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:33.920
 that give us a sense that life has meaning and we have value. And in the form of self esteem,

1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:40.800
 which we get from perceiving that we meet or exceed the expectations associated with the role

1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:47.600
 that we play in society. Well, here we are right now in a world where first of all, if you have

1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:53.440
 nothing, you are nothing. And secondly, as you were saying before we got started today,

1:00:53.440 --> 1:01:00.560
 a lot of jobs are gone and they're not coming back. And that's the, where the self esteem,

1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:04.800
 that's where the self esteem and identity come in with people. It's not only that you don't have

1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:11.440
 anything to eat. You don't even have a self anymore to speak of because the, we typically

1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:20.160
 define ourselves, you know, as Marx put it, you are what you do. And now who are you when your way

1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:24.720
 of life, as well as your way of earning a living is no longer available?

1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:29.520
 Yeah. And it feels like that yearning for self esteem that we could talk a little bit more,

1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:36.800
 because you about defining self esteem is quite interesting. The more I've read Warm at the Core

1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:43.360
 and just in general, your thinking, it made me realize I haven't thought enough about the idea

1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:49.200
 of self esteem. But the thing I want to say is, it feels like when you lose your self esteem,

1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:58.320
 it feels like when you lose your job, then it's easy to find, it's tempting to find that self

1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:07.600
 esteem in a tribe that's not somehow often positive. It's like a tribe that defines itself

1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:09.360
 on the hatred of somebody else.

1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:15.680
 So that's brilliant. And this is what John Gray, the philosopher in the 1990s,

1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:22.800
 predicted what's happening today. He wrote a book about globalism. And actually Hannah Arendt in

1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:31.040
 the 1950s said the same thing in her book about totalitarianism. When she said that, you know,

1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:39.040
 that economics has reached the point where most money is made, not by actually making stuff,

1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:48.640
 you know, you use money to make money. And therefore, what happens is money chases money

1:02:48.640 --> 1:02:57.680
 across national boundaries. Ultimately, governments become subordinate to the corporate

1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:06.080
 entities whose sole function is to generate money. And what John Gray said is that that will

1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:17.360
 inevitably produce economic upheaval in local areas, which will not be attributed to the

1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:26.320
 economic order. It will be misattributed to whoever the scapegoat du jour is, and the anger

1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:37.840
 and the distress associated with that uncertainty will be picked up on by ideological demagogues

1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:46.240
 who will transform that into rage. So both Hannah Arendt as well as John Gray, they just said,

1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:57.040
 watch out, we're gonna have right wingish populist movements where demagogues who are the alchemists

1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:06.480
 of hate, what makes them brilliant is they don't, the hate's already there, but they take the fears

1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:15.520
 and they expertly redirect them to who it is that I need to hate and kill in order to feel

1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:22.640
 good about myself. So back to your point, Lex, that's right. So the self regard that used to come

1:04:23.520 --> 1:04:30.720
 from having a job and doing it well, and as a result of that, having adequate resources to

1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:39.200
 provide a decent life for your family, well, those opportunities are gone. And yeah, what's left?

1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:47.200
 So Max Weber, German sociologist at the beginning of the 20th century, he said in times of historical

1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:54.320
 upheaval, we are apt to embrace, he was the one who coined the term charismatic leader, seemingly

1:04:54.320 --> 1:05:02.720
 larger than life individuals who often believe or their followers believe are divinely ordained to

1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:11.680
 rid the world of evil. All right, now, Ernest Becker, he used Weber's ideas in order to account

1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:19.600
 for the rise of Hitler. Hitler was elected, and he was elected when Germans were in an extraordinary

1:05:19.600 --> 1:05:28.000
 state of existential distress, and he said, I'm gonna make Germany great again. All right, now,

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:37.520
 what Becker adds to the equation is his claim that what underlies our affection for charismatic

1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:45.520
 populist leaders, good and bad, is death anxiety. All right, now, here's where we come in,

1:05:45.520 --> 1:05:52.480
 we're egghead experimental researchers. Becker wrote this book, The Denial of Death, and he

1:05:52.480 --> 1:06:00.000
 couldn't get a job. People just dismiss these ideas as fanciful speculation for which there's

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:07.440
 no evidence. And you've done some good experiments. Yeah, here's where I can be more cavalier,

1:06:07.440 --> 1:06:15.040
 and where what I would urge people, like what you said, Lex, is ignore my histrionic and polemic

1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:23.360
 language, if possible, and step back, if you can, myself included, and let's just consider

1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:34.000
 the research findings. Because in September 11, 2001, people that are old enough to remember that

1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:42.800
 horrible day, two days before, George W. Bush had the lowest approval rating in the history of

1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:48.560
 presidential polling. All right, three weeks later, after he said, we will rid the world of the

1:06:48.560 --> 1:06:55.440
 evildoers, and then a week or two after that, he said in a cover story on Time magazine that he

1:06:55.440 --> 1:07:01.200
 believed that God had chosen him to lead the world during this, to lead the country, rather, during

1:07:01.200 --> 1:07:07.600
 this perilous time, he had the highest approval rating. And so we're like, well, what happened?

1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:16.400
 You know, what happened to Americans that their approval of President Bush got so high so fast?

1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:25.440
 Well, our view, following Becker, is that 2001 was like a giant death reminder. The people dying,

1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:33.120
 plus the symbols of American greatness, World Trade Center and the Pentagon. So we did a bunch

1:07:33.120 --> 1:07:37.440
 of experiments, and most of our experiments are disarmingly simple. We have one group of

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:42.800
 people, and we just remind them that they're going to die. We say, hey, write your thoughts

1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:48.320
 and feelings about dying. Or in other cases, we stop them outside, either in front of a funeral

1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:55.120
 home or 100 meters to either side. Our thought being that if we stop you in front of a funeral

1:07:55.120 --> 1:07:59.760
 home, then death is on your mind, even if you don't know it. And then there's other studies,

1:07:59.760 --> 1:08:05.920
 they're even more subtle, where we bring people into the lab, and they read stuff on a computer,

1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:11.920
 and while they're doing that, we flash the word death for 28 milliseconds. It's so fast,

1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:19.760
 you don't see anything. And then we just measure people's reactions or behavior thereafter. So what

1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:29.280
 we found in 2003, leading up to the election of 2004, was that Americans did not care for President

1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:37.440
 Bush or his policies in Iraq in controlled conditions. But if we reminded them of their

1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:45.120
 mortality first, they liked Bush a lot more. So in every study that we did, Americans liked John

1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:49.760
 Kerry, who was running against Bush, they liked Kerry more than Bush.

1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:52.240
 Policy wise, in a controlled...

1:08:52.240 --> 1:09:00.880
 In a controlled condition. But if they were reminded of death first, then they liked Bush

1:09:00.880 --> 1:09:01.760
 a lot more.

1:09:01.760 --> 1:09:06.080
 So by the way, just a small pause, you said they're discerningly simple experiments.

1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:11.040
 I think that's, and people should read Warm at the Core for some other description,

1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:16.320
 you have a lot of different experiments of this nature. I think it's a brilliant experiment

1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:22.640
 connected to the Stoics, perhaps, of how your worldview on anything and how delicious that

1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:28.560
 water tastes after you're reminded of your own mortality. It's such a fascinating experiment

1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:36.720
 that you could probably keep doing like millions of them to draw insight about the way we see the

1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:37.040
 world.

1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:42.320
 No, that's right, Lex. And I appreciate the compliment, not because we did anything,

1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:49.600
 but because what these studies, many of which are now done by other people around the world

1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:54.000
 in labs that we're not connected with, what I'm most proud about our work. I am proud

1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:59.680
 of the experiments that we've done. But it's not science until somebody else can replicate

1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:05.280
 your findings and independent researchers are interested in pursuing them.

1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:08.880
 It's such a fascinating idea. I don't... I have to think about

1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:14.160
 a lot about the experiments you've done and that you've inspired, about the fact that death

1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:20.880
 changes the way you see a bunch of different things. I think the Stoics talked about the,

1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:28.400
 I mean, in general, just memento mori, like just thinking about death and meditating on death is a

1:10:28.400 --> 1:10:37.040
 really positive, not a positive, it's an enlightening way to live life. So what do you

1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:45.040
 think about that at the individual level? Like, what is the role about being, bringing that terror

1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:48.960
 of death, fear of death to the surface and being cognizant of it?

1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:56.960
 For us, that's the ball game. So what I'm trying to say is that

1:10:56.960 --> 1:11:06.480
 so what we write in our book and here we're just paying homage to the philosophers and

1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:17.520
 theologians that come before us is to point out that literally since antiquity, there has been

1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:28.320
 a consensus that to lead a full life requires, Albert Camus said, come to terms with death,

1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:37.920
 thereafter anything is possible. And so you've got the Stoics and you've got the Epicureans and

1:11:37.920 --> 1:11:43.760
 then you've got the Tibetan Book of the Dead and then you've got like the medieval monks that,

1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:52.720
 you know, worked with like a skull on their desk. And the whole idea, I should back up a bit because

1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:58.720
 and just remind folks that our studies, you know, when we remind people that they're going to die

1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:08.720
 and we find that, yeah, they drink more water if a famous person is, you know, advertising it,

1:12:08.720 --> 1:12:16.720
 but they eat more cookies. They want more fancy clothes. They sit closer to people that look like

1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:23.120
 them. It changes who they vote for. But all of those things, those are very subtle death reminders.

1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:29.520
 You don't even know that death is on your mind. And so our point is that, and this is kind of

1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:38.480
 counterintuitive, and that is that the most problematic and unsavory human reactions to death

1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:45.760
 anxiety are malignant manifestations of repressed death anxiety. You know, we try and bury it under

1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:52.560
 the psychological bushes and then it comes back to bear bitter fruit. But what the theologians and

1:12:52.560 --> 1:13:02.480
 the philosophers of the world are saying is it behooves each of us to spend considerable time.

1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:11.600
 You don't have to be a goth death rocker, you know, wallowing in death imagery to spend enough

1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:18.720
 time entertaining the reality of the human condition, which is that you too will pass

1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:30.400
 to get to the point where there is, to lapse into a cliche, the capacity for personal transformation

1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:41.280
 and growth. Let's go personal for a second. Are you yourself afraid of death? Yeah.

1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:49.200
 And how much do you meditate on that thought? Like, maybe your own study of it is a kind of

1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:55.520
 escape from your own mortality. Absolutely. So you got it. And like, if you figure out death,

1:13:55.520 --> 1:14:01.120
 somehow you won't die. So no, no. So my my colleagues and good friends, Jeff Greenberg

1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:06.480
 and Tom Posinski, you know, we met in graduate school in the 1970s. We've been doing this work

1:14:06.480 --> 1:14:15.280
 for 40 years. And we cheerfully admit, even though it doesn't reflect well on us as humans,

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:23.360
 that I should just speak for myself. But I feel like there's a real sense in which doing these

1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:34.000
 studies and writing books and lecturing has been my way of avoiding directly confronting my anxiety.

1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:43.280
 Directly confronting my anxieties by turning it into an intellectual exercise. And every once

1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:48.880
 in a while, therefore, when I think that I'm making some progress as a human, I have to remind

1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:59.680
 myself that that is probably not the case. And I have at times, like all humans, been more

1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:05.600
 preoccupied with the implications of these ideas for my self esteem as like, oh, we're going to

1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:15.200
 write a book and maybe we'll get to go on TV or something. Well, no, that's not the same as to

1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:23.120
 actually think about it in a way that you feel it rather than just think it.

1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:29.680
 Yeah, like you did when you were eight. Exactly right. So when I first read The Denial of Death,

1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:36.800
 I was so literally flabbergasted by it that I took a leave of absence for a year

1:15:37.520 --> 1:15:43.920
 and just like did what would be considered menial jobs. I did construction work. I worked in a

1:15:43.920 --> 1:15:53.760
 restaurant. And I was just like, well, wait a minute. If I understand what this guy is saying,

1:15:54.720 --> 1:16:03.200
 then I'm just a culturally constructed meat puppet doing things for reasons that I know not

1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:10.560
 in order to assuage death anxiety. And I was like, that's not acceptable.

1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:15.440
 Maybe another interesting person to talk about is Ernest Becker himself.

1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:24.960
 So how did he face his death? Is there something interesting, personal?

1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:35.200
 I think so. So interesting to me is Becker also from a Jewish family, claimed to be

1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:47.040
 the atheistic, did not identify ultimately as Jewish. I believe he converted to Christianity,

1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:55.760
 but was himself a religious person. And he said he became religious when his first child was born.

1:16:55.760 --> 1:17:03.360
 Now religious, what does that mean? Does he have a faith? Well, let's talk more. Most importantly,

1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:10.160
 is the afterlife. What's his view on the afterlife? He was agnostic on that, but he did.

1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:21.840
 Now the denial of death is, there's a chapter devoted to Kierkegaard. And he talks about

1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:30.080
 for Kierkegaard, if you want to become a mature individual, if you want to learn something,

1:17:30.080 --> 1:17:36.560
 you go to the university. If you want to become a more mature individual, according to Kierkegaard,

1:17:36.560 --> 1:17:44.560
 you got to go to the school of anxiety. And what Kierkegaard said is that we have to let this vague

1:17:45.120 --> 1:17:54.400
 dis ease, put a hyphen between dis and ease about death. Kierkegaard's point is you have to really

1:17:54.400 --> 1:18:02.480
 think about that. You have to think about it and feel it. You got to let it seek in or seep into

1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:14.160
 your mind. At which point, according to Kierkegaard, basically you realize that your

1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:19.760
 present identity is fundamentally a cultural construction. You didn't choose the time and

1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:27.200
 place of your birth. You didn't choose your name. You didn't choose necessarily even the social

1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:32.800
 role that you occupy. You might've chosen from what's available in your culture, but not from

1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:40.240
 the full palette of human opportunities. And so what Kierkegaard said is that we need to realize

1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:51.040
 that we've been living a lie of sorts. Becker calls it a necessary lie. And we have to momentarily

1:18:51.920 --> 1:19:00.640
 dispose of that. And so now Kierkegaard says, well, here I am. I have shrugged off all of the

1:19:00.640 --> 1:19:11.120
 all of the cultural accoutrements that I have used to define myself. And now what am I or who am I?

1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:19.840
 This is like the ancient Greek tragedy where the worst thing was to be no one or no thing. At this

1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:26.880
 point, Kierkegaard said, you're really dangling on the precipice of oblivion. And some people

1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:34.240
 tumble into that abyss and never come out. On the other hand, Kierkegaard said that

1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:40.640
 what you can now do metaphorically and literally is to rebuild yourself from the ground up. And

1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:46.160
 there's a, in the new Testament, there's something you have to die in order to be reborn. And

1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:51.920
 Kierkegaard's view though, is that there's only one way to do that. This is his proverbial leap

1:19:51.920 --> 1:20:01.600
 into faith. And in Kierkegaard's case, it was faith in Christianity, that you can't have unbridled

1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:09.680
 faith in cultural constructions. The only thing that you can have unequivocal faith in is some

1:20:09.680 --> 1:20:17.600
 kind of transcendent power. All right. But of course, this raises the question of, well, is that

1:20:17.600 --> 1:20:25.600
 just another death denying belief system? And at the end of the denial of death, Becker admits

1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:35.840
 that there's no way to tell while still advocating for what is ultimately a religious stance. Now,

1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:41.760
 one of the things that I don't understand, and Becker has been the most singularly potent

1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:50.560
 influence in my academic and personal life, but a year or two ago, I started reading Martin

1:20:50.560 --> 1:21:02.560
 Heidegger. I'm reading Being and Time. And what I now wonder is why Becker, who refers to Heidegger

1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:08.000
 from time to time in his work, why he didn't take Heidegger more seriously. Because Heidegger

1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:16.800
 is like a secular Kierkegaard. He has the same thing, which is death anxiety. Oh, and I should

1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:22.800
 have pointed out that what Kierkegaard says is that death anxiety, most people don't go to the

1:21:22.800 --> 1:21:32.800
 school of anxiety. They flee from death anxiety by embracing their cultural beliefs. Kierkegaard

1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:39.360
 says they then tranquilize themselves with the trivial. And I love that phrase. It's a beautiful

1:21:39.360 --> 1:21:44.160
 phrase because at the end of the denial of death, Becker's like, look, the average American is

1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:50.400
 either drinking or shopping or watching television, and they're all the same thing, right? Heidegger

1:21:50.400 --> 1:21:56.480
 says the same thing. He says, look, and he acknowledges Kierkegaard. He says, what makes us

1:21:56.480 --> 1:22:06.080
 feel unsettled? And evidently, that's an English translation of angst, that we don't feel at home

1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:14.240
 in the world. Heidegger says that's death anxiety. And one direction is the Kierkegaard one.

1:22:14.880 --> 1:22:21.520
 Heidegger calls it a flight from death. You just unself reflexively cling to your cultural

1:22:21.520 --> 1:22:30.720
 constructions. And Heidegger borrows the term tranquilized, but he points out that he doesn't

1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:38.000
 care for that term because tranquilized sounds like you're subdued. When in fact, what most

1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:44.240
 culturally constructed meat puppets do is to be frenetically engaged with their surroundings to

1:22:44.240 --> 1:22:49.840
 ensure that they never sit still long enough to actually think about anything consequential.

1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:57.360
 Heidegger says there's another way, though. He's like, yo, what you can do is to come to terms with

1:22:57.360 --> 1:23:06.400
 that death anxiety in the following way. Thing number one is to realize that not only are you

1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:15.840
 going to die, but your death can happen at any given moment. So for Heidegger, if you say, I know

1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:22.320
 I'm going to die in some vaguely unspecified future moment, that's still death denial because you're

1:23:22.320 --> 1:23:31.600
 saying, yeah, not me, not now. Heidegger's point is you need to get to the point where you need to

1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:41.760
 realize that I need to realize that I can walk outside and get smote by a comet, or I can stop

1:23:41.760 --> 1:23:48.640
 for gas on the way home and catch the virus and be dead in two days, or any number of potentially

1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:51.840
 unanticipated and uncontrollable fatal outcomes.

1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:57.440
 That's brilliant, by the way. Sorry. To bring it to the now.

1:23:57.440 --> 1:24:03.040
 Yeah, it is brilliant. I agree, Lex, and that's just why I'm wondering why didn't Becker notice

1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:09.600
 this? Because that's the being and time thing, is it's got to be now. And then he says, so okay,

1:24:09.600 --> 1:24:20.240
 so now I've dealt somewhat with the death part. And now he says, now you've got to deal with what he

1:24:20.240 --> 1:24:30.720
 calls existential guilt. And he says, well, all right, you have to realize that like it or not,

1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:37.840
 you have to make choices. This is Jean Paul Sartre, we are condemned by virtue of consciousness to

1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:45.520
 choosing. But Heidegger is a little bit more precise. He's like, look, as I was saying earlier,

1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:55.120
 you're in reality, you're an insignificant speck of respiring carbon based dust born into a time

1:24:55.120 --> 1:25:02.240
 and place not of your choosing when you're here for a microscopic amount of time after which you

1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:13.920
 are not. And for Heidegger, you have to realize that, like I said, I didn't choose to be born a

1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:24.480
 male or Jewish or in America, the offspring of working class people. And Heidegger, what he says

1:25:24.480 --> 1:25:33.120
 is, yeah, but you still have to make choices and accept responsibility for those choices,

1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:39.280
 even though you didn't choose any of the parameters that ultimately limit what's available

1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:51.520
 to you. And moreover, you're going to not always make good choices. So now you're guilty for your

1:25:51.520 --> 1:26:03.680
 choices. And then he uses the poet Rilke, he has a phrase, Becker uses it in The Denial of Death,

1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:14.400
 the guilt of unlived life. I just love that. You have to accept that you have already diminished

1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:23.120
 and in many ways amputated your own possibilities by virtue of choices that you've made or just as

1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:33.920
 often have declined to make because you are reluctant to accept responsibility for the

1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:42.960
 opportunities that you are now able to create by virtue of seeing the possibilities that lay before

1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:51.600
 you. So anyway, Heidegger then says, look, OK, so, you know, I'm a professor and I live in America

1:26:52.320 --> 1:27:00.640
 in the 21st century. Well, if I was in the third century living in a year in Mongolia, I'm not

1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:10.160
 going to have an opportunity to be a professor. But what he submits is that there is some aspects

1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:19.120
 of whatever I am that are independent of my cultural and historical circumstances. In other

1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:23.760
 words, there is a me of sorts. Heidegger would take vigorous issue and so would Heidegger's

1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:28.640
 scholars because I'm not claiming to understand him. This is my classic comic book rendering.

1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:34.560
 But Heidegger's point is that you get to the point where you're able to say, OK,

1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:44.480
 I am a contingent historical and cultural artifact. But so what? You know, if I was,

1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:52.160
 you know, if I was transported a thousand years in the past in Asia, I'd be in the same situation.

1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:58.640
 I would still be conditioned by time and place. I would still have choices that I could make

1:27:58.640 --> 1:28:06.160
 within the confines of what opportunities are afforded to me. And then Heidegger says,

1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:14.640
 if I can get that far in this is his language. He says that there is a transformation and he

1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:22.000
 literally he calls it a turning. You're turning away from a flight from death and you are allowed

1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:33.040
 you therefore you see a horizon is his word of opportunity that makes you in a state of

1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:44.000
 anticipatory resoluteness with solicitous regard for others that makes your life seem like an

1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:54.240
 adventure perfused with unshakable joy. Let me unpack those things. It is beautiful. It is. I

1:28:54.240 --> 1:28:59.440
 love, Lex, that you're resonating to the time thing. So he's like, OK, we already talked about

1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:09.360
 now. Anticipatory is is already hopeful because it's looking forward to be resolute. It means to

1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:19.680
 trust and to just have confidence in what you're doing moving forward. All right. Solicitous. I

1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:25.840
 had to look up all these words, by the way. It just means that you are concerned about your

1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:34.720
 fellow human beings. And but I love the idea, even if it seems allegorical, I don't mind that

1:29:34.720 --> 1:29:41.520
 at all. This idea you said love earlier. And I think that when Heidegger is talking about being

1:29:41.520 --> 1:29:49.920
 solicitous, that's as close as he can get. There's an Italian. Yes. So what was that line again with

1:29:49.920 --> 1:29:56.000
 the solicitous of the whole thing of turning away from death? And all the words you said are just

1:29:56.000 --> 1:30:02.880
 beautiful. I love those words. Yeah. Anticipatory resoluteness that is accompanied with solicitous

1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:12.560
 regard to our fellow humans, which makes life appear to us to be an ongoing adventure that is

1:30:12.560 --> 1:30:20.640
 permeated by unshakable joy. Now, again, Heidegger is not Mary Poppins. This I just got a tattoo.

1:30:20.640 --> 1:30:28.080
 I know. This is great. I just love that exact quote. No, I'm piecing together. These are his

1:30:28.080 --> 1:30:35.200
 exact words that and I spent the last two years reading almost everything that I can find because

1:30:35.200 --> 1:30:42.240
 I want to. I'm sick of death. You said it. So I want to second what you say, Lex. So it's not

1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:49.920
 about death. It's the Sherwood Anderson guy. He's a novelist that I like about. He wrote a book

1:30:49.920 --> 1:30:57.920
 in Lyonsburg, Ohio. And now I'm going to forget what he said on his tombstone. But, you know, it

1:30:57.920 --> 1:31:05.360
 was something to the effect. Oh, he said life, not death is the great adventure. The point being is

1:31:05.360 --> 1:31:15.200
 that, you know, to consider that we must die and the existential implications of that, really,

1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:25.440
 the goal, the way I see it is getting from hate to love. And I feel like Heidegger has

1:31:26.720 --> 1:31:33.840
 a way of thinking about things that moves us more in that direction. And so that's kind of my

1:31:34.480 --> 1:31:44.560
 current preoccupation is to take what I just said to you and to talk about it with my colleagues

1:31:44.560 --> 1:31:49.760
 and other academic psychologists, because the way we started with Ernest Becker,

1:31:50.400 --> 1:31:55.440
 remember I said earlier, I wasn't trained in any of these things. I'm an egghead

1:31:56.160 --> 1:32:02.880
 researcher that was doing experiments about biofeedback. And, you know, then we read these

1:32:02.880 --> 1:32:08.480
 Becker books, and I thought they were so interesting that for the first few years,

1:32:08.480 --> 1:32:13.600
 we didn't have any studies. I just would travel around and I'd be like, here's what this Becker

1:32:13.600 --> 1:32:20.480
 guy says. I think this is cool. Well, my present view is I'm like, here's what this Heidegger guy

1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:30.240
 says. I think these ideas are consistent with what Becker is saying because they are anchored in

1:32:30.240 --> 1:32:41.600
 death anxiety. But I like that direction as an alternative to the Kierkegaardian insistence that

1:32:41.600 --> 1:32:51.600
 the only psychologically tenable way to extricate ourselves from maladaptive reactions to death

1:32:51.600 --> 1:33:00.640
 anxiety is through faith in the traditional sense. Yeah, I always kind of saw Kierkegaard unfairly,

1:33:00.640 --> 1:33:06.560
 like you said, in a comic book sense of the word faith as a non traditional sense. I kind of like

1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:11.600
 the idea of leap of faith. Oh, I love that idea. And so what I've been babbling about with, you

1:33:11.600 --> 1:33:21.280
 know, Heidegger, I'm like, yeah, Kierkegaard is a leap of faith in God. Heidegger is a leap of faith

1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:29.600
 in life. And I just like it. I found the leap of faith really interesting in the technological

1:33:29.600 --> 1:33:37.280
 space. So I've talked to on this thing with Elon Musk, but I think he's also just in general for

1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:43.040
 our culture, a really important figure. Oh, absolutely. That takes, I mean, sometimes a

1:33:43.040 --> 1:33:49.760
 little bit insane on social media and just in life. When I met him, it was kind of interesting

1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:56.720
 that, of course, there's, I mean, he's a legit engineer, so he's fun to talk to about the

1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:05.200
 technical things, but he also just the way the humor and the way he sees life, it just like

1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:13.920
 refuses to be conventional. So it's a constant leap into the unknown. And one of the things

1:34:14.480 --> 1:34:20.800
 that he does, and this isn't even like fake. A lot of people say, cause he's a CEO,

1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:27.680
 there's a business owner. So he's trying to make money. No, I think I looked him in his eyes. I

1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:33.840
 mean, this is real, is a lot of the things he believes that are going to be accomplished that

1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:39.520
 a lot of others are saying are impossible, like autonomous vehicles. He truly believes it. To me,

1:34:39.520 --> 1:34:45.440
 that is the leap of faith of I'm almost going like, we're like the entirety of our experience

1:34:45.440 --> 1:34:50.240
 is shrouded in mystery. We don't know what the hell's going to happen. We don't know what we're

1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:56.160
 actually capable of as human beings. And he just takes the leap. He fully believes that we can,

1:34:56.160 --> 1:35:04.480
 you know, we can go to, we can colonize Mars. I mean, how, how crazy is it to just believe and

1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:10.720
 dream and actually be taking steps towards it to colonizing Mars when most people are like,

1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:16.000
 that's the stupidest idea ever. Yeah. Well, I'm, I'm in agreement with you on that. You know,

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:20.720
 two things, you know, one is it reminds me of Ben Franklin who in his autobiography,

1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:31.120
 you know, has a similarly childish in the best sense of the word, unbridled imagination for what

1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:37.760
 might become, you know, Ben Franklin's like, yeah, I got electricity. That's cool, but we'll be

1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:45.200
 levitating soon. And I, we can't even begin to imagine what we are capable of. And of course,

1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:53.120
 people are like, dude, that's crazy. And there's a guy with it's FCS Schiller, some humanistic guy

1:35:53.120 --> 1:36:04.640
 at the beginning of the 20th century. He's like, you know, lots of things that people think about

1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:13.280
 may appear to be absurd to the point of obscene. But the reality is historically

1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:21.600
 every fantastic innovation has generally been initiated by someone who was condemned

1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:31.360
 for being a lunatic. And it's not that anything is possible, but surely things that we don't try

1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:38.800
 will never manifest as possibilities. Yeah. And that's, that's that there's something beautiful

1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:46.160
 to that. That's the embracing the abyss. And again, it's like the, it's the embracing the

1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:53.360
 fear of death, the reality of death and then turning and to look at all the opportunities.

1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:59.680
 That's right. Let me ask you, whenever I bring up Ernest Becker's work, which I do and yours

1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:10.320
 is quite a bit, I find it surprising how that it's not a lot more popular in a sense that,

1:37:11.680 --> 1:37:16.560
 no, we're not, I don't mean just your book. That's well written. People should read it,

1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:23.360
 should buy it, whatever. I think it has the same kind of qualities that are useful to think about

1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:32.400
 as like Jordan Peterson's work and stuff like that. But I just mean like why people are not,

1:37:32.400 --> 1:37:41.200
 don't think of that as a compelling description of the core of the human condition. Like,

1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:46.320
 I think what you mentioned about Heidegger is quite, connects with me quite well. So I ask

1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:52.720
 on this podcast, I often ask people if they're afraid of death. That's like almost every single

1:37:52.720 --> 1:38:00.080
 part. I almost always get criticized for asking world class people, scientists and technologists

1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:07.280
 about fear of death and the meaning of life. And on the fear of death, they often

1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:16.480
 like don't say anything interesting. What I mean by that is they haven't thought deeply about it.

1:38:16.480 --> 1:38:22.240
 Like you kind of brought this up a few times of really letting it sink in. They kind of say this

1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:29.120
 thing about what exactly you said, which is like, it's something that happens not today. Like I'm

1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:34.160
 aware that it's something that happens. And I'm not, the thing they usually say is I'm not afraid

1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:42.320
 of death. I just want to live a good life kind of thing. And what I'm trying to express is like when

1:38:42.320 --> 1:38:47.360
 I look in their eyes and the kind of the core of the conversation, it looks like they haven't

1:38:47.360 --> 1:38:54.800
 really become, like they haven't really meditated on death. I guess the question is, what do I say

1:38:54.800 --> 1:39:04.160
 to people that there's something to really think about here? Like there's some demons, some realities

1:39:04.160 --> 1:39:10.400
 that need to be faced by more people. Well, that's a tough one. You know, I could tell you what not to

1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:19.840
 do. So when we are young and annoying, a lot of famous people, mostly psychologists because that's

1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:29.440
 who we intersected with, we would lay out these ideas and they would be, well, I don't think

1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:37.840
 about death like that. So these ideas must be wrong. And we would say, well, you don't think

1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:44.080
 about death because you're lucky enough to be comfortably ensconced in a cultural worldview

1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:50.880
 from which you derive self esteem. And that has spared you the existential excruciations that

1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:57.680
 would otherwise arise. But that's like Freud. You know, you're repressing, so you either agree with

1:39:57.680 --> 1:40:04.480
 me in which case I'm right, or you disagree with me in which case you're repressing and I'm right.

1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:11.840
 Well, so that's the Nietzsche thing. What I felt when I've, there've been moments in my life

1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:17.200
 when I really thought about death. I mean, there's not too many. Like really, really thought about it

1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:22.160
 and feel the thing when you felt that eight, maybe I'm traumatizing or romanticizing it. But

1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:31.360
 I feel like it's, the conservatives call it popularly like, or the movie Matrix call it the

1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:39.920
 red pill moment. I feel like it's a dangerous thought because I feel like I'm taking a step

1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:45.520
 out of a society. Like there's a nice narrative that we've all constructed and I'm taking a step

1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:55.040
 out. And it feels, there's this feeling like you're basically drowning. I mean, it's not a

1:40:55.040 --> 1:41:00.480
 good feeling. It is not. But this gets back to the Heidegger Kierkegaard school of anxiety. You are

1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:09.120
 stepping out and you are momentarily shrugging off, again, the culturally constructed psychological

1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:18.240
 accoutrements that allow you to stand up in the morning. And so, I mean, in that sense, it feels

1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:29.760
 like, I mean, how do you have that conversation? Because I guess I'm dancing around a set of

1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:37.680
 questions, which is like, I guess I'm disappointed that people don't, are not as willing to step

1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:46.160
 outside. Like even just, even any kind of thought experiment. Forget denial of death. Like

1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:53.680
 there's not a community of people. Let's take an easy one that I think is scientifically

1:41:53.680 --> 1:41:59.840
 ridiculous, which is, there's a community of people that believe that the earth is flat. Or

1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:09.760
 actually even better, the space is fake. Like what I find surprising is that a lot of people I talk

1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:18.640
 to are not willing to be like, imagine if it is, like imagine the earth is flat. Like think about

1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:25.520
 it. Like a lot of people are just like, no, the earth is round. They're like scientists too. They're

1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:31.760
 like, yeah, well actually, wait, have you actually like thought about it? Like imagine like a thought

1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:38.800
 experiment that like basically step outside the little narrative that we are comfortable with. Now

1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:48.240
 that one in particular is, has really strong evidence and scientific validation. So it's

1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:56.800
 pretty simple thing to show that it at least is not flat. But just the willingness to take a step

1:42:56.800 --> 1:43:03.440
 outside of the stories that bring us comfort, it's been disappointing that people are not willing to

1:43:03.440 --> 1:43:09.040
 do that. And I think the philosophy that you've constructed and that Ernest Becker is constructing,

1:43:09.040 --> 1:43:14.800
 you've tested, I think is really compelling. And the fact that people aren't often willing to take

1:43:14.800 --> 1:43:21.200
 that step. It's disappointing. Well, yes, but perhaps understandable. I mean, one of this is

1:43:21.200 --> 1:43:29.360
 an anecdote, of course, but when we were trying to get a publisher for our book, we had a meeting

1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:41.520
 with a publisher who published some Malcolm Gladwell books. And she said, I'm very interested

1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:47.840
 in your book, but can you write it without mentioning death? Because people don't like death.

1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:56.960
 And we're like, no, it's really kind of central. And I think that's part of it. I think, again,

1:43:56.960 --> 1:44:06.320
 if these ideas have merit, and I actually like the way that you put it, Lex, it's that to step away

1:44:06.320 --> 1:44:19.840
 is to momentarily expose yourself to all of the anxiety that our identity and our beliefs

1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:24.160
 typically enable us to manage. I think it's as simple as that.

1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:36.880
 Yeah, I had this experience in college with my best friend who got really high. And he forgot,

1:44:36.880 --> 1:44:41.440
 it was in the winter, it was really freezing. It was memorable to me. I think it's an analogy,

1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:53.200
 it's very useful. So he went to get some pizza. And he left me outside and said,

1:44:53.200 --> 1:44:59.280
 I'll be back in five minutes. And he forgot that he left me outside. And I remember it was,

1:44:59.280 --> 1:45:05.840
 I was in shorts, it was freezing winter. And I remember standing outside, it's a dorm,

1:45:05.840 --> 1:45:12.480
 and I'm looking from the outside in, it's a light and it's warm. And I'm just standing there frozen,

1:45:12.480 --> 1:45:19.600
 I think for an hour or more. And that's how I think about it. I don't give a damn about the

1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:28.880
 stupid winter. I'm drawn to be back to the warm. And that's how I feel about thinking about death.

1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:36.560
 At a certain point, it's too much. It's like that cold. I wanna be back into the warm.

1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:46.880
 Getting back to Heidegger for a moment. He uses a lot the idea of feeling at home,

1:45:46.880 --> 1:45:52.240
 not as like in your house, but just feeling like you're comfortably situated.

1:45:52.240 --> 1:45:56.560
 Maybe you could talk about, like I had a conversation about this with my dad a little bit.

1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:01.520
 How does religion relate to this?

1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:18.640
 I see it as the disease and the cure. In a sense, a few things. One is that I think a case could be

1:46:18.640 --> 1:46:26.720
 made that humans are innately religious. So now we're gonna get into territory where there's gonna

1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:33.120
 be a lot of disputes. And what do you mean by religious?

1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:36.560
 Religion is an evolutionary adaptation.

1:46:36.560 --> 1:46:42.080
 And religion is like a belief in something outside of yourself kind of thing?

1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:50.160
 Not necessarily. So here we gotta be a little bit more careful. And again, I'm not a scholar.

1:46:50.160 --> 1:46:59.520
 How about I'm a well intentioned dilettante in this regard? Because what I have read is that

1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:11.520
 religion evolved very early on, long before our ancestors were conscious and the issue of death

1:47:11.520 --> 1:47:22.880
 arose. And the word religion evidently is from a Latin word, regatear. We can look it up. And it

1:47:22.880 --> 1:47:31.200
 means to bind. And Emile Durkheim, the dead French sociologist, he said, you know, originally

1:47:31.200 --> 1:47:40.320
 religion is Darce Lassing, who's a dead novelist. She calls it the substance of we feeling that it's

1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:51.040
 literally that it arose because we're uber social creatures who from time to time took comfort in

1:47:51.040 --> 1:48:02.160
 just being in physical proximity with our fellow humans. And that there is this kind of sense of

1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:11.280
 transcendent exuberance, just back to the unshakable joy that Heidegger alludes to.

1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:21.760
 And that the original function of religion was to foster social cohesion and coordination. And that

1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:30.720
 it was only subsequently some claim that a burgeoning level of consciousness made it such that

1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:37.340
 religious belief systems that included the hope of some kind of

1:48:37.340 --> 1:48:44.760
 immortality were just naturally selected thereafter. So there are some people. So

1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:53.560
 it's David Sloan Wilson wrote a book called Darwin's Cathedral. And he said,

1:48:53.560 --> 1:49:00.200
 religion has nothing to do with death. It's evolved to make groups viable. He's actually

1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:07.480
 a group selection guy. What's group selection? The idea that it's the group that is selected

1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:12.360
 for rather than the individual. Yeah, so people have vigorous disagreements about that. But I

1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:21.640
 guess our point would be, we see religion as being inextricably connected, ultimately, to assuaging

1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:30.200
 concerns about death. Well, I guess another question to ask around this, like, what does

1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:41.000
 the world look like without religion? Will we, if it's inextricably connected to our fears of death,

1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:47.160
 do you think it always returns in some kind of shape? Maybe it's not called religion, but whatever,

1:49:47.160 --> 1:49:51.880
 it just keeps returning? Yeah, who knows? So that's a great question, Lex. So there's a woman named

1:49:51.880 --> 1:50:01.960
 Karen Armstrong. She was a nun turned historian. And she's, I can't remember the name of the book,

1:50:02.920 --> 1:50:08.520
 but no matter. She, we could look that up, but... If you want, I can look it up, but I can also,

1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:13.400
 I'll just add it in post. Yeah, her point, it says God in the title, of course.

1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:23.560
 But she's like, look, all religions are generally fairly right minded in that they advocate the

1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:35.880
 golden rule. And all religions, at their best, do seem to foster pro social behavior towards the

1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:43.400
 in group. And that confers both psychological as well as physical benefits. That's the good news.

1:50:44.200 --> 1:50:53.000
 And the bad news is historically all religions are subject to being hijacked by a lunatic fringe

1:50:54.520 --> 1:51:02.760
 who declares that, you know, they're the ones in sole possession of the world.

1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:09.080
 Sole possession of the liturgical practices or whatever they call them.

1:51:10.280 --> 1:51:19.480
 And they're the ones that turn, you know, religion at its best into your crusades and holocausts.

1:51:19.480 --> 1:51:31.960
 Yeah. My view, not that it should matter for much, but I grew up just skeptical of religion

1:51:32.920 --> 1:51:39.160
 because I'm like, as a kid, I'm like, well, if we didn't have these beliefs,

1:51:39.160 --> 1:51:45.240
 we wouldn't be killing each other because of them. And I'd be like to my parents,

1:51:45.240 --> 1:51:50.760
 well, you're telling me that all people should be judged on the merits of their character,

1:51:51.560 --> 1:51:58.120
 but don't come home if you don't marry a Jewish woman. Right. Which is implying that if you're

1:51:58.120 --> 1:52:02.280
 not Jewish, you're an inferior form of life. Yeah. That's what tribes always do.

1:52:02.280 --> 1:52:08.200
 And there's the tribal thing. And so there's a guy named Amin Malouf, a Lebanese guy who writes

1:52:08.200 --> 1:52:17.720
 in French in the 1990s, I think wrote a book called In the Name of Identity, Violence and

1:52:17.720 --> 1:52:28.280
 the Need to Belong. And that was his point is unless we can overcome this tribal mentality,

1:52:29.800 --> 1:52:35.640
 this will not end well. But you said earlier something, Lex, that I think is profound and

1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:44.520
 profoundly important. And that is you did not recoil in horror when I mentioned Kierkegaard's

1:52:44.520 --> 1:52:53.960
 use of the term faith. And so I'm a big fan of faith and I'm not sure what that implies.

1:52:56.440 --> 1:53:04.360
 And by the way, this is just a peripheral comment, but I find less resistance to Becker's ideas in

1:53:04.360 --> 1:53:13.640
 our work when I'm in Jesuit schools. It's the Americans, the secular humanists who

1:53:14.440 --> 1:53:21.240
 are most disinclined to accept these ideas. It's an important side comment because I think it's

1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:27.640
 mostly because they don't think philosophically. I speak with a lot of scientists and I think that's

1:53:27.640 --> 1:53:37.080
 my main criticism. I mean, that's the problem with science is it's so comforting to focus in

1:53:37.080 --> 1:53:43.480
 on the details that you can escape thinking about the mystery of it all, the big picture things,

1:53:43.480 --> 1:53:52.600
 the philosophical, like the fact that you don't actually know shit at all. So in terms of Jesuit,

1:53:52.600 --> 1:54:01.000
 like that's the beauty of the experience of faith and so on is like, wherever that journey takes you

1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:07.160
 is you actually explore the biggest questions of our world. So I don't see religion going away

1:54:07.160 --> 1:54:19.240
 because I don't see humans as capable of surviving without faith and hope. And

1:54:19.240 --> 1:54:29.640
 then everyone from the Pope to Elon Musk will acknowledge that it is a world that is unfathomably

1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:38.680
 mysterious. And like it or not, in the absence of beliefs, here I'm Charles Peirce, the pragmatic

1:54:38.680 --> 1:54:44.200
 philosopher, he just said beliefs are the basis of action. If you don't have any beliefs, you're

1:54:44.200 --> 1:54:50.600
 paralyzed with indecision, whether we're aware of it or not, whether we like it or not, in order to

1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:58.680
 stand up in the morning, you have to subscribe to beliefs that can never be unequivocally proven

1:54:59.480 --> 1:55:07.080
 right or wrong. Well, then why do you maintain them? Well, ultimately it's because of some form

1:55:07.080 --> 1:55:16.280
 of faith. But also faith shouldn't be a dogmatic thing that you should always be leaping.

1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:25.240
 I guess the problem with science or with religion is you can sort of all of a sudden

1:55:25.240 --> 1:55:30.680
 take a step into a place where you're super confident that you know the absolute truth of

1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:37.800
 things. There you go. And again, back to Socrates, Plato, back in the cave. At Skidmore, where I

1:55:37.800 --> 1:55:44.120
 work, that's what I have the students read in their first week. And Plato's like, oh, look at

1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:51.560
 all those poor bastards. They're in the cave, but they don't know it. And then they are freed from

1:55:51.560 --> 1:55:56.200
 their chains. And they have to be dragged out of the cave, by the way, which is another interesting

1:55:56.200 --> 1:56:02.840
 point. They don't run out. But that gets back to why people don't like to be divested of their

1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:07.000
 comfortable illusions. But anyway, they get dragged out of the cave into the sunlight,

1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:13.080
 which he claims is a representation of truth and beauty. And I say to the students, well,

1:56:13.080 --> 1:56:21.400
 what's wrong with that? And they're like, nothing. That's like awesome. And then I'm like, yo, dudes,

1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:29.320
 you're out of the cave, but how do you know that you're not in another cave? The illumination may

1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:40.200
 be better. But the minute you think you're at the end of the proverbial intellectual slash

1:56:41.560 --> 1:56:50.840
 epistemological trail, then you have already succumbed to either laziness or dogmatism or

1:56:50.840 --> 1:56:57.000
 both. That's really well put. That's both terrifying and exciting that there's always

1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:03.000
 a bigger cave. A little bit of an out there question, but I think some of the interesting

1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:11.640
 qualities of the human mind is the ideas of intelligence and consciousness. So what do you

1:57:11.640 --> 1:57:19.560
 make of consciousness? So do you think death creates consciousness, like the fear of death,

1:57:19.560 --> 1:57:29.320
 the terror of death creates consciousness and consciousness in turn magnifies the terror of

1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:37.480
 death? I do. Like what is consciousness to you? Don't ask me that. So now if I could answer that,

1:57:37.480 --> 1:57:43.960
 you know, I'd be chugging rum out of a coconut with my Nobel prize that, you know, it's literally,

1:57:43.960 --> 1:57:50.280
 you know, Steven Pinker, I do agree with his claim and I think how the mind works, that it is the

1:57:51.400 --> 1:58:01.320
 key question for the psychological sciences broadly defined in the 21st century.

1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:02.040
 What is consciousness?

1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:09.800
 Yeah, what is consciousness? And I don't think it's an epiphenomenological afterthought. So a

1:58:09.800 --> 1:58:19.000
 lot of people, I think Dan Wagner at Harvard, a lot of folks consider it just the ass end of a

1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:30.520
 process that by the time we are aware of what it is, it's just basically an integrated rendering

1:58:30.520 --> 1:58:37.480
 of something that's already happened. You know, evidently there's a half second delay between

1:58:37.480 --> 1:58:41.560
 when something happens, you know, those studies and our awareness of it.

1:58:43.320 --> 1:58:47.960
 And that's where like ideas of free will will step in. You can explain away a lot of stuff.

1:58:47.960 --> 1:58:54.200
 And I think those are all important and interesting questions. I'm of the persuasion.

1:58:55.160 --> 1:59:05.960
 I mean, even, not even, but Dawkins and the selfish gene is very thoughtful. Actually,

1:59:05.960 --> 1:59:11.880
 in a lot of, it's actually more in notes than in the text of the book, but he's just like,

1:59:11.880 --> 1:59:23.000
 it's hard for me to imagine that consciousness doesn't have some sort of important and highly

1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:30.680
 adaptive function. And what Dawkins says is he thought about it in terms of just that we could

1:59:30.680 --> 1:59:39.560
 do mental simulations, that one possibly extraordinary product of consciousness is to

1:59:40.120 --> 1:59:50.280
 rather than find out often by adverse consequences through trying something would be to run mental

1:59:50.280 --> 1:59:55.800
 simulations. And so one possibility is that consciousness is highly adaptive.

1:59:55.800 --> 2:00:01.960
 Another possibility is Nicholas Humphrey, a British dude who wrote a book about, I think it's

2:00:01.960 --> 2:00:09.000
 called Regaining Consciousness. And he hypothesized, I think this is 1980s, maybe even earlier,

2:00:09.560 --> 2:00:18.840
 that consciousness arose as a way to better predict the behavior of others in social settings,

2:00:18.840 --> 2:00:27.320
 that by knowing how I feel makes me better able to know how you may be feeling. This is like the

2:00:27.320 --> 2:00:35.160
 rudiments of a theory of mind. And it really may not have had anything to do with intelligence,

2:00:35.960 --> 2:00:37.880
 so much as social intelligence.

2:00:37.880 --> 2:00:46.680
 So in that sense, consciousness is a social construct. It's just a useful thing for interacting

2:00:46.680 --> 2:00:56.280
 with other humans. I don't know, but there seems to be something about realizing your own mortality

2:00:56.280 --> 2:00:59.480
 that's somehow intricately connected to the idea of consciousness.

2:00:59.480 --> 2:01:08.120
 Well, I think so also. So this is where, and Nietzsche, he said a solitary creature would not

2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:10.120
 need consciousness.

2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:12.120
 What do you think?

2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:18.200
 Well, I don't know what I think about that. And then he goes on to say that consciousness

2:01:18.200 --> 2:01:23.960
 is the most calamitous stupidity by which we shall someday perish. And wow, I was like, dude.

2:01:25.720 --> 2:01:26.220
 Relax.

2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:37.160
 Say you were on an island alone, and you saw a reflection of yourself in the water.

2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:40.840
 If you were alone your whole life.

2:01:40.840 --> 2:01:48.200
 Yeah, great question. Nietzsche's view would be that your thoughts of yourself would never

2:01:48.200 --> 2:01:51.800
 come to mind. I don't know how I feel about that, though.

2:01:52.520 --> 2:02:00.680
 In a sense, this sounds weird, but in a sense, I feel like my mental conversation has always

2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:12.040
 been with death. It's almost like another notion, like these visualizations of a death

2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:19.560
 in the cloak. I always felt like I am a living thing, and then there's an other thing that

2:02:19.560 --> 2:02:27.720
 is the end of me. And I'm having a conversation with that. So in a sense, that's the way I

2:02:27.720 --> 2:02:36.280
 construct the fact that I am a thing is because there's somebody else that tells me, well,

2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:44.360
 you won't be a thing eventually. So this feels like a conversation, perhaps, but that might

2:02:44.360 --> 2:02:51.640
 be kind of this mental stimulation kind of idea. It's a conversation with yourself, essentially.

2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:52.140
 Sure.

2:02:52.140 --> 2:03:00.620
 Yeah, I don't know how I feel about that, but I tend to be in agreement with you when

2:03:00.620 --> 2:03:11.820
 we're talking about economics more so that we're deeply social beings. It just feels

2:03:11.820 --> 2:03:20.220
 like we're humans. I'm with Harari with the sapiens. We seem to construct ideas on top

2:03:20.220 --> 2:03:23.420
 of each other, and that's fundamentally a social process.

2:03:23.420 --> 2:03:30.860
 Absolutely. I think that's a fine book. It overlaps considerably with our take on these

2:03:30.860 --> 2:03:37.260
 matters, and the fact that we get to these points, drawing on different sources, I think

2:03:37.260 --> 2:03:38.300
 makes me more confident.

2:03:39.020 --> 2:03:46.220
 It's so fascinating, just like reading your book, sorry, on a small tangent, that Sapiens

2:03:46.220 --> 2:03:54.940
 is one of the most popular books in the world. And just reading your book is like, well,

2:03:54.940 --> 2:04:01.580
 this sounds... I don't know what makes a popular book.

2:04:01.580 --> 2:04:07.740
 Well, if you want me to be petty and stupid, I will tell you that from time to time, we

2:04:07.740 --> 2:04:20.060
 also wonder why our book... Like all books, people can take issue with it, but we thought

2:04:20.060 --> 2:04:24.220
 it would be a bigger hit, that it would be more widely read.

2:04:24.220 --> 2:04:31.020
 It's funny because I've... I don't know if I have good examples because I forgot already,

2:04:31.020 --> 2:04:37.660
 but I'm often saddened by Franz Kafka. I think he wasn't known in his life, but I

2:04:37.660 --> 2:04:46.220
 always wonder these great... Some of the greatest books ever written are completely unknown

2:04:46.220 --> 2:04:53.100
 during the author's lifetime. And it's like, man, for some reason, it's again, it's that

2:04:53.100 --> 2:04:56.220
 identity thing. I think, man, that sucks.

2:04:56.220 --> 2:05:04.060
 Well, I'm comforted by that. So Van Gogh sold one painting in his life, and evidently Thoreau

2:05:04.060 --> 2:05:12.700
 sold like 75 copies of Walden. Nietzsche's books did not sell well.

2:05:12.700 --> 2:05:19.340
 And how did Ernest Becker sell? His books are published by the free press

2:05:19.340 --> 2:05:26.060
 and have sold more than any other books that they have published.

2:05:26.060 --> 2:05:30.300
 So what does that mean? It's a lot? I don't know if it's like Jordan Peterson

2:05:30.300 --> 2:05:36.460
 Millions, but it's hundreds of thousands. Was he respected? I just don't see him...

2:05:37.180 --> 2:05:43.740
 Okay. I don't see him brought up as like in the top 10 philosophers of...

2:05:43.740 --> 2:05:49.660
 No, not at all. So how far away is he? Is he in the top 100

2:05:49.660 --> 2:05:51.180
 for people? I don't think so.

2:05:51.180 --> 2:05:53.740
 He's not brought up that often. Because again...

2:05:53.740 --> 2:05:55.980
 Like your work is brought up more often. Yeah.

2:05:55.980 --> 2:06:03.420
 I think he's one of the great philosophers of the 20th century.

2:06:03.420 --> 2:06:09.980
 So what we say, Lex, is that our goal, certainly when we first started and now

2:06:10.540 --> 2:06:16.140
 just as much actually, but what I say at all my talks is, look, if these ideas have

2:06:16.140 --> 2:06:22.460
 interest you enough to go read Ernest Becker, then this has been good. I consider him to be

2:06:22.460 --> 2:06:30.940
 one of the most important voices of the 20th century who does not get the attention that

2:06:30.940 --> 2:06:40.380
 he deserves. Similarly, our work I believe to be important because point by point we provide

2:06:40.380 --> 2:06:51.900
 empirical corroboration for all of the claims. So that's literally the students that read

2:06:51.900 --> 2:06:57.660
 The Denial of Death and then Escape from Evil. They're like, yeah, wow, every chapter of the

2:06:57.660 --> 2:07:04.220
 book, you have studies. And I'm like, yeah, because for 40 years, if a Skidmore student said,

2:07:04.220 --> 2:07:08.700
 oh, that's gotta be bullshit. I'm like, well, let's do a study.

2:07:08.700 --> 2:07:12.460
 Let's do a study. And my own dreams are in creating

2:07:14.140 --> 2:07:20.700
 robots and artificial intelligence systems that a human can love. And I think there's something

2:07:20.700 --> 2:07:26.620
 about mortality and fear mortality that is essential for implementing in our AI systems.

2:07:26.620 --> 2:07:38.780
 And so maybe can you comment on that? So this is a different perspective on your work,

2:07:38.780 --> 2:07:41.340
 which is like, how do we engineer a human?

2:07:41.340 --> 2:07:45.580
 Yeah, so, no, this is awesome, Lex. I'm delighted that you said that. First of all,

2:07:45.580 --> 2:07:50.700
 and I may have mentioned this to you, and I can't remember because I am seeing now, when you first

2:07:50.700 --> 2:07:59.900
 contacted me, I had just been told I have to learn more about your work because I'm working with some

2:07:59.900 --> 2:08:12.860
 very talented people in New York and they're writing a screenplay for a movie about an artificial

2:08:12.860 --> 2:08:24.220
 intelligence. It's a female AI set in like 30 years in the future. And basically the little

2:08:24.220 --> 2:08:29.980
 twist, this is how I had to read Heidegger. So these people call me and they're like,

2:08:29.980 --> 2:08:38.380
 we're making a movie. It's based on Becker and your work and Heidegger and this other

2:08:38.380 --> 2:08:44.540
 philosopher, Levinas, and then another philosopher, Silvia Benzo, who's an Italian philosopher.

2:08:45.420 --> 2:08:53.260
 And the long short story is the movie is about supposedly the most advanced artificial

2:08:53.260 --> 2:09:02.060
 intelligence entity, an embodied one, and who…

2:09:02.060 --> 2:09:03.020
 Human form?

2:09:03.020 --> 2:09:15.100
 Human form, who finds out, who is having essentially existential anxieties. And I think

2:09:15.100 --> 2:09:19.740
 the project is called A Dinner with Her or something, and it doesn't really matter, but the

2:09:19.740 --> 2:09:34.460
 punchline is that she finds out that her creator has made her mortal. And so the question is what

2:09:34.460 --> 2:09:47.580
 happens phenomenologically and behaviorally to an artificial intelligence who now knows that it's

2:09:47.580 --> 2:09:55.420
 mortal? And it's actually the same question that you're posing. And that is, is that necessary

2:09:57.420 --> 2:10:03.340
 in order for an AI to approximate humanity?

2:10:03.340 --> 2:10:08.780
 Yeah, I think, yeah. So the intuition, again, it's unknown, but I think it's absolutely,

2:10:08.780 --> 2:10:17.580
 I think it's absolutely necessary. A lot of people, the same kind of shallow thinking that people

2:10:17.580 --> 2:10:23.420
 have about our own end of life, our own death, is the same way people think of, I think, about

2:10:23.420 --> 2:10:30.380
 artificial intelligence. It's like, well, okay, so yeah, so within the system, there's a terminal

2:10:30.380 --> 2:10:38.700
 position where there's a point at which it ends, the program ends, there's a goal state, there's a,

2:10:38.700 --> 2:10:49.180
 you reached an end point. But the thing is, making that end a thing that's also within the program,

2:10:49.900 --> 2:10:57.500
 like making the thing, and then it's also the mystery of it. So the thing is, we don't know

2:10:57.500 --> 2:11:06.140
 what the hell this death thing is. I mean, it's not like we, I mean, the program doesn't give

2:11:06.140 --> 2:11:13.740
 us information about the meaning of it all. And that's where the terror is. And it feels like,

2:11:13.740 --> 2:11:21.020
 I mean, in the language that you would think about is the terror of this death, or like

2:11:21.020 --> 2:11:24.860
 anticipation of it, or thinking about it, is the creative force that builds everything.

2:11:24.860 --> 2:11:32.380
 Right. And that feels like, you know, that feels really important to implement. Again,

2:11:32.380 --> 2:11:37.820
 it's very difficult to know how to do technically, currently, but it's important to think about.

2:11:37.820 --> 2:11:45.340
 What I find is, you mentioned like screenplays and so on, is sci fi folks and philosophers are the

2:11:45.980 --> 2:11:50.700
 the only ones thinking about it currently. And that's what these folks have convinced me.

2:11:50.700 --> 2:12:00.220
 Yeah. And engineers aren't, which is, I get, yeah, most of the things I talk about, I get kind of

2:12:01.740 --> 2:12:03.980
 people roll their eyes from the engineer perspective.

2:12:03.980 --> 2:12:08.620
 Not these folks. They're like, because again, I saw your name and they're like,

2:12:08.620 --> 2:12:11.980
 wait a minute, I've just seen that. They're like, here's someone.

2:12:13.020 --> 2:12:14.220
 You should check out.

2:12:14.220 --> 2:12:17.420
 Yeah. So this was a delightful conference.

2:12:17.420 --> 2:12:17.980
 Yeah.

2:12:17.980 --> 2:12:26.220
 I was a huge fan of your work and Ernest Becker. And it's funny that not enough people are

2:12:27.900 --> 2:12:33.340
 talking about it. I don't know what to do with that. I think that there's a possibility to create

2:12:33.340 --> 2:12:37.500
 real deep, meaningful connections between AI systems and humans.

2:12:37.500 --> 2:12:38.060
 Absolutely.

2:12:38.060 --> 2:12:44.300
 And I think some of these things of fear mortality are essential, are essential for

2:12:44.300 --> 2:12:49.820
 the element of human experience. I don't, I don't think it might be essential to create

2:12:49.820 --> 2:12:55.500
 general intelligence, like very intelligent machines, but to create a machine that connects

2:12:55.500 --> 2:12:57.580
 to human in some deep way.

2:12:57.580 --> 2:13:07.340
 What's your view, not to make me the interviewer, but what's your view about machine ethics? Can

2:13:07.340 --> 2:13:16.940
 you imagine an ethical AI without some semblance of finitude, let's say?

2:13:16.940 --> 2:13:26.220
 Well, I think ethics is a, there's a trolley problem that's often used in the work that

2:13:26.220 --> 2:13:30.540
 I've done at MIT with autonomous vehicles in particular.

2:13:30.540 --> 2:13:31.740
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

2:13:31.740 --> 2:13:38.860
 That people, I think they offload, they ask, like, how would a machine deal with an ethical

2:13:38.860 --> 2:13:43.740
 situation that they themselves, the humans don't know how to deal with?

2:13:43.740 --> 2:13:44.380
 Exactly.

2:13:44.380 --> 2:13:53.820
 And so I don't know if a machine is able to do a better job on difficult ethical questions,

2:13:53.820 --> 2:14:00.300
 but I certainly think to behave properly and effectively in this world is a very important

2:14:00.300 --> 2:14:06.140
 thing. Effectively in this world, it needs to be, have a fear of mortality and like be

2:14:06.140 --> 2:14:10.940
 able to even dance. Because I don't think you can solve ethical problems, but you have

2:14:10.940 --> 2:14:17.740
 to, I think like ethics is like a dance floor. You have to just, you have to dance properly

2:14:17.740 --> 2:14:21.180
 with the rest of the humans. Like if people are dancing tango, you have to dance in the

2:14:21.180 --> 2:14:27.180
 same kind of way. And for that, you have to have a fear of mortality. Like I think of,

2:14:27.180 --> 2:14:32.620
 more practically speaking, as I said, autonomous vehicles, like the way you interact with pedestrians

2:14:33.820 --> 2:14:40.860
 fundamentally has to have a sense of mortality. So when pedestrians cross the road,

2:14:42.940 --> 2:14:48.780
 now I've watched, well, certainly 100 plus hours of pedestrian videos.

2:14:48.780 --> 2:14:56.780
 There's a kind of social contract where you walk in front of a car and you're putting

2:14:56.780 --> 2:14:58.860
 your life in the hands of another human being.

2:14:58.860 --> 2:14:59.820
 Yes, that's right.

2:14:59.820 --> 2:15:06.220
 And like death is in the car, in the game that's being played, death is right there.

2:15:07.180 --> 2:15:11.820
 It's part of the calculus. It's not, but it's not like a simple calculus. It's not a simple

2:15:11.820 --> 2:15:20.780
 equation. I mean, I don't know what it is, but it's in there and it has to be part of

2:15:20.780 --> 2:15:25.900
 the optimization problem. Like it's not as simple as, so from the computer vision, from

2:15:25.900 --> 2:15:34.060
 the artificial intelligence perspective, it's detecting there's a human estimating the trajectory,

2:15:34.060 --> 2:15:40.780
 like treating everything like it's a billiard balls, as opposed to like being able to calculate

2:15:40.780 --> 2:15:47.580
 it, being able to construct an effective model, the world model of what the person's thinking,

2:15:47.580 --> 2:15:52.300
 what they're going to do, what are the different possibilities of how the scene might evolve,

2:15:52.300 --> 2:16:00.060
 I think requires having some sense of, yeah, fear of fear of mortality, of mortality.

2:16:00.060 --> 2:16:05.820
 I don't see the, the thing is, I think it's really important to think about, I can be

2:16:05.820 --> 2:16:12.620
 honest enough to say that it's, I haven't been able to figure out how to engineer any

2:16:12.620 --> 2:16:17.660
 of these things. But I do think it's really, really important. Like I have, so I have a

2:16:17.660 --> 2:16:24.060
 bunch of Roombas here. I can show it to you after that. Roombas is a robot that does

2:16:25.740 --> 2:16:32.540
 vacuums the floor and I've had them make different sounds. Like I had them scream in pain

2:16:32.540 --> 2:16:45.980
 and it, you immediately anthropomorphize and it creates, I don't know, knowing that they

2:16:45.980 --> 2:16:52.860
 can feel pain. See, I'm speaking, like knowing that I immediately imagine that they can feel

2:16:52.860 --> 2:16:59.660
 pain and it immediately draws me closer to them, the human experience. And that there's

2:16:59.660 --> 2:17:06.380
 something in that that should be engineered in our systems, it feels like. I believe,

2:17:06.380 --> 2:17:11.500
 personally, I don't know what you think, but I believe it's possible for a robot and a

2:17:11.500 --> 2:17:14.380
 human to fall in love, for example, in the future.

2:17:14.380 --> 2:17:17.100
 Oh, I think it's, yeah, it's already there.

2:17:18.780 --> 2:17:23.740
 No, there's a certain kind of deep connection with technology. I mean, a real, like you

2:17:23.740 --> 2:17:24.700
 would choose to marry.

2:17:24.700 --> 2:17:30.140
 I mean, again, it sounds, I'll find a book title and I'll send it to you. And it's a

2:17:30.140 --> 2:17:41.820
 serious consideration of people who started out with these sex dolls, but it turned into

2:17:41.820 --> 2:17:48.220
 a relationship of enduring significance that the woman who wrote the book is not willing

2:17:48.220 --> 2:17:50.220
 to dismiss as a perversion.

2:17:50.220 --> 2:17:56.860
 Yeah, that's what, you know, people kind of joke about sex robots, which is funny. Like,

2:17:56.860 --> 2:18:00.460
 it's a funny, I mean, there's a lot of stuff about robots. It's just kind of fun to talk

2:18:00.460 --> 2:18:06.700
 about that is not necessarily connected to reality. People joke about sex robots, but

2:18:06.700 --> 2:18:12.220
 if you actually look how sex robots, which are pretty rare these days, are used, they're

2:18:12.220 --> 2:18:16.060
 not used by people who want sex.

2:18:16.060 --> 2:18:16.860
 Precisely.

2:18:16.860 --> 2:18:17.820
 They're actually,

2:18:17.820 --> 2:18:18.780
 They're kind of,

2:18:18.780 --> 2:18:20.460
 They're actually,

2:18:20.460 --> 2:18:21.420
 They're companions.

2:18:21.420 --> 2:18:22.620
 They become companions.

2:18:22.620 --> 2:18:22.860
 Yeah.

2:18:24.380 --> 2:18:29.340
 It's, yeah, it's fascinating. And they're just, we're not even talking about any kind

2:18:29.340 --> 2:18:33.500
 of intelligence. We're talking about just, I mean, human beings seek companionships.

2:18:33.500 --> 2:18:37.740
 We're deeply lonely. I mean, that was the other sense I have that I don't know if I

2:18:37.740 --> 2:18:42.380
 can articulate clearly. You can probably do a better job, but I have a sense that there's

2:18:42.380 --> 2:18:44.620
 a deep loneliness within all of us.

2:18:44.620 --> 2:18:45.100
 Absolutely.

2:18:45.740 --> 2:18:48.540
 In the face of death, it feels like we're alone.

2:18:48.540 --> 2:18:56.700
 So, you know, the, what drew me to the existential take on things, Lex, was the,

2:19:00.460 --> 2:19:08.380
 who is it, Rollo May and Erwin Yallem write about existentialism and they're like, look,

2:19:09.820 --> 2:19:16.380
 what, there's different flavors of existentialism, but they all have in common, what is it,

2:19:16.380 --> 2:19:26.620
 four universal concerns. The overriding one is about death. And that next is choice and

2:19:26.620 --> 2:19:33.980
 responsibility. The next one is existential isolation. And they're like, that's one of the

2:19:35.420 --> 2:19:41.020
 things about consciousness that, and the last one is meaninglessness, but the existential

2:19:41.020 --> 2:19:55.100
 isolation point is, you know, we are by virtue of consciousness able to apprehend that unless

2:19:55.100 --> 2:20:03.660
 you're a Siamese twin, you are fundamentally alone. And because it is claimed, it's Eric

2:20:03.660 --> 2:20:11.900
 Fromm in a book called Escape from Freedom. He's like, look, you're smart enough to know that the

2:20:11.900 --> 2:20:17.020
 most direct way that we typically communicate with our fellow human beings is through language.

2:20:18.140 --> 2:20:25.900
 But you also know that language is a pale shadow of the totality of our interior

2:20:25.900 --> 2:20:33.980
 phenomenological existence. Therefore, there's always going to be times in our lives where even

2:20:33.980 --> 2:20:40.620
 under the best of circumstances, you could be trying desperately to convey your thoughts and

2:20:40.620 --> 2:20:47.100
 feelings and somebody listening could be like, yeah, I get it, I get it, I get it. And you're

2:20:47.100 --> 2:20:55.420
 like, you have no fucking idea what I'm talking about. So you can be desperately lonely in a house

2:20:55.420 --> 2:21:00.300
 where you live with 10 people in the middle of Tokyo where there's millions.

2:21:02.940 --> 2:21:06.540
 Yeah, it's the Great Gatsby. You could be alone in a big party.

2:21:06.540 --> 2:21:07.180
 Exactly.

2:21:07.820 --> 2:21:12.620
 Maybe this is a small tangent, but let me ask you on the topic of academia,

2:21:13.900 --> 2:21:20.860
 you're kind of, we talked about Jordan Peterson, there's a lot of sort of renegade type of thinkers,

2:21:20.860 --> 2:21:29.580
 certainly in psychology, but it applies in all disciplines. What are your thoughts about academia

2:21:29.580 --> 2:21:40.940
 being a place to harbor people like yourself? People who think deeply about things, who are

2:21:40.940 --> 2:21:46.780
 not constrained by sort of the, I don't think you're quite controversial.

2:21:46.780 --> 2:21:47.580
 No, not really.

2:21:47.580 --> 2:21:55.660
 But you are a person who thinks deeply about things and it feels like academia can sometimes

2:21:55.660 --> 2:21:56.700
 stifle that.

2:21:56.700 --> 2:22:09.420
 I think so. So my concern right now, Lex, for young scholars is that the restrictions and

2:22:09.420 --> 2:22:17.020
 expectations are such that it's highly unlikely that anybody will do anything

2:22:18.860 --> 2:22:29.740
 of great value or innovation except for, and this is not a bad thing, but stepwise improvement

2:22:29.740 --> 2:22:38.300
 of existing paradigms. So in simple English, I went to Princeton for a job interview 40 years

2:22:38.300 --> 2:22:42.940
 ago and they're like, what are you going to do if we give you a job? And I'm like, I don't know,

2:22:42.940 --> 2:22:52.380
 I want to think about it and read. And I saw that that interview was over, the window of

2:22:52.380 --> 2:22:59.660
 opportunity shut in my face and they actually called my mentors and they're like, what are

2:22:59.660 --> 2:23:03.740
 you doing? Tell this guy to buy some pants. I had hair down to my waist also. He's like,

2:23:03.740 --> 2:23:12.620
 this guy looks like Charles Manson in Jesus. But the expectation is that you come to a

2:23:12.620 --> 2:23:18.780
 post, you start publishing so that you can get grants.

2:23:20.060 --> 2:23:24.060
 That's certainly true. But there's also kind of a behavioral thing. You said like long hair.

2:23:24.060 --> 2:23:30.220
 There's a certain style of the way you're supposed to behave. For example, I'm wearing

2:23:30.220 --> 2:23:38.300
 a suit. It sounds weird, but I feel comfortable in this. I wore it when I was teaching at MIT,

2:23:38.300 --> 2:23:47.500
 I wore it to meetings and so on, the different, sometimes a blue and red tie, but that was an

2:23:47.500 --> 2:23:52.220
 outsider thing to do at MIT. So there was a strong pressure to not wear a suit.

2:23:52.220 --> 2:23:53.020
 No, that's right.

2:23:53.020 --> 2:23:57.900
 And there's a pressure to behave, to have a hair thing, the way you wear your hair,

2:23:57.900 --> 2:24:04.140
 the way you, this isn't like a liberal or a left or anything. It's just in tribes.

2:24:04.140 --> 2:24:04.780
 That's right.

2:24:04.780 --> 2:24:12.780
 And academia to me or a place, any place that dreams of having like renegade free thinkers,

2:24:12.780 --> 2:24:20.620
 like really deep thinkers should in fact, like glorify the outsider. Should welcome

2:24:20.620 --> 2:24:25.500
 just, should welcome people that don't fit in.

2:24:25.500 --> 2:24:26.060
 Yeah.

2:24:26.060 --> 2:24:30.860
 No, that sounds weird, but I can just imagine an interview with at Princeton,

2:24:32.540 --> 2:24:38.460
 I can imagine why aren't people, why aren't you at Harvard, for example, or MIT?

2:24:40.300 --> 2:24:48.300
 Yeah. Well, so that, look, I would love to, I haven't lectured at MIT, but I've lectured at

2:24:48.300 --> 2:24:54.540
 Harvard. I've gotten to lecture at almost every place that wouldn't consider me for a job.

2:24:55.500 --> 2:25:04.780
 And I, well, a few things. I'm lucky because I go to Princeton, I'm like, I don't know what I

2:25:04.780 --> 2:25:08.780
 want to do. And then two days later I go to Skidmore and I'm like, I don't know what I want

2:25:08.780 --> 2:25:15.340
 to do. And they offer me a job later that day, which I declined for months because of the

2:25:15.340 --> 2:25:22.860
 extraordinary pressure of my mentors who right mindedly felt that I wouldn't get much done there.

2:25:24.140 --> 2:25:31.020
 But what they told me at Skidmore was take your time, show up for your classes and don't molest

2:25:31.020 --> 2:25:35.580
 barnyard animals and you'll probably get tenure. And I'm like, I'll show up for my classes.

2:25:35.580 --> 2:25:37.580
 We'll talk about it.

2:25:37.580 --> 2:25:39.180
 That was the negotiation.

2:25:39.180 --> 2:25:47.820
 Yeah, I negotiated, I drove a hard bargain. But honestly, Lex, that's, I feel I'm very committed

2:25:47.820 --> 2:25:57.100
 to Skidmore because I was given tenure when our first terror management paper wasn't published.

2:25:57.100 --> 2:26:03.420
 It took eight years to publish. It was rejected at every journal. And I submitted it as like a

2:26:03.420 --> 2:26:09.900
 purple ditto sheet thing. I'm like, here's what I've been doing. Here's the reviews. Here's why

2:26:09.900 --> 2:26:15.100
 I think this is still a pretty good idea. And I don't know that this would happen even at Skidmore

2:26:15.100 --> 2:26:23.020
 anymore. But I was very lucky to be given the latitude and to be encouraged. I took classes

2:26:23.020 --> 2:26:29.180
 at Skidmore. That's how I learned all this stuff. I graduated, I got a PhD unscathed by knowledge.

2:26:29.180 --> 2:26:39.420
 We were great statisticians and methodologists, but we didn't have any substance. And I don't

2:26:39.420 --> 2:26:45.980
 mean this cynically, but we were trained in a method in search of a question. So I appreciate

2:26:46.940 --> 2:26:54.700
 having five years at Skidmore basically to read books. And I also appreciate that I look like

2:26:54.700 --> 2:27:10.300
 this 40 years ago. And my view is that this is how I comported myself. Other people, the guy I learned

2:27:10.300 --> 2:27:18.060
 the most from at Skidmore is now dead, a history professor, Ted Kuroda. He wore a bow tie. And

2:27:18.060 --> 2:27:25.660
 there's another guy, Darnell Rucker, who taught me about philosophy. And he was very proper. And

2:27:25.660 --> 2:27:34.620
 he had his jacket with the leather patches. But these guys weren't pompous at all. They were,

2:27:34.620 --> 2:27:44.860
 this is the way I am. And I always felt that that's important that somebody who looks at you

2:27:44.860 --> 2:27:52.220
 and says, oh, what a stiff, he's probably an MBA. Well, they're wrong. And someone who looks at me,

2:27:52.860 --> 2:27:58.620
 when I first got to Skidmore, other professors would ask when I'd be coming to their office to

2:27:58.620 --> 2:28:03.740
 empty the garbage. They just assumed, as in my twenties, they assumed I was housekeeping.

2:28:04.540 --> 2:28:10.940
 I always felt that was important that the students learn not to judge an idea by the appearance of

2:28:10.940 --> 2:28:21.660
 the person who pervades it. I guess this is such a high concern now because I personally still

2:28:22.220 --> 2:28:27.580
 have faith that academia is where the great geniuses will come from and great ideas.

2:28:27.580 --> 2:28:35.340
 I love hearing you say that. I still, and it's one of the reasons why I'm really

2:28:35.340 --> 2:28:44.540
 apprehensive about the future of education right now in the context of the pandemic is that a lot

2:28:44.540 --> 2:28:53.100
 of folks, a lot of these are Google type people who I don't, they're geniuses also, but I don't

2:28:53.100 --> 2:29:00.220
 like this idea that all learning can be virtual and that much could happen. I'm big on embodied

2:29:00.220 --> 2:29:08.060
 environments with actual humans interacting. I mean, there's so much to the university education,

2:29:08.060 --> 2:29:16.540
 but I think the key part is the mentorship that occurs somehow at the human level. Like I've

2:29:16.540 --> 2:29:25.740
 gotten a lot of flack, like this conversation where in person now, and I've even with Edward

2:29:25.740 --> 2:29:33.660
 Snowden who done all interviews remote, I'm a stickler to in person. It has to be in person

2:29:33.660 --> 2:29:38.300
 like, and a lot of people just don't get it. They're like, well, why can't, this is so much

2:29:38.300 --> 2:29:45.420
 easier. Like why go through the pain? Like I've traveled, I'm traveling in the next month to Paris

2:29:46.300 --> 2:29:52.220
 for a single stupid conversation. Nobody cares about just to be in person. Well, it's important

2:29:52.220 --> 2:30:01.100
 to me. I honestly, I was like this, and thank you for coming down to it. It's my pleasure,

2:30:01.100 --> 2:30:05.660
 but again, it's very self serving. I've enjoyed this. I knew I was going to, but

2:30:06.620 --> 2:30:13.020
 it's not about our enjoyment per se. Again, at the risk of sounding cavalier,

2:30:13.020 --> 2:30:24.140
 there are a host of factors beyond verbal that I don't believe can be adequately captured. I don't

2:30:24.140 --> 2:30:35.260
 care how much the acuity is decent on a zoom conversation. I feel again, I felt within five

2:30:35.260 --> 2:30:45.340
 minutes that this was going to be for me easy in the sense that I could speak freely. I just don't

2:30:45.340 --> 2:30:52.540
 see that happening so easily from a distance. Yeah, I tend to, well, I'm hopeful. I agree with

2:30:52.540 --> 2:30:58.140
 you on the current technology, but I am hopeful on like some others on the technology eventually

2:30:58.140 --> 2:31:03.740
 being able to create that kind of experience or quite far away from that, but it might be

2:31:03.740 --> 2:31:12.460
 able to, my hope is, you know, I'm hopeful. I was at Microsoft in Seattle and I can't remember why.

2:31:13.260 --> 2:31:24.220
 And no, I can't. I, that's how I'm in my early Mr. Magoo phase. And somebody there was showing us

2:31:24.220 --> 2:31:35.260
 like a virtual wall where the entire wall, you know, when you're talking to somebody, so it's

2:31:35.260 --> 2:31:43.500
 life size and they were beginning the, get the appearance of motion and stuff. It looked pretty.

2:31:44.300 --> 2:31:47.820
 Yeah. With virtual reality too, I don't know if you've ever been inside a virtual world.

2:31:47.820 --> 2:31:56.940
 It's to me, it's I can just see the future. It's quite real in terms of like a terror of death.

2:31:57.500 --> 2:32:03.580
 I'm afraid of heights. Me too. And there's, I don't know if you've ever tried, you should,

2:32:03.580 --> 2:32:07.500
 if you haven't, there's a virtual reality experience where you can walk a plank. Yeah.

2:32:07.500 --> 2:32:15.340
 You can look down and man, I was on the ground like, I was like, I was afraid. I was deeply afraid.

2:32:15.340 --> 2:32:23.100
 I was, it was, it was as real as, as anything else could be. And I mean, these are very early days

2:32:23.100 --> 2:32:30.460
 of that technology, relatively speaking. So yeah. I mean, I don't know what to do with that. Same

2:32:30.460 --> 2:32:35.820
 with like crossing the street, we did these experiments across the street in front of a car

2:32:35.820 --> 2:32:45.900
 and, you know, it's being run over by a car. It's terrifying. Yeah. It's just that, yeah. So there's

2:32:45.900 --> 2:32:53.340
 a rich experience to be created there. We're not there yet, but, yeah. And I've seen a lot of people

2:32:53.340 --> 2:32:59.020
 try, like you said, the Google folks, Silicon Valley folks try to create a virtual online

2:32:59.020 --> 2:33:04.380
 education. I don't know. I think they've raised really important questions. Absolutely. Like what

2:33:04.380 --> 2:33:12.940
 makes the education experience fulfilling? What makes it effective? Yeah. These are important

2:33:12.940 --> 2:33:22.460
 questions. And I think what they highlight is we have no clue. Like, there's, Thomas Sowell

2:33:24.460 --> 2:33:31.900
 wrote a book about, a recent book on charter schools. Yeah. I would like to talk to him. Yeah,

2:33:31.900 --> 2:33:37.900
 he's an interesting guy. We will disagree about a lot, but respectfully. Yeah. Such a powerful mind.

2:33:37.900 --> 2:33:46.220
 Yeah. But he, I need to read, I've only heard him talk about the book, but he argues quite

2:33:46.780 --> 2:33:57.020
 seemingly effectively that the public education system is broken. That we blame, he basically says

2:33:57.020 --> 2:34:05.820
 that we kind of blame, like the conditions or the environment, but the upbringing of people,

2:34:05.820 --> 2:34:13.100
 like parenting, blah, blah, blah, like the set of opportunities. But okay, putting that aside,

2:34:13.100 --> 2:34:20.620
 it seems like charter schools, no matter who it is that attends them, does much better than in

2:34:20.620 --> 2:34:27.900
 public schools. And he puts a bunch of data behind it. And in his usual way, as you know, just is

2:34:27.900 --> 2:34:34.300
 very eloquent in arguing his points. Yeah. So that to me just highlights, man, we don't, education

2:34:34.300 --> 2:34:39.660
 is like one of the most important, it's probably the most important thing in our civilization,

2:34:39.660 --> 2:34:49.260
 and we're doing a shitty job of it. Yeah. In academia, in university education and, you know,

2:34:49.260 --> 2:34:55.340
 younger education, the whole thing. The whole thing. And yet, we value

2:34:59.580 --> 2:35:05.820
 just about anyone or anything more than educators. You know, part of it is just the

2:35:07.420 --> 2:35:18.380
 relatively low regard that Americans have for teachers. Also similarly, like just people

2:35:18.380 --> 2:35:26.620
 of service. I think great teachers are the greatest thing in our society. And I would say,

2:35:26.620 --> 2:35:33.100
 now on a controversial note, like Black Lives Matter, you know, great police officers is the

2:35:33.100 --> 2:35:40.620
 greatest thing in our society. Also, like all people that do service, we undervalue cops severe,

2:35:40.620 --> 2:35:47.260
 like this whole defund the police is missing the point. And it's a stupid word. I'm with you on

2:35:47.260 --> 2:35:54.940
 that, Lex. Our neighbors to one side of our house are three generations of police, our neighbors

2:35:54.940 --> 2:36:08.940
 across the street are police. They know my, you know, political predilections. And we've gotten

2:36:08.940 --> 2:36:14.940
 along fine for 30 years. And I go out and tell them every day, you know, when you go in today,

2:36:14.940 --> 2:36:23.980
 you tell the people on the force that I appreciate what they're doing. I think it's

2:36:25.500 --> 2:36:36.620
 really important to not tribalize those concerns. I mean, we mentioned so many brilliant books and

2:36:36.620 --> 2:36:45.900
 philosophers, but it'd be nice to sort of in a focused way, try to see if we can get some

2:36:45.900 --> 2:36:54.140
 recommendations from you. So what three books, technical or fiction or philosophical had a big

2:36:54.140 --> 2:37:02.300
 impact in your life and you would recommend. Spent four hours driving here, perseverating about

2:37:02.300 --> 2:37:08.540
 that. I didn't, I, everything else you sent me as fine. And I actually, I skimmed it and I'm like,

2:37:08.540 --> 2:37:14.460
 I don't want to look at it because I want, I want us to talk. The ones in blue. I'm like, all right.

2:37:15.340 --> 2:37:24.060
 And you know, I've already said that I've found backers work and I put the denial of death out

2:37:24.060 --> 2:37:31.260
 there. Um, is that his best, sorry, a small tangent. Is there other books that of his?

2:37:31.260 --> 2:37:35.740
 Yes. If I could have this count as one that the, the birth and death of meaning,

2:37:36.380 --> 2:37:44.220
 the denial of death and escape from evil are three books of Ernest Becker's that I believe to

2:37:44.220 --> 2:37:53.340
 all be profound in a, in a little sort of brief dance around topics. Um, I've only read denial

2:37:53.340 --> 2:37:57.980
 of death. Like, well, how do those books connect in here? Yeah. Nice. So the, the birth and death

2:37:57.980 --> 2:38:07.180
 of meaning is where Becker situates his thinking in more of an evolutionary foundation. So I like

2:38:07.180 --> 2:38:16.060
 that for that reason. Escape from evil is where he applies the ideas in the denial of death

2:38:17.100 --> 2:38:27.260
 more directly, um, to economic matters and to inequality and also to our inability to

2:38:27.260 --> 2:38:32.620
 peacefully coexist with other folks who don't share our beliefs. So I would put Ernest Becker

2:38:32.620 --> 2:38:42.060
 out there as one. Um, I also like novels a lot. And here I was like, God damn it. No matter what

2:38:42.060 --> 2:38:48.540
 I say, I'm going to be like, yes, but, but the existentialists, do you like all those folks?

2:38:48.540 --> 2:38:56.540
 Come on. You like that literary existential? I do. But I mean, you know, I, I've read all those

2:38:56.540 --> 2:39:03.100
 books. I will tell you the last line of the plague. We learn in times of pestilence that there's more

2:39:03.100 --> 2:39:10.620
 to admire in men than to despise. And I love that. Yeah. Plagues such a, I don't know. I,

2:39:10.620 --> 2:39:17.260
 I find the plague is a brilliant before, before, uh, the plague has come to us in 2020.

2:39:17.260 --> 2:39:25.420
 I, it was just a book about love about, but I'll toss a one that may be less known to folks. I'm

2:39:25.420 --> 2:39:32.540
 enamored with a novel by a woman named Carson McCullers written in 1953 called clock without

2:39:32.540 --> 2:39:41.420
 hands. And I find it a brilliant literary depiction of many of the ideas that we have spoken about.

2:39:41.420 --> 2:39:42.060
 Fiction?

2:39:42.060 --> 2:39:43.100
 Fiction. Yeah.

2:39:43.100 --> 2:39:45.100
 What's, uh, what kind of ideas are we talking about?

2:39:45.100 --> 2:39:51.100
 Oh, it, it, all of the existential ideas that we have encountered today,

2:39:51.100 --> 2:39:57.980
 but in the context of a story of someone who finds out that he is terminally ill,

2:39:59.020 --> 2:40:06.300
 it's set in the South and the, um, heyday of like segregation. So there's a lot of social issues,

2:40:06.300 --> 2:40:14.060
 a lot of existential issues, but it's basically a novel, a fictional account of someone who finds

2:40:14.060 --> 2:40:23.500
 out that they're terminally ill and who reacts originally as, um, uh, you might expect anyone,

2:40:23.500 --> 2:40:31.580
 uh, becomes more, um, hostile to people who are different, like petty and stupid denies that

2:40:32.220 --> 2:40:41.020
 anything's happening. But, uh, as the book goes on and he comes more to terms, um, with his own

2:40:41.020 --> 2:40:50.700
 mortality, um, it ends lovingly. And then, uh, back to your idea about, you know, love being

2:40:51.900 --> 2:40:53.660
 incredibly potent.

2:40:53.660 --> 2:40:57.980
 That's the, the nice thing, as you mentioned, uh, before with, with Heidegger,

2:40:59.340 --> 2:41:06.780
 I really liked that idea. And I've seen that in people who are terminally ill is they bring,

2:41:06.780 --> 2:41:14.380
 you know, the idea of death becomes, uh, current. It becomes like a thing, you know, I could die.

2:41:14.380 --> 2:41:20.860
 I really liked that idea. I, I can die. Not just tomorrow, but like now, now, now.

2:41:20.860 --> 2:41:21.340
 Yeah.

2:41:21.340 --> 2:41:28.140
 Uh, that's a really useful, I don't even know. I think I've been too afraid to even think about

2:41:28.140 --> 2:41:34.380
 that. Like, like, like sit here and think like in five minutes,

2:41:34.380 --> 2:41:37.660
 in five minutes, it's over.

2:41:39.660 --> 2:41:41.660
 This is it. This is five minutes. It's over.

2:41:41.660 --> 2:41:49.020
 Yeah. So that would be my most recent addition as I really am struck by Heidegger.

2:41:50.300 --> 2:41:51.660
 Would you recommend that?

2:41:51.660 --> 2:41:53.420
 Well, okay. Well, if you have a few years,

2:41:53.420 --> 2:41:57.500
 I remember I tuned out being in time. I was like, I tried to read it. I was like, that's it.

2:41:57.500 --> 2:42:05.740
 It took me 40 years to read Ulysses that could not get past the first five pages. And it took

2:42:05.740 --> 2:42:09.660
 me 40 years to read being in time. It's a slog.

2:42:10.780 --> 2:42:18.700
 And I took a James Joyce course in college. So I've, uh, I, I even, uh, I, I guess read parts

2:42:18.700 --> 2:42:19.580
 of Finnegan's Wake.

2:42:19.580 --> 2:42:19.980
 No way.

2:42:20.620 --> 2:42:27.180
 But like, there's a difference between reading and like, I don't think I understood anything.

2:42:27.180 --> 2:42:30.780
 I like his, uh, short stories on the dead, the dead. Yeah.

2:42:30.780 --> 2:42:37.580
 Yeah. I love that. And, um, I like Faulkner, Absalom. Absalom is a, is a fine book.

2:42:37.580 --> 2:42:43.340
 But would you, uh, is there something Heidegger connected in a book you would recommend or no?

2:42:43.980 --> 2:42:50.540
 No. So maybe I got to abandon him. I mean, I mean, being in time is, is awesome. Um,

2:42:51.260 --> 2:42:55.420
 but here's an interesting thing and not to get all academic, but, you know, it's,

2:42:55.420 --> 2:43:01.900
 there's two parts to it. And most of the, most philosophers are preoccupied with the first part.

2:43:02.540 --> 2:43:09.820
 It's in the second part where he gets into all the flight from death stuff and this idea of,

2:43:09.820 --> 2:43:13.260
 you know, a turning and philosophers don't like that.

2:43:14.220 --> 2:43:19.420
 And I'm like, this is where he's starting to really shine, to really shine for me.

2:43:19.420 --> 2:43:27.820
 So, yeah. Yeah. All right. That's a beautiful set of books. So what, um, advice would you give to

2:43:27.820 --> 2:43:36.460
 a young person today about their career, about life, about, uh, how to survive in this world

2:43:36.460 --> 2:43:45.420
 full of suffering? Yeah. Great. Um, my advice is to get competent advice. That's what I tell my

2:43:45.420 --> 2:43:51.340
 students that don't listen to me. Don't listen to me. Well, you know, I think, um,

2:43:53.420 --> 2:44:01.020
 my, my big piece of advice these days is, you know, again, it's at the risk of sounding

2:44:01.660 --> 2:44:12.860
 like a simpleton, but it's to emphasize a few things. One is, um, you know,

2:44:12.860 --> 2:44:17.260
 so, uh, one of your questions I think was, you know, what's the meaning of life. And of course,

2:44:17.260 --> 2:44:24.060
 the existentialists say life has no meaning, but it doesn't follow from that, that it's intrinsic,

2:44:24.060 --> 2:44:29.820
 that it's meaningless. You know what the existential point is not that life is

2:44:30.620 --> 2:44:38.460
 meaningless so much as it doesn't have one inevitable and intrinsic meaning, you know,

2:44:38.460 --> 2:44:44.700
 which then it opens up, uh, you know, I think it was Kierkegaard who said consciousness gives us

2:44:44.700 --> 2:44:52.140
 the possibility of possibilities. And, but there's another lunatic Oswald Spangler who wrote a book

2:44:52.140 --> 2:44:59.100
 called, uh, decline of the West. And he says that the philosopher, the German philosopher Gerta,

2:44:59.820 --> 2:45:07.100
 he says, the purpose of life is to live. And I let that's, so that's one of my pieces of advice.

2:45:07.100 --> 2:45:12.060
 So the possibility of possibilities, it's interesting. So what do you do with this

2:45:12.060 --> 2:45:17.980
 kind of sea of possibilities? Like, well, this is one of the, when, when young folks

2:45:18.860 --> 2:45:24.940
 talk to me, especially these days, uh, is there swimming in a sea of possibilities?

2:45:24.940 --> 2:45:30.860
 Yeah. Well, so this is great. And so that's another existential point, which is that

2:45:30.860 --> 2:45:39.420
 we yearn for freedom. We react vigorously when we perceive that our choices have been curtailed

2:45:40.220 --> 2:45:46.380
 and then we're paralyzed by indecision in the wake of seemingly unlimited possibilities,

2:45:46.380 --> 2:45:53.980
 because we're not choking on choice. And, and I'm not sure if this is helpful advice or not,

2:45:53.980 --> 2:46:03.260
 but what I say to folks is that the fact of the matter is, is the, you know, for most people,

2:46:03.260 --> 2:46:16.220
 choice is a first world problem. And sometimes the best option is to do something as silly as

2:46:16.220 --> 2:46:21.500
 it sounds. And then if that doesn't work, do something else, which just sounds like my mom

2:46:21.500 --> 2:46:28.620
 torturing me, uh, when I was young. But you know, part of the thing that I find myself singularly

2:46:28.620 --> 2:46:37.980
 ill equipped is that we're at the, I may be at the tail end of the last generation of Americans

2:46:38.940 --> 2:46:44.220
 where you like picked something and that's what you did. Like I've been at a job for 40 years

2:46:45.100 --> 2:46:49.580
 where you can expect to do better than your parents cause those days are gone.

2:46:49.580 --> 2:46:50.780
 Yeah.

2:46:50.780 --> 2:46:59.500
 And where you can make a comfortable inference that the world in a decade or two will have any

2:46:59.500 --> 2:47:05.820
 remote similarity to the one that we now inhabit. And so.

2:47:05.820 --> 2:47:07.900
 But still you recommend just do.

2:47:08.620 --> 2:47:15.580
 Yeah. And to do so I'm again, I'm, this is, I'm so back to the Heidegger guy because,

2:47:15.580 --> 2:47:22.380
 all right, I may, you know, I consider myself a professor, but what happens if most of the

2:47:22.380 --> 2:47:28.860
 schools go out of business? Somebody else may consider themselves a restaurant tour,

2:47:28.860 --> 2:47:36.460
 but what happens if there's no more restaurants? So what I, this is negative advice, but I tell

2:47:36.460 --> 2:47:50.380
 folks, don't define yourself as a social caricature. Don't, don't limit how you feel about yourself by,

2:47:51.660 --> 2:48:01.180
 through identification with a host of variables that may be uncertain.

2:48:01.180 --> 2:48:02.220
 Maybe temporary.

2:48:02.220 --> 2:48:03.420
 And temporary.

2:48:03.420 --> 2:48:04.220
 What,

2:48:04.220 --> 2:48:08.380
 let's say. No, but of course that gets back to your point earlier, Lex, where you're like, yeah,

2:48:08.380 --> 2:48:13.980
 but when you step out of that, it's extraordinarily discombobulating.

2:48:15.420 --> 2:48:23.740
 So what, I think you talked about an ax of chopping wood and soul from Socrates.

2:48:23.740 --> 2:48:24.380
 Yeah.

2:48:24.380 --> 2:48:32.060
 What is your soul? What is the, the essence of Schellen?

2:48:33.260 --> 2:48:36.380
 Wow. That was like, awesome.

2:48:36.380 --> 2:48:41.500
 Like when God, when you, when you show up at the end of this thing, he kind of looks at you,

2:48:41.500 --> 2:48:45.180
 he's like, oh yeah, yeah, I remember you.

2:48:45.180 --> 2:48:51.500
 Yeah. Well, you know, I, to be honest, what I muse about,

2:48:51.500 --> 2:49:04.380
 is to me, the, when, when people are, I told you, I have to, we have two kids, late 20s, early 30s.

2:49:05.580 --> 2:49:13.660
 And over the years, when people, when we meet people that know our kids and they're like, oh,

2:49:13.660 --> 2:49:21.580
 your kids are kind and decent. And I'd be like, that's what I would like to be.

2:49:22.620 --> 2:49:27.740
 Because I think intelligence is vastly overrated. You know, the Unabomber was a smart guy.

2:49:27.740 --> 2:49:28.380
 Yeah.

2:49:28.380 --> 2:49:35.340
 And I do admire intelligence and I do venerate education and I find that to be

2:49:35.340 --> 2:49:42.140
 tremendously important. But if I had to pay the ultimate homage to myself,

2:49:43.340 --> 2:49:49.900
 it would be to be known as somebody who takes himself too seriously to take myself too seriously.

2:49:51.660 --> 2:50:01.020
 Again, as corny as it sounds, I'd like to leave the world a time when I can be known as somebody

2:50:01.020 --> 2:50:07.740
 who takes himself too seriously. Again, as corny as it sounds, I'd like to leave the world

2:50:09.020 --> 2:50:12.620
 a tad better than I found it, or at least do no harm.

2:50:14.300 --> 2:50:20.860
 And, I think you, I think you did all right in that, in that regard.

2:50:20.860 --> 2:50:24.620
 I love that question, Alex. That's a good one. I think everyone should be asked that.

2:50:25.260 --> 2:50:26.540
 What is your soul?

2:50:26.540 --> 2:50:30.300
 I think there's a lot of lingering questions around it.

2:50:33.420 --> 2:50:40.380
 So, I mean, on the point of the soul, you've talked about the meaning of life. Do you have,

2:50:45.100 --> 2:50:54.060
 on a personal level, do you have an answer to the meaning of your life, of something that brought you

2:50:54.060 --> 2:51:05.340
 meaning, happiness, some sense of sense?

2:51:09.100 --> 2:51:16.700
 No, I mean, yes and no. I mean, I'm 66, so I'm in the kind of

2:51:16.700 --> 2:51:25.500
 and not ready to wrap it up, literally or metaphorically, but you look, I look back and

2:51:27.420 --> 2:51:35.100
 just really with a sense of awe and wonder, gratitude, and

2:51:35.100 --> 2:51:39.580
 Is there memories that stand out to you from childhood, from earlier, that like,

2:51:39.580 --> 2:51:48.220
 it's like, you know, stand out as something you're really proud of or just happy to have been on this

2:51:48.220 --> 2:51:50.300
 earth, because that stuff happened.

2:51:50.300 --> 2:51:59.420
 Yeah, that. I mean, you know, my family, also a chunk, my folks, my grandparents are from Eastern

2:51:59.420 --> 2:52:08.620
 Europe, you know, Russia, Austria. As far as we know, some of them never made it out. I consider

2:52:08.620 --> 2:52:22.380
 myself very fortunate to have been a so called product of the American dream. You know, my

2:52:22.380 --> 2:52:32.700
 grandparents were basically peasants. My parents, my dad worked two full time jobs when I was growing

2:52:32.700 --> 2:52:37.100
 up, and I would see him on the weekends. I'd be like, why are you working all the time? He'd be

2:52:37.100 --> 2:52:45.900
 like, so you won't have to. And he said, Look, the world does not owe you a living. And so your first

2:52:45.900 --> 2:52:54.940
 responsibility is to take care of yourself. And then your next responsibility is to take care of

2:52:54.940 --> 2:53:03.100
 other people. And I think you did a pretty good job with that. I don't know. But I so that those

2:53:03.100 --> 2:53:07.740
 are the things that I'm proud of.

2:53:07.740 --> 2:53:16.540
 Well, it's funny. You've been, you've talked about just yourself as a human being. But you've

2:53:16.540 --> 2:53:27.980
 also contributed some really important ideas for your ideas and also kind of integrating and maybe

2:53:27.980 --> 2:53:34.380
 even popularizing the work of Ernest Becker of connecting it of making it legitimate scientifically.

2:53:34.380 --> 2:53:43.020
 I mean, you know, as a human, of course, you want to be you want your ripple to be one that makes the

2:53:43.020 --> 2:53:51.340
 world a better place. But also, I think, in the span of time, I think it's of great value. You've

2:53:51.340 --> 2:53:57.500
 contributed in terms of how we think about the human condition, how we think about ourselves,

2:53:57.500 --> 2:54:04.300
 assuming as finite beings in this world. And I hope also in our technology of engineering

2:54:04.300 --> 2:54:11.180
 intelligence, I think, at least, at least for me, and I'm sure there's a lot of other people

2:54:11.820 --> 2:54:15.580
 like me that your work has been a gift for so well, thank you.

2:54:15.580 --> 2:54:22.380
 Oh, I like that. And we have described ourselves as giant interneurons. I'm like,

2:54:22.380 --> 2:54:29.580
 we have had no original ideas. And maybe that's the only thing that's original about our work is

2:54:29.580 --> 2:54:37.820
 we don't claim to be original. What we claim to have done is to integrate and to connect

2:54:38.940 --> 2:54:45.180
 these disparate and superficially unconnected discourses, you know, so existentialists,

2:54:45.180 --> 2:54:52.780
 they'd be like, evidence? What's that? And yeah, there's now a branch of psychology, experimental,

2:54:52.780 --> 2:55:01.100
 existential psychology that I think we could take credit for having encouraged the formation of.

2:55:02.380 --> 2:55:10.060
 And that, in turn, has gotten these ideas in circulation and academic communities where they

2:55:10.060 --> 2:55:17.500
 may not have otherwise gotten. So I think that's good. Well, Sheldon, it's a huge honor. I can't

2:55:17.500 --> 2:55:25.020
 believe you came down here. I've been a fan of your work. I hope we get to talk again. Huge honor

2:55:25.020 --> 2:55:28.140
 to talk to you. Thank you so much for talking today. Thanks, Lex. We'll do it again soon, I hope.

2:55:56.780 --> 2:56:04.380
 uses in his book, Warm at the Core. The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us

2:56:04.380 --> 2:56:09.980
 that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness.

2:56:09.980 --> 2:56:26.940
 Thanks for listening, and hope to see you next time.
