00:00.000 --> 00:02.460
 The following is a conversation with Peter White,

00:02.460 --> 00:04.720
 a theoretical physicist at Columbia,

00:04.720 --> 00:06.640
 outspoken critic of string theory,

00:06.640 --> 00:10.000
 and the author of the popular physics and mathematics blog

00:10.000 --> 00:12.480
 called Not Even Wrong.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.600
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.580
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:17.580 --> 00:18.760
 in the description.

00:18.760 --> 00:22.380
 And now, here's my conversation with Peter White.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.360
 You're both a physicist and a mathematician.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.020
 So let me ask, what is the difference

00:29.020 --> 00:31.680
 between physics and mathematics?

00:31.680 --> 00:33.800
 Well, there's kind of a conventional understanding

00:33.800 --> 00:37.280
 of the subject that they're two quite different things.

00:37.280 --> 00:41.600
 So that mathematics is about making rigorous statements

00:41.600 --> 00:45.600
 about these abstract things,

00:45.600 --> 00:48.360
 things of mathematics, and proving them rigorously.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.000
 And physics is about doing experiments

00:51.000 --> 00:53.940
 and testing various models and that.

00:53.940 --> 00:55.880
 But I think the more interesting thing

00:55.880 --> 01:00.840
 is that there's a wide variety of what people do

01:00.840 --> 01:02.520
 as mathematics, what they do as physics,

01:02.520 --> 01:04.040
 and there's a significant overlap.

01:04.040 --> 01:09.000
 And that, I think, is actually a very interesting area.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.600
 And if you go back kind of far enough in history

01:12.600 --> 01:15.760
 and look at figures like Newton or something,

01:15.760 --> 01:17.280
 at that point, you can't really tell,

01:17.280 --> 01:19.880
 was Newton a physicist or a mathematician?

01:19.880 --> 01:21.700
 Mathematicians will tell you he was a mathematician.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.380
 The physicists will tell you he was a physicist.

01:23.380 --> 01:26.040
 But he would say he's a philosopher.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.880
 Yeah, that's interesting.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.400
 But yeah, anyway, there was kind of no such distinction

01:32.400 --> 01:35.000
 then that's more of a modern thing.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.100
 But anyway, I think these days,

01:36.100 --> 01:38.080
 there's a very interesting space in between the two.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.820
 So in the story of the 20th century

01:40.820 --> 01:42.360
 and the early 21st century,

01:42.360 --> 01:44.640
 what is the overlap between mathematics and physics,

01:44.640 --> 01:45.960
 would you say?

01:45.960 --> 01:49.800
 Well, I think it's actually become very, very complicated.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.520
 I think it's really interesting to see

01:51.520 --> 01:54.280
 a lot of what my colleagues in the math department

01:54.280 --> 01:56.880
 are doing, most of what they're doing,

01:56.880 --> 01:58.140
 they're doing all sorts of different things,

01:58.140 --> 02:00.360
 but most of them have some kind of overlap

02:00.360 --> 02:02.360
 with physics or other.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.840
 So, I mean, I'm personally interested

02:03.840 --> 02:06.640
 in one particular aspect of this overlap,

02:06.640 --> 02:09.680
 which I think has a lot to do with the most fundamental ideas

02:09.680 --> 02:12.040
 about physics and about mathematics.

02:12.040 --> 02:17.040
 But you kind of see this really everywhere at this point.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.480
 Which particular overlap are you looking at, group theory?

02:20.480 --> 02:24.440
 Yeah, so at least the way it seems to me

02:24.440 --> 02:25.520
 that if you look at physics

02:25.520 --> 02:29.960
 and look at our most successful laws of fundamental physics,

02:29.960 --> 02:33.480
 they have a certain kind of mathematical structure,

02:33.480 --> 02:36.240
 it's based upon certain kind of mathematical objects

02:36.240 --> 02:38.800
 and geometry, connections and curvature,

02:38.800 --> 02:41.720
 the spinners, the Dirac equation.

02:41.720 --> 02:46.720
 And this very deep mathematics provides kind of a unifying

02:47.720 --> 02:50.480
 set of ways of thinking that allow you

02:50.480 --> 02:52.720
 to make a unified theory of physics.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.480
 But the interesting thing is that if you go to mathematics

02:55.480 --> 02:58.440
 and look at what's been going on in mathematics

02:58.440 --> 03:02.640
 the last 50, 100 years, and even especially recently,

03:02.640 --> 03:06.720
 there's a similarly some kind of unifying ideas

03:06.720 --> 03:08.840
 which bring together different areas of mathematics

03:08.840 --> 03:11.680
 and which have been established in the last 50, 100 years.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.680
 Especially powerful in number theory recently.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.720
 And there's a book, for instance, by Edward Frankel

03:17.720 --> 03:19.240
 about love and math.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.320
 Yeah, that book's great, I recommend it highly.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.160
 It's partially accessible.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.800
 But there's a nice audio book that I listened to

03:27.800 --> 03:31.920
 while running an exceptionally long distance,

03:31.920 --> 03:35.500
 like across the San Francisco bridge.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.940
 And there's something magic about the way he writes about it.

03:38.940 --> 03:40.520
 But some of the group theory in there

03:40.520 --> 03:42.240
 is a little bit difficult.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.000
 Yeah, that's the problem with any of these things,

03:44.000 --> 03:45.960
 to kind of really say what's going on

03:45.960 --> 03:48.880
 and make it accessible is very hard.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.360
 He, in this book and elsewhere, I think takes the attitude

03:52.360 --> 03:54.440
 that kinds of mathematics he's interested in

03:54.440 --> 03:57.080
 and that he's talking about provide

03:57.080 --> 03:59.240
 kind of a grand unified theory of mathematics.

03:59.240 --> 04:03.160
 They bring together geometry and number theory

04:03.160 --> 04:06.840
 and representation theory, a lot of different ideas

04:06.840 --> 04:09.700
 in a really unexpected way.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.440
 But I think, to me, the most fascinating thing

04:11.440 --> 04:13.840
 is if you look at the kind of grand unified theory

04:13.840 --> 04:15.440
 of mathematics he's talking about

04:15.440 --> 04:17.520
 and you look at the physicist kind of ideas

04:17.520 --> 04:19.800
 about unification, it's more or less

04:19.800 --> 04:22.600
 the same mathematical objects are appearing in both.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.880
 So it's this, I think there's a really,

04:24.880 --> 04:26.440
 we're seeing a really strong indication

04:26.440 --> 04:30.240
 that the deepest ideas that we're discovering about physics

04:30.240 --> 04:32.400
 and some of the deepest ideas that mathematicians

04:32.400 --> 04:36.120
 are learning about are really, are intimately connected.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.840
 Is there something, like if I was five years old

04:38.840 --> 04:40.640
 and you were trying to explain this to me,

04:40.640 --> 04:43.720
 is there ways to try to sneak up

04:43.720 --> 04:47.400
 to what this unified world of mathematics looks like?

04:47.400 --> 04:50.200
 You said number theory, you said geometry,

04:50.200 --> 04:52.520
 words like topology.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.520
 What does this universe begin to look like?

04:54.520 --> 04:57.500
 Are these, what should we imagine in our mind?

04:57.500 --> 05:00.840
 Is it a three dimensional surface?

05:00.840 --> 05:03.240
 And we're trying to say something about it.

05:03.240 --> 05:07.320
 Is it triangles and squares and cubes?

05:07.320 --> 05:09.460
 Like what are we supposed to imagine in our minds?

05:09.460 --> 05:10.560
 Is this natural number?

05:10.560 --> 05:13.880
 What's a good thing to try to,

05:13.880 --> 05:16.800
 for people that don't know any of these tools

05:16.800 --> 05:19.000
 except maybe some basic calculus and geometry

05:19.000 --> 05:22.240
 from high school that they should keep in their minds

05:22.240 --> 05:24.860
 as to the unified world of mathematics

05:24.860 --> 05:29.860
 that also allows us to explore the unified world of physics.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.120
 I mean, what I find kind of remarkable about this

05:33.120 --> 05:38.120
 is the way in which these, we've discovered these ideas,

05:38.200 --> 05:40.240
 but they're actually quite alien

05:40.240 --> 05:42.440
 to our everyday understanding.

05:42.440 --> 05:45.640
 We grow up in this three spatial dimensional world

05:45.640 --> 05:47.480
 and we have intimate understanding

05:47.480 --> 05:50.440
 of certain kinds of geometry and certain kinds of things.

05:50.440 --> 05:53.520
 But these things that we've discovered

05:53.520 --> 05:56.060
 in both math and physics are,

05:56.060 --> 05:58.300
 that they're not at all close,

05:58.300 --> 05:59.800
 have any obvious connection

05:59.800 --> 06:02.040
 to kind of human everyday experience.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.160
 They're really quite different.

06:03.160 --> 06:06.040
 And I can say some of my initial fascination with this

06:06.040 --> 06:08.400
 when I was young and starting to learn about it

06:08.400 --> 06:13.400
 was actually exactly this kind of arcane nature

06:14.160 --> 06:15.000
 of these things.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.420
 It was a little bit like being told,

06:17.420 --> 06:21.040
 well, there are these kind of semi mystical experience

06:21.040 --> 06:24.340
 that you can acquire by a long study and whatever,

06:24.340 --> 06:27.000
 except that it was actually true.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.560
 There's actually evidence that this actually works.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.000
 So I'm a little bit wary of trying to give people

06:33.000 --> 06:33.840
 that kind of thing,

06:33.840 --> 06:35.200
 because I think it's mostly misleading.

06:35.200 --> 06:39.880
 But one thing to say is that geometry is a large part of it.

06:39.880 --> 06:43.280
 And maybe one interesting thing to say very,

06:43.280 --> 06:45.800
 that's about more recent, some of the most recent ideas

06:45.800 --> 06:48.440
 is that when we think about the geometry

06:48.440 --> 06:50.040
 of our space and time,

06:50.040 --> 06:53.640
 it's kind of three spatial and one time dimension.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.760
 It's a physics is in some sense

06:56.760 --> 07:00.760
 about something that's kind of four dimensional in a way.

07:00.760 --> 07:03.720
 And a really interesting thing about

07:03.720 --> 07:06.160
 some of the recent developments and number theory

07:06.160 --> 07:09.960
 have been to realize that these ideas

07:09.960 --> 07:12.760
 that we were looking at naturally fit into a context

07:12.760 --> 07:15.860
 where your theory is kind of four dimensional.

07:15.860 --> 07:19.840
 So, geometry is a big part of this

07:19.840 --> 07:22.160
 and we know a lot and feel a lot about

07:22.160 --> 07:24.600
 two, one, two, three dimensional geometry.

07:24.600 --> 07:28.100
 So wait a minute, so we can at least rely

07:28.100 --> 07:31.520
 on the four dimensions of space and time

07:31.520 --> 07:32.920
 and say that we can get pretty far

07:32.920 --> 07:35.640
 by working in those four dimensions.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.700
 I thought you were gonna scare me

07:36.700 --> 07:39.000
 that we're gonna have to go to many, many, many,

07:39.000 --> 07:40.640
 many more dimensions than that.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.360
 My point of view, which goes against

07:43.360 --> 07:44.800
 a lot of these ideas about unification

07:44.800 --> 07:46.440
 is that no, this is really,

07:47.320 --> 07:50.560
 everything we know about really is about four dimensions

07:50.560 --> 07:54.800
 and that you can actually understand a lot of these

07:54.800 --> 07:56.840
 structures that we've been seeing in fundamental physics

07:56.840 --> 08:01.480
 and in number theory, just in terms of four dimensions,

08:01.480 --> 08:05.400
 that it's kind of, it's in some sense I would claim

08:05.400 --> 08:09.040
 has been a really, has been kind of a mistake

08:09.040 --> 08:12.880
 that physicists have made for decades and decades

08:12.880 --> 08:16.560
 to try to go to higher dimensions,

08:16.560 --> 08:19.040
 to try to formulate a theory in higher dimensions

08:19.040 --> 08:21.600
 and then you're stuck with the problem

08:21.600 --> 08:23.400
 of how do you get rid of all these extra dimensions

08:23.400 --> 08:25.080
 that you've created

08:25.080 --> 08:27.440
 because we only ever see anything in four dimensions.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.920
 That kind of thing leaves us astray, you think?

08:29.920 --> 08:31.960
 So creating all these extra dimensions

08:31.960 --> 08:34.620
 just to give yourself extra degrees of freedom.

08:35.800 --> 08:38.360
 Isn't that the process of mathematics

08:38.360 --> 08:41.280
 is to create all of these trajectories for yourself

08:41.280 --> 08:45.920
 but eventually you have to end up at the final place

08:45.920 --> 08:50.920
 but it's okay to sort of create abstract objects

08:52.600 --> 08:55.880
 on your path to proving something.

08:55.880 --> 08:59.640
 Yeah, certainly and from a mathematician's point of view,

08:59.640 --> 09:01.360
 I mean, the kinds of,

09:01.360 --> 09:03.440
 mathematicians also are very different than physicists

09:03.440 --> 09:06.040
 in that we like to develop very general theories.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.200
 We like to, if we have an idea,

09:07.200 --> 09:09.680
 we want to see what's the greatest generality

09:09.680 --> 09:11.140
 in which you can talk about it.

09:11.140 --> 09:14.200
 So from the point of view of most of the ways geometry

09:14.200 --> 09:17.040
 is formulated by mathematicians,

09:17.040 --> 09:19.080
 it really doesn't matter, it works in any dimension.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.120
 We can do one, two, three, four, any number.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.860
 There's no particular, for most of geometry,

09:24.860 --> 09:28.240
 there's no particular special thing about four.

09:28.240 --> 09:33.240
 But anyway, but what physicists have been trying to do

09:33.240 --> 09:35.800
 over the years is try to understand

09:35.800 --> 09:38.320
 these fundamental theories in a geometrical way

09:38.320 --> 09:41.960
 and it's very tempting to kind of just start bringing in

09:41.960 --> 09:46.200
 extra dimensions and using them to explain the structure.

09:46.200 --> 09:51.200
 But typically this attempt kind of founders

09:51.320 --> 09:53.340
 because you just don't know,

09:53.340 --> 09:57.140
 you end up not being able to explain why we only see four.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.800
 It is nice in the space of physics

10:01.800 --> 10:04.520
 that like if you look at Fermat's last theorem,

10:04.520 --> 10:06.680
 it's much easier to prove that there's no solution

10:06.680 --> 10:11.680
 for n equals three than it is for the general case.

10:12.120 --> 10:16.360
 And so I guess that's the nice benefit of being a physicist

10:16.360 --> 10:18.640
 is you don't have to worry about the general case

10:18.640 --> 10:22.160
 because we live in a universe with n equals four

10:22.160 --> 10:23.440
 in this case.

10:23.440 --> 10:27.880
 Yeah, physicists are very interested in saying something

10:27.880 --> 10:31.440
 about specific examples and I find that interesting

10:31.440 --> 10:33.760
 when I'm trying to do things in mathematics

10:33.760 --> 10:36.920
 and I'm even teaching courses into mathematics students,

10:36.920 --> 10:40.200
 I find that I'm teaching them in a different way

10:40.200 --> 10:43.880
 than most mathematicians because I'm very often

10:43.880 --> 10:47.800
 very focused on examples on what's kind of the crucial

10:47.800 --> 10:52.480
 example that shows how this powerful new mathematical

10:52.480 --> 10:55.680
 technique, how it works and why you would want to do it.

10:55.680 --> 11:00.040
 And I'm less interested in kind of proving a precise theorem

11:00.040 --> 11:01.400
 about exactly when it's gonna work

11:01.400 --> 11:02.440
 and when it's not gonna work.

11:02.440 --> 11:05.160
 Do you usually think about really simple examples,

11:05.160 --> 11:09.080
 like both for teaching and when you try to solve

11:09.080 --> 11:12.160
 a difficult problem, do you construct the simplest

11:12.160 --> 11:14.360
 possible examples that captures the fundamentals

11:14.360 --> 11:15.720
 of the problem and try to solve it?

11:15.720 --> 11:19.640
 Yeah, exactly, that's often a really fruitful way

11:19.640 --> 11:22.520
 to if you've got some idea to just kind of try

11:22.520 --> 11:27.000
 to boil it down to what's the simplest situation

11:27.000 --> 11:28.680
 in which this kind of thing is gonna happen

11:28.680 --> 11:31.320
 and then try to really understand that and understand that

11:31.320 --> 11:33.520
 and that is almost always a really good way

11:33.520 --> 11:34.480
 to get insight into it.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.720
 Do you work with paper and pen or like, for example,

11:37.720 --> 11:41.560
 for me coming from the programming side,

11:41.560 --> 11:43.880
 if I look at a model, if I look at some kind

11:43.880 --> 11:47.360
 of mathematical object, I like to mess around

11:47.360 --> 11:49.600
 with it sort of numerically.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.600
 I just visualize different parts of it,

11:51.600 --> 11:54.160
 visualize however I can so most of the work

11:54.160 --> 11:56.160
 is like when you're on networks, for example,

11:56.160 --> 11:59.360
 is you try to play with the simplest possible example

11:59.360 --> 12:04.360
 and just to build up intuition by any kind of object

12:04.440 --> 12:07.280
 has a bunch of variables in it and you start

12:07.280 --> 12:09.040
 to mess around with them in different ways

12:09.040 --> 12:10.480
 and visualize in different ways to start

12:10.480 --> 12:14.720
 to build intuition or do you go the Einstein route

12:14.720 --> 12:19.160
 and just imagine everything inside your mind

12:19.160 --> 12:21.200
 and sort of build thought experiments

12:21.200 --> 12:24.840
 and then work purely on paper and pen?

12:24.840 --> 12:28.120
 Well, the problem with this kind of stuff

12:28.120 --> 12:31.880
 I'm interested in is you rarely can kind of,

12:31.880 --> 12:34.780
 it's rarely something that is really kind of,

12:34.780 --> 12:38.600
 or even the simplest example, you can kind of see

12:38.600 --> 12:40.800
 what's going on by looking at something happening

12:40.800 --> 12:42.240
 in three dimensions.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.600
 There's generally the structures involved

12:44.600 --> 12:47.960
 are either they're more abstract

12:47.960 --> 12:50.720
 or if you try to kind of embed them in some kind of space

12:50.720 --> 12:53.800
 and where you could manipulate them

12:53.800 --> 12:55.200
 in some kind of geometrical way,

12:55.200 --> 12:57.320
 it's gonna be a much higher dimensional space.

12:57.320 --> 13:00.080
 So even simple examples,

13:00.080 --> 13:02.080
 the embedding them into three dimensional space,

13:02.080 --> 13:03.040
 you're losing a lot.

13:03.040 --> 13:06.960
 Yeah, but to capture what you're trying to understand

13:06.960 --> 13:09.720
 about them, you have to go to four or more dimensions.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.000
 So it starts to get to be hard to,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.680
 I mean, you can train yourself to try it as much

13:14.680 --> 13:18.200
 as to kind of think about things in your mind

13:18.200 --> 13:21.000
 and I often use pad and paper

13:21.000 --> 13:24.360
 and often if I'm in my office, I have to use the blackboard

13:25.480 --> 13:26.920
 and you are kind of drawing things

13:26.920 --> 13:29.600
 but they're really kind of more abstract representations

13:29.600 --> 13:32.560
 of how things are supposed to fit together

13:32.560 --> 13:35.240
 and they're not really, unfortunately,

13:35.240 --> 13:37.640
 not just kind of really living in three dimensions

13:37.640 --> 13:39.200
 where you can.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.620
 Are we supposed to be sad or excited

13:41.620 --> 13:43.160
 by the fact that our human minds

13:43.160 --> 13:45.040
 can't fully comprehend the kind of mathematics

13:45.040 --> 13:46.000
 you're talking about?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.760
 I mean, what do we make of that?

13:48.760 --> 13:50.740
 I mean, to me, that makes you quite sad.

13:50.740 --> 13:53.960
 It makes it seem like there's a giant mystery out there

13:53.960 --> 13:58.320
 that we'll never truly get to experience directly.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.720
 It is kind of sad how difficult this is.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.680
 I mean, or I would put it a different way

14:03.680 --> 14:06.600
 that most questions that people have

14:06.600 --> 14:08.640
 about this kind of thing,

14:08.640 --> 14:12.240
 you can give them a really true answer

14:12.240 --> 14:13.080
 and really understand it

14:13.080 --> 14:16.580
 but the problem is one more of time.

14:16.580 --> 14:20.360
 It's like, yes, I could explain to you how this works

14:20.360 --> 14:23.040
 but you'd have to be willing to sit down with me

14:23.040 --> 14:28.000
 and work at this repeatedly for hours and days and weeks

14:28.000 --> 14:31.540
 and it's just gonna take that long for your mind

14:31.540 --> 14:34.360
 to really wrap itself around what's going on

14:34.360 --> 14:39.360
 and so that does make things inaccessible which is sad

14:40.560 --> 14:43.000
 but it's just kind of part of life

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
 that we all have a limited amount of time

14:45.000 --> 14:49.760
 and we have to decide what we're gonna spend our time doing.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.280
 Speaking of a limited amount of time,

14:52.280 --> 14:55.640
 we only have a few hours, maybe a few days together

14:55.640 --> 14:56.840
 here on this podcast.

14:57.760 --> 15:02.320
 Let me ask you the question of amongst many of the ideas

15:02.320 --> 15:05.280
 that you work on in mathematics and physics,

15:05.280 --> 15:07.560
 which is the most beautiful idea

15:07.560 --> 15:11.200
 or one of the most beautiful ideas, maybe a surprising idea

15:11.200 --> 15:13.960
 and once again, unfortunately, the way life works,

15:13.960 --> 15:15.680
 we only have a limited time together

15:15.680 --> 15:18.440
 to try to convey such an idea.

15:18.440 --> 15:22.520
 Okay, well, actually, let me just tell you something which

15:22.520 --> 15:25.260
 I'm tempted to kind of start trying to explain

15:25.260 --> 15:26.980
 what I think is this most powerful idea

15:26.980 --> 15:28.600
 that brings together math and physics,

15:28.600 --> 15:31.060
 ideas about groups and representations

15:31.060 --> 15:33.200
 and how it fits in quantum mechanics

15:33.200 --> 15:35.560
 but in some sense, I wrote a whole textbook about that

15:35.560 --> 15:37.440
 and I don't think we really have time

15:37.440 --> 15:39.080
 to get very far into it so.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.320
 Well, can I actually, on a small tangent,

15:41.320 --> 15:43.600
 you did write a paper towards a grant unified theory

15:43.600 --> 15:47.840
 mathematics and physics, maybe you could step there first,

15:47.840 --> 15:49.520
 what is the key idea in that paper?

15:49.520 --> 15:51.480
 Well, I think we've kind of gone over that.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.560
 I think that the key idea is what we were talking about

15:53.560 --> 15:58.360
 earlier that just kind of a claim that if you look

15:58.360 --> 16:01.400
 and see what have been successful ideas in unification

16:01.400 --> 16:05.160
 in physics and over the last 50 years or so

16:05.160 --> 16:07.760
 and what's been happening in mathematics

16:07.760 --> 16:10.800
 and the kind of thing that Frankel's book is about

16:10.800 --> 16:13.000
 that these are very much the same kind of mathematics

16:13.000 --> 16:16.420
 and so it's kind of an argument that there really is,

16:16.420 --> 16:19.720
 you shouldn't be looking to unify just math

16:19.720 --> 16:23.140
 or just fundamental physics but taking inspiration

16:23.140 --> 16:25.560
 for looking for new ideas in fundamental physics

16:25.560 --> 16:27.380
 that they are gonna be in the same direction

16:27.380 --> 16:30.200
 of getting deeper into mathematics

16:30.200 --> 16:33.280
 and looking for more inspiration in mathematics

16:33.280 --> 16:37.320
 from these successful ideas about fundamental physics.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.480
 Could you put words to sort of the disciplines

16:39.480 --> 16:40.400
 we're trying to unify?

16:40.400 --> 16:42.920
 So you said number theory, are we literally talking

16:42.920 --> 16:45.040
 about all the major fields of mathematics?

16:45.040 --> 16:48.280
 So it's like the number theory, geometry,

16:48.280 --> 16:51.040
 so the differential geometry, topology.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.440
 Yeah, so the, I mean, one name for this

16:55.400 --> 16:57.600
 that this is acquired in mathematics

16:57.600 --> 16:59.760
 is the so called Langlands program

16:59.760 --> 17:01.960
 and so this started out in mathematics.

17:01.960 --> 17:05.120
 It's that Robert Langlands kind of realized

17:05.120 --> 17:07.480
 that a lot of what people were doing

17:07.480 --> 17:11.080
 and that was starting to be really successful

17:11.080 --> 17:13.600
 in number theory in the 60s

17:13.600 --> 17:17.800
 and so that this actually was,

17:18.960 --> 17:21.160
 anyway, that this could be thought of

17:21.160 --> 17:24.120
 in terms of these ideas about symmetry

17:24.120 --> 17:26.100
 and groups and representations

17:26.100 --> 17:29.600
 and in a way that was also close

17:29.600 --> 17:32.020
 to some ideas about geometry

17:32.020 --> 17:35.200
 and then more later on in the 80s, 90s,

17:35.200 --> 17:38.120
 there was something called geometric Langlands

17:38.120 --> 17:40.500
 that people realize that you could take

17:40.500 --> 17:43.120
 what people have been doing in number theory in Langlands

17:43.120 --> 17:45.560
 and get rid, just forget about the number theory

17:45.560 --> 17:48.000
 and ask what is this telling you about geometry

17:48.000 --> 17:49.960
 and you get a whole, some new insights

17:49.960 --> 17:52.360
 into certain kinds of geometry that way.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.860
 So it's, anyway, that's kind of the name

17:54.860 --> 17:58.080
 for this area is Langlands and geometric Langlands

17:58.080 --> 17:59.680
 and just recently in the last few months,

17:59.680 --> 18:02.760
 there's been, there's kind of really major paper

18:02.760 --> 18:06.660
 that appeared by Peter Schultze and Laurent Farg

18:06.660 --> 18:11.040
 where they made some serious advance

18:11.040 --> 18:16.000
 to try to understand very much kind of a local problem

18:16.000 --> 18:17.960
 of what happens in number theory

18:17.960 --> 18:19.760
 near a certain prime number

18:19.760 --> 18:22.060
 and they turned this into a problem

18:22.060 --> 18:26.040
 of exactly the kind that geometric Langlands people

18:26.040 --> 18:28.880
 had been doing, this kind of pure geometry problem

18:28.880 --> 18:32.360
 and they found by generalizing mathematics,

18:32.360 --> 18:34.280
 they could actually reformulate it in that way

18:34.280 --> 18:36.680
 and it worked perfectly well.

18:36.680 --> 18:41.680
 One of the things that makes me sad is I'm a pretty

18:42.760 --> 18:46.440
 knowledgeable person and then, what is it?

18:46.440 --> 18:48.280
 At least I'm in the neighborhood

18:48.280 --> 18:50.480
 like theoretical computer science, right?

18:50.480 --> 18:52.320
 And it's still way out of my reach

18:52.320 --> 18:54.960
 and so many people talk about like Langlands, for example,

18:54.960 --> 18:57.640
 is one of the most brilliant people in mathematics

18:57.640 --> 18:59.960
 and just really admire his work

18:59.960 --> 19:03.720
 and I can't, it's like almost I can't hear the music

19:03.720 --> 19:05.820
 that he composed and it makes me sad.

19:05.820 --> 19:09.000
 Yeah, well, I mean, I think unfortunately,

19:09.000 --> 19:13.200
 it's not just you, it's I think even most mathematicians

19:13.200 --> 19:15.080
 have no, really don't actually understand

19:15.080 --> 19:15.920
 what this is about.

19:15.920 --> 19:19.400
 I mean, the group of people who really understand

19:19.400 --> 19:21.040
 all these ideas and so for instance,

19:21.040 --> 19:24.040
 this paper of Schultz and Farg that I was talking about,

19:24.040 --> 19:26.320
 the number of people who really actually understand

19:26.320 --> 19:31.000
 how that works is anyway, very, very small

19:31.000 --> 19:35.200
 and so I think even you find if you talk to mathematicians

19:35.200 --> 19:38.000
 and physicists, even they will often feel that,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.320
 there's this really interesting sounding stuff going on

19:40.320 --> 19:42.840
 and which I should be able to understand,

19:42.840 --> 19:44.960
 it's kind of in my own field, I have a PhD in

19:44.960 --> 19:48.360
 but it still seems pretty clearly far beyond me right now.

19:49.780 --> 19:52.640
 Well, if we can step into the back to the question

19:52.640 --> 19:56.320
 of beauty, is there an idea that maybe

19:56.320 --> 19:59.560
 is a little bit smaller that you find beautiful

19:59.560 --> 20:02.040
 in the space of mathematics or physics?

20:02.040 --> 20:05.320
 There's an idea that I kind of went, got a physics PhD

20:05.320 --> 20:07.120
 and spent a lot of time learning about mathematics

20:07.120 --> 20:10.000
 and I guess it was embarrassing

20:10.000 --> 20:11.720
 that I hadn't really actually understand

20:11.720 --> 20:15.560
 this very simple idea until I kind of learned it

20:15.560 --> 20:18.160
 when I actually started teaching math classes,

20:18.160 --> 20:23.160
 which is maybe that there's a simple way

20:23.320 --> 20:24.840
 to explain kind of the fundamental way

20:24.840 --> 20:28.080
 in which algebra and geometry are connected.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.680
 So you normally think of geometry as about these spaces

20:31.680 --> 20:35.000
 and these points and you think of algebra

20:35.000 --> 20:38.800
 as this very abstract thing about these abstract objects

20:38.800 --> 20:40.680
 that satisfy certain kinds of relations,

20:40.680 --> 20:44.360
 you can multiply them and add them and do stuff

20:44.360 --> 20:45.960
 but it's completely abstract,

20:45.960 --> 20:47.720
 there's nothing geometric about it

20:47.720 --> 20:51.680
 but the kind of really fundamental idea

20:51.680 --> 20:54.680
 is that unifies algebra and geometry

20:54.680 --> 20:58.800
 is to think whenever anybody gives you

20:58.800 --> 21:01.920
 what you call an algebra, some abstract thing

21:01.920 --> 21:04.280
 of things that you can multiply and add

21:04.280 --> 21:06.400
 that you should ask yourself,

21:06.400 --> 21:10.640
 is that algebra the space of functions on some geometry?

21:10.640 --> 21:12.560
 So one of the most surprising examples of this,

21:12.560 --> 21:16.840
 for instance, is a standard kind of thing

21:16.840 --> 21:18.640
 that seems to have nothing to do with geometry

21:18.640 --> 21:21.920
 is the integers.

21:21.920 --> 21:26.920
 So you can multiply them and add them, it's an algebra

21:26.920 --> 21:31.000
 but it seems to have nothing to do with geometry

21:31.000 --> 21:32.160
 but what you can, it turns out,

21:32.160 --> 21:33.720
 but if you ask yourself this question

21:33.720 --> 21:36.240
 and ask, you know, are integers,

21:36.240 --> 21:37.760
 can you think, if somebody gives you an integer,

21:37.760 --> 21:40.800
 can you think of it as a function on some space,

21:40.800 --> 21:42.200
 on some geometry?

21:42.200 --> 21:44.280
 And it turns out that yes, you can

21:44.280 --> 21:47.240
 and the space is the space of prime numbers

21:47.240 --> 21:48.600
 and so what you do is you just,

21:48.600 --> 21:50.400
 if somebody gives you an integer,

21:50.400 --> 21:53.120
 you can make a function on the prime numbers

21:53.120 --> 21:56.960
 by just, you know, at each prime number taking that,

21:56.960 --> 21:58.880
 that integer modulo that prime.

21:58.880 --> 22:02.480
 So if you say, I don't know, if you're given 10,

22:02.480 --> 22:05.560
 you know, 10 and you ask, what is its value at two?

22:05.560 --> 22:09.600
 Well, it's five times two, so mod two, it's zero,

22:09.600 --> 22:10.640
 so it's zero one.

22:10.640 --> 22:13.640
 What is its value at three?

22:13.640 --> 22:17.400
 Well, it's nine plus one, so it's one mod three.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.920
 So it's zero at two, it's one at three

22:19.920 --> 22:21.880
 and you can kind of keep going.

22:21.880 --> 22:26.880
 And so this is really kind of a truly fundamental idea.

22:26.960 --> 22:29.240
 It's at the basis of what's called algebraic geometry

22:29.240 --> 22:31.400
 and it just links these two parts of mathematics

22:31.400 --> 22:32.920
 that look completely different

22:32.920 --> 22:35.120
 and it's just an incredibly powerful idea

22:35.120 --> 22:37.240
 and so much of mathematics emerges

22:37.240 --> 22:39.760
 from this kind of simple relation.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.760
 So you're talking about mapping

22:41.760 --> 22:44.720
 from one discrete space to another.

22:44.720 --> 22:49.600
 So for a second, I thought perhaps mapping

22:49.600 --> 22:51.600
 like a continuous space to a discrete space,

22:51.600 --> 22:56.320
 like functions over a continuous space, because yeah.

22:56.320 --> 23:00.000
 Well, I mean, you can take, if somebody gives you a space,

23:00.000 --> 23:03.200
 you can ask, you can say, well, let's,

23:03.200 --> 23:05.240
 and this is also, this is part of the same idea.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.000
 The part of the same idea is that if you try

23:07.000 --> 23:10.560
 and do geometry and somebody tells you, here's a space,

23:10.560 --> 23:11.920
 that what you should do is you should wait,

23:11.920 --> 23:12.760
 so say, wait a minute,

23:12.760 --> 23:15.760
 maybe I should be trying to solve this using algebra.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.280
 And so if I do that, the way to start is,

23:18.280 --> 23:19.680
 you give me the space,

23:19.680 --> 23:22.800
 I start to think about the functions of the space, okay?

23:22.800 --> 23:26.160
 So for each point in the space, I associate a number.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.600
 I can take different kinds of functions

23:27.600 --> 23:29.080
 and different kinds of values,

23:29.080 --> 23:31.560
 but basically functions on a space.

23:31.560 --> 23:36.280
 So what this insight is telling you is that

23:36.280 --> 23:39.640
 if you're a geometer, often the way to work

23:39.640 --> 23:41.920
 is to change your problem into algebra

23:41.920 --> 23:44.840
 by changing your space, stop thinking about your space

23:44.840 --> 23:47.640
 and the points in it and think about the functions on it.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.760
 And if you're an algebraist

23:49.760 --> 23:52.240
 and you've got these abstract algebraic gadgets

23:52.240 --> 23:55.080
 that you're multiplying and adding, say, wait a minute,

23:55.080 --> 23:58.520
 are those gadgets, can I think of them in some way

23:58.520 --> 23:59.680
 as a function on a space?

23:59.680 --> 24:00.760
 What would that space be

24:00.760 --> 24:02.880
 and what kind of functions would they be?

24:02.880 --> 24:05.720
 And that going back and forth really brings

24:05.720 --> 24:08.200
 these two completely different looking areas

24:08.200 --> 24:09.600
 of mathematics together.

24:09.600 --> 24:13.400
 Do you have particular examples where it allowed

24:13.400 --> 24:15.000
 to prove some difficult things

24:15.000 --> 24:16.760
 by jumping from one to the other?

24:16.760 --> 24:19.680
 Is that something that's a part of modern mathematics

24:19.680 --> 24:21.680
 where such jumps are made?

24:21.680 --> 24:23.720
 Oh yeah, this is kind of all the time.

24:23.720 --> 24:27.160
 Much of modern number theory is kind of based on this idea.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.880
 But, and when you start doing this,

24:29.880 --> 24:31.640
 you start to realize that you need,

24:32.880 --> 24:37.520
 what simple things on one side of the algebra

24:37.520 --> 24:40.920
 start to require you to think about the other side,

24:40.920 --> 24:42.360
 about geometry in a new way.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.120
 You have to kind of get a more sophisticated idea

24:44.120 --> 24:46.960
 about geometry, or if you start thinking

24:46.960 --> 24:49.120
 about the functions on a space,

24:49.120 --> 24:52.040
 you may need a more sophisticated kind of algebra.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.960
 But in some sense, I mean,

24:53.960 --> 24:55.560
 much or most of modern number theory

24:55.560 --> 24:58.920
 is based upon this move to geometry.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.240
 And there's also a lot of geometry

25:01.240 --> 25:05.040
 and topology is also based upon, yeah, change.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.800
 If you want to understand the topology of something,

25:06.800 --> 25:09.480
 you look at the functions, you do drum comology

25:09.480 --> 25:11.360
 and you get the topology.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.640
 Anyway.

25:13.640 --> 25:16.200
 Well, let me ask you then the ridiculous question.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.960
 You said that this idea is beautiful.

25:18.960 --> 25:22.680
 Can you formalize the definition of the word beautiful?

25:22.680 --> 25:24.880
 And why is this beautiful?

25:24.880 --> 25:26.240
 First, why is this beautiful?

25:26.240 --> 25:29.720
 And second, what is beautiful?

25:29.720 --> 25:32.320
 Yeah, well, and I think there are many different things

25:32.320 --> 25:34.120
 you can find beautiful for different reasons.

25:34.120 --> 25:37.900
 I mean, I think in this context, the notion of beauty,

25:37.900 --> 25:41.280
 I think really is just kind of an idea is beautiful

25:41.280 --> 25:45.720
 if it's packages a huge amount of kind of power

25:45.720 --> 25:48.800
 and information into something very simple.

25:48.800 --> 25:53.800
 So in some sense, you can almost kind of try and measure it

25:54.640 --> 25:58.320
 in the sense of what are the implications of this idea?

25:58.320 --> 26:00.880
 What non trivial things does it tell you

26:00.880 --> 26:05.880
 versus how simply can you express the idea?

26:06.320 --> 26:07.160
 And so.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.520
 So the level of compression,

26:08.520 --> 26:12.400
 what is it correlates with beauty?

26:12.400 --> 26:15.000
 Yeah, that's one aspect of it.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.800
 And so you can start to tell that an idea

26:16.800 --> 26:18.840
 is becoming uglier and uglier

26:18.840 --> 26:21.280
 as you start kind of having to,

26:21.280 --> 26:22.360
 it doesn't quite do what you want.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.560
 So you throw in something else to the idea

26:24.560 --> 26:27.360
 and you keep doing that until you get what you want.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.560
 But that's how you know you're doing something uglier

26:29.560 --> 26:31.960
 and uglier when you have to kind of keep adding

26:31.960 --> 26:36.960
 and more into what was originally a fairly simple idea

26:36.960 --> 26:40.380
 and making it more and more complicated

26:40.380 --> 26:41.820
 to get what you want.

26:41.820 --> 26:45.340
 Okay, so let's put some philosophical words on the table

26:45.340 --> 26:47.100
 and try to make some sense of them.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.780
 One word is beauty, another one is simplicity

26:49.780 --> 26:52.220
 as you mentioned, another one is truth.

26:53.300 --> 26:57.060
 So do you have a sense if I give you two theories,

26:57.060 --> 27:01.380
 one is simpler, one is more complicated.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.820
 Do you have a sense of which one is more likely to be true

27:05.820 --> 27:10.820
 to capture deeply the fabric of reality,

27:13.240 --> 27:15.340
 the simple one or the more complicated one?

27:15.340 --> 27:17.660
 Yeah, I think all of our evidence,

27:18.540 --> 27:20.100
 what we see in the history of the subject

27:20.100 --> 27:22.380
 is the simpler one though.

27:22.380 --> 27:26.300
 Often it's a surprise, it's simpler in a surprising way.

27:26.300 --> 27:29.820
 But yeah, that we just don't, we just,

27:31.100 --> 27:32.980
 anyway, the kind of best theories

27:32.980 --> 27:35.460
 we've been coming up with are ultimately

27:35.460 --> 27:38.740
 when properly understood, relatively simple

27:38.740 --> 27:41.860
 and much, much simpler than you would expect them to be.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.500
 Do you have a good explanation why that is?

27:43.500 --> 27:46.020
 Is it just because humans want it to be that way?

27:46.020 --> 27:47.540
 Are we just like ultra biased

27:47.540 --> 27:51.080
 and we just kind of convince ourselves

27:51.080 --> 27:53.720
 that simple is better because we find simplicity beautiful?

27:53.720 --> 27:57.340
 Or is there something about our actual universe

27:57.340 --> 28:00.060
 that at the core is simple?

28:00.060 --> 28:02.980
 My own belief is that there is something about a universe

28:02.980 --> 28:05.580
 that's simple and as I was trying to say that,

28:05.580 --> 28:08.020
 there is some kind of fundamental thing about math,

28:08.020 --> 28:13.020
 physics and all this picture, which is in some sense simple.

28:14.500 --> 28:18.580
 It's true that, it's of course true that our minds

28:18.580 --> 28:20.840
 have certain, are very limited

28:20.840 --> 28:23.680
 and can certainly do certain things and not others.

28:23.680 --> 28:26.500
 So it's in principle possible

28:26.500 --> 28:29.380
 that there's some great insight in,

28:29.380 --> 28:31.300
 there are a lot of insights into the way the world works,

28:31.300 --> 28:33.460
 which just aren't accessible to us because

28:33.460 --> 28:35.500
 that's not the way our minds work, we don't.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.340
 And that what we're seeing, this kind of simplicity

28:37.340 --> 28:41.300
 is just because that's all we ever have any hope of seeing.

28:42.540 --> 28:46.120
 So there's a brilliant physicist

28:46.120 --> 28:49.060
 by the name of Sabine Hassenfelder

28:49.060 --> 28:51.060
 who both agrees and disagrees with you.

28:51.060 --> 28:56.060
 I suppose agrees that the final answer will be simple.

28:57.260 --> 28:58.420
 Yeah.

28:58.420 --> 29:01.580
 But simplicity and beauty leads us astray

29:01.580 --> 29:04.840
 in the local pockets of scientific progress.

29:05.900 --> 29:08.660
 Do you agree with her disagreement

29:08.660 --> 29:11.140
 and do you disagree with her agreement?

29:11.140 --> 29:14.060
 And agree with the agreement and so on.

29:14.060 --> 29:17.100
 Anyway, yes, I found it was really fascinating

29:17.100 --> 29:19.420
 reading her book and anyway,

29:19.420 --> 29:21.420
 I was finding disagreeing with a lot,

29:21.420 --> 29:23.340
 but then at the end when she says yes,

29:23.340 --> 29:26.580
 when we find, when we actually figure this out,

29:26.580 --> 29:31.220
 it will be simple and okay, so we agree in the end.

29:31.220 --> 29:32.860
 But does beauty lead us astray,

29:32.860 --> 29:37.620
 which is the core thesis of her work in that book.

29:37.620 --> 29:41.160
 I actually, I guess I do disagree with her on that so much.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.660
 I don't think, and especially,

29:42.660 --> 29:44.580
 and I actually fairly strongly disagree with her

29:44.580 --> 29:47.180
 about sometimes the way she'll refer to math.

29:47.180 --> 29:51.460
 And so the problem is, physicists and people in general

29:51.460 --> 29:56.140
 just refer to it as math and they're often meaning

29:56.140 --> 29:57.220
 not what I would call math,

29:57.220 --> 29:59.160
 which is the interesting ideas of math,

29:59.160 --> 30:03.260
 but just some complicated calculation.

30:03.260 --> 30:08.260
 And so I guess my feeling about it is more that it's very,

30:09.180 --> 30:11.120
 the problem with talking about simplicity

30:11.120 --> 30:14.700
 and using simplicity as a guide is that it's very,

30:16.140 --> 30:17.620
 it's very easy to fool yourself

30:17.620 --> 30:22.620
 and it's very easy to decide to fall in love with an idea.

30:23.340 --> 30:26.000
 You have an idea, you think, oh, this is great

30:26.000 --> 30:26.980
 and you fall in love with it.

30:26.980 --> 30:29.500
 And it's like any kind of love affair,

30:29.500 --> 30:32.820
 it's very easy to believe that the object of your affections

30:32.820 --> 30:35.300
 is much more beautiful than the others might think

30:35.300 --> 30:36.660
 and that they really are.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.380
 And that's very, very easy to do.

30:39.380 --> 30:43.980
 So if you say, I'm just gonna pursue ideas about beauty

30:43.980 --> 30:46.460
 and this and mathematics and this,

30:46.460 --> 30:49.500
 it's extremely easy to just fool yourself, I think.

30:50.740 --> 30:54.060
 And I think that's a lot of what the story

30:54.060 --> 30:56.260
 she was thinking of about where people have gone astray,

30:56.260 --> 30:59.100
 that I think it's, I would argue that it's more people,

30:59.100 --> 31:01.960
 it's not that there was some simple, powerful,

31:01.960 --> 31:03.660
 wonderful idea which they'd found

31:03.660 --> 31:08.340
 and it turned out not to be useful,

31:08.340 --> 31:10.340
 but it was more that they kind of fooled themselves

31:10.340 --> 31:13.080
 that this was actually a better idea than it really was

31:13.080 --> 31:15.180
 and that it was simpler and more beautiful

31:15.180 --> 31:17.700
 than it really was, is a lot of the story.

31:18.860 --> 31:20.700
 I see, so it's not that the simplicity of beauty

31:20.700 --> 31:22.900
 leads us astray, it's just people are people

31:22.900 --> 31:27.180
 and they fall in love with whatever idea they have

31:27.180 --> 31:30.260
 and then they weave narratives around that idea

31:30.260 --> 31:31.540
 or they present it in such a way

31:31.540 --> 31:36.540
 that emphasizes the simplicity and the beauty.

31:36.740 --> 31:37.960
 Yeah, that's part of it.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.840
 But I mean, the thing about physics that you have

31:40.840 --> 31:44.160
 is that what really can tell,

31:44.160 --> 31:46.140
 if you can do an experiment and check

31:46.140 --> 31:50.840
 and see if nature is really doing what your idea expects,

31:50.840 --> 31:54.020
 you do in principle have a way of really testing it

31:54.020 --> 31:58.380
 and it's certainly true that if you thought

31:58.380 --> 32:00.160
 you had a simple idea and that doesn't work

32:00.160 --> 32:01.900
 and you go out and do an experiment

32:01.900 --> 32:04.120
 and what actually does work is some more,

32:04.120 --> 32:05.900
 maybe some more complicated version of it,

32:05.900 --> 32:10.780
 that can certainly happen and that can be true.

32:10.780 --> 32:13.140
 I think her emphasis is more,

32:13.140 --> 32:14.580
 that I don't really disagree with,

32:14.580 --> 32:18.820
 is that people should be concentrating

32:18.820 --> 32:21.980
 on when they're trying to develop better theories

32:21.980 --> 32:25.740
 on more on self consistency, not so much on beauty,

32:25.740 --> 32:28.300
 but not is this idea beautiful,

32:28.300 --> 32:30.400
 but is there something about the theory

32:30.400 --> 32:34.420
 which is not quite consistent and use that as a guide

32:35.340 --> 32:37.980
 that there's something wrong there which needs fixing.

32:37.980 --> 32:40.700
 And so I think that part of her argument,

32:40.700 --> 32:43.220
 I think we're on the same page about.

32:43.220 --> 32:48.220
 What is consistency and inconsistencies?

32:48.300 --> 32:53.000
 What exactly, do you have examples in mind?

32:53.000 --> 32:55.700
 Well, it can be just simple inconsistency

32:55.700 --> 32:58.700
 between theory and an experiment that if you,

32:58.700 --> 33:01.000
 so we have this great fundamental theory,

33:01.000 --> 33:02.980
 but there are some things that we see out there

33:02.980 --> 33:04.260
 which don't seem to fit in it,

33:04.260 --> 33:07.500
 like dark energy and dark matter, for instance.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.600
 But if there's something which you can't test experimentally,

33:09.600 --> 33:12.020
 I think she would argue and I would agree

33:12.020 --> 33:15.100
 that, for instance, if you're trying to think about gravity

33:15.100 --> 33:17.380
 and how are you gonna have a quantum theory of gravity,

33:17.380 --> 33:21.540
 you should kind of test any of your ideas

33:21.540 --> 33:24.980
 with kind of a thought experiment.

33:24.980 --> 33:26.780
 Does this actually give a consistent picture

33:26.780 --> 33:28.740
 of what's gonna happen, of what happens

33:28.740 --> 33:31.100
 in this particular situation or not?

33:32.300 --> 33:33.460
 So this is a good example.

33:33.460 --> 33:34.760
 You've written about this.

33:36.460 --> 33:40.600
 Since quantum gravitational effects are really small,

33:40.600 --> 33:44.260
 super small, arguably unobservably small,

33:44.260 --> 33:46.480
 should we have hope to arrive

33:46.480 --> 33:49.580
 at a theory of quantum gravity somehow?

33:49.580 --> 33:51.540
 What are the different ways we can get there?

33:51.540 --> 33:53.340
 You've mentioned that you're not as interested

33:53.340 --> 33:56.940
 in that effort because basically, yes,

33:56.940 --> 34:01.940
 you cannot have ways to scientifically validate it

34:02.500 --> 34:04.160
 given the tools of today.

34:04.160 --> 34:06.460
 Yeah, I've actually, you know, I've over the years

34:06.460 --> 34:08.900
 certainly spent a lot of time learning about gravity

34:08.900 --> 34:11.940
 and about attempts to quantize it, but it hasn't been

34:11.940 --> 34:14.060
 that much in the past the focus

34:14.060 --> 34:16.000
 of what I've been thinking about.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.720
 But I mean, my feeling was always, you know,

34:18.720 --> 34:22.880
 as I think Sabina would agree that the, you know,

34:22.880 --> 34:25.800
 one way you can pursue this if you can't do experiments

34:25.800 --> 34:29.140
 is just this kind of search for consistency.

34:29.140 --> 34:31.840
 You know, it can be remarkably hard to come up

34:31.840 --> 34:34.980
 with a completely consistent model of this

34:34.980 --> 34:37.420
 in a way that brings together quantum mechanics

34:37.420 --> 34:39.420
 and general relativity.

34:39.420 --> 34:42.700
 And that's, I think, kind of been the traditional way

34:42.700 --> 34:44.440
 that people who have pursued quantum gravity

34:44.440 --> 34:46.340
 have often pursued, you know,

34:48.340 --> 34:52.420
 we have the best route to finding a consistent theory

34:52.420 --> 34:55.740
 of quantum gravity and string theorists will tell you this,

34:55.740 --> 34:57.120
 other people will tell you it,

34:57.120 --> 35:00.060
 it's kind of what people argue about.

35:00.060 --> 35:03.340
 But the problem with all of that is that you end up,

35:03.340 --> 35:07.060
 you know, the danger is that you end up with,

35:08.620 --> 35:10.140
 that everybody could be successful.

35:10.140 --> 35:14.620
 Everybody's program for how to find a theory

35:14.620 --> 35:16.540
 of quantum gravity, you know, ends up with something

35:16.540 --> 35:18.500
 that is consistent.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.780
 And so, and in some sense you could argue

35:20.780 --> 35:23.860
 this is what happened to the string theorists.

35:23.860 --> 35:26.300
 They solved their problem of finding a consistent theory

35:26.300 --> 35:27.800
 of quantum gravity and they ended up,

35:27.800 --> 35:30.300
 but they found 10 to the 500 solutions.

35:30.300 --> 35:34.620
 So you, you know, if you believe that everything

35:34.620 --> 35:35.980
 that they would like to be true is true,

35:35.980 --> 35:38.380
 well, okay, you've got a theory,

35:38.380 --> 35:41.100
 but it ends up being kind of useless

35:41.100 --> 35:43.860
 because it's just one of an infinite,

35:43.860 --> 35:46.060
 essentially infinite number of things

35:46.060 --> 35:48.340
 which you have no way to experimentally distinguish.

35:48.340 --> 35:51.300
 And so this is just a depressing situation.

35:52.220 --> 35:55.260
 But I do think that there is a,

35:55.260 --> 35:57.780
 so again, I think pursuing ideas about what,

35:57.780 --> 36:01.380
 more about beauty and how can you integrate

36:01.380 --> 36:04.340
 and unify these issues about gravity

36:04.340 --> 36:06.020
 with other things we know about physics.

36:06.020 --> 36:08.860
 And can you find a theory where these fit together

36:08.860 --> 36:12.340
 in a way that makes sense and hopefully predict something.

36:12.340 --> 36:14.020
 That's much more promising.

36:14.020 --> 36:15.620
 Well, it makes sense and hopefully,

36:15.620 --> 36:19.620
 I mean, we'll sneak up onto this question a bunch of times

36:19.620 --> 36:23.540
 because you kind of said a few slightly contradictory things

36:23.540 --> 36:27.220
 which is like, it's nice to have a theory that's consistent,

36:27.220 --> 36:29.940
 but then if the theory is consistent,

36:29.940 --> 36:31.780
 it doesn't necessarily mean anything.

36:32.860 --> 36:33.700
 So like.

36:33.700 --> 36:35.220
 It's not enough, it's not enough.

36:35.220 --> 36:36.780
 It's not enough and that's the problem.

36:36.780 --> 36:39.460
 So it's like, it keeps coming back to,

36:39.460 --> 36:42.060
 okay, there should be some experimental validation.

36:43.380 --> 36:47.020
 So, okay, let's talk a little bit about strength theory.

36:47.020 --> 36:51.340
 You've been a bit of an outspoken critic of strength theory.

36:52.420 --> 36:56.680
 Maybe one question first to ask is what is strength theory?

36:56.680 --> 37:01.680
 And beyond that, why is it wrong?

37:01.900 --> 37:06.540
 Or rather as the title of your blog says, not even wrong.

37:06.540 --> 37:07.900
 Okay.

37:07.900 --> 37:08.740
 Well, one interesting thing

37:08.740 --> 37:10.380
 about the current state of strength theory is that,

37:10.380 --> 37:13.340
 I think it, I'd argue it's actually very, very difficult

37:13.340 --> 37:15.880
 to at this point to say what strength theory means.

37:15.880 --> 37:17.380
 If people say they're a strength theorist,

37:17.380 --> 37:19.820
 what they mean and what they're doing

37:19.820 --> 37:24.140
 is kind of hard to pin down the meaning of the term.

37:24.140 --> 37:26.800
 But the initial meaning I think goes back to,

37:28.380 --> 37:32.100
 there was kind of a series of developments starting in 1984

37:32.100 --> 37:36.420
 in which people felt that they had found a unified theory

37:36.420 --> 37:41.300
 of our so called standard model of all the standard,

37:41.300 --> 37:44.620
 well known kind of particle interactions and gravity

37:44.620 --> 37:46.620
 and it all fit together in a quantum theory.

37:46.620 --> 37:49.940
 And that you could do this in a very specific way

37:49.940 --> 37:54.900
 by instead of thinking about having a quantum theory

37:54.900 --> 37:57.200
 of particles moving around in space time,

37:57.200 --> 38:00.380
 think about a quantum theory of kind of one dimensional

38:00.380 --> 38:03.420
 loops moving around in space time, so called strings.

38:03.420 --> 38:06.580
 And so instead of one degree of freedom,

38:06.580 --> 38:08.220
 these have an infinite number of degrees of freedom.

38:08.220 --> 38:11.060
 It's a much more complicated theory, but you can imagine,

38:12.300 --> 38:14.780
 okay, we're gonna quantize this theory of loops

38:14.780 --> 38:16.780
 moving around in space time.

38:16.780 --> 38:21.160
 And what they found is that you could do this

38:21.160 --> 38:23.420
 and you could fairly, relatively straightforwardly

38:23.420 --> 38:26.900
 make sense of such a quantum theory,

38:26.900 --> 38:30.660
 but only if space and time together were 10 dimensional.

38:31.580 --> 38:32.980
 And so then you had this problem,

38:32.980 --> 38:34.820
 again, the problem I referred to at the beginning of,

38:34.820 --> 38:37.260
 okay, now once you make that move,

38:37.260 --> 38:39.620
 you gotta get rid of six dimensions.

38:39.620 --> 38:42.300
 And so the hope was that you could get rid

38:42.300 --> 38:44.820
 of the six dimensions by making them very small

38:44.820 --> 38:47.460
 and that consistency of the theory would require

38:48.740 --> 38:52.860
 that these six dimensions satisfy a very specific condition

38:52.860 --> 38:55.180
 called being a Calabi out manifold.

38:55.180 --> 38:58.300
 And that we knew very, very few examples of this.

38:58.300 --> 39:02.340
 So what got a lot of people very excited back in 84, 85

39:02.340 --> 39:05.180
 was the hope that you could just take

39:05.180 --> 39:07.060
 this 10 dimensional string theory

39:07.060 --> 39:10.900
 and find one of a limited number of possible ways

39:10.900 --> 39:14.620
 of getting rid of six dimensions by making them small

39:14.620 --> 39:16.700
 and then you would end up with an effective

39:16.700 --> 39:18.820
 four dimensional theory, which looked like the real world.

39:18.820 --> 39:20.020
 This was the hope.

39:20.020 --> 39:22.580
 So then there's then a very long story

39:22.580 --> 39:25.900
 about what happened to that hope over the years.

39:25.900 --> 39:28.780
 I would argue and part of the point of the book

39:28.780 --> 39:33.780
 and its title was that this ultimately was a failure

39:33.900 --> 39:36.460
 that you ended up, that this idea just didn't,

39:38.940 --> 39:41.060
 there ended up being just too many ways of doing this

39:41.060 --> 39:44.100
 and you didn't know how to do this consistently,

39:44.100 --> 39:46.740
 that it was kind of not even wrong in the sense

39:46.740 --> 39:49.140
 that you couldn't even, you never could pin it down

39:49.140 --> 39:53.580
 well enough to actually get a real falsifiable prediction

39:53.580 --> 39:55.220
 out of it that would tell you it was wrong.

39:55.220 --> 39:59.340
 But it was kind of in the realm of ideas

39:59.340 --> 40:02.100
 which initially looked good, but the more you look at them,

40:02.100 --> 40:05.460
 they just, they don't work out the way you want

40:05.460 --> 40:07.740
 and they don't actually end up carrying the power

40:07.740 --> 40:10.220
 or that you originally had this vision of.

40:10.220 --> 40:14.180
 And yes, the book title is not even wrong.

40:14.180 --> 40:17.780
 Your blog, your excellent blog title is not even wrong.

40:17.780 --> 40:20.900
 Okay, but there's nevertheless been a lot of excitement

40:20.900 --> 40:24.180
 about string theory through the decades, as you mentioned.

40:24.180 --> 40:27.860
 What are the different flavors of ideas that came,

40:29.420 --> 40:31.340
 like that branched out?

40:31.340 --> 40:32.700
 You mentioned 10 dimensions.

40:32.700 --> 40:36.540
 You mentioned loops with infinite degrees of freedom.

40:36.540 --> 40:38.780
 What other interesting ideas to you

40:38.780 --> 40:41.020
 that kind of emerged from this world?

40:41.020 --> 40:42.020
 Well, yeah, I mean, the problem

40:42.020 --> 40:43.260
 with talking about the whole subject

40:43.260 --> 40:45.740
 and part of the reason I wrote the book

40:45.740 --> 40:48.740
 is that it gets very, very complicated.

40:48.740 --> 40:50.380
 I mean, there's a huge amount,

40:52.100 --> 40:54.460
 a lot of people got very interested in this,

40:54.460 --> 40:55.580
 a lot of people worked on it.

40:55.580 --> 40:57.900
 And in some sense, I think what happened

40:57.900 --> 41:01.340
 is exactly because the idea didn't really work

41:01.340 --> 41:03.580
 that this caused people to,

41:04.540 --> 41:06.220
 instead of focusing on this one idea

41:06.220 --> 41:08.220
 and digging in and working on that,

41:08.220 --> 41:11.020
 they just kind of kept trying new things.

41:11.020 --> 41:14.020
 And so people, I think, ended up wandering around

41:14.020 --> 41:15.860
 in a very, very rich space of ideas

41:15.860 --> 41:17.660
 about mathematics and physics

41:17.660 --> 41:19.980
 and discovering all sorts of really interesting things.

41:19.980 --> 41:22.020
 It's just the problem is there tended

41:22.020 --> 41:23.380
 to be an inverse relationship

41:23.380 --> 41:26.100
 between how interesting and beautiful and fruitful

41:26.100 --> 41:28.820
 this new idea that they were trying to pursue was

41:28.820 --> 41:31.820
 and how much it looked like the real world.

41:31.820 --> 41:34.500
 So there's a lot of beautiful mathematics came out of it.

41:34.500 --> 41:36.020
 I think one of the most spectacular

41:36.020 --> 41:38.340
 is what the physicists call

41:38.340 --> 41:40.620
 two dimensional conformal field theory.

41:40.620 --> 41:44.620
 And so these are basically quantum field theories

41:44.620 --> 41:46.300
 and kind of think of it as one space

41:46.300 --> 41:47.780
 and one time dimension,

41:47.780 --> 41:51.220
 which have just this huge amount of symmetry

41:51.220 --> 41:53.620
 and a huge amount of structure,

41:53.620 --> 41:57.420
 which there's some totally fantastic mathematics behind it.

41:57.420 --> 42:00.340
 And again, and some of that mathematics

42:00.340 --> 42:03.260
 is exactly also what appears in the Langlands program.

42:03.260 --> 42:07.780
 So a lot of the first interaction between math and physics

42:07.780 --> 42:09.140
 around the Langlands program has been

42:09.140 --> 42:12.580
 around these two dimensional conformal field theories.

42:12.580 --> 42:15.220
 Is there something you could say

42:15.220 --> 42:18.980
 about what are the major problems are with string theory?

42:18.980 --> 42:23.980
 So like, besides that there's no experimental validation,

42:25.820 --> 42:30.420
 you've written that a big hole in string theory

42:30.420 --> 42:33.380
 has been its perturbative definition.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.940
 Perhaps that's one, can you explain what that means?

42:36.940 --> 42:38.140
 Well, maybe to begin with,

42:38.140 --> 42:40.780
 I think the simplest thing to say is,

42:42.580 --> 42:45.220
 the initial idea really was that,

42:45.220 --> 42:48.380
 okay, we have this, instead of what's great

42:48.380 --> 42:50.740
 is we have this thing that only works,

42:50.740 --> 42:54.180
 it's very structured and has to work in a certain way

42:54.180 --> 42:55.540
 for it to make sense.

42:55.540 --> 43:00.540
 But then you ended up in 10 space time dimensions.

43:01.700 --> 43:03.620
 And so to get back to physics,

43:03.620 --> 43:05.380
 you had to get rid of five of the dimensions,

43:05.380 --> 43:06.860
 six of the dimensions.

43:06.860 --> 43:09.620
 And the bottom line I would say in some sense is very simple

43:09.620 --> 43:11.660
 that what people just discovered is just,

43:12.780 --> 43:15.660
 there's kind of no particularly nice way of doing this,

43:15.660 --> 43:17.460
 there's an infinite number of ways of doing it

43:17.460 --> 43:18.740
 and you can get whatever you want

43:18.740 --> 43:20.140
 depending on how you do it.

43:20.140 --> 43:24.020
 So you end up the whole program of starting at 10 dimensions

43:24.020 --> 43:26.780
 and getting to four just kind of collapses

43:26.780 --> 43:29.740
 out of a lack of any way to kind of get to where you want

43:29.740 --> 43:31.540
 because you can get anything.

43:31.540 --> 43:34.380
 The hope around that problem has always been

43:34.380 --> 43:38.940
 that the standard formulation that we have of string theory,

43:38.940 --> 43:42.540
 which is, you can go by the name perturbative,

43:42.540 --> 43:46.300
 but it's kind of, there's a standard way we know

43:46.300 --> 43:50.700
 of given a classical theory of constructing a quantum theory

43:50.700 --> 43:55.700
 and working with it, which is the so called

43:56.100 --> 43:59.260
 perturbation theory that we know how to do.

43:59.260 --> 44:04.260
 And that by itself just doesn't give you any hint

44:04.460 --> 44:06.660
 as to what to do about the six dimensions.

44:06.660 --> 44:09.180
 So actual perturbed string theory by itself

44:09.180 --> 44:11.340
 really only works in 10 dimensions.

44:11.340 --> 44:14.380
 So you have to start making some kinds of assumptions

44:14.380 --> 44:19.380
 about how I'm gonna go beyond this formulation

44:19.380 --> 44:21.700
 that we really understand of string theory

44:21.700 --> 44:24.060
 and get rid of these six dimensions.

44:24.060 --> 44:29.060
 So kind of the simplest one was the Klabiau postulate,

44:29.380 --> 44:31.820
 but when that didn't really work out,

44:31.820 --> 44:33.940
 people have tried more and more different things.

44:33.940 --> 44:38.500
 And the hope has always been that the solution,

44:38.500 --> 44:41.540
 this problem would be that you would find a deeper

44:41.540 --> 44:44.220
 and better understanding of what string theory is

44:44.220 --> 44:47.860
 that would actually go beyond this perturbative expansion

44:47.860 --> 44:51.820
 and which would generalize this.

44:51.820 --> 44:56.820
 And that once you had that, it would solve this problem of,

44:57.220 --> 44:59.580
 it would pick out what to do with the six dimensions.

44:59.580 --> 45:01.140
 How difficult is this problem?

45:01.140 --> 45:05.100
 So if I could restate the problem,

45:05.100 --> 45:09.860
 it seems like there's a very consistent physical world

45:09.860 --> 45:11.720
 operating in four dimensions.

45:13.340 --> 45:16.700
 And how do you map a consistent physical world

45:16.700 --> 45:19.260
 in 10 dimensions to a consistent physical world

45:19.260 --> 45:21.180
 in four dimensions?

45:21.180 --> 45:23.100
 And how difficult is this problem?

45:23.100 --> 45:25.340
 Is that something you can even answer?

45:27.720 --> 45:30.340
 Just in terms of physics intuition,

45:30.340 --> 45:32.280
 in terms of mathematics,

45:32.280 --> 45:35.060
 mapping from 10 dimensions to four dimensions.

45:35.060 --> 45:36.580
 Well, basically, I mean, you have to get rid

45:36.580 --> 45:38.140
 of the six of the dimensions.

45:38.140 --> 45:41.620
 So there's kind of two ways of doing it.

45:41.620 --> 45:44.020
 One is what we called compactification.

45:44.020 --> 45:46.860
 You say that there really are 10 dimensions,

45:46.860 --> 45:48.220
 but for whatever reason,

45:48.220 --> 45:51.860
 six of them are so, so small, we can't see them.

45:51.860 --> 45:54.660
 So you basically start out with 10 dimensions

45:54.660 --> 45:58.980
 and what we call, make six of them not go out to infinity,

45:58.980 --> 46:00.780
 but just kind of a finite extent

46:00.780 --> 46:05.460
 and then make that size go down so small, it's unobservable.

46:05.460 --> 46:08.300
 But that's like, that's a math trick.

46:08.300 --> 46:11.420
 So can you also help me build an intuition

46:11.420 --> 46:15.580
 about how rich and interesting the world

46:15.580 --> 46:17.900
 in those six dimensions is?

46:17.900 --> 46:21.020
 So compactification seems to imply...

46:21.020 --> 46:22.660
 Well, it's not very interesting.

46:22.660 --> 46:24.700
 Well, no, but the problem is that what you learn

46:24.700 --> 46:26.780
 if you start doing mathematics

46:26.780 --> 46:28.900
 and looking at geometry and topology

46:28.900 --> 46:31.600
 and more and more dimensions is that,

46:31.600 --> 46:34.180
 I mean, asking the question like,

46:34.180 --> 46:36.540
 what are all possible six dimensional spaces?

46:36.540 --> 46:38.580
 It's just, it's kind of an unnatural question.

46:38.580 --> 46:39.620
 It's just, I mean,

46:39.620 --> 46:42.020
 it's even kind of technically undecidable in some way.

46:42.020 --> 46:46.180
 There are too many things you can do with all these,

46:46.180 --> 46:47.500
 if you start trying to make,

46:47.500 --> 46:49.540
 if you start trying to make one dimensional spaces,

46:49.540 --> 46:52.140
 it's like, well, you got a line, you can make a circle,

46:52.140 --> 46:55.180
 you can make graphs, you can kind of see what you can do.

46:55.180 --> 46:58.260
 But as you go to higher and higher dimensions,

46:58.260 --> 47:02.140
 there are just so many ways you can put things together

47:02.140 --> 47:05.460
 of and get something of that dimensionality.

47:05.460 --> 47:09.820
 And so unless you have some very, very strong principle,

47:09.820 --> 47:12.920
 we're just gonna pick out some very specific ones

47:12.920 --> 47:15.400
 of these six dimensional spaces.

47:15.400 --> 47:17.340
 And there are just too many of them

47:17.340 --> 47:19.500
 and you can get anything you want.

47:19.500 --> 47:21.600
 So if you have 10 dimensions,

47:22.540 --> 47:24.460
 the kind of things that happen,

47:24.460 --> 47:26.700
 say that's actually the way,

47:26.700 --> 47:29.740
 that's actually the fabric of our reality is 10 dimensions.

47:29.740 --> 47:33.100
 There's a limited set of behaviors of objects.

47:33.100 --> 47:35.180
 I don't know even know what the right terminology

47:35.180 --> 47:39.380
 to use that can occur within those dimensions,

47:39.380 --> 47:40.620
 like in reality.

47:41.500 --> 47:44.540
 And so like what I'm getting at is like,

47:44.540 --> 47:47.280
 is there some consistent constraints?

47:47.280 --> 47:51.080
 So if you have some constraints that map to reality,

47:51.080 --> 47:53.460
 then you can start saying like,

47:53.460 --> 47:56.260
 dimension number seven is kind of boring.

47:56.260 --> 47:58.900
 All the excitement happens in the spatial dimensions,

47:58.900 --> 48:00.380
 one, two, three.

48:00.380 --> 48:02.740
 And time is also kind of boring.

48:02.740 --> 48:05.380
 And like some are more exciting than others,

48:05.380 --> 48:08.100
 or we can use our metric of beauty.

48:08.100 --> 48:10.260
 Some dimensions are more beautiful than others.

48:10.260 --> 48:12.260
 Once you have an actual understanding

48:12.260 --> 48:15.280
 of what actually happens in those dimensions

48:15.280 --> 48:16.500
 in our physical world,

48:16.500 --> 48:18.620
 as opposed to sort of all the possible things

48:18.620 --> 48:19.600
 that could happen.

48:19.600 --> 48:20.660
 In some sense, I mean,

48:20.660 --> 48:22.240
 just the basic fact is you need to get rid of them.

48:22.240 --> 48:23.080
 We don't see them.

48:23.080 --> 48:25.580
 So you need to somehow explain them.

48:25.580 --> 48:26.580
 The main thing you're trying to do

48:26.580 --> 48:28.820
 is to explain why we're not seeing them.

48:28.820 --> 48:32.540
 And so you have to come up with some theory

48:32.540 --> 48:35.420
 of these extra dimensions and how they're gonna behave.

48:35.420 --> 48:38.180
 And string theory gives you some ideas

48:38.180 --> 48:39.020
 about how to do that.

48:39.020 --> 48:43.580
 But the bottom line is where you're trying to go

48:43.580 --> 48:45.660
 with this whole theory you're creating

48:45.660 --> 48:49.540
 is to just make all of its effects essentially unobservable.

48:49.540 --> 48:51.480
 So it's not a really,

48:54.780 --> 48:57.300
 it's an inherently kind of dubious and worrisome thing

48:57.300 --> 48:58.300
 that you're trying to do there.

48:58.300 --> 49:00.600
 Why are you just adding in all this stuff

49:00.600 --> 49:02.220
 and then trying to explain why we don't see it?

49:02.220 --> 49:03.060
 Exactly.

49:03.060 --> 49:04.260
 This may be a dumb question,

49:04.260 --> 49:07.780
 but is this an obvious thing to state

49:07.780 --> 49:11.580
 that those six dimensions are unobservable

49:11.580 --> 49:14.720
 or anything beyond four dimensions is unobservable?

49:16.180 --> 49:19.540
 Or do you leave a little door open

49:19.540 --> 49:23.180
 to saying the current tools of physics,

49:23.180 --> 49:26.980
 and obviously our brains aren't unable to observe them,

49:26.980 --> 49:29.940
 but we may need to come up with methodologies

49:29.940 --> 49:30.780
 for observing them.

49:30.780 --> 49:33.140
 So as opposed to collapsing your mathematical theory

49:33.140 --> 49:35.020
 into four dimensions,

49:35.020 --> 49:37.140
 leaving the door open a little bit too,

49:37.140 --> 49:38.760
 maybe we need to come up with tools

49:38.760 --> 49:42.700
 that actually allow us to directly measure those dimensions.

49:42.700 --> 49:45.260
 Yes, I mean, you can certainly ask,

49:45.260 --> 49:49.200
 assume that we've got model,

49:49.200 --> 49:51.340
 look at models with more dimensions and ask,

49:51.340 --> 49:54.180
 what would the observable effects, how would we know this?

49:54.180 --> 49:55.500
 And you go out and do experiments.

49:55.500 --> 49:58.780
 So for instance, you have a,

49:58.780 --> 50:02.660
 like gravitationally you have an inverse square law of forces.

50:02.660 --> 50:04.100
 If you had more dimensions,

50:04.100 --> 50:06.620
 that inverse square law would change to something else.

50:06.620 --> 50:09.540
 So you can go and start measuring the inverse square law

50:09.540 --> 50:12.060
 and say, okay, inverse square law is working,

50:12.060 --> 50:14.660
 but maybe if I get,

50:14.660 --> 50:16.540
 and it turns out to be actually kind of very, very hard

50:16.540 --> 50:18.140
 to measure gravitational effects

50:18.140 --> 50:21.940
 and even kind of somewhat macroscopic distances

50:21.940 --> 50:23.300
 because they're so small.

50:23.300 --> 50:26.220
 So you can start looking at the inverse square law

50:26.220 --> 50:28.020
 and say, start trying to measure it

50:28.020 --> 50:29.380
 at shorter and shorter distances

50:29.380 --> 50:33.180
 and see if there were extra dimensions

50:33.180 --> 50:34.440
 at those distance scales,

50:34.440 --> 50:36.780
 you would start to see the inverse square law fail.

50:36.780 --> 50:40.520
 And so people look for that and again, you don't see it,

50:40.520 --> 50:43.220
 but you can, I mean, there's all sorts of experiments

50:43.220 --> 50:46.580
 of this kind you can imagine which test

50:46.580 --> 50:48.420
 for effects of extra dimensions

50:48.420 --> 50:52.640
 at different distance scales, but none of them,

50:53.860 --> 50:55.940
 I mean, they all just don't work.

50:55.940 --> 50:58.220
 Nothing yet.

50:58.220 --> 51:01.860
 Nothing yet, but you could say, ah, but it's just much,

51:01.860 --> 51:03.700
 much smaller, you can say that.

51:05.180 --> 51:06.900
 Which by the way makes LIGO

51:06.900 --> 51:09.980
 and the detection of gravitational waves

51:09.980 --> 51:11.640
 quite an incredible project.

51:13.300 --> 51:15.680
 Ed Witten is often brought up

51:15.680 --> 51:17.420
 as one of the most brilliant mathematicians

51:17.420 --> 51:19.140
 and physicists ever.

51:21.060 --> 51:24.460
 What do you make of him and his work on string theory?

51:24.460 --> 51:26.820
 Well, I think he's a truly remarkable figure.

51:26.820 --> 51:30.140
 I've had the pleasure of meeting him first

51:30.140 --> 51:31.100
 when he was a postdoc.

51:31.100 --> 51:34.780
 And I mean, he's just completely amazing

51:36.060 --> 51:38.020
 mathematician and physicist.

51:38.020 --> 51:41.460
 And he's quite a bit smarter

51:41.460 --> 51:43.380
 than just about any of the rest of us

51:43.380 --> 51:44.580
 and also more hardworking.

51:44.580 --> 51:46.780
 It's a kind of frightening combination

51:46.780 --> 51:49.180
 to see how much he's been able to do.

51:50.540 --> 51:53.540
 But I would actually argue that his greatest work,

51:53.540 --> 51:55.820
 the things that he's done that have been of

51:55.820 --> 51:58.660
 just this mind blowing significance of giving us,

51:58.660 --> 52:00.100
 I mean, he's completely revolutionized

52:00.100 --> 52:02.180
 some areas of mathematics.

52:02.180 --> 52:04.220
 He's totally revolutionized the way we understand

52:04.220 --> 52:07.160
 the relations between mathematics and physics.

52:07.160 --> 52:10.660
 And most of those, his greatest work

52:10.660 --> 52:13.700
 is stuff that has little or nothing

52:13.700 --> 52:15.140
 to do with string theory.

52:15.140 --> 52:19.180
 I mean, for instance, so he was actually one of Fields.

52:19.180 --> 52:20.920
 The very strange thing about him in some sense

52:20.920 --> 52:23.660
 is that he doesn't have a Nobel Prize.

52:23.660 --> 52:25.940
 So there's a very large number of people

52:25.940 --> 52:28.300
 who are nowhere near as smart as he is

52:28.300 --> 52:30.140
 and don't work anywhere near as hard

52:30.140 --> 52:31.740
 who have Nobel Prizes.

52:31.740 --> 52:33.180
 I think he just had the misfortune

52:33.180 --> 52:35.820
 of coming into the field at a time

52:35.820 --> 52:37.740
 when things had gotten much, much, much tougher

52:37.740 --> 52:41.380
 and nobody really had, no matter how smart you were,

52:41.380 --> 52:44.020
 it was very hard to come up with a new idea

52:44.020 --> 52:47.740
 that was gonna work physically and get you a Nobel Prize.

52:47.740 --> 52:52.740
 But he got a Fields Medal for a certain work he did

52:52.980 --> 52:56.540
 in mathematics, and that's just completely unheard of.

52:56.540 --> 52:58.380
 For mathematicians to give a Fields Medal

52:58.380 --> 53:00.860
 to someone outside their field in physics

53:00.860 --> 53:05.620
 is really, you wouldn't have, before he came around,

53:05.620 --> 53:06.680
 I don't think anybody would have thought

53:06.680 --> 53:08.040
 that was even conceivable.

53:08.040 --> 53:11.020
 So you're saying he came into the field

53:11.020 --> 53:13.700
 of theoretical physics at a time when,

53:13.700 --> 53:18.240
 and still to today, is you can't get a Nobel Prize

53:18.240 --> 53:20.200
 for purely theoretical work.

53:20.200 --> 53:22.320
 The specific problem of trying to do better

53:22.320 --> 53:23.880
 than the standard, the standard model

53:23.880 --> 53:26.680
 is just this insanely successful thing,

53:26.680 --> 53:30.600
 and it kind of came together in 1973, pretty much.

53:30.600 --> 53:34.320
 And all of the people who kind of were involved

53:34.320 --> 53:37.200
 in that coming together, many of them ended up

53:37.200 --> 53:38.600
 with Nobel Prizes for that.

53:38.600 --> 53:43.600
 But if you look post 1973, pretty much,

53:43.720 --> 53:47.160
 it's a little bit more, there's some edge cases,

53:47.160 --> 53:50.200
 if you like, but if you look post 1973

53:50.200 --> 53:53.240
 at what people have done to try to do better

53:53.240 --> 53:56.160
 than the standard model and to get a better idea,

53:56.160 --> 53:58.440
 it really hasn't, it's been too hard a problem.

53:58.440 --> 53:59.280
 It hasn't worked.

53:59.280 --> 54:00.100
 The theory's too good.

54:00.100 --> 54:03.320
 And so it's not that other people went out there

54:03.320 --> 54:07.340
 and did it, and not him, and that they got Nobel Prizes

54:07.340 --> 54:08.960
 for doing it, it's just that no one really,

54:08.960 --> 54:10.480
 the kind of thing he's been trying to do

54:10.480 --> 54:13.360
 with string theory is not, no one has been able to do

54:13.360 --> 54:14.680
 since 1973.

54:15.540 --> 54:17.380
 Is there something you can say about the standard model,

54:17.380 --> 54:20.720
 so the four laws of physics that seems to work very well,

54:20.720 --> 54:24.980
 and yet people are striving to do more?

54:24.980 --> 54:27.580
 Talking about unification, so on, why?

54:27.580 --> 54:30.900
 What's wrong, what's broken about the standard model?

54:30.900 --> 54:33.080
 Why does it need to be improved?

54:33.080 --> 54:34.880
 I mean, the thing that's gets most attention

54:34.880 --> 54:38.220
 is gravity, that we have trouble.

54:39.160 --> 54:44.120
 So you want to, in some sense, integrate what we know

54:44.120 --> 54:46.320
 about the gravitational force with it

54:46.320 --> 54:48.640
 and have a unified quantum field theory

54:48.640 --> 54:50.340
 that has gravitational interactions also.

54:50.340 --> 54:52.640
 So that's the big problem everybody talks about.

54:53.640 --> 54:55.940
 I mean, but it's also true that if you look

54:55.940 --> 54:58.380
 at the standard model, it has these very, very deep,

54:58.380 --> 55:01.600
 beautiful ideas, but there's certain aspects of it

55:01.600 --> 55:06.600
 that are very, let's just say that they're not beautiful.

55:08.240 --> 55:11.440
 They're not, you have to, to make the thing work,

55:11.440 --> 55:14.240
 you have to throw in lots and lots of extra parameters

55:14.240 --> 55:17.480
 at various points, and a lot of this has to do

55:17.480 --> 55:21.960
 with the so called Higgs mechanism and the Higgs field,

55:21.960 --> 55:25.960
 that if you look at the theory, it's everything is,

55:25.960 --> 55:28.940
 if you forget about the Higgs field and what it needs to do,

55:28.940 --> 55:33.520
 the rest of the theory is very, very constrained

55:33.520 --> 55:35.320
 and has very, very few free parameters,

55:35.320 --> 55:36.400
 really a very small number.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.060
 There's very small number of parameters

55:38.060 --> 55:40.900
 and a few integers which tell you what the theory is.

55:40.900 --> 55:42.960
 To make this work as a theory of the real world,

55:42.960 --> 55:45.480
 you need a Higgs field and you need to,

55:45.480 --> 55:48.080
 it needs to do something.

55:48.080 --> 55:50.840
 And once you introduce that Higgs field,

55:50.840 --> 55:54.440
 all sorts of parameters make an appearance.

55:54.440 --> 55:58.760
 So now we've got 20 or 30 or whatever parameters

55:58.760 --> 56:00.880
 that are gonna tell you what all the masses of things are

56:00.880 --> 56:02.160
 and what's gonna happen.

56:02.160 --> 56:05.500
 So you've gone from a very tightly constrained thing

56:05.500 --> 56:09.000
 with a couple of parameters to this thing,

56:09.000 --> 56:11.120
 which the minute you put it in,

56:11.120 --> 56:13.200
 you had to add all this extra,

56:13.200 --> 56:15.320
 all these extra parameters to make things work.

56:15.320 --> 56:19.120
 And so that, it may be one argument as well,

56:19.120 --> 56:20.480
 that's just the way the world is,

56:20.480 --> 56:24.160
 and the fact that you don't find that aesthetically pleasing

56:24.160 --> 56:27.320
 is just your problem, or maybe we live in a multiverse

56:27.320 --> 56:30.080
 and those numbers are just different in every universe.

56:30.080 --> 56:33.620
 But another reasonable conjecture is just that,

56:33.620 --> 56:36.020
 well, this is just telling us that there's something

56:36.020 --> 56:40.200
 we don't understand about what's going on in a deeper way,

56:40.200 --> 56:41.680
 which would explain those numbers.

56:41.680 --> 56:44.240
 And there's some kind of deeper idea

56:44.240 --> 56:47.240
 about where the Higgs field comes from and what's going on,

56:47.240 --> 56:49.040
 which we haven't figured out yet.

56:49.040 --> 56:52.820
 And that's what we should look for.

56:52.820 --> 56:55.960
 But to stick on string theory a little bit longer,

56:55.960 --> 56:57.520
 could you play devil's advocate

56:58.580 --> 57:01.880
 and try to argue for string theory,

57:01.880 --> 57:06.880
 why it is something that deserved the effort that it got,

57:07.000 --> 57:10.400
 and still, like if you think of it as a flame,

57:10.400 --> 57:14.160
 still should be a little flame that keeps burning?

57:14.160 --> 57:17.600
 Well, I think the, I mean, the most positive argument

57:17.600 --> 57:22.120
 for it is all sorts of new ideas about mathematics

57:22.120 --> 57:24.800
 and about parts of physics really emerge from it.

57:24.800 --> 57:28.420
 That was very a fruitful source of ideas.

57:28.420 --> 57:30.720
 And I think this is actually one argument you'll definitely,

57:30.720 --> 57:31.600
 which I kind of agree with,

57:31.600 --> 57:34.280
 I'll hear from Whitten and from other string theorists,

57:34.280 --> 57:38.960
 say that this is just such a fruitful and inspiring idea

57:38.960 --> 57:41.320
 and it's led to so many other different things

57:41.320 --> 57:43.680
 coming out of it that there must be something

57:43.680 --> 57:45.160
 right about this.

57:45.160 --> 57:48.880
 And that's, okay, anyway, I think that's probably

57:48.880 --> 57:52.760
 the strongest thing that they've got.

57:52.760 --> 57:55.800
 But you don't think there's aspects to it

57:55.800 --> 58:00.440
 that could be neighboring to a theory

58:00.440 --> 58:03.160
 that does unify everything, to a theory of everything.

58:03.160 --> 58:05.720
 Like it could, it may not be exactly,

58:08.080 --> 58:11.240
 exactly the theory, but sticking on it longer

58:11.240 --> 58:14.360
 might get us closer to the theory of everything.

58:14.360 --> 58:15.400
 Well, the problem with it now really

58:15.400 --> 58:17.280
 is that you really don't know what it is now.

58:17.280 --> 58:19.880
 You've never, nobody has ever kind of come up

58:19.880 --> 58:23.360
 with this nonperturbative theory.

58:23.360 --> 58:27.400
 So it's become more and more frustrating

58:27.400 --> 58:30.320
 and an odd activity to try to argue with a string theorist

58:30.320 --> 58:34.080
 about string theory because it's become

58:34.080 --> 58:37.200
 less and less well defined what it is.

58:37.200 --> 58:40.080
 And it's become actually more and more kind of a,

58:40.080 --> 58:42.280
 whether you have this weird phenomenon

58:42.280 --> 58:44.780
 of people calling themselves string theorists

58:44.780 --> 58:47.480
 when they've never actually worked on any theory

58:47.480 --> 58:49.520
 where there are any strings anywhere.

58:49.520 --> 58:52.560
 So what has actually happened kind of sociologically

58:52.560 --> 58:54.760
 is that you started out with this

58:54.760 --> 58:56.480
 fairly well defined proposal.

58:56.480 --> 58:59.120
 And then I would argue because that didn't work,

58:59.120 --> 59:01.720
 people branched out in all sorts of directions

59:01.720 --> 59:02.800
 doing all sorts of things.

59:02.800 --> 59:05.520
 It became farther and farther removed from that.

59:05.520 --> 59:07.880
 And for sociological reasons,

59:07.880 --> 59:12.400
 the ones who kind of started out or now

59:12.400 --> 59:15.360
 or were trained by the people who worked on that

59:15.360 --> 59:18.880
 have now become this string theorists.

59:18.880 --> 59:23.640
 And, but it's becoming almost more

59:23.640 --> 59:25.640
 kind of a tribal denominator than a,

59:26.640 --> 59:28.120
 I think so it's very hard to know

59:28.120 --> 59:29.040
 what you're arguing about

59:29.040 --> 59:30.680
 when you're arguing about string theory these days.

59:30.680 --> 59:32.120
 Well, to push back on that a little bit,

59:32.120 --> 59:34.560
 I mean, string theory is just a term, right?

59:34.560 --> 59:37.040
 It doesn't, like you could,

59:37.040 --> 59:38.920
 like this is the way language evolves

59:39.780 --> 59:41.360
 is it could start to represent something

59:41.360 --> 59:43.440
 more than just the theory that involves strings.

59:43.440 --> 59:48.440
 It could represent the effort to unify the laws of physics.

59:49.160 --> 59:50.000
 Right?

59:50.000 --> 59:54.680
 At high dimensions with these super tiny objects, right?

59:54.680 --> 59:56.120
 Or something like that.

59:56.120 --> 59:59.320
 I mean, we can sort of put string theory aside.

59:59.320 --> 1:00:00.840
 So for example, neural networks

1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:02.680
 in the space of machine learning,

1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:05.480
 there was a time when they were extremely popular.

1:00:05.480 --> 1:00:07.160
 They became much, much less popular

1:00:07.160 --> 1:00:09.000
 to a point where if you mentioned neural networks,

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:10.440
 you're getting no funding

1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:13.300
 and you're not going to be respected at conferences.

1:00:13.300 --> 1:00:14.440
 And then once again,

1:00:15.440 --> 1:00:18.480
 neural networks became all the rage

1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:20.720
 about 10, 15 years ago.

1:00:20.720 --> 1:00:22.040
 And as it goes up and down

1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:23.640
 and a lot of people would argue

1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:26.700
 that using terminology like machine learning

1:00:26.700 --> 1:00:31.700
 and deep learning is often misused over general,

1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:35.200
 everything that works is deep learning,

1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:38.280
 everything that doesn't, isn't something like that.

1:00:38.280 --> 1:00:40.080
 That's just the way,

1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:42.960
 again, we're back to sociological things,

1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:45.320
 but I guess what I'm trying to get at is

1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:48.640
 if we leave the sociological mess aside,

1:00:50.540 --> 1:00:53.140
 do we throw out the baby with the bathwater?

1:00:53.140 --> 1:00:57.160
 Is there some, besides the side effects of nice ideas

1:00:57.160 --> 1:00:59.220
 from the Ed Wittons of the world,

1:00:59.220 --> 1:01:04.220
 is there some core truths there that we should stick by

1:01:04.300 --> 1:01:08.260
 in the full beautiful mess of a space

1:01:08.260 --> 1:01:09.640
 that we call string theory,

1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:11.440
 that people call string theory?

1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:14.360
 You're right, it is kind of a common problem

1:01:14.360 --> 1:01:19.360
 that how what you call some field changes and evolves

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:22.760
 and in interesting ways as the field changes.

1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:27.760
 But I mean, I guess what I would argue

1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:30.480
 is the initial understanding of string theory

1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:31.640
 that was quite specific,

1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:33.200
 we're talking about a specific idea,

1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:34.920
 10 dimensional super strings

1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:36.880
 compactified to six dimensions.

1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:41.280
 That to my mind, the really bad thing has happened

1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:45.840
 to the subject is that it's hard to get people to admit,

1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:48.160
 at least publicly, that that was a failure,

1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:49.800
 that this really didn't work.

1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:53.280
 And so de facto, what people do is people stop doing that

1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:55.440
 and they start doing more interesting things,

1:01:55.440 --> 1:02:00.440
 but they keep talking to the public about string theory

1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:03.280
 and referring back to that idea

1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:05.360
 and using that as kind of the starting point

1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:11.760
 and as kind of the place where the whole tribe starts

1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:13.320
 and everything else comes from.

1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:17.960
 So the problem with this is that having as your initial name

1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:20.480
 and what everything points back to,

1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:25.480
 something which really didn't work out,

1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:28.280
 it kind of makes everybody, it makes everything,

1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:31.040
 you've created this potentially very, very interesting field

1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:32.080
 with interesting things happening,

1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:37.040
 but people in graduate school take courses

1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:38.840
 on string theory and everything kind of,

1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:40.160
 and this is what you tell the public

1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:41.680
 in which you're continually pointing back.

1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:43.520
 So you're continually pointing back to this idea

1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:48.520
 which never worked out as your guiding inspiration.

1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:51.600
 And it really kind of deforms your whole way

1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:54.120
 of your hopes of making progress.

1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:57.640
 And that's, to me, I think the kind of worst thing

1:02:57.640 --> 1:02:59.200
 that's happened in this field.

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:02.560
 Okay, sure, so there's a lack of transparency, sort of authenticity

1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:07.120
 about communicating the things that failed in the past.

1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:10.920
 And so you don't have a clear picture of like firm ground

1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:12.080
 that you're standing on.

1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:13.840
 But again, those are sociological things.

1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:18.720
 And there's a bunch of questions I want to ask you.

1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:26.720
 So one, what's your intuition about why the original idea failed?

1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:32.480
 So what can you say about why you're pretty sure it has failed?

1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:35.400
 I mean, the initial idea was, as I try to explain it,

1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:39.000
 it was quite seductive in that you could see why Whitten

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:40.440
 and others got excited by it.

1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:45.000
 It was, you know, at the time it looked like there were only

1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.600
 a few of these possible clobby owls that would work.

1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:50.000
 And it looked like, okay, we just have to understand

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:53.160
 this very specific model and these very specific

1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:55.760
 six dimensional spaces, and we're going to get everything.

1:03:55.760 --> 1:03:59.240
 And so it was a very seductive idea, but it just, you know,

1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:03.120
 as people learned, worked more and more about it,

1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:07.280
 it just didn't, they just kind of realized that there are just

1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:09.240
 more and more things you can do with these six dimensions

1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:12.720
 and you can't, and this is just not going to work.

1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:21.240
 Meaning like, it's, I mean, what was the failure mode here?

1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:24.200
 Is it, you could just have an infinite number of possibilities

1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:27.160
 that you could do so you can come up with any theory you want,

1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:30.720
 you can fit quantum mechanics, you can explain gravity,

1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:32.880
 you can explain anything you want with it.

1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:34.280
 Is that the basic failure mode?

1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:37.120
 Yeah, so it's a failure mode of kind of that this idea

1:04:37.120 --> 1:04:39.920
 ended up being kind of being essentially empty,

1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:43.240
 that it just doesn't, ends up not telling you anything

1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:47.280
 because it's consistent with just about anything.

1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:50.760
 And so, I mean, there's a complex, if you try and talk

1:04:50.760 --> 1:04:52.280
 with string theorists about this now, I mean,

1:04:52.280 --> 1:04:54.720
 there's an argument, there's a long argument over this

1:04:54.720 --> 1:04:58.960
 about whether, oh no, no, no, maybe there still are

1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:01.680
 constraints coming out of this idea or not.

1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:06.160
 Or maybe we live in a multiverse and everything is true

1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:10.200
 anyway, so you can, there are various ways you can kind of,

1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:12.520
 that string theorists have kind of react to this kind of

1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:15.520
 argument that I'm making, but I try to hold onto it.

1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:18.880
 What about experimental validation?

1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:23.880
 Is that a fair standard to hold before a theory

1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:27.360
 of everything that's trying to unify

1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:28.960
 quantum mechanics and gravity?

1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:31.360
 Yeah, I mean, ultimately, to be really convinced

1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:36.680
 that some new idea about unification really works,

1:05:36.680 --> 1:05:39.720
 you need some kind of, you need to look at the real world

1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:44.200
 and see that this is telling you something true about it.

1:05:44.200 --> 1:05:49.200
 I mean, either telling you that if you do some experiment

1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:52.440
 and go out and do it, you'll get some unexpected result

1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:57.240
 and that's the kind of gold standard, or it may be just that

1:05:57.240 --> 1:05:58.840
 like all those numbers that are,

1:05:58.840 --> 1:06:00.060
 we don't know how to explain,

1:06:00.060 --> 1:06:02.200
 it will show you how to calculate them.

1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:05.260
 I mean, it can be various kinds of experimental validation,

1:06:05.260 --> 1:06:08.640
 but that's certainly ideally what you're looking for.

1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:11.240
 How tough is this, do you think, for a theory of everything,

1:06:11.240 --> 1:06:13.880
 not just string theory, for something that unifies

1:06:13.880 --> 1:06:14.960
 gravity and quantum mechanics,

1:06:14.960 --> 1:06:17.520
 so the very big and the very small?

1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:20.200
 Is this, let me ask you one way,

1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:25.200
 is it a physics problem, a math problem,

1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:27.920
 or an engineering problem?

1:06:27.920 --> 1:06:30.420
 My guess is it's a combination of a physics

1:06:30.420 --> 1:06:32.720
 and a math problem that you really need.

1:06:33.820 --> 1:06:36.520
 It's not really engineering, it's not like there's some kind

1:06:36.520 --> 1:06:39.400
 of well defined thing you can write down

1:06:39.400 --> 1:06:41.540
 and we just don't have enough computer power

1:06:41.540 --> 1:06:43.240
 to do the calculation.

1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:46.320
 That's not the kind of problem it is at all.

1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:49.400
 But the question is, what mathematical tools you need

1:06:49.400 --> 1:06:53.440
 to properly formulate the problem is unclear.

1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:55.960
 So one reasonable conjecture is the way,

1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:58.760
 the reason that we haven't had any success yet

1:06:58.760 --> 1:07:01.600
 is just that we're missing,

1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:04.240
 either we're missing certain physical ideas

1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:06.260
 or we're missing certain mathematical tools,

1:07:06.260 --> 1:07:08.440
 which there are some combination of them,

1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:12.740
 which we need to kind of properly formulate the problem

1:07:12.740 --> 1:07:15.760
 and see that it has a solution

1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:17.280
 that looks like the real world.

1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:19.400
 But those you need, I guess you don't,

1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:24.400
 but there's a sense that you need both gravity,

1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:27.360
 like all the laws of physics to be operating

1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:28.440
 on the same level.

1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:31.580
 So it feels like you need an object like a black hole

1:07:31.580 --> 1:07:36.580
 or something like that in order to make predictions about.

1:07:38.100 --> 1:07:40.360
 Otherwise, you're always making predictions

1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:45.280
 about this joint phenomena or can you do that

1:07:45.280 --> 1:07:46.960
 as long as the theory is consistent

1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:48.840
 and doesn't have special cases for each of the phenomena?

1:07:48.840 --> 1:07:50.600
 Well, your theory should, I mean,

1:07:50.600 --> 1:07:52.160
 if your theory is gonna include gravity,

1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:53.520
 our current understanding of gravity

1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:54.720
 is that you should have,

1:07:56.340 --> 1:07:57.840
 there should be black hole states in it.

1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:00.040
 You should be able to describe black holes in this theory.

1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:04.320
 And just one aspect that people have concentrated a lot on

1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:06.640
 is just this kind of questions about

1:08:06.640 --> 1:08:09.880
 if your theory includes black holes like it's supposed to

1:08:09.880 --> 1:08:11.840
 and it includes quantum mechanics,

1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:13.880
 then there's certain kinds of paradoxes which come up.

1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:16.120
 And so that's been a huge focus of kind of

1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:19.360
 quantum gravity work has been just those paradoxes.

1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:23.240
 So stepping outside of string theory,

1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:26.520
 can you just say first at a high level,

1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:28.560
 what is the theory of everything?

1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:31.280
 What is the theory of everything seek to accomplish?

1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:34.760
 Well, I mean, this is very much a kind of reductionist

1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:38.080
 point of view in the sense that, so it's not a theory.

1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:42.320
 This is not gonna explain to you anything.

1:08:42.320 --> 1:08:44.520
 It doesn't really, this kind of theory,

1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:46.260
 this kind of theory of everything we're talking about

1:08:46.260 --> 1:08:48.320
 doesn't say anything interesting,

1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:50.240
 particularly about like macroscopic objects,

1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:52.320
 about what the weather is gonna be tomorrow,

1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:54.800
 or things are happening at this scale.

1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:57.240
 But just what we've discovered is that

1:08:57.240 --> 1:09:01.080
 as you look at the universe that kind of,

1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:05.640
 if you kind of start, you can start breaking it apart

1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:08.440
 into, and you end up with some fairly simple pieces,

1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:11.160
 quanta, if you like, and which are doing,

1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:14.480
 which are interacting in some fairly simple way.

1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:18.880
 And it's, so what we mean by theory of everything is

1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:24.160
 a theory that describes all the object,

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:26.840
 all the correct objects you need to describe

1:09:26.840 --> 1:09:29.080
 what's happening in the world and describes how

1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:30.160
 they're interacting with each other

1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:31.880
 at our most fundamental level.

1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:36.800
 How you get from that theory to describing some macroscopic,

1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:38.840
 incredibly complicated thing is,

1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:41.160
 there that becomes, again, more of an engineering problem

1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:42.640
 and you may need machine learning,

1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:44.740
 or you may, you know, a lot of very different things

1:09:44.740 --> 1:09:45.580
 to do it, but.

1:09:45.580 --> 1:09:48.760
 Well, I don't even think it's just engineering.

1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:50.400
 It's also science.

1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:55.200
 One thing that I find kind of interesting

1:09:55.200 --> 1:10:00.200
 talking to physicists is a little bit, there's a,

1:10:05.300 --> 1:10:07.220
 a little bit of hubris.

1:10:07.220 --> 1:10:09.740
 Some of the most brilliant people I know are physicists,

1:10:09.740 --> 1:10:12.340
 both philosophy and just in terms of mathematics,

1:10:12.340 --> 1:10:14.300
 in terms of understanding the world.

1:10:14.300 --> 1:10:18.060
 But there's a kind of either hubris or what would I call it?

1:10:19.500 --> 1:10:22.740
 Like a confidence that if we have a theory of everything,

1:10:22.740 --> 1:10:24.500
 we will understand everything.

1:10:24.500 --> 1:10:26.740
 Like this is the deepest thing to understand.

1:10:26.740 --> 1:10:29.820
 And I would say, and like the rest is details, right?

1:10:29.820 --> 1:10:31.600
 That's the old Rutherford thing.

1:10:33.140 --> 1:10:37.940
 But to me, there's like, this is like a cake or something.

1:10:37.940 --> 1:10:39.140
 There's layers to this thing

1:10:39.140 --> 1:10:42.020
 and each one has a theory of everything.

1:10:42.020 --> 1:10:46.580
 Like at every level from biology,

1:10:46.580 --> 1:10:50.860
 like how life originates, that itself,

1:10:50.860 --> 1:10:52.700
 like complex systems.

1:10:52.700 --> 1:10:56.860
 Like that in itself is like this gigantic thing

1:10:56.860 --> 1:10:58.860
 that requires a theory of everything.

1:10:58.860 --> 1:11:01.680
 And then there's the, in the space of humans,

1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:04.700
 psychology, like intelligence, collective intelligence,

1:11:04.700 --> 1:11:07.180
 the way it emerges among species,

1:11:07.180 --> 1:11:09.260
 that feels like a complex system

1:11:09.260 --> 1:11:11.580
 that requires its own theory of everything.

1:11:11.580 --> 1:11:15.460
 On top of that is things like in the computing space,

1:11:15.460 --> 1:11:16.820
 artificial intelligence systems,

1:11:16.820 --> 1:11:19.460
 like that feels like it needs a theory of everything.

1:11:19.460 --> 1:11:24.460
 And it's almost like once we solve,

1:11:24.780 --> 1:11:26.660
 once we come up with a theory of everything

1:11:26.660 --> 1:11:28.500
 that explains the basic laws of physics

1:11:28.500 --> 1:11:30.320
 that gave us the universe,

1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:32.620
 even stuff that's super complex,

1:11:32.620 --> 1:11:37.120
 like how the universe might be able to originate,

1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:39.460
 even explaining something that you're not a big fan of,

1:11:39.460 --> 1:11:40.940
 like multiverses or stuff

1:11:40.940 --> 1:11:42.900
 that we don't have any evidence of yet.

1:11:42.900 --> 1:11:47.580
 Still, we won't be able to have a strong explanation

1:11:47.580 --> 1:11:52.580
 of why food tastes delicious.

1:11:52.700 --> 1:11:53.660
 Yeah, I know.

1:11:53.660 --> 1:11:55.620
 No, anyway, yeah, I agree completely.

1:11:55.620 --> 1:11:58.700
 I mean, there is something kind of completely wrong

1:11:58.700 --> 1:12:00.860
 with this terminology of theory of everything.

1:12:00.860 --> 1:12:04.100
 It's not, it's really in some sense a very bad term,

1:12:04.100 --> 1:12:06.420
 very hubristic and bad terminology,

1:12:06.420 --> 1:12:09.060
 because it's not, this is explaining,

1:12:11.020 --> 1:12:13.160
 this is a purely kind of reductionist point of view

1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:15.260
 that you're trying to understand

1:12:15.260 --> 1:12:17.900
 a certain very specific kind of things,

1:12:17.900 --> 1:12:22.900
 which in principle, other things emerge from,

1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:27.660
 but to actually understand how anything emerges from this

1:12:27.660 --> 1:12:30.780
 is, it can't be understood in terms of

1:12:31.740 --> 1:12:35.740
 this underlying fundamental theory is gonna be hopeless

1:12:35.740 --> 1:12:38.320
 in terms of kind of telling you what about this,

1:12:39.620 --> 1:12:40.980
 this various emergent behavior.

1:12:40.980 --> 1:12:43.060
 And as you go to different levels of explanation,

1:12:43.060 --> 1:12:44.660
 you're gonna need to develop new,

1:12:44.660 --> 1:12:46.100
 different, completely different ideas,

1:12:46.100 --> 1:12:47.380
 completely different ways of thinking.

1:12:47.380 --> 1:12:52.380
 And I guess there's a famous kind of Phil Anderson's slogan

1:12:52.500 --> 1:12:54.380
 is that, you know, more is different.

1:12:54.380 --> 1:12:59.300
 And so it's just, even once you understand how,

1:12:59.300 --> 1:13:00.580
 what a couple of things,

1:13:00.580 --> 1:13:01.940
 if you have a collection of stuff

1:13:01.940 --> 1:13:03.220
 and you understand perfectly well

1:13:03.220 --> 1:13:07.320
 how each thing is interacting with the others,

1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:08.600
 what the whole thing is gonna do

1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:10.160
 is just a completely different problem.

1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:12.260
 It's just not, and you need completely different ways

1:13:12.260 --> 1:13:13.520
 of thinking about it.

1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:15.100
 What do you think about this?

1:13:15.100 --> 1:13:17.420
 I got to ask you at a few different attempts

1:13:17.420 --> 1:13:20.060
 that a theory of everything, especially recently.

1:13:20.060 --> 1:13:23.240
 So I've been for many years,

1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:25.620
 a big fan of cellular automata of complex systems.

1:13:25.620 --> 1:13:28.140
 And obviously because of that,

1:13:28.140 --> 1:13:31.500
 a fan of Stephen Wolfram's work in that space,

1:13:31.500 --> 1:13:35.180
 but he's recently been talking about a theory of everything

1:13:35.180 --> 1:13:38.100
 through his physics project, essentially.

1:13:38.100 --> 1:13:40.340
 What do you think about this kind of discreet

1:13:40.340 --> 1:13:45.140
 theory of everything like from simple rules

1:13:45.140 --> 1:13:47.660
 and simple objects on the hypergraphs

1:13:47.660 --> 1:13:51.500
 emerges all of our reality where time and space are emergent.

1:13:51.500 --> 1:13:53.980
 Basically everything we see around us is emergent.

1:13:53.980 --> 1:13:55.420
 Yeah, I have to say, unfortunately,

1:13:55.420 --> 1:13:58.440
 I've kind of pretty much zero sympathy for that.

1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:01.660
 I mean, I don't, I spent a little time looking at it

1:14:01.660 --> 1:14:04.940
 and I just don't see, it doesn't seem to me to get anywhere.

1:14:04.940 --> 1:14:08.780
 And it really is just really, really doesn't agree at all

1:14:08.780 --> 1:14:10.900
 with what I'm seeing,

1:14:10.900 --> 1:14:13.180
 this kind of unification of math and physics

1:14:13.180 --> 1:14:15.440
 that I'm kind of talking about around certain kinds

1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:17.860
 of very deep ideas about geometry and stuff.

1:14:17.860 --> 1:14:22.400
 This, if you want to believe that your things

1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:25.140
 are really coming out of cellular automata

1:14:25.140 --> 1:14:26.780
 at the most fundamental level,

1:14:26.780 --> 1:14:30.480
 you have to believe that everything that I've seen

1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:34.340
 my whole career and as beautiful, powerful ideas,

1:14:34.340 --> 1:14:35.740
 that that's all just kind of a mirage,

1:14:35.740 --> 1:14:38.200
 which just kind of randomly is emerging

1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:41.480
 from these more basic, very, very simple minded things.

1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:44.980
 And you have to give me some serious evidence for that

1:14:44.980 --> 1:14:46.240
 and I'm seeing nothing.

1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:50.420
 So Mirage, you don't think there could be a consistency

1:14:50.420 --> 1:14:54.500
 where things like quantum mechanics could emerge

1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:57.640
 from much, much, much smaller, discreet,

1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:00.100
 like computational type systems.

1:15:00.100 --> 1:15:02.540
 I think from the point of view of certain mathematical

1:15:02.540 --> 1:15:06.400
 point of view, quantum mechanics is already mathematically

1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:07.420
 as simple as it gets.

1:15:07.420 --> 1:15:12.420
 It really is a story about really the fundamental objects

1:15:13.620 --> 1:15:16.420
 that you work within when you write down a quantum theory

1:15:16.420 --> 1:15:18.500
 are in some form point of view,

1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:20.180
 precisely the fundamental objects

1:15:21.220 --> 1:15:22.900
 at these deepest levels of mathematics

1:15:22.900 --> 1:15:25.060
 that you're working with, they're exactly the same.

1:15:25.060 --> 1:15:28.460
 So, and cellular automata are something completely different

1:15:28.460 --> 1:15:30.000
 which don't fit into these structures.

1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.540
 And so I just don't see why, anyway,

1:15:32.540 --> 1:15:37.340
 I don't see it as a promising thing to do.

1:15:37.340 --> 1:15:38.580
 And then just looking at it and saying,

1:15:38.580 --> 1:15:39.480
 does this go anywhere?

1:15:39.480 --> 1:15:42.440
 Does this solve any problem that I've ever,

1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:45.300
 that I didn't, does this solve any problem of any kind?

1:15:45.300 --> 1:15:46.740
 I just don't see it.

1:15:46.740 --> 1:15:50.580
 Yeah, to me, cellular automata and these hypergraphs,

1:15:50.580 --> 1:15:55.280
 I'm not sure solving a problem is even the standard

1:15:55.280 --> 1:15:57.700
 to apply here at this moment.

1:15:57.700 --> 1:16:00.580
 To me, the fascinating thing is that the question it asks

1:16:00.580 --> 1:16:02.020
 have no good answers.

1:16:02.020 --> 1:16:04.580
 So there's not good math explaining,

1:16:04.580 --> 1:16:06.020
 forget the physics of it,

1:16:06.020 --> 1:16:09.180
 math explaining the behavior of complex systems.

1:16:09.180 --> 1:16:12.340
 And that to me is both exciting and paralyzing.

1:16:12.340 --> 1:16:15.380
 Like we're at the very early days of understanding

1:16:17.100 --> 1:16:19.980
 how complicated and fascinating things emerge

1:16:19.980 --> 1:16:21.300
 from simple rules.

1:16:21.300 --> 1:16:22.740
 Yeah, and I agree.

1:16:22.740 --> 1:16:25.460
 I think that is a truly great problem.

1:16:25.460 --> 1:16:28.120
 And depending where it goes, it may be,

1:16:30.940 --> 1:16:33.600
 it may start to develop some kind of connections

1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:36.740
 to the things that I've kind of found more fruitful

1:16:36.740 --> 1:16:38.740
 and hard to know.

1:16:38.740 --> 1:16:41.380
 It just, I think a lot of that area,

1:16:41.380 --> 1:16:45.740
 I kind of strongly feel I best not say too much about it

1:16:45.740 --> 1:16:48.220
 because I just, I don't know too much about it.

1:16:48.220 --> 1:16:51.580
 And again, we're back to this original problem

1:16:51.580 --> 1:16:54.340
 that your time in life is limited.

1:16:54.340 --> 1:16:55.780
 You have to figure out what you're gonna spend

1:16:55.780 --> 1:16:56.820
 your time thinking about.

1:16:56.820 --> 1:16:59.060
 And that's something I've just never seen enough

1:16:59.060 --> 1:17:01.460
 to convince me to spend more time thinking about.

1:17:01.460 --> 1:17:03.940
 Well, also timing, it's not just that our time is limited,

1:17:03.940 --> 1:17:07.180
 but the timing of the kind of things you think about.

1:17:07.180 --> 1:17:09.740
 There's some aspect to cellular automata,

1:17:09.740 --> 1:17:12.820
 these kinds of objects that it feels like

1:17:12.820 --> 1:17:17.820
 we're very many years away from having big breakthroughs on.

1:17:18.260 --> 1:17:20.420
 And so it's like, you have to pick the problems

1:17:20.420 --> 1:17:21.780
 that are solvable today.

1:17:21.780 --> 1:17:26.400
 In fact, my intuition, again, perhaps biased,

1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:30.180
 is it feels like the kind of systems that,

1:17:30.180 --> 1:17:32.840
 complex systems that cellular automata are,

1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:35.100
 would not be solved by human brains.

1:17:36.260 --> 1:17:40.300
 It feels like something post human

1:17:40.300 --> 1:17:41.840
 that will solve that problem.

1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:45.020
 Or like significantly enhanced humans,

1:17:45.020 --> 1:17:47.700
 meaning like using computational tools,

1:17:47.700 --> 1:17:51.740
 very powerful computational tools to crack

1:17:51.740 --> 1:17:53.120
 these problems open.

1:17:54.420 --> 1:17:58.140
 That's if our approach to science,

1:17:58.140 --> 1:18:00.420
 our ability to understand science, our ability

1:18:00.420 --> 1:18:02.500
 to understand physics will become more and more

1:18:02.500 --> 1:18:04.660
 computational, or there'll be a whole field

1:18:04.660 --> 1:18:06.300
 that's computational in nature,

1:18:06.300 --> 1:18:07.740
 which currently is not the case.

1:18:07.740 --> 1:18:12.460
 Currently, computation is the thing that sort of assists us

1:18:12.460 --> 1:18:15.640
 in understanding science the way we've been doing it

1:18:15.640 --> 1:18:17.980
 all along, but if there's a whole new,

1:18:17.980 --> 1:18:20.540
 I mean, we're from a new kind of science, right?

1:18:20.540 --> 1:18:23.360
 It's a little bit dramatic, but you know,

1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:28.360
 if computers could do science on their own,

1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:33.680
 computational systems, perhaps that's the way

1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:35.600
 they would do the science.

1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:37.760
 They would try to understand the cellular automata,

1:18:37.760 --> 1:18:39.980
 and that feels like we're decades away.

1:18:39.980 --> 1:18:43.980
 So perhaps it'll crack open some interesting facets

1:18:43.980 --> 1:18:46.320
 of this physics problem, but it's very far away.

1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:48.680
 So timing is everything.

1:18:48.680 --> 1:18:51.040
 That's perfectly possible, yeah.

1:18:51.040 --> 1:18:53.640
 Well, let me ask you then, in the space of geometry,

1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:57.280
 I don't know how well you know Eric Weinstein.

1:18:57.280 --> 1:18:58.320
 Oh, quite well, yeah.

1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.600
 What are your thoughts about his geometric community

1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:05.760
 and the space of ideas that he's playing with

1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:09.800
 in his proposal for theory of everything?

1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:14.140
 Well, I think that he has, he fundamentally has,

1:19:14.140 --> 1:19:17.800
 I think, the same problems that everybody has had

1:19:17.800 --> 1:19:20.960
 trying to do this, and there are really versions

1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:25.960
 of the same problem that you try to get unity

1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:28.840
 by putting everything into some bigger structure.

1:19:28.840 --> 1:19:33.460
 So he has some other ones that are not so conventional

1:19:33.460 --> 1:19:35.040
 that he's trying to work with,

1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:39.620
 but he has the same problem that even if he can,

1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:43.640
 if he can get a lot farther in terms of having

1:19:43.640 --> 1:19:45.860
 a really well defined, well understood,

1:19:45.860 --> 1:19:50.300
 clear picture of these things he's working with,

1:19:50.300 --> 1:19:53.240
 they're really kind of large geometrical structures

1:19:53.240 --> 1:19:55.160
 of many dimensions of many kinds,

1:19:55.160 --> 1:19:57.400
 and I just don't see any way,

1:19:57.400 --> 1:19:59.520
 he's gonna have the same problem the string theorists have,

1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:02.680
 how do you get back down to the structures

1:20:02.680 --> 1:20:06.860
 of the standard model, and how do you, yeah.

1:20:06.860 --> 1:20:10.760
 So I just, anyway, it's the same,

1:20:10.760 --> 1:20:13.320
 and there's another interesting example

1:20:13.320 --> 1:20:16.040
 of a similar kind of thing is Garrett Leasy's

1:20:16.040 --> 1:20:17.400
 theory of everything.

1:20:17.400 --> 1:20:20.040
 Again, there, it's a little bit more specific

1:20:20.040 --> 1:20:22.520
 than Eric's, he's working with this E8,

1:20:22.520 --> 1:20:25.980
 but it, again, I think all these things found

1:20:25.980 --> 1:20:27.880
 are at the same point, that you don't,

1:20:29.480 --> 1:20:30.760
 you know, you create this unity,

1:20:30.760 --> 1:20:34.920
 but then you have no, you don't actually have a good idea

1:20:34.920 --> 1:20:37.880
 how you're gonna get back to the actual,

1:20:40.880 --> 1:20:42.680
 to the objects we've seen, how are you gonna,

1:20:42.680 --> 1:20:43.920
 you create these big symmetries,

1:20:43.920 --> 1:20:45.340
 how are you gonna break them?

1:20:45.340 --> 1:20:47.480
 And, because we don't see those symmetries

1:20:47.480 --> 1:20:49.720
 in the real world, and so ultimately,

1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:53.840
 there would need to be a simple process

1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:56.280
 for collapsing it to four dimensions.

1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:58.480
 You'd have to explain, well, yeah,

1:20:58.480 --> 1:21:01.000
 I forget in his case, but it's not just four dimensions,

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:05.400
 it's also these structures you see in the standard model,

1:21:05.400 --> 1:21:07.600
 there's, you know, there's certain very small

1:21:07.600 --> 1:21:09.160
 dimensional groups of symmetries,

1:21:09.160 --> 1:21:13.800
 so called U1, SU2, and SU3, and the problem with,

1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:15.240
 and this has been a problem since the beginning,

1:21:15.240 --> 1:21:18.880
 almost immediately after 1973, about a year later,

1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:20.600
 two years later, people started talking about

1:21:20.600 --> 1:21:24.280
 grand unified theories, so you take the U1,

1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:27.120
 the SU2, and the SU3, and you put them together

1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:31.520
 into this bigger structure called SU5 or SO10,

1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:33.560
 but then you're stuck with this problem that,

1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:36.440
 wait a minute, now how, why does the world not look,

1:21:36.440 --> 1:21:40.960
 why do I not see these SU5 symmetries in the world,

1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:45.960
 I only see these, and so, and I think, you know,

1:21:45.960 --> 1:21:49.880
 the kind of thing that Eric, and all of a sudden Garrett,

1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:51.000
 and lots of people who try to do it,

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:55.160
 they all kind of found her in that same way,

1:21:55.160 --> 1:21:57.660
 that they don't have a good answer to that.

1:21:58.560 --> 1:22:01.800
 Are there lessons, ideas to be learned from theories

1:22:01.800 --> 1:22:04.040
 like that, from Garrett Leacy's, from Eric's?

1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:07.080
 I don't know, it depends, I have to confess,

1:22:07.080 --> 1:22:11.020
 I haven't looked that closely at Eric's,

1:22:11.020 --> 1:22:14.240
 I mean, he explained this to me personally a few times,

1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:16.640
 and I've looked a bit at his paper, but it's,

1:22:17.560 --> 1:22:19.280
 again, we're back to the problem

1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:21.080
 of a limited amount of time in life.

1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:24.760
 Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting effect, right?

1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:28.840
 Why don't more physicists look at it?

1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:35.960
 I mean, I'm in this position that somehow,

1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:38.400
 you know,

1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:43.400
 I've, people write me emails, for whatever reason,

1:22:45.700 --> 1:22:47.460
 and I've worked in the space of AI,

1:22:47.460 --> 1:22:49.180
 and so there's a lot of people,

1:22:49.180 --> 1:22:52.300
 perhaps AI is even way more accessible than physics,

1:22:52.300 --> 1:22:54.980
 in a certain sense, and so a lot of people write to me

1:22:54.980 --> 1:22:56.720
 with different theories about what they have

1:22:56.720 --> 1:23:00.000
 for how to create general intelligence,

1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.380
 and it's, again, a little bit of an excuse, I say to myself,

1:23:03.380 --> 1:23:05.420
 like, well, I only have a limited amount of time,

1:23:05.420 --> 1:23:07.940
 so that's why I'm not investigating it,

1:23:07.940 --> 1:23:11.620
 but I wonder if there's ideas out there

1:23:11.620 --> 1:23:14.700
 that are still powerful, that are still fascinating,

1:23:14.700 --> 1:23:19.700
 and that I'm missing because I'm dismissing them

1:23:21.360 --> 1:23:24.740
 because they're outside of the sort of the usual process

1:23:24.740 --> 1:23:26.780
 of academic research.

1:23:26.780 --> 1:23:28.340
 Yeah, well, I mean, the same thing,

1:23:28.340 --> 1:23:29.940
 and pretty much every day in my email,

1:23:29.940 --> 1:23:32.980
 there's somebody who's got a theory or everything

1:23:32.980 --> 1:23:35.180
 about why all of what physicists are doing,

1:23:35.180 --> 1:23:38.940
 and perhaps the most disturbing thing I should say

1:23:38.940 --> 1:23:41.740
 about being a critic of string theory

1:23:41.740 --> 1:23:43.900
 is that when you realize who your fans are,

1:23:45.700 --> 1:23:47.060
 every day I hear from somebody who says,

1:23:47.060 --> 1:23:48.620
 oh, well, since you don't like string theory,

1:23:48.620 --> 1:23:49.980
 you must, of course, agree with me

1:23:49.980 --> 1:23:52.260
 that this is the right way to think about everything.

1:23:52.260 --> 1:23:57.260
 Oh, no, oh, no, and most of these are,

1:23:57.620 --> 1:24:00.800
 you quickly can see this person doesn't know very much

1:24:00.800 --> 1:24:02.500
 and doesn't know what they're doing,

1:24:02.500 --> 1:24:05.100
 but there's a whole continuum to,

1:24:05.100 --> 1:24:08.060
 people who are quite serious physicists and mathematicians

1:24:08.060 --> 1:24:10.380
 who are making a fairly serious attempt

1:24:10.380 --> 1:24:14.620
 to try to do something, like Eric and Eric,

1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:19.620
 and then your problem is you do try to spend more time

1:24:21.380 --> 1:24:22.600
 looking at it and trying to figure out

1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:23.700
 what they're really doing,

1:24:23.700 --> 1:24:26.220
 but then at some point you just realize,

1:24:26.220 --> 1:24:28.220
 wait a minute, for me to really, really understand

1:24:28.220 --> 1:24:32.340
 exactly what's going on here would just take time

1:24:32.340 --> 1:24:33.620
 I just don't have.

1:24:33.620 --> 1:24:36.940
 Yeah, it takes a long time, which is the nice thing about AI

1:24:36.940 --> 1:24:41.140
 is unlike the kind of physics we're talking about,

1:24:41.140 --> 1:24:46.140
 if your idea is good, that should quite naturally lead

1:24:46.660 --> 1:24:49.820
 to you being able to build a system that's intelligent.

1:24:49.820 --> 1:24:52.280
 So you don't need to get approval from somebody

1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:54.460
 that's saying you have a good idea here.

1:24:54.460 --> 1:24:56.940
 You can just utilize that idea in an engineer system,

1:24:56.940 --> 1:24:58.860
 like naturally leads to engineering.

1:24:58.860 --> 1:25:01.940
 With physics here, if you have a perfect theory

1:25:01.940 --> 1:25:06.060
 that explains everything, that still doesn't obviously lead

1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:11.060
 one, to scientific experiments that can validate

1:25:12.020 --> 1:25:15.700
 that theory, and two, to like trinkets you can build

1:25:15.700 --> 1:25:18.580
 and sell at a store for $5.

1:25:18.580 --> 1:25:20.220
 You can't make money off of it.

1:25:21.220 --> 1:25:23.660
 So that makes it much more challenging.

1:25:25.820 --> 1:25:28.580
 Well, let me also ask you about something that you found,

1:25:28.580 --> 1:25:30.540
 especially recently appealing,

1:25:30.540 --> 1:25:32.840
 which is Roger Penrose's Twister theory.

1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:35.180
 What is it?

1:25:35.180 --> 1:25:37.820
 What kind of questions might it allow us to answer?

1:25:37.820 --> 1:25:39.900
 What will the answers look like?

1:25:39.900 --> 1:25:41.620
 It's only in the last couple of years

1:25:41.620 --> 1:25:43.380
 that I really, really kind of come to really,

1:25:43.380 --> 1:25:46.060
 I think, to appreciate it and to see how to really,

1:25:46.060 --> 1:25:48.500
 I believe to see how to really do something with it.

1:25:48.500 --> 1:25:49.980
 And I've gotten very excited about that

1:25:49.980 --> 1:25:51.220
 the last year or two.

1:25:51.220 --> 1:25:54.820
 I mean, one way of saying one idea of Twister theory

1:25:54.820 --> 1:25:59.080
 is that it's a different way of thinking about

1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:01.660
 what space and time are and about what points

1:26:01.660 --> 1:26:05.100
 in space and time are, which is very interesting

1:26:05.100 --> 1:26:07.420
 that it only really works in four dimensions.

1:26:07.420 --> 1:26:09.700
 So four dimensions behaves very, very specially

1:26:09.700 --> 1:26:11.180
 unlike other dimensions.

1:26:11.180 --> 1:26:14.500
 And in four dimensions, there is a way of thinking

1:26:14.500 --> 1:26:17.580
 about space and time geometry,

1:26:17.580 --> 1:26:21.280
 as well as just thinking about points in space and time.

1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:25.140
 You can also think about different objects,

1:26:25.140 --> 1:26:26.240
 these so called twisters.

1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:27.860
 And then when you do that,

1:26:27.860 --> 1:26:30.900
 you end up with a kind of a really interesting insight

1:26:30.900 --> 1:26:35.340
 that you can formulate a theory,

1:26:35.340 --> 1:26:37.100
 and you can formulate a very,

1:26:37.100 --> 1:26:39.420
 take a standard theory that we formulate

1:26:39.420 --> 1:26:41.660
 in terms of points of space and time,

1:26:41.660 --> 1:26:44.460
 and you can reformulate in this Twister language.

1:26:44.460 --> 1:26:45.820
 And in this Twister language,

1:26:45.820 --> 1:26:50.460
 it's the fundamental objects actually are more kind of the,

1:26:51.340 --> 1:26:54.140
 are actually spheres in some sense, kind of the light cone.

1:26:54.140 --> 1:26:56.900
 So maybe one way to say it,

1:26:56.900 --> 1:27:01.900
 which actually I think is really, is quite amazing.

1:27:02.100 --> 1:27:05.140
 If you ask yourself, what do we know about the world?

1:27:05.140 --> 1:27:07.900
 We have this idea that the world out there

1:27:07.900 --> 1:27:11.340
 is all these different points and these points of time.

1:27:11.340 --> 1:27:13.220
 Well, that's kind of a derived quantity.

1:27:13.220 --> 1:27:16.300
 What we really know about the world is when we open our eyes,

1:27:16.300 --> 1:27:17.460
 what do you see?

1:27:17.460 --> 1:27:19.580
 You see a sphere.

1:27:19.580 --> 1:27:23.100
 And that what you're looking at is you're looking at,

1:27:23.100 --> 1:27:26.420
 a sphere is worth of light rays coming into your eyes.

1:27:26.420 --> 1:27:29.140
 And what Penrose says is that,

1:27:29.140 --> 1:27:33.820
 well, what a point in space time is, is that sphere,

1:27:33.820 --> 1:27:36.620
 that sphere of all the light rays coming in.

1:27:36.620 --> 1:27:39.180
 And he says, and you should formulate your,

1:27:39.180 --> 1:27:40.700
 instead of thinking about points,

1:27:40.700 --> 1:27:43.100
 you should think about the space of those spheres,

1:27:43.100 --> 1:27:46.860
 if you like, and formulate the degrees of freedom

1:27:46.860 --> 1:27:50.020
 as physics as living on those spheres, living on,

1:27:50.020 --> 1:27:51.940
 so you're kind of living on,

1:27:51.940 --> 1:27:53.660
 your degrees of freedom are living on light rays,

1:27:53.660 --> 1:27:55.180
 not on points.

1:27:55.180 --> 1:28:00.180
 And it's a very different way of thinking about physics.

1:28:00.660 --> 1:28:03.260
 And he and others working with him developed

1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:08.260
 a beautiful mathematical formulas

1:28:08.420 --> 1:28:11.540
 and a way to go back from forth between some aspects

1:28:11.540 --> 1:28:14.180
 of our standard way we write these things down

1:28:14.180 --> 1:28:17.380
 and work in the so called twister space.

1:28:17.380 --> 1:28:20.380
 And certain things worked out very well,

1:28:20.380 --> 1:28:24.940
 but they ended up, I think kind of stuck by the 80s or 90s

1:28:24.940 --> 1:28:27.980
 that they weren't a little bit like string theory

1:28:27.980 --> 1:28:31.220
 that they, by using these ideas about twisters,

1:28:31.220 --> 1:28:33.100
 they could develop them in different directions

1:28:33.100 --> 1:28:34.780
 and find all sorts of other interesting things,

1:28:34.780 --> 1:28:36.900
 but they were getting,

1:28:36.900 --> 1:28:38.580
 they weren't finding any way of doing that

1:28:38.580 --> 1:28:43.140
 that brought them back to kind of new insights into physics.

1:28:43.140 --> 1:28:46.420
 And my own, I mean, what's kind of gotten me excited really

1:28:46.420 --> 1:28:49.700
 is what I think I have an idea about

1:28:49.700 --> 1:28:52.580
 that I think does actually work,

1:28:52.580 --> 1:28:54.180
 that goes more in that direction.

1:28:54.180 --> 1:28:56.780
 And I can go on about that endlessly

1:28:56.780 --> 1:28:57.820
 or talk a little bit about it,

1:28:57.820 --> 1:29:02.620
 but that's the, I think that's the one kind of easy

1:29:02.620 --> 1:29:05.260
 to explain insight about twister theory.

1:29:05.260 --> 1:29:06.860
 There are some more technical ones.

1:29:06.860 --> 1:29:09.340
 I should mean, I think it's also very convincing

1:29:09.340 --> 1:29:11.260
 what it tells you about spinners, for instance,

1:29:11.260 --> 1:29:12.980
 but that's a more technical.

1:29:12.980 --> 1:29:14.980
 Well, first let's like linger on the spheres

1:29:14.980 --> 1:29:16.100
 and the light cones.

1:29:17.460 --> 1:29:20.780
 You're saying twisted theory allows you to make

1:29:20.780 --> 1:29:23.740
 that the fundamental object with which you're operating.

1:29:23.740 --> 1:29:24.660
 Yeah.

1:29:24.660 --> 1:29:26.340
 How that, I mean, first of all,

1:29:26.340 --> 1:29:30.820
 like philosophically that's weird and beautiful,

1:29:32.260 --> 1:29:34.500
 maybe because it maps,

1:29:34.500 --> 1:29:37.020
 it feels like it moves us so much closer

1:29:37.020 --> 1:29:40.500
 to the way human brains perceive reality.

1:29:40.500 --> 1:29:41.340
 Yeah.

1:29:41.340 --> 1:29:46.340
 So it's almost like our perception is like the content

1:29:46.340 --> 1:29:51.340
 of our perception is the fundamental object of reality.

1:29:54.580 --> 1:29:55.900
 That's very appealing.

1:29:55.900 --> 1:29:57.260
 Yeah.

1:29:57.260 --> 1:30:00.660
 Is it mathematically powerful?

1:30:01.860 --> 1:30:04.740
 Is there something you can say,

1:30:04.740 --> 1:30:06.540
 can you say a little bit more about what the heck

1:30:06.540 --> 1:30:08.380
 that even means for,

1:30:08.380 --> 1:30:11.260
 because it's much easier to think about mathematically

1:30:11.260 --> 1:30:13.740
 like a point in space time.

1:30:13.740 --> 1:30:16.900
 What does it mean to be operating on the light cone?

1:30:16.900 --> 1:30:19.380
 It uses a kind of mathematics that's relative,

1:30:19.380 --> 1:30:22.060
 that kind of goes back to the 19th century

1:30:22.060 --> 1:30:23.020
 among mathematicians.

1:30:23.020 --> 1:30:26.420
 It's not, anyway, it's a bit of a long story,

1:30:26.420 --> 1:30:28.860
 but one problem is that you have to start,

1:30:28.860 --> 1:30:31.700
 it's crucial that you think in terms of complex numbers

1:30:31.700 --> 1:30:32.900
 and not just real numbers.

1:30:32.900 --> 1:30:36.340
 And this, for most people, that makes it harder to,

1:30:36.340 --> 1:30:37.620
 for mathematicians, that's fine.

1:30:37.620 --> 1:30:38.460
 We love doing that.

1:30:38.460 --> 1:30:41.380
 But for most people, that makes it harder to think about.

1:30:41.380 --> 1:30:43.100
 I think perhaps the most,

1:30:43.100 --> 1:30:45.540
 the way that there is something you can say

1:30:45.540 --> 1:30:49.060
 very specifically about it in terms of spinners,

1:30:49.060 --> 1:30:50.060
 which I don't know if you want to,

1:30:50.060 --> 1:30:52.340
 I think at some point you want to talk, so maybe you can.

1:30:52.340 --> 1:30:53.340
 What are spinners?

1:30:53.340 --> 1:30:54.180
 Let's start with spinners,

1:30:54.180 --> 1:30:55.980
 because I think that if we can introduce that,

1:30:55.980 --> 1:30:57.300
 then I can say it.

1:30:57.300 --> 1:31:01.020
 By the way, twister is spelled with an O

1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:03.700
 and spinner is spelled with an O as well.

1:31:03.700 --> 1:31:05.260
 Yes, okay.

1:31:05.260 --> 1:31:07.660
 In case you want to Google it and look it up,

1:31:07.660 --> 1:31:10.940
 there's very nice Wikipedia pages as a starting point.

1:31:10.940 --> 1:31:12.380
 I don't know what is a good starting point

1:31:12.380 --> 1:31:13.540
 for twister theory.

1:31:13.540 --> 1:31:16.060
 Well, one thing you say about Penrose,

1:31:16.060 --> 1:31:18.100
 I mean, Penrose is actually a very good writer

1:31:18.100 --> 1:31:19.380
 and also a very good draftsman.

1:31:19.380 --> 1:31:22.020
 He's a draftsman, to the extent this is visualizable,

1:31:22.020 --> 1:31:23.700
 he actually has done some very nice drawings.

1:31:23.700 --> 1:31:26.460
 So, I mean, almost any kind of expository thing

1:31:26.460 --> 1:31:29.820
 you can find him writing is a very good place to start.

1:31:29.820 --> 1:31:32.540
 He's a remarkable person.

1:31:32.540 --> 1:31:36.060
 But the, so spinners are something

1:31:36.060 --> 1:31:38.380
 that independently came out of mathematics

1:31:38.380 --> 1:31:40.060
 and out of physics.

1:31:40.060 --> 1:31:42.620
 And to say where they came out of physics,

1:31:42.620 --> 1:31:44.620
 I mean, what people realized when they started looking

1:31:44.620 --> 1:31:47.580
 at elementary particles like electrons or whatever,

1:31:47.580 --> 1:31:51.660
 that there seem to be some kind of doubling

1:31:51.660 --> 1:31:53.140
 of the degrees of freedom going on.

1:31:53.140 --> 1:31:57.060
 If you counted what was there in some sense

1:31:57.060 --> 1:31:58.180
 in the way you would expect it

1:31:58.180 --> 1:32:00.020
 and when you started doing quantum mechanics

1:32:00.020 --> 1:32:01.780
 and started looking at elementary particles,

1:32:01.780 --> 1:32:03.700
 there were seen to be two degrees of freedom,

1:32:03.700 --> 1:32:04.900
 they're not one.

1:32:04.900 --> 1:32:09.860
 And one way of seeing it was that if you put your electron

1:32:09.860 --> 1:32:13.860
 in a strong magnetic field and asked what was the energy

1:32:13.860 --> 1:32:15.540
 of it, instead of it having one energy,

1:32:15.540 --> 1:32:17.940
 it would have two energies, there'd be two energy levels.

1:32:17.940 --> 1:32:20.500
 And as you increase magnetic field,

1:32:20.500 --> 1:32:22.100
 the splitting would increase.

1:32:22.100 --> 1:32:24.980
 So physicists kind of realized that, wait a minute.

1:32:24.980 --> 1:32:27.020
 So we thought when we were doing,

1:32:27.020 --> 1:32:28.260
 first started doing quantum mechanics,

1:32:28.260 --> 1:32:31.660
 that the way to describe particles was in terms

1:32:31.660 --> 1:32:33.540
 of wave functions and these wave functions

1:32:33.540 --> 1:32:35.860
 were complex to complex values.

1:32:35.860 --> 1:32:38.020
 Well, if we actually look at particles,

1:32:38.020 --> 1:32:38.860
 that that's not right.

1:32:38.860 --> 1:32:42.060
 They're pairs of complex numbers.

1:32:42.060 --> 1:32:44.100
 They're pairs of complex numbers.

1:32:44.100 --> 1:32:46.900
 So one of the kind of fundamental,

1:32:46.900 --> 1:32:47.820
 from the physics point of view,

1:32:47.820 --> 1:32:50.220
 the fundamental question is why are all our kind

1:32:50.220 --> 1:32:53.900
 of fundamental particles described

1:32:53.900 --> 1:32:55.740
 by pairs of complex numbers?

1:32:55.740 --> 1:32:56.740
 Just weird.

1:32:56.740 --> 1:33:00.220
 And then you can ask, well, what happens

1:33:00.220 --> 1:33:03.140
 if you like take an electron and rotate it?

1:33:03.140 --> 1:33:08.140
 So how do things move in this pair of complex numbers?

1:33:08.140 --> 1:33:10.940
 Well, now, if you go back to mathematics,

1:33:10.940 --> 1:33:13.860
 what had been understood in mathematics,

1:33:13.860 --> 1:33:16.380
 some years earlier, not that many years earlier,

1:33:16.380 --> 1:33:20.500
 was that if you ask very, very generally,

1:33:20.500 --> 1:33:24.260
 think about geometry of three dimensions and ask,

1:33:24.260 --> 1:33:25.820
 and if you think about things that are happening

1:33:25.820 --> 1:33:28.260
 in three dimensions in the standard way,

1:33:28.260 --> 1:33:30.500
 everything, the standard way of doing geometry,

1:33:30.500 --> 1:33:32.540
 everything is about vectors, right?

1:33:32.540 --> 1:33:35.220
 So if you've taken any mathematics classes,

1:33:35.220 --> 1:33:36.700
 you probably see vectors at some point.

1:33:36.700 --> 1:33:39.420
 They're just triplets of numbers tell you

1:33:39.420 --> 1:33:41.620
 what a direction is or how far you're going

1:33:41.620 --> 1:33:42.980
 in three dimensional space.

1:33:42.980 --> 1:33:46.260
 And most of everything we teach in most standard courses

1:33:46.260 --> 1:33:49.700
 in mathematics is about vectors

1:33:49.700 --> 1:33:51.420
 and things you build out of vectors.

1:33:51.420 --> 1:33:53.060
 So you express everything about geometry

1:33:53.060 --> 1:33:55.420
 in terms of vectors or how they're changing

1:33:55.420 --> 1:33:57.620
 or how you put two of them together

1:33:57.620 --> 1:34:00.940
 and get planes and whatever.

1:34:00.940 --> 1:34:03.660
 But what had been realized that,

1:34:03.660 --> 1:34:05.820
 Rianna, is that if you ask very, very generally,

1:34:05.820 --> 1:34:09.140
 what are the, if you have, what are the things

1:34:09.140 --> 1:34:13.020
 that you can kind of consistently think about rotating?

1:34:13.020 --> 1:34:16.340
 And so you ask a technical question,

1:34:16.340 --> 1:34:18.620
 what are the representations of the rotation group?

1:34:18.620 --> 1:34:22.220
 Well, you find that one answer is they're vectors

1:34:22.220 --> 1:34:24.660
 and everything you build out of vectors,

1:34:24.660 --> 1:34:26.420
 but then people found, but wait a minute,

1:34:26.420 --> 1:34:29.220
 there's also these other things,

1:34:29.220 --> 1:34:31.820
 which you can build out of vectors,

1:34:31.820 --> 1:34:34.420
 but which you can consistently rotate.

1:34:34.420 --> 1:34:37.020
 And they're described by pairs of complex numbers,

1:34:37.020 --> 1:34:38.420
 by two complex numbers.

1:34:38.420 --> 1:34:40.580
 And they're the spinners also.

1:34:40.580 --> 1:34:43.020
 And to make a lot, and to make,

1:34:43.020 --> 1:34:45.060
 and you can think of spinners in some sense

1:34:45.060 --> 1:34:46.660
 as more fundamental than vectors

1:34:46.660 --> 1:34:48.860
 because you can build vectors out of spinners.

1:34:48.860 --> 1:34:51.180
 You can take two spinners and make a vector,

1:34:51.180 --> 1:34:54.940
 but you can't, if you only have vectors,

1:34:54.940 --> 1:34:56.620
 you can't get spinners.

1:34:56.620 --> 1:34:59.220
 So they're in some sense, there's some kind of level

1:34:59.220 --> 1:35:02.140
 of lower level of geometry beyond what we thought it was,

1:35:02.140 --> 1:35:04.260
 which was kind of spinner geometry.

1:35:04.260 --> 1:35:07.340
 And this is something which even to this day,

1:35:07.340 --> 1:35:09.460
 when we teach graduate courses in geometry,

1:35:09.460 --> 1:35:11.700
 we mostly don't talk about this

1:35:11.700 --> 1:35:15.380
 because it's a bit hard to do correctly.

1:35:15.380 --> 1:35:18.860
 If you start with your whole setup is in terms of vectors,

1:35:20.420 --> 1:35:22.020
 describing things in terms of spinners

1:35:22.020 --> 1:35:24.020
 is a whole different ball game.

1:35:24.860 --> 1:35:28.780
 But anyway, it was just this amazing fact

1:35:28.780 --> 1:35:33.020
 that this kind of more fundamental piece of geometry,

1:35:33.020 --> 1:35:35.500
 spinners, and what we were actually seeing,

1:35:35.500 --> 1:35:37.900
 if you look at electron, are one and the same.

1:35:37.900 --> 1:35:41.300
 So it's, I think it's kind of a mind blowing thing,

1:35:41.300 --> 1:35:44.860
 but it's very counterintuitive.

1:35:44.860 --> 1:35:47.020
 What are some weird properties of spinners

1:35:47.020 --> 1:35:50.220
 that are counterintuitive?

1:35:50.220 --> 1:35:51.540
 That there are some things that they do,

1:35:51.540 --> 1:35:56.300
 for instance, if you rotate a spinner around 360 degrees,

1:35:56.300 --> 1:35:58.260
 it doesn't come back towards,

1:35:58.260 --> 1:36:00.020
 it becomes minus what it was.

1:36:00.020 --> 1:36:04.660
 Or, so it's, anyway, so the way rotations work,

1:36:04.660 --> 1:36:05.900
 there's a kind of a funny sign

1:36:05.900 --> 1:36:08.180
 you have to keep track of in some sense.

1:36:08.180 --> 1:36:11.020
 So they're kind of too valued in another weird way.

1:36:11.020 --> 1:36:14.700
 But the fundamental problem is that it's just not,

1:36:14.700 --> 1:36:17.540
 if you're used to visualizing vectors,

1:36:17.540 --> 1:36:19.600
 you just, there's nothing you can do

1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:20.560
 visualizing in terms of vectors

1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:21.860
 that will ever give you a spinner.

1:36:21.860 --> 1:36:23.820
 It just is not gonna ever work.

1:36:23.820 --> 1:36:26.600
 As you were saying that I was visualizing a vector

1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:29.100
 walking along a Mobius strip,

1:36:29.100 --> 1:36:30.880
 and it ends up being upside down.

1:36:32.460 --> 1:36:34.820
 But you're saying that doesn't really capture.

1:36:34.820 --> 1:36:36.860
 So, I mean, what really captures it?

1:36:36.860 --> 1:36:39.460
 The problem is that it's really,

1:36:39.460 --> 1:36:41.020
 the simplest way to describe it

1:36:41.020 --> 1:36:43.420
 is in terms of two complex numbers.

1:36:43.420 --> 1:36:45.060
 And your problem with two complex numbers

1:36:45.060 --> 1:36:46.820
 is that's four real numbers.

1:36:46.820 --> 1:36:50.540
 So your spinner kind of lies in a four dimensional space.

1:36:50.540 --> 1:36:53.820
 So you, that makes it hard to visualize.

1:36:53.820 --> 1:36:57.540
 And it's crucial that it's not just any four dimensions.

1:36:57.540 --> 1:36:59.340
 It's just, it's actually complex numbers.

1:36:59.340 --> 1:37:01.740
 You're really gonna use the fact that

1:37:01.740 --> 1:37:03.180
 these are two complex numbers.

1:37:03.180 --> 1:37:06.140
 So it's very hard to visualize.

1:37:06.140 --> 1:37:09.300
 But to get back to what I think is mind blowing

1:37:09.300 --> 1:37:11.980
 about twisters is that the,

1:37:11.980 --> 1:37:15.780
 another way of saying this idea about talking about spheres,

1:37:15.780 --> 1:37:18.640
 another way of saying the fundamental idea of twister theory

1:37:18.640 --> 1:37:21.540
 is in some sense, the fundamental idea of twister theory

1:37:21.540 --> 1:37:26.540
 is that a point is a two complex dimensional space.

1:37:28.700 --> 1:37:32.020
 So that every, and that it lives inside,

1:37:32.020 --> 1:37:34.540
 the space that it lies inside is twister space.

1:37:34.540 --> 1:37:36.700
 So in the simplest case, it's four,

1:37:36.700 --> 1:37:38.480
 twister space is four dimensional

1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:40.820
 and a point in space time

1:37:40.820 --> 1:37:44.900
 is a two complex dimensional subspace

1:37:44.900 --> 1:37:47.500
 of all the four complex dimensions.

1:37:47.500 --> 1:37:49.000
 And as you move around in space time,

1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.620
 you're just moving, your planes are just moving around.

1:37:51.620 --> 1:37:52.460
 Okay.

1:37:52.460 --> 1:37:54.540
 And that, but then the.

1:37:54.540 --> 1:37:56.980
 So it's a plane in a four dimensional space.

1:37:56.980 --> 1:37:58.660
 It's a plane.

1:37:58.660 --> 1:37:59.480
 Complex.

1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:00.320
 Complex plane.

1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:03.060
 So it's two complex dimensions in four complex.

1:38:03.060 --> 1:38:03.900
 Got it.

1:38:03.900 --> 1:38:05.780
 But then to me, the mind blowing thing about this

1:38:05.780 --> 1:38:09.380
 is this then kind of tautologically answers the question

1:38:09.380 --> 1:38:10.380
 is what is a spinner?

1:38:10.380 --> 1:38:14.100
 Well, a spinner is a point.

1:38:14.100 --> 1:38:17.920
 I mean, the space of spinners at a point is the point.

1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:21.520
 In twister theory, the points are the complex two planes.

1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:24.620
 And you want me to, and you're asking what a spinner is.

1:38:24.620 --> 1:38:28.260
 Well, a spinner, the space of spinners is that two plane.

1:38:28.260 --> 1:38:31.820
 So it's, you know, just your whole definition

1:38:31.820 --> 1:38:33.380
 of what a point in space time was

1:38:33.380 --> 1:38:35.180
 just told you what a spinner was.

1:38:35.180 --> 1:38:37.220
 It's, they're just, it's the same thing.

1:38:37.220 --> 1:38:38.500
 Yeah, but we're trying to project that

1:38:38.500 --> 1:38:39.760
 into a three dimensional space

1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:42.300
 and trying to intuit, but you can't.

1:38:42.300 --> 1:38:44.140
 Yeah, so the intuition becomes very difficult,

1:38:44.140 --> 1:38:49.140
 but from, if you don't, not using twister theory,

1:38:49.740 --> 1:38:51.300
 you have to kind of go through a certain

1:38:51.300 --> 1:38:54.600
 fairly complicated rigmarole to even describe spinners

1:38:54.600 --> 1:38:55.980
 to describe electrons.

1:38:55.980 --> 1:38:57.220
 Whereas using twister theory,

1:38:57.220 --> 1:38:58.820
 it's just completely tautological.

1:38:58.820 --> 1:39:03.100
 They're just what you want to describe.

1:39:03.100 --> 1:39:05.980
 The electron is fundamentally the way

1:39:05.980 --> 1:39:08.180
 that you're describing the point in space time already.

1:39:08.180 --> 1:39:09.880
 It's just there, so.

1:39:10.740 --> 1:39:11.580
 Do you have a hope?

1:39:11.580 --> 1:39:14.940
 You mentioned that you found it appealing recently.

1:39:14.940 --> 1:39:17.260
 Is it just because of certain aspects

1:39:17.260 --> 1:39:18.500
 of its mathematical beauty,

1:39:18.500 --> 1:39:19.660
 or do you actually have a hope

1:39:19.660 --> 1:39:22.580
 that this might lead to a theory of everything?

1:39:22.580 --> 1:39:25.120
 Yeah, I mean, I certainly do have such a hope

1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:27.980
 because what I've found, I think the thing which I've done,

1:39:27.980 --> 1:39:29.740
 which I don't think, as far as I can tell,

1:39:29.740 --> 1:39:33.380
 no one had really looked at from this point of view before

1:39:33.380 --> 1:39:38.380
 is, has to do with this question of how do you treat time

1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:40.840
 in your quantum theory?

1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:44.440
 And so there's another long story

1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:46.700
 about how we do quantum theories

1:39:46.700 --> 1:39:48.700
 and about how we treat time in quantum theories,

1:39:48.700 --> 1:39:51.780
 which is a long story.

1:39:51.780 --> 1:39:55.580
 But the short version of it is that what people have found

1:39:55.580 --> 1:39:58.460
 when you try and write down a quantum theory,

1:39:58.460 --> 1:40:03.460
 that it's often a good idea to take your time coordinate,

1:40:05.220 --> 1:40:07.100
 whatever you're using to your time coordinate,

1:40:07.100 --> 1:40:09.920
 and multiply it by the square root of minus one

1:40:09.920 --> 1:40:11.980
 and to make it purely imaginary.

1:40:11.980 --> 1:40:13.580
 And so all these formulas,

1:40:13.580 --> 1:40:18.460
 which you have in your standard theory,

1:40:18.460 --> 1:40:19.900
 if you do that to those,

1:40:19.900 --> 1:40:23.660
 I mean, those formulas have some very strange behavior

1:40:23.660 --> 1:40:25.380
 and they're kind of singular.

1:40:25.380 --> 1:40:27.800
 If you ask even some simple questions,

1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:31.020
 you have to take very delicate singular limits

1:40:31.020 --> 1:40:33.260
 in order to get the correct answer,

1:40:33.260 --> 1:40:35.060
 and you have to take them from the right direction,

1:40:35.060 --> 1:40:36.980
 otherwise it doesn't work.

1:40:36.980 --> 1:40:39.980
 Whereas if you just take time,

1:40:39.980 --> 1:40:42.120
 and if you just put a factor of square root of minus one,

1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:44.240
 wherever you see the time coordinate,

1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:47.340
 you end up with much simpler formulas,

1:40:47.340 --> 1:40:49.900
 which are much better behaved mathematically.

1:40:49.900 --> 1:40:52.900
 And what I hadn't really appreciated until fairly recently

1:40:52.900 --> 1:40:55.500
 is also how dramatically that changes

1:40:55.500 --> 1:40:57.260
 the whole structure of the theory.

1:40:57.260 --> 1:40:59.800
 You end up with a consistent way of talking

1:40:59.800 --> 1:41:01.600
 about these quantum theories,

1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:04.280
 but it has some very different flavor

1:41:04.280 --> 1:41:07.380
 and very different aspects that I hadn't really appreciated.

1:41:07.380 --> 1:41:10.900
 And in particular, the way symmetries act on it

1:41:10.900 --> 1:41:15.060
 is not at all what I originally had expected.

1:41:15.060 --> 1:41:17.660
 And so that's the new thing that I have,

1:41:17.660 --> 1:41:19.580
 or I think gives you something,

1:41:19.580 --> 1:41:21.820
 is to do this move,

1:41:21.820 --> 1:41:26.340
 which people often think of as just kind of a mathematical

1:41:26.340 --> 1:41:27.380
 trick that you're doing

1:41:27.380 --> 1:41:29.780
 to make some formulas work out nicely,

1:41:29.780 --> 1:41:33.180
 but to take that mathematical trick as really fundamental.

1:41:33.180 --> 1:41:35.940
 And it turns out in Twister theory

1:41:35.940 --> 1:41:39.540
 allows you to simultaneously talk about your usual time

1:41:39.540 --> 1:41:41.900
 and the time times the square root of minus one,

1:41:41.900 --> 1:41:45.500
 they both fit very nicely into Twister theory.

1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:48.380
 And you end up with some structures

1:41:48.380 --> 1:41:50.460
 which look a lot like the standard models.

1:41:51.980 --> 1:41:54.140
 Well, let me ask you about some Nobel prizes.

1:41:54.140 --> 1:41:55.300
 Okay.

1:41:55.300 --> 1:41:56.660
 Do you think there will be,

1:41:56.660 --> 1:42:01.660
 there was a bet between Michio Kaku

1:42:01.780 --> 1:42:04.100
 and somebody else about.

1:42:04.100 --> 1:42:05.020
 John Horgan.

1:42:05.020 --> 1:42:07.380
 John Horgan about,

1:42:07.380 --> 1:42:09.140
 by the way, maybe discover a cool website,

1:42:09.140 --> 1:42:11.140
 longbets.com or.org.

1:42:11.140 --> 1:42:11.980
 Better, yeah, yeah.

1:42:11.980 --> 1:42:12.980
 Yeah, it's cool.

1:42:12.980 --> 1:42:15.340
 It's cool that you can make a bet with people

1:42:16.380 --> 1:42:18.860
 and then check in 20 years later.

1:42:18.860 --> 1:42:19.700
 I really love it.

1:42:19.700 --> 1:42:21.300
 There's a lot of interesting bets on there.

1:42:21.300 --> 1:42:22.460
 I would love to participate,

1:42:22.460 --> 1:42:24.020
 but it's interesting to see,

1:42:24.020 --> 1:42:27.460
 time flies and you make a bet about

1:42:27.460 --> 1:42:28.900
 what's going to happen in 20 years.

1:42:28.900 --> 1:42:31.900
 You don't realize 20 years just goes like this.

1:42:31.900 --> 1:42:33.700
 And then you get to face out

1:42:33.700 --> 1:42:38.700
 and you get to wonder what was that person?

1:42:39.620 --> 1:42:41.060
 What was I thinking?

1:42:41.060 --> 1:42:42.780
 That person 20 years ago

1:42:42.780 --> 1:42:43.900
 was almost like a different person.

1:42:43.900 --> 1:42:46.340
 What was I thinking back then to think that?

1:42:46.340 --> 1:42:47.500
 It's interesting.

1:42:47.500 --> 1:42:49.620
 So let me ask you this on record,

1:42:49.620 --> 1:42:54.020
 20 years from now or some number of years from now,

1:42:54.020 --> 1:42:55.780
 do you think there will be a Nobel Prize given

1:42:55.780 --> 1:42:58.300
 for something directly connected

1:42:58.300 --> 1:43:01.740
 to a first broadly theory of everything?

1:43:01.740 --> 1:43:05.980
 And second, of course, one of the possibilities,

1:43:05.980 --> 1:43:08.240
 one of them, string theory?

1:43:10.940 --> 1:43:13.420
 String theory, definitely not.

1:43:13.420 --> 1:43:16.180
 Things have gone, yeah.

1:43:16.180 --> 1:43:18.140
 So if you were giving financial advice,

1:43:18.140 --> 1:43:19.140
 you would say not to bet on that?

1:43:19.140 --> 1:43:20.380
 No, do not.

1:43:20.380 --> 1:43:22.660
 And even, I actually suspect

1:43:22.660 --> 1:43:24.260
 if you ask string theorists that question,

1:43:24.260 --> 1:43:27.500
 you're gonna get a few of them saying,

1:43:27.500 --> 1:43:29.620
 I mean, if you'd asked them that question 20 years ago,

1:43:29.620 --> 1:43:32.140
 again, when Kaku was making this bet or whatever,

1:43:32.140 --> 1:43:35.460
 I think some of them would have taken you up on it.

1:43:35.460 --> 1:43:37.020
 And certainly back in 1984,

1:43:37.020 --> 1:43:39.020
 a bunch of them would have said, oh, sure, yeah.

1:43:39.020 --> 1:43:41.420
 But now I get the impression that

1:43:43.060 --> 1:43:45.700
 even they realize that things are not looking good

1:43:45.700 --> 1:43:46.900
 for that particular idea.

1:43:46.900 --> 1:43:48.620
 Again, it depends what you mean by string theory,

1:43:48.620 --> 1:43:51.940
 whether maybe the term will evolve to mean something else,

1:43:51.940 --> 1:43:53.800
 which will work out.

1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:57.400
 But I don't think that's not gonna like it to work out,

1:43:57.400 --> 1:43:59.060
 whether something else.

1:43:59.060 --> 1:44:01.220
 I mean, I still think it's relatively unlikely

1:44:01.220 --> 1:44:04.940
 that you'll have any really successful theory of everything.

1:44:04.940 --> 1:44:07.480
 And the main problem is just the,

1:44:08.900 --> 1:44:11.980
 it's become so difficult to do experiments at higher energy

1:44:11.980 --> 1:44:13.620
 that we've really lost this ability

1:44:13.620 --> 1:44:18.620
 to kind of get unexpected input from experiment.

1:44:19.140 --> 1:44:22.260
 And you can, while it's maybe hard to figure out

1:44:22.260 --> 1:44:24.900
 what people's thinking is gonna be 20 years from now,

1:44:24.900 --> 1:44:28.780
 looking at high energy particle,

1:44:28.780 --> 1:44:30.940
 high energy colliders and their technology,

1:44:30.940 --> 1:44:33.580
 it's actually pretty easy to make a pretty accurate guess

1:44:33.580 --> 1:44:37.300
 what you're gonna be doing 20 years from now.

1:44:37.300 --> 1:44:42.300
 And I think actually, I would actually claim that

1:44:42.300 --> 1:44:44.540
 it's pretty clear where you're gonna be 20 years from now.

1:44:44.540 --> 1:44:47.540
 And what it's gonna be is you're gonna have the LHC,

1:44:50.020 --> 1:44:51.500
 you're gonna have a lot more data,

1:44:51.500 --> 1:44:56.100
 an order of magnitude or more data from the LHC,

1:44:56.100 --> 1:44:57.580
 but at the same energy.

1:44:57.580 --> 1:45:01.940
 You're not gonna see a higher energy accelerator

1:45:01.940 --> 1:45:05.340
 operating successfully in the next 20 years.

1:45:05.340 --> 1:45:08.140
 And like maybe machine learning

1:45:08.140 --> 1:45:10.240
 or great sort of data science methodologies

1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:12.580
 that process that data will not reveal

1:45:12.580 --> 1:45:17.380
 any major shifts in our understanding

1:45:17.380 --> 1:45:19.180
 of the underlying physics, you think?

1:45:19.180 --> 1:45:20.020
 I don't think so.

1:45:20.020 --> 1:45:23.060
 I mean, I think that field, my understanding

1:45:23.060 --> 1:45:26.940
 is they're starting to make a great use of those techniques,

1:45:26.940 --> 1:45:29.540
 but it seems to look like it will help them

1:45:29.540 --> 1:45:30.980
 solve certain technical problems

1:45:30.980 --> 1:45:32.500
 and be able to do things somewhat better,

1:45:32.500 --> 1:45:36.600
 but not completely change the way they're looking at things.

1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:39.580
 What do you think about the potential quantum computers

1:45:39.580 --> 1:45:41.300
 simulating quantum mechanical systems

1:45:41.300 --> 1:45:46.300
 and through that sneak up to sort of through simulation,

1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:51.540
 sneak up to a deep understanding of the fundamental physics?

1:45:51.540 --> 1:45:54.780
 The problem there is that that's promising more

1:45:54.780 --> 1:45:59.420
 for this, for Phil Anderson's problem,

1:45:59.420 --> 1:46:03.180
 that if you wanna, there's lots and lots of,

1:46:06.060 --> 1:46:08.580
 you start putting together lots and lots of things

1:46:08.580 --> 1:46:11.060
 and we think we know they're pair by pair interactions,

1:46:11.060 --> 1:46:13.380
 but what this thing is gonna do,

1:46:13.380 --> 1:46:16.540
 we don't have any good calculational techniques.

1:46:16.540 --> 1:46:19.540
 Quantum computers may very well give you those.

1:46:19.540 --> 1:46:21.660
 And so they may, what we think of

1:46:21.660 --> 1:46:23.260
 is kind of a strong coupling behavior.

1:46:23.260 --> 1:46:25.220
 We have no good way to calculate.

1:46:26.780 --> 1:46:28.300
 Even though we can write down the theory,

1:46:28.300 --> 1:46:31.580
 we don't know how to calculate anything with any accuracy

1:46:31.580 --> 1:46:34.620
 and the quantum computer may solve that problem.

1:46:34.620 --> 1:46:36.660
 But the problem is that I don't think

1:46:36.660 --> 1:46:38.140
 that they're gonna solve the problem

1:46:38.140 --> 1:46:39.220
 that they help you with the problem

1:46:39.220 --> 1:46:41.860
 of not having the, of knowing

1:46:41.860 --> 1:46:44.220
 what the right underlying theory is.

1:46:44.220 --> 1:46:48.580
 As somebody who likes experimental validation,

1:46:48.580 --> 1:46:51.300
 let me ask you the perhaps ridiculous sounding,

1:46:51.300 --> 1:46:53.300
 but I don't think it's actually a ridiculous question

1:46:53.300 --> 1:46:56.700
 of do you think we live in a simulation?

1:46:56.700 --> 1:46:58.340
 Do you find that thought experiment

1:46:58.340 --> 1:47:00.220
 at all useful or interesting?

1:47:00.220 --> 1:47:03.680
 Not really, I don't, it just doesn't.

1:47:03.680 --> 1:47:08.680
 Yeah, anyway, to me, it doesn't actually lead

1:47:08.700 --> 1:47:11.980
 to any kind of interesting, lead anywhere interesting.

1:47:11.980 --> 1:47:15.540
 Yeah, to me, so maybe I'll throw a wrench into your thing.

1:47:16.700 --> 1:47:17.860
 To me, it's super interesting

1:47:17.860 --> 1:47:19.620
 from an engineering perspective.

1:47:19.620 --> 1:47:21.860
 So if you look at virtual reality systems,

1:47:23.140 --> 1:47:28.140
 the actual question is how much computation

1:47:28.220 --> 1:47:32.980
 and how difficult is it to construct a world

1:47:32.980 --> 1:47:35.780
 that like there are several levels here.

1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:39.700
 One is you won't know the difference,

1:47:39.700 --> 1:47:41.340
 our human perception systems

1:47:41.340 --> 1:47:42.720
 and maybe even the tools of physics

1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:43.820
 won't know the difference

1:47:43.820 --> 1:47:46.180
 between the simulated world and the real world.

1:47:47.160 --> 1:47:51.020
 That's sort of more of a physics question.

1:47:51.020 --> 1:47:53.060
 The most interesting question to me

1:47:53.060 --> 1:47:55.740
 has more to do with why food tastes delicious,

1:47:55.740 --> 1:47:58.700
 which is create how difficult

1:47:58.700 --> 1:48:00.380
 and how much computation is required

1:48:00.380 --> 1:48:02.860
 to construct a simulation

1:48:02.860 --> 1:48:06.100
 where you kind of know it's a simulation at first,

1:48:06.100 --> 1:48:07.860
 but you want to stay there anyway.

1:48:07.860 --> 1:48:12.860
 And over time, you don't even remember.

1:48:13.340 --> 1:48:15.860
 Yeah, well, anyway, I agree,

1:48:15.860 --> 1:48:18.340
 these are kind of fascinating questions

1:48:18.340 --> 1:48:20.020
 and they may be very, very relevant

1:48:20.020 --> 1:48:21.900
 to our future as a species,

1:48:21.900 --> 1:48:26.060
 but yeah, they're just very far from anything I think.

1:48:26.060 --> 1:48:27.580
 Well, so from a physics perspective,

1:48:27.580 --> 1:48:29.420
 it's not useful to you to think,

1:48:29.420 --> 1:48:32.380
 taking a computational perspective to our universe,

1:48:32.380 --> 1:48:35.140
 thinking of it as an information processing system

1:48:35.140 --> 1:48:37.420
 and then they give it as doing computation

1:48:37.420 --> 1:48:39.440
 and then you think about the resources required

1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:42.260
 to do that kind of computation and all that kind of stuff.

1:48:42.260 --> 1:48:43.820
 You could just look at the basic physics

1:48:43.820 --> 1:48:46.700
 and who cares what the computer it's running on is.

1:48:46.700 --> 1:48:48.020
 Yeah, it just, I mean, the kinds of,

1:48:48.020 --> 1:48:49.940
 I mean, I'm willing to agree

1:48:49.940 --> 1:48:51.860
 that you can get into interesting kinds of questions

1:48:51.860 --> 1:48:52.820
 going down that road,

1:48:52.820 --> 1:48:55.220
 but they're just so different from anything

1:48:55.220 --> 1:48:57.420
 from what I've found interesting and I just,

1:48:57.420 --> 1:49:01.280
 again, I just have to kind of go back to life is too short

1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:03.700
 and I'm very glad other people are thinking about this,

1:49:03.700 --> 1:49:07.600
 but I just don't see anything I can do with it.

1:49:08.500 --> 1:49:11.480
 What about space itself?

1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:13.220
 So I have to ask you about aliens.

1:49:14.300 --> 1:49:17.680
 Again, something, since you emphasize evidence,

1:49:18.740 --> 1:49:20.820
 do you think there is, how many,

1:49:20.820 --> 1:49:23.000
 do you think there are and how many

1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.900
 intelligent alien civilizations are out there?

1:49:25.900 --> 1:49:28.540
 Yeah, I have no idea, but I have certainly,

1:49:28.540 --> 1:49:30.700
 as far as I know, unless the government's covering it up

1:49:30.700 --> 1:49:32.980
 or something, we haven't heard from,

1:49:32.980 --> 1:49:35.780
 we don't have any evidence for such things yet,

1:49:35.780 --> 1:49:37.540
 but there seems to be no,

1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:43.220
 there's no particular obstruction why there shouldn't be, so.

1:49:43.220 --> 1:49:47.460
 I mean, do you, you work on some fundamental questions

1:49:47.460 --> 1:49:49.140
 about the physics of reality.

1:49:49.140 --> 1:49:51.620
 When you look up to the stars,

1:49:51.620 --> 1:49:55.260
 do you think about whether somebody's looking back at us?

1:49:55.260 --> 1:49:56.100
 Yes, yeah, well, actually,

1:49:56.100 --> 1:49:58.140
 I originally got interested in physics.

1:49:58.140 --> 1:50:00.180
 I actually started out as a kid interested in astronomy,

1:50:00.180 --> 1:50:02.300
 exactly that, and a telescope and whatever that,

1:50:02.300 --> 1:50:05.620
 and certainly read a lot of science fiction

1:50:05.620 --> 1:50:08.340
 and thought about that.

1:50:08.340 --> 1:50:12.020
 I find over the years, I find myself kind of less,

1:50:12.020 --> 1:50:15.100
 anyway, less and less interested in that one,

1:50:15.100 --> 1:50:18.100
 just because I don't really know what to do with them.

1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:20.420
 I also kind of, at some point,

1:50:20.420 --> 1:50:23.060
 kind of stopped reading science fiction that much,

1:50:23.060 --> 1:50:25.140
 kind of feeling that there was just too,

1:50:25.140 --> 1:50:27.100
 that the actual science I was kind of learning about

1:50:27.100 --> 1:50:29.920
 was perfectly kind of weird and fascinating,

1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:33.140
 and unusual enough, and better than any of the stuff

1:50:33.140 --> 1:50:36.620
 that Isaac Asimov, so why should I?

1:50:36.620 --> 1:50:39.740
 Yeah, and you can mess with the science

1:50:39.740 --> 1:50:42.300
 much more than the distant science fiction,

1:50:43.180 --> 1:50:45.400
 the one that exists in our imagination

1:50:45.400 --> 1:50:48.320
 or the one that exists out there among the stars.

1:50:49.500 --> 1:50:51.180
 Well, you mentioned science fiction.

1:50:51.180 --> 1:50:54.060
 You've written quite a few book reviews.

1:50:54.060 --> 1:50:56.420
 I gotta ask you about some books, perhaps,

1:50:56.420 --> 1:50:57.580
 if you don't mind.

1:50:57.580 --> 1:51:02.580
 Is there one or two books that you would recommend to others

1:51:03.500 --> 1:51:07.020
 and maybe if you can, what ideas you drew from them?

1:51:09.300 --> 1:51:12.660
 Either negative recommendations or positive recommendations.

1:51:12.660 --> 1:51:15.220
 Do not read this book for sure.

1:51:15.220 --> 1:51:18.260
 Well, I must say, I mean, unfortunately,

1:51:18.260 --> 1:51:19.860
 yeah, you can go to my website

1:51:19.860 --> 1:51:21.700
 and you can click on book reviews

1:51:21.700 --> 1:51:24.060
 and you can see I've written, read a lot of,

1:51:24.060 --> 1:51:27.180
 a lot of, I mean, as you can tell from my views

1:51:27.180 --> 1:51:28.780
 about string theory, I'm not a fan

1:51:28.780 --> 1:51:31.020
 of a lot of the kind of popular books

1:51:31.020 --> 1:51:32.740
 about, oh, isn't string theory great?

1:51:32.740 --> 1:51:37.660
 And yes, I'm not a fan of a lot of things of that kind.

1:51:37.660 --> 1:51:40.420
 Can I ask you a quick question on this, a small tangent?

1:51:41.420 --> 1:51:46.420
 Are you a fan, can you explore the pros and cons

1:51:46.540 --> 1:51:50.700
 of, if I get string theory, sort of science communication,

1:51:51.620 --> 1:51:56.620
 sort of Cosmos style communication of concepts

1:51:56.620 --> 1:51:59.040
 to people that are outside of physics,

1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:02.240
 outside of mathematics, outside of even the sciences

1:52:02.240 --> 1:52:04.780
 and helping people to sort of dream

1:52:04.780 --> 1:52:07.560
 and fill them with awe about the full range

1:52:07.560 --> 1:52:09.080
 of mysteries in our universe?

1:52:10.420 --> 1:52:11.260
 That's a complicated issue.

1:52:11.260 --> 1:52:13.680
 You know, I think, you know, I certainly go back

1:52:13.680 --> 1:52:15.680
 and go back to like what inspired me

1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:18.440
 and maybe to connect it a little bit

1:52:18.440 --> 1:52:19.320
 to this question about books.

1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:21.540
 I mean, certainly when the books,

1:52:21.540 --> 1:52:23.980
 some books that I remember reading when I was a kid

1:52:23.980 --> 1:52:26.280
 were about the early history of quantum mechanics,

1:52:26.280 --> 1:52:29.080
 like Heisenberg's books that he wrote about, you know,

1:52:29.080 --> 1:52:31.120
 kind of looking back at telling the history

1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:32.960
 of what happened when he developed quantum mechanics.

1:52:32.960 --> 1:52:36.640
 It's just kind of a totally fascinating, romantic,

1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:40.040
 great story, and those were very inspirational to me.

1:52:40.040 --> 1:52:41.840
 And I would think maybe other people

1:52:41.840 --> 1:52:45.160
 might also find them that, but the...

1:52:45.160 --> 1:52:47.240
 And that's almost like the human story

1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:49.120
 of the development of the ideas.

1:52:49.120 --> 1:52:51.800
 Yeah, the human story, but yeah, just also how, you know,

1:52:51.800 --> 1:52:53.760
 there are these very, very weird ideas

1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:54.800
 that didn't seem to make sense,

1:52:54.800 --> 1:52:56.280
 and how they were struggling with them

1:52:56.280 --> 1:52:58.320
 and how, you know, they actually...

1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:01.840
 Anyway, it's, I think it's the period of physics

1:53:01.840 --> 1:53:06.080
 kind of beginning, you know, 1905 with Planck and Einstein

1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:08.400
 and ending up with the war

1:53:08.400 --> 1:53:11.280
 when these things get used to, you know,

1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:14.060
 make massively destructive weapons.

1:53:14.060 --> 1:53:15.720
 It's just the truly amazing...

1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:17.580
 And so many, so many new ideas.

1:53:17.580 --> 1:53:19.800
 Let me, on another, a tangent on top of a tangent

1:53:19.800 --> 1:53:21.500
 on top of a tangent, ask,

1:53:21.500 --> 1:53:26.500
 if we didn't have Einstein, so how does science progress?

1:53:26.740 --> 1:53:28.980
 Is it the lone geniuses?

1:53:28.980 --> 1:53:32.980
 Or is it some kind of weird network of ideas

1:53:32.980 --> 1:53:36.620
 swimming in the air and just kind of the geniuses

1:53:36.620 --> 1:53:39.260
 pop up to catch them and others would anyway?

1:53:39.260 --> 1:53:42.580
 Without Einstein, would we have special relativity,

1:53:42.580 --> 1:53:43.740
 general relativity?

1:53:44.740 --> 1:53:47.260
 I mean, it's an interesting case to case basis.

1:53:47.260 --> 1:53:51.820
 I mean, special relativity, I think we would have had,

1:53:51.820 --> 1:53:53.940
 I mean, there are other people.

1:53:53.940 --> 1:53:56.700
 Anyway, you could even argue that it was already there

1:53:56.700 --> 1:53:57.900
 in some form in some ways,

1:53:57.900 --> 1:54:00.340
 but I think special relativity you would have had

1:54:00.340 --> 1:54:03.300
 without Einstein fairly quickly.

1:54:03.300 --> 1:54:07.580
 General relativity, that was a much, much harder thing to do

1:54:07.580 --> 1:54:11.700
 and required a much more effort, much more sophisticated.

1:54:11.700 --> 1:54:13.960
 That I think you would have had sooner or later,

1:54:13.960 --> 1:54:16.820
 but it would have taken quite a bit longer.

1:54:16.820 --> 1:54:20.500
 That took a bunch of years to validate scientifically,

1:54:20.500 --> 1:54:21.700
 the general relativity.

1:54:21.700 --> 1:54:24.540
 But even for Einstein, from the point where he had

1:54:24.540 --> 1:54:26.820
 kind of a general idea of what he was trying to do

1:54:26.820 --> 1:54:29.900
 to the point where he actually had a well defined theory

1:54:29.900 --> 1:54:31.840
 that you could actually compare to the real world,

1:54:31.840 --> 1:54:35.340
 that was, I forget the number of the order of magnitude,

1:54:35.340 --> 1:54:36.720
 10 years of very serious work.

1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:39.740
 And if he hadn't been around to do that,

1:54:39.740 --> 1:54:41.900
 it would have taken a while before anyone else

1:54:41.900 --> 1:54:43.060
 got around to it.

1:54:43.060 --> 1:54:45.020
 On the other hand, there are things like,

1:54:45.020 --> 1:54:50.020
 with quantum mechanics, you have Heisenberg and Schrodinger

1:54:51.260 --> 1:54:55.140
 came up with two, which ultimately equivalent,

1:54:55.140 --> 1:54:58.180
 but two different approaches to it

1:54:58.180 --> 1:54:59.620
 within months of each other.

1:54:59.620 --> 1:55:02.380
 And so if Heisenberg hadn't been there,

1:55:02.380 --> 1:55:04.020
 you already would have had Schrodinger or whatever.

1:55:04.020 --> 1:55:05.180
 And if neither of them had been there,

1:55:05.180 --> 1:55:07.580
 it would have been somebody else a few months later.

1:55:07.580 --> 1:55:12.420
 So there are times when the, just the,

1:55:12.420 --> 1:55:16.540
 a lot often is the combination of the right ideas

1:55:16.540 --> 1:55:19.600
 are in place and the right experimental data is in place

1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:20.780
 to point in the right direction.

1:55:20.780 --> 1:55:24.140
 And it's just waiting for somebody who's gonna find it.

1:55:25.620 --> 1:55:28.380
 Maybe to go back to your aliens,

1:55:28.380 --> 1:55:30.780
 I guess the one thing that I often wonder about aliens is,

1:55:30.780 --> 1:55:33.940
 would they have the same fundamental physics ideas

1:55:33.940 --> 1:55:35.600
 as we have in mathematics?

1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:38.620
 Would their math, you know, would they, you know,

1:55:39.660 --> 1:55:42.140
 how much is this really intrinsic to our minds?

1:55:42.140 --> 1:55:43.780
 If you start out with a different kind of mind

1:55:43.780 --> 1:55:46.140
 when you end up with a different ideas

1:55:46.140 --> 1:55:47.340
 of what fundamental physics is

1:55:47.340 --> 1:55:49.820
 or what the structure of mathematics is.

1:55:49.820 --> 1:55:54.160
 So this is why, like if I was, you know,

1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:56.460
 I like video games, the way I would do it

1:55:56.460 --> 1:55:59.560
 as a curious being, so first experiment I'd like to do

1:55:59.560 --> 1:56:02.560
 is run Earth over many thousands of times

1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:06.700
 and see if our particular, no, you know what?

1:56:06.700 --> 1:56:08.140
 I wouldn't do the full evolution.

1:56:08.140 --> 1:56:10.180
 I would start at Homo sapiens first

1:56:10.180 --> 1:56:12.620
 and then see the evolution of Homo sapiens

1:56:12.620 --> 1:56:15.620
 millions of times and see how the ideas

1:56:15.620 --> 1:56:16.500
 of science would evolve.

1:56:16.500 --> 1:56:19.700
 Like, would you get, like how would physics evolve?

1:56:19.700 --> 1:56:21.340
 How would math evolves?

1:56:21.340 --> 1:56:22.720
 I would particularly just be curious

1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:24.760
 about the notation they come up with.

1:56:25.920 --> 1:56:28.420
 Every once in a while I would like throw miracles

1:56:28.420 --> 1:56:31.180
 at them to like, to mess with them and stuff.

1:56:31.180 --> 1:56:33.260
 And then I would also like to run Earth

1:56:33.260 --> 1:56:35.460
 from the very beginning to see if evolution

1:56:35.460 --> 1:56:37.220
 will produce different kinds of brains

1:56:37.220 --> 1:56:38.820
 that would then produce different kinds

1:56:38.820 --> 1:56:40.220
 of mathematics and physics.

1:56:40.220 --> 1:56:43.460
 And then finally, I would probably millions of times

1:56:43.460 --> 1:56:46.980
 run the universe over to see what kind of,

1:56:48.460 --> 1:56:52.260
 what kind of environments and what kind of life

1:56:52.260 --> 1:56:55.400
 would be created to then lead to intelligent life,

1:56:55.400 --> 1:56:59.100
 to then lead to theories of mathematics and physics

1:56:59.100 --> 1:57:00.840
 and to see the full range.

1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:04.940
 And like, sort of like Darwin kind of mark, okay.

1:57:04.940 --> 1:57:09.940
 It took them, what is it, several hundred million years

1:57:10.260 --> 1:57:13.780
 to come up with calculus.

1:57:13.780 --> 1:57:16.020
 I would just like keep noting how long it took

1:57:16.020 --> 1:57:19.020
 and get an average and see which ideas are difficult,

1:57:19.020 --> 1:57:23.420
 which are not and then conclusively sort of figure out

1:57:23.420 --> 1:57:27.340
 if it's more collective intelligence

1:57:27.340 --> 1:57:30.180
 or singular intelligence that's responsible for shifts

1:57:30.180 --> 1:57:33.820
 and for big phase shifts and breakthroughs in science.

1:57:33.820 --> 1:57:36.380
 If I was playing a video game and ran,

1:57:36.380 --> 1:57:38.260
 I got a chance to run this whole thing.

1:57:38.260 --> 1:57:41.620
 Yeah, but we're talking about books

1:57:41.620 --> 1:57:42.460
 before I distracted us horribly.

1:57:42.460 --> 1:57:44.420
 About books, okay, so books, yeah, go back, books.

1:57:44.420 --> 1:57:47.180
 Yeah, so and then, yeah, so that's one thing I'd recommend

1:57:47.180 --> 1:57:50.660
 is the books about the, from the original people,

1:57:50.660 --> 1:57:53.640
 especially Heisenberg about the, how that happened.

1:57:53.640 --> 1:57:55.740
 And there's also a very, very good kind of history

1:57:55.740 --> 1:58:00.460
 of the kind of what happened during this 20th century

1:58:00.460 --> 1:58:05.300
 in physics and up to the time of the Standard Model in 1973.

1:58:05.300 --> 1:58:10.300
 It's called The Second Creation by Bob Kreis and Mann.

1:58:10.380 --> 1:58:11.500
 That's one of the best ones.

1:58:11.500 --> 1:58:14.780
 I know that's, but the one thing that I can say is that,

1:58:14.780 --> 1:58:18.600
 so that book, I think, I forget when it was, late 80s, 90s.

1:58:20.320 --> 1:58:22.200
 The problem is that there just hasn't been much

1:58:22.200 --> 1:58:24.060
 that's actually worked out since then.

1:58:24.060 --> 1:58:26.660
 So most of the books that are kind of trying to tell you

1:58:26.660 --> 1:58:28.400
 about all the glorious things that have happened

1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:32.660
 since 1973 are, they're mostly telling you

1:58:32.660 --> 1:58:33.900
 about how glorious things are,

1:58:33.900 --> 1:58:35.260
 which actually don't really work.

1:58:35.260 --> 1:58:38.580
 And it's really, the argument people sometimes make

1:58:38.580 --> 1:58:41.540
 in favor of these books as well, oh, they're really great

1:58:41.540 --> 1:58:43.780
 because you want to do something that will get kids excited.

1:58:43.780 --> 1:58:45.780
 And then, so they're getting excited about things,

1:58:45.780 --> 1:58:47.700
 something that's not really quite working.

1:58:47.700 --> 1:58:50.720
 It doesn't really matter, the main thing is get them excited.

1:58:50.720 --> 1:58:53.580
 The other argument is, wait a minute,

1:58:53.580 --> 1:58:56.720
 if you're getting people excited about ideas that are wrong,

1:58:56.720 --> 1:58:59.000
 you're really kind of, you're actually kind of discrediting

1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:02.220
 the whole scientific enterprise in a not really good way.

1:59:02.220 --> 1:59:04.620
 So there's this problem.

1:59:04.620 --> 1:59:07.940
 So my general feeling about expository stuff is, yeah,

1:59:07.940 --> 1:59:10.660
 it's to the extent you can do it kind of honestly

1:59:10.660 --> 1:59:12.780
 and, well, that's great.

1:59:12.780 --> 1:59:14.760
 There are a lot of people doing that now,

1:59:14.760 --> 1:59:19.060
 but to the extent that you're just trying to get people

1:59:20.180 --> 1:59:22.940
 excited and enthusiastic by kind of telling them stuff,

1:59:22.940 --> 1:59:24.420
 which isn't really true,

1:59:24.420 --> 1:59:26.540
 you really shouldn't be doing that.

1:59:26.540 --> 1:59:28.980
 You obviously have a much better intuition about physics.

1:59:28.980 --> 1:59:32.660
 I tend to, in the space of AI, for example,

1:59:32.660 --> 1:59:37.620
 you could use certain kinds of language,

1:59:37.620 --> 1:59:41.300
 like calling things intelligent

1:59:41.300 --> 1:59:43.340
 that could rub people the wrong way.

1:59:43.340 --> 1:59:46.060
 But I never had a problem with that kind of thing,

1:59:46.060 --> 1:59:48.340
 saying that a program can learn its way

1:59:48.340 --> 1:59:52.180
 without any human supervision as AlphaZero does

1:59:52.180 --> 1:59:53.720
 to play chess.

1:59:53.720 --> 1:59:57.820
 To me, that may not be intelligence,

1:59:57.820 --> 2:00:01.660
 but it sure as heck seems like a few steps

2:00:01.660 --> 2:00:04.500
 down the path towards intelligence.

2:00:04.500 --> 2:00:09.060
 And so I think that's a very peculiar property

2:00:09.060 --> 2:00:10.860
 of systems that can be engineered.

2:00:10.860 --> 2:00:12.460
 So even if the idea is fuzzy,

2:00:12.460 --> 2:00:15.180
 even if you're not really sure what intelligence is,

2:00:15.180 --> 2:00:19.500
 or if you don't have a deep fundamental understanding

2:00:19.500 --> 2:00:21.620
 or even a model what intelligence is,

2:00:21.620 --> 2:00:24.500
 if you build a system that sure as heck is impressive

2:00:24.500 --> 2:00:26.740
 and showing some of the signs

2:00:26.740 --> 2:00:29.740
 of what previously thought impossible

2:00:29.740 --> 2:00:32.940
 for a nonintelligent system,

2:00:32.940 --> 2:00:34.900
 then that's impressive and that's inspiring

2:00:34.900 --> 2:00:36.660
 and that's okay to celebrate.

2:00:36.660 --> 2:00:39.860
 In physics, because you're not engineering anything,

2:00:39.860 --> 2:00:41.820
 you're just now swimming in the space,

2:00:41.820 --> 2:00:43.940
 directly when you do theoretical physics,

2:00:43.940 --> 2:00:45.440
 that it could be more dangerous.

2:00:45.440 --> 2:00:48.740
 You could be out too far away from shore.

2:00:48.740 --> 2:00:52.820
 Yeah, well, the problem, I think physics is,

2:00:52.820 --> 2:00:55.180
 I think it's actually hard for people even to believe

2:00:55.180 --> 2:01:00.140
 or really understand how that this particular kind

2:01:00.140 --> 2:01:02.900
 of physics has gotten itself into a really unusual

2:01:02.900 --> 2:01:05.300
 and strange and historically unusual state,

2:01:05.300 --> 2:01:06.660
 which is not really.

2:01:06.660 --> 2:01:09.500
 I mean, I spent half my life among mathematicians

2:01:09.500 --> 2:01:10.620
 and half of the physicists,

2:01:10.620 --> 2:01:12.860
 and mathematics is kind of doing fine.

2:01:12.860 --> 2:01:14.180
 People are making progress

2:01:14.180 --> 2:01:16.100
 and it has all the usual problems,

2:01:16.100 --> 2:01:19.340
 but also, so you could have a,

2:01:19.340 --> 2:01:21.100
 but I just, I don't know,

2:01:21.100 --> 2:01:23.780
 I've never seen anything at all happening in mathematics

2:01:23.780 --> 2:01:26.340
 like what's happened in this specific area in physics.

2:01:26.340 --> 2:01:29.820
 It's just the kind of sociology of this,

2:01:29.820 --> 2:01:33.580
 the way this field works banging up

2:01:33.580 --> 2:01:37.080
 against this harder problem without anything

2:01:37.080 --> 2:01:38.560
 from experiment to help it.

2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:41.780
 It's really, it's led to some really kind

2:01:41.780 --> 2:01:43.300
 of problematic things.

2:01:43.300 --> 2:01:48.020
 And those, so it's one thing to kind of oversimplify

2:01:48.020 --> 2:01:49.740
 or to slightly misrepresent,

2:01:49.740 --> 2:01:52.380
 to try to explain things in a way that's not quite right,

2:01:52.380 --> 2:01:55.820
 but it's another thing to start promoting to people

2:01:56.740 --> 2:02:00.300
 as a success as ideas, which really completely failed.

2:02:00.300 --> 2:02:03.600
 And so, I mean, I've kind of a very, very specific,

2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:07.500
 if you used to have people, I won't name any names,

2:02:07.500 --> 2:02:09.500
 for instance, coming on certain podcasts like yours,

2:02:09.500 --> 2:02:12.560
 telling the world, this is a huge success

2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:13.740
 and this is really wonderful.

2:02:13.740 --> 2:02:16.520
 And it's just not true.

2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:19.620
 And this is really problematic

2:02:19.620 --> 2:02:23.560
 and it carries a serious danger of once,

2:02:24.460 --> 2:02:27.020
 when people realize that this is what's going on,

2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:32.380
 that the loss of credibility of science

2:02:32.380 --> 2:02:34.700
 is a real, real problem for our society.

2:02:34.700 --> 2:02:39.700
 And you don't want people to have an all too good reason

2:02:39.700 --> 2:02:44.420
 to think that what they're being told

2:02:44.420 --> 2:02:46.860
 by kind of some of the best institutions

2:02:46.860 --> 2:02:49.140
 or a country or authorities is not true.

2:02:49.140 --> 2:02:52.300
 You know, it's not true, it's a problem.

2:02:52.300 --> 2:02:55.860
 That's obviously characteristic of not just physics,

2:02:55.860 --> 2:02:58.940
 it's sociology.

2:03:00.500 --> 2:03:02.940
 And it's, I mean, obviously in the space of politics,

2:03:02.940 --> 2:03:11.940
 it's the history of politics is you sell ideas to people,

2:03:11.940 --> 2:03:14.020
 even when you don't have any proof

2:03:14.020 --> 2:03:16.060
 that those ideas actually work in the US

2:03:16.060 --> 2:03:17.980
 because if they've worked in that,

2:03:17.980 --> 2:03:20.540
 that seems to be the case throughout history.

2:03:23.700 --> 2:03:26.500
 And just like you said, it's human beings running up

2:03:26.500 --> 2:03:28.500
 against a really hard problem.

2:03:28.500 --> 2:03:33.500
 I'm not sure if this is like a particular like trajectory

2:03:35.420 --> 2:03:37.060
 through the progress of physics

2:03:37.060 --> 2:03:38.380
 that we're dealing with now

2:03:38.380 --> 2:03:40.240
 or it's just a natural progress of science.

2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:44.800
 You run up against a really difficult stage of a field

2:03:44.800 --> 2:03:49.800
 and different people behave differently in the face of that.

2:03:53.100 --> 2:03:56.140
 Some sell books and sort of tell narratives

2:03:56.140 --> 2:03:57.820
 that are beautiful and so on.

2:03:57.820 --> 2:04:00.980
 They're not necessarily grounded in solutions

2:04:00.980 --> 2:04:02.740
 that have proven themselves.

2:04:02.740 --> 2:04:05.460
 Others kind of put their head down quietly,

2:04:05.460 --> 2:04:06.340
 keep doing the work.

2:04:06.340 --> 2:04:08.180
 Others sort of pivot to different fields

2:04:08.180 --> 2:04:11.420
 and that's kind of like, yeah, ants scattering.

2:04:11.420 --> 2:04:14.500
 And then you have fields like machine learning,

2:04:14.500 --> 2:04:17.100
 which there was a few folks mostly scattered away

2:04:17.100 --> 2:04:19.580
 from machine learning in the 90s,

2:04:19.580 --> 2:04:22.980
 in the winter of AI, AI winter, as they call it.

2:04:22.980 --> 2:04:24.740
 But a few people kept their head down

2:04:24.740 --> 2:04:27.140
 and now they're called the fathers of deep learning.

2:04:27.140 --> 2:04:30.260
 And they didn't think of it that way.

2:04:31.380 --> 2:04:33.300
 And in fact, if there's another AI winter,

2:04:33.300 --> 2:04:35.560
 they'll just probably keep working on it anyway,

2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:40.380
 sort of like loyal ants sticking to a particular thing.

2:04:40.380 --> 2:04:43.140
 So it's interesting, but you're sort of saying

2:04:43.140 --> 2:04:46.660
 that we should be careful over hyping things

2:04:46.660 --> 2:04:48.380
 that have not proven themselves

2:04:48.380 --> 2:04:53.380
 because people will lose trust in the scientific process.

2:04:53.380 --> 2:04:56.780
 But unfortunately, there's been other ways

2:04:56.780 --> 2:04:59.740
 in which people have lost trust in the scientific process.

2:04:59.740 --> 2:05:01.140
 That ultimately has to do actually

2:05:01.140 --> 2:05:04.020
 with all the same kind of behavior as you're highlighting,

2:05:04.020 --> 2:05:07.260
 which is not being honest and transparent

2:05:07.260 --> 2:05:10.620
 about the flaws of mistakes of the past.

2:05:10.620 --> 2:05:12.140
 Yeah, I mean, that's always a problem.

2:05:12.140 --> 2:05:14.700
 But this particular field is kind of fun.

2:05:14.700 --> 2:05:17.780
 It's always a strange one.

2:05:17.780 --> 2:05:19.540
 I mean, I think in the sense that

2:05:20.500 --> 2:05:22.140
 there's a lot of public fascination with it

2:05:22.140 --> 2:05:24.780
 that it seems to speak to kind of our deepest questions

2:05:24.780 --> 2:05:27.540
 about what is this physical reality?

2:05:27.540 --> 2:05:28.380
 Where do we come from?

2:05:28.380 --> 2:05:30.300
 And these kind of deep issues.

2:05:30.300 --> 2:05:33.060
 So there's this unusual fascination with it.

2:05:33.060 --> 2:05:34.540
 Mathematics is very different.

2:05:34.540 --> 2:05:36.620
 Nobody's that interested in mathematics.

2:05:36.620 --> 2:05:40.580
 Nobody really kind of expects to learn really great,

2:05:40.580 --> 2:05:42.580
 deep things about the world from mathematics that much.

2:05:42.580 --> 2:05:44.180
 They don't ask mathematicians that.

2:05:44.180 --> 2:05:46.660
 So it's a very unusual,

2:05:46.660 --> 2:05:50.140
 it draws this kind of unusual amount of attention.

2:05:50.140 --> 2:05:54.860
 And it really is historically in a really unusual state.

2:05:54.860 --> 2:05:59.860
 It's gotten itself way kind of down a blind alley

2:06:01.220 --> 2:06:04.700
 in a way which it's hard to find

2:06:04.700 --> 2:06:06.500
 other historical parallels to.

2:06:06.500 --> 2:06:08.380
 But sort of to push back a little bit,

2:06:08.380 --> 2:06:10.660
 there's power to inspiring people.

2:06:10.660 --> 2:06:13.140
 And if I just empirically look,

2:06:13.140 --> 2:06:20.140
 physicists are really good at combining science

2:06:21.740 --> 2:06:24.420
 and philosophy and communicating it.

2:06:24.420 --> 2:06:26.220
 Like there's something about physics often

2:06:26.220 --> 2:06:28.900
 that forces you to build a strong intuition

2:06:28.900 --> 2:06:31.300
 about the way reality works, right?

2:06:31.300 --> 2:06:34.260
 And that allows you to think through sort of

2:06:34.260 --> 2:06:37.340
 and communicate about all kinds of questions.

2:06:37.340 --> 2:06:38.780
 Like if you see physicists,

2:06:38.780 --> 2:06:41.140
 it's always fascinating to take on problems

2:06:41.140 --> 2:06:43.500
 that have nothing to do with their particular discipline.

2:06:43.500 --> 2:06:45.900
 They think in interesting ways

2:06:45.900 --> 2:06:47.180
 and they're able to communicate

2:06:47.180 --> 2:06:48.660
 their thinking in interesting ways.

2:06:48.660 --> 2:06:52.180
 And so in some sense, they have a responsibility

2:06:52.180 --> 2:06:55.580
 not just to do science, but to inspire.

2:06:55.580 --> 2:06:58.060
 And not responsibility, but the opportunity.

2:06:58.060 --> 2:07:02.660
 And thereby, I would say a little bit of a responsibility.

2:07:02.660 --> 2:07:03.820
 Yeah, yeah.

2:07:03.820 --> 2:07:06.340
 But I don't know, anyway, it's hard to say

2:07:06.340 --> 2:07:10.620
 because there's many, many people doing this kind of thing

2:07:10.620 --> 2:07:15.580
 with different degrees of success and whatever.

2:07:15.580 --> 2:07:19.740
 I guess one thing, but I mean,

2:07:19.740 --> 2:07:21.140
 what's kind of front and center for me

2:07:21.140 --> 2:07:22.860
 is kind of a more parochial interest

2:07:22.860 --> 2:07:27.100
 is just kind of what damage do you do

2:07:27.100 --> 2:07:30.100
 to the subject itself, ignoring,

2:07:30.100 --> 2:07:33.460
 okay, misrepresenting what high school students think

2:07:33.460 --> 2:07:36.540
 about string theory and that doesn't matter much,

2:07:36.540 --> 2:07:40.220
 but what the smartest undergraduates

2:07:40.220 --> 2:07:43.140
 or the smartest graduate students in the world think about it

2:07:43.140 --> 2:07:45.140
 and what paths you're leading them down

2:07:45.140 --> 2:07:47.060
 and what story you're telling them

2:07:47.060 --> 2:07:49.580
 and what textbooks you're making them read

2:07:49.580 --> 2:07:51.380
 and what they're hearing.

2:07:51.380 --> 2:07:53.020
 And so a lot of what's motivated me

2:07:53.020 --> 2:07:57.340
 is more to try to speak to this kind of a specific population

2:07:57.340 --> 2:08:00.020
 of people to make sure that, look, people,

2:08:01.660 --> 2:08:05.500
 it doesn't matter so much what the average person

2:08:05.500 --> 2:08:06.980
 on the street thinks about string theory,

2:08:06.980 --> 2:08:11.980
 but what the best students at Columbia or Harvard

2:08:12.060 --> 2:08:14.860
 or Princeton or whatever who really wanna change,

2:08:14.860 --> 2:08:16.620
 work in this field and wanna work that way,

2:08:16.620 --> 2:08:19.300
 what they know about it, what they think about it

2:08:19.300 --> 2:08:22.020
 and that they not be going to the field being misled

2:08:22.020 --> 2:08:23.820
 and believing that a certain story,

2:08:23.820 --> 2:08:25.060
 this is where this is all going,

2:08:25.060 --> 2:08:29.020
 this is what I gotta do, that's important to me.

2:08:29.020 --> 2:08:31.380
 Well, in general, for graduate students,

2:08:31.380 --> 2:08:34.220
 for people who seek to be experts in the field,

2:08:34.220 --> 2:08:36.460
 diversity of ideas is really powerful

2:08:36.460 --> 2:08:40.700
 and is getting into this local pocket of ideas

2:08:40.700 --> 2:08:43.820
 that people hold on to for several decades is not good,

2:08:43.820 --> 2:08:44.860
 no matter what the idea.

2:08:44.860 --> 2:08:47.860
 I would say no matter if the idea is right or wrong,

2:08:47.860 --> 2:08:51.540
 because there's no such thing as right in the long term,

2:08:51.540 --> 2:08:56.380
 like it's right for now until somebody builds on

2:08:56.380 --> 2:08:58.100
 something much bigger on top of it.

2:08:58.100 --> 2:09:00.060
 It might end up being right,

2:09:00.060 --> 2:09:03.500
 but being a tiny subset of a much bigger thing.

2:09:03.500 --> 2:09:07.460
 So you always should question sort of the ways of the past.

2:09:07.460 --> 2:09:10.260
 Yeah, so how to kind of achieve

2:09:10.260 --> 2:09:12.700
 that kind of diversity of thought

2:09:12.700 --> 2:09:15.060
 and within kind of the sociology

2:09:15.060 --> 2:09:17.660
 of how we organize scientific researches.

2:09:17.660 --> 2:09:19.500
 I know this is one thing that I think it's very interesting

2:09:19.500 --> 2:09:22.700
 that Sabina Hassenfelder has very interesting things

2:09:22.700 --> 2:09:23.540
 to say about it.

2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:25.540
 And I think also Lee Smolin in his book,

2:09:25.540 --> 2:09:29.900
 which is also about that very much in agreement with them

2:09:29.900 --> 2:09:34.900
 that there's a really kind of important questions

2:09:36.780 --> 2:09:41.460
 about how research in this field is organized

2:09:41.460 --> 2:09:46.460
 and what can you do to kind of get more diversity of thought

2:09:46.580 --> 2:09:51.180
 and get people thinking about a wider range of ideas.

2:09:53.100 --> 2:09:55.980
 At the bottom, I think humility always helps.

2:09:55.980 --> 2:09:59.900
 Well, the problem is that it's also,

2:09:59.900 --> 2:10:02.780
 it's a combination of humility to know when you're wrong

2:10:02.780 --> 2:10:06.700
 and also, but also you have to have a certain

2:10:06.700 --> 2:10:08.620
 very serious lack of humility to believe

2:10:08.620 --> 2:10:11.180
 that you're gonna make progress on some of these problems.

2:10:11.180 --> 2:10:13.260
 I think you have to have like both modes

2:10:13.260 --> 2:10:15.600
 and switch between them when needed.

2:10:18.420 --> 2:10:19.460
 Let me ask you a question

2:10:19.460 --> 2:10:21.220
 you're probably not gonna wanna answer

2:10:21.220 --> 2:10:25.460
 because you're focused on the mathematics of things

2:10:25.460 --> 2:10:27.720
 and mathematics can't answer the why questions,

2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:30.620
 but let me ask you anyway.

2:10:30.620 --> 2:10:33.420
 Do you think there's meaning to this whole thing?

2:10:33.420 --> 2:10:34.980
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

2:10:34.980 --> 2:10:36.860
 Why are we here?

2:10:36.860 --> 2:10:37.700
 I don't know.

2:10:37.700 --> 2:10:39.580
 Yeah, I was thinking about this.

2:10:39.580 --> 2:10:42.300
 So the, and it did occur to me,

2:10:42.300 --> 2:10:45.660
 one interesting thing about that question

2:10:45.660 --> 2:10:47.180
 is that you don't,

2:10:47.180 --> 2:10:51.060
 yeah, so I have this life in mathematics

2:10:51.060 --> 2:10:52.020
 and this life in physics

2:10:52.020 --> 2:10:55.900
 and I see some of my physicist colleagues,

2:10:55.900 --> 2:10:59.740
 kind of seem to be, people are often asking them,

2:10:59.740 --> 2:11:00.580
 what's the meaning of life?

2:11:00.580 --> 2:11:02.300
 And they're writing books about the meaning of life

2:11:02.300 --> 2:11:04.580
 and teaching courses about the meaning of life.

2:11:04.580 --> 2:11:06.460
 But then I realized that no one ever asked

2:11:06.460 --> 2:11:07.900
 my mathematician colleagues.

2:11:08.980 --> 2:11:10.660
 Nobody ever asked mathematicians.

2:11:10.660 --> 2:11:11.500
 Yeah, that's funny.

2:11:11.500 --> 2:11:15.020
 So yeah, everybody just kind of assumes,

2:11:15.020 --> 2:11:16.620
 okay, well, you people are studying mathematics,

2:11:16.620 --> 2:11:19.380
 whatever you're doing, it's maybe very interesting,

2:11:19.380 --> 2:11:21.180
 but it's clearly not gonna tell me anything useful

2:11:21.180 --> 2:11:22.300
 about the meaning of my life.

2:11:22.300 --> 2:11:25.820
 And I'm afraid a lot of my point of view is that

2:11:25.820 --> 2:11:28.180
 if people realized how little difference there was

2:11:28.180 --> 2:11:29.700
 between what the mathematicians are doing

2:11:29.700 --> 2:11:32.260
 and what a lot of these theoretical physicists are doing,

2:11:32.260 --> 2:11:35.740
 they might understand that it's a bit misguided

2:11:35.740 --> 2:11:39.020
 to look for deep insight into the meaning of life

2:11:39.020 --> 2:11:42.540
 from many theoretical physicists.

2:11:42.540 --> 2:11:45.580
 It's not, they're people,

2:11:45.580 --> 2:11:47.220
 they may have interesting things to say about this.

2:11:47.220 --> 2:11:50.220
 You're right, they know a lot about physical reality

2:11:50.220 --> 2:11:53.900
 and about, in some sense about metaphysics,

2:11:53.900 --> 2:11:56.740
 about what is real of this kind.

2:11:56.740 --> 2:12:01.740
 But you're also, to my mind,

2:12:02.260 --> 2:12:03.740
 I think you're also making a bit of a mistake

2:12:03.740 --> 2:12:07.940
 that you're looking to, I mean, I'm very, very aware

2:12:07.940 --> 2:12:10.620
 that I've led a very pleasant

2:12:10.620 --> 2:12:11.980
 and fairly privileged existence

2:12:11.980 --> 2:12:15.220
 and fairly without many challenges of different kinds

2:12:15.220 --> 2:12:16.700
 and of a certain kind.

2:12:16.700 --> 2:12:21.460
 And I'm really not in no way the kind of person

2:12:21.460 --> 2:12:24.260
 that a lot of people who are looking for

2:12:24.260 --> 2:12:27.460
 to try to understand in some sense the meaning of life

2:12:27.460 --> 2:12:30.300
 in the sense of the challenges that they're facing in life.

2:12:30.300 --> 2:12:32.660
 I can't really, I'm really the wrong person

2:12:32.660 --> 2:12:34.020
 for you to be asking about this.

2:12:34.020 --> 2:12:39.020
 Well, if struggle is somehow a thing that's core to meaning,

2:12:39.660 --> 2:12:42.460
 perhaps mathematicians are just quietly the ones

2:12:42.460 --> 2:12:45.140
 who are most equipped to answer that question

2:12:45.140 --> 2:12:49.980
 if, in fact, the creation or at least experiencing beauty

2:12:53.660 --> 2:12:55.860
 is at the core of the meaning of life.

2:12:55.860 --> 2:12:59.420
 Because it seems like mathematics is the methodology

2:12:59.420 --> 2:13:04.060
 by which you can most purely explore beautiful things, right?

2:13:04.060 --> 2:13:05.280
 Yeah, yeah.

2:13:05.280 --> 2:13:06.220
 So in some sense,

2:13:06.220 --> 2:13:08.900
 maybe we should talk to mathematicians more.

2:13:08.900 --> 2:13:12.620
 Yeah, yeah, maybe, but unfortunately,

2:13:12.620 --> 2:13:14.900
 people do have a somewhat correct perception

2:13:14.900 --> 2:13:17.100
 that what these people are doing every day

2:13:17.100 --> 2:13:19.700
 or whatever is pretty far removed from anything.

2:13:21.940 --> 2:13:26.140
 Yeah, from what's kind of close to what I do every day

2:13:26.140 --> 2:13:28.060
 and what my typical concerns are.

2:13:28.060 --> 2:13:29.740
 So you may learn something very interesting

2:13:29.740 --> 2:13:31.060
 by talking to mathematicians,

2:13:31.060 --> 2:13:33.940
 but it's probably not gonna be,

2:13:33.940 --> 2:13:37.120
 you're probably not gonna get what you were hoping.

2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:39.540
 So when you put the pen and paper down,

2:13:39.540 --> 2:13:41.460
 you're not thinking about physics

2:13:41.460 --> 2:13:43.380
 and you're not thinking about mathematics

2:13:43.380 --> 2:13:46.820
 and you just get to breathe in the air and look around you

2:13:46.820 --> 2:13:49.220
 and realize that you're going to die one day.

2:13:49.220 --> 2:13:50.060
 Yeah.

2:13:50.060 --> 2:13:51.160
 Do you think about that?

2:13:53.300 --> 2:13:56.940
 Your ideas will live on, but you, the human.

2:13:56.940 --> 2:13:58.460
 Not especially much.

2:13:58.460 --> 2:14:00.180
 Certainly, I've been getting older.

2:14:00.180 --> 2:14:01.900
 I'm now 64 years old.

2:14:01.900 --> 2:14:02.740
 You start to realize, well,

2:14:02.740 --> 2:14:05.700
 there's probably less ahead than there was behind.

2:14:05.700 --> 2:14:09.580
 And so you start to, that starts to become,

2:14:09.580 --> 2:14:10.420
 what do I think about that?

2:14:10.420 --> 2:14:13.420
 Maybe I should actually get serious

2:14:13.420 --> 2:14:14.740
 about getting some things done,

2:14:14.740 --> 2:14:17.020
 which I may not have,

2:14:17.020 --> 2:14:18.740
 which I may otherwise not have time to do,

2:14:18.740 --> 2:14:20.300
 which I didn't see.

2:14:20.300 --> 2:14:22.220
 And this didn't seem to be a problem when I was younger,

2:14:22.220 --> 2:14:24.060
 but that's the main,

2:14:24.060 --> 2:14:26.860
 I think the main way in which that thought occurred.

2:14:26.860 --> 2:14:30.040
 But it doesn't, you know, the stoics are big on this.

2:14:30.040 --> 2:14:33.460
 Meditating on mortality helps you

2:14:33.460 --> 2:14:36.580
 more intensely appreciate the beauty

2:14:36.580 --> 2:14:38.020
 when you do experience it.

2:14:38.020 --> 2:14:41.140
 I suppose that's true, but it's not,

2:14:41.140 --> 2:14:45.880
 yeah, it's not something I've spent a lot of time trying,

2:14:45.880 --> 2:14:47.180
 but yeah.

2:14:47.180 --> 2:14:49.780
 Day to day, you just enjoy the positives, the mathematics.

2:14:49.780 --> 2:14:52.460
 Just enjoy, yeah, our life in general.

2:14:52.460 --> 2:14:57.120
 Life is, I have a perfectly pleasant life and enjoy it.

2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:00.220
 And I often think, wow, this is,

2:15:00.220 --> 2:15:02.600
 things are, I'm really enjoying this.

2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:04.300
 Things are going well.

2:15:04.300 --> 2:15:06.540
 Yeah, life is pretty amazing.

2:15:06.540 --> 2:15:08.180
 I think you and I are pretty lucky.

2:15:08.180 --> 2:15:11.300
 We get to live on this nice little earth

2:15:11.300 --> 2:15:13.380
 with a nice little comfortable climate,

2:15:13.380 --> 2:15:17.160
 and we get to have this nice little podcast conversation.

2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:19.100

 And now, let me leave you with some words

2:15:34.100 --> 2:15:36.180
 from Richard Feynman.

2:15:36.180 --> 2:15:40.220
 The first principle is that you must not fool yourself,

2:15:40.220 --> 2:15:43.120
 and you are the easiest person to fool.

2:15:43.120 --> 2:16:06.120
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
