00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
 The following is a conversation with Brian Johnson,

00:02.560 --> 00:06.480
 founder of Kernel, a company that has developed devices

00:06.480 --> 00:09.360
 that can monitor and record brain activity.

00:09.360 --> 00:12.080
 And previously, he was the founder of Braintree,

00:12.080 --> 00:14.760
 a mobile payment company that acquired Venmo

00:14.760 --> 00:17.840
 and then was acquired by PayPal and eBay.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.720
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:19.720 --> 00:24.280
 Forsigmatic, NetSuite, Grammarly, and ExpressVPN.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.760
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:27.760 --> 00:30.160
 As a side note, let me say that this was a fun

00:30.160 --> 00:31.720
 and memorable experience,

00:31.720 --> 00:34.040
 wearing the Kernel FlowBrain interface

00:34.040 --> 00:35.920
 in the beginning of this conversation,

00:35.920 --> 00:38.080
 as you can see if you watch the video version

00:38.080 --> 00:39.520
 of this episode.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.900
 And there was a Ubuntu Linux machine sitting next to me

00:42.900 --> 00:44.840
 collecting the data from my brain.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.840
 The whole thing gave me hope that the mystery

00:47.840 --> 00:51.480
 of the human mind will be unlocked in the coming decades

00:51.480 --> 00:53.760
 as we begin to measure signals from the brain

00:53.760 --> 00:55.400
 in a high bandwidth way.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.600
 To understand the mind,

00:56.600 --> 01:00.160
 we either have to build it or to measure it.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.200
 Both are worth a try.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.200
 Thanks to Brian and the rest of the Kernel team

01:04.200 --> 01:06.320
 for making this little demo happen.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.640
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,

01:08.640 --> 01:12.300
 and here is my conversation with Brian Johnson.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.080
 You ready, Lex?

01:14.080 --> 01:15.680
 Yes, I'm ready.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.000
 Do you guys wanna come in and put the interfaces

01:18.000 --> 01:18.840
 on our heads?

01:18.840 --> 01:22.040
 And then I will proceed to tell you a few jokes.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.760
 So we have two incredible pieces of technology

01:25.760 --> 01:30.480
 and a machine running Ubuntu 2004 in front of us.

01:30.480 --> 01:31.520
 What are we doing?

01:31.520 --> 01:32.360
 All right.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.200
 Are these going on our heads?

01:33.200 --> 01:34.040
 They're going on our heads, yeah.

01:34.040 --> 01:39.040
 And they will place it on our heads for proper alignment.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.200
 Does this support giant heads?

01:43.200 --> 01:45.120
 Because I kind of have a giant head.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.440
 Is this just giant head?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.040
 Are you saying as like an ego

01:48.040 --> 01:55.760
 or are you saying physically both?

01:55.760 --> 01:57.040
 It's a nice massage.

01:57.040 --> 01:57.880
 Yes.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.920
 Okay, how does this feel?

02:01.920 --> 02:04.720
 It's okay to move around?

02:04.720 --> 02:05.680
 Yeah.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.440
 It feels, oh yeah.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.280
 Hey, hey.

02:10.920 --> 02:11.760
 This feels awesome.

02:11.760 --> 02:12.840
 It's a pretty good fit.

02:12.840 --> 02:13.680
 Thank you.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.640
 That feels good.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.640
 So this is big head friendly.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.080
 It suits you well, Lex.

02:19.080 --> 02:19.920
 Thank you.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.560
 I feel like I need to,

02:24.600 --> 02:25.760
 I feel like when I wear this,

02:25.760 --> 02:27.040
 I need to sound like Sam Harris,

02:27.040 --> 02:31.760
 calm, collected, eloquent.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.080
 I feel smarter, actually.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.840
 I don't think I've ever felt quite as much

02:36.840 --> 02:38.720
 like I'm part of the future as now.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.680
 Have you ever worn a brain interface

02:40.680 --> 02:42.520
 or had your brain imaged?

02:42.520 --> 02:44.680
 Oh, never had my brain imaged.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.280
 The only way I've analyzed my brain

02:47.280 --> 02:52.280
 is by talking to myself and thinking.

02:52.280 --> 02:53.720
 No direct data.

02:53.720 --> 02:56.360
 Yeah, that is definitely a brain interface

02:57.400 --> 02:59.240
 that has a lot of blind spots.

02:59.240 --> 03:01.320
 It has some blind spots, yeah.

03:01.320 --> 03:02.480
 Psychotherapy.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.320
 That's right.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.040
 All right, are we recording?

03:07.040 --> 03:08.280
 Yeah, we're good.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.600
 All right.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.680
 So Lex, the objective of this,

03:12.680 --> 03:16.960
 I'm going to tell you some jokes

03:16.960 --> 03:18.920
 and your objective is to not smile,

03:18.920 --> 03:22.960
 which as a Russian, you should have an edge.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.520
 Make the motherland proud.

03:24.520 --> 03:25.520
 I gotcha.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.360
 Okay.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.440
 Let's hear the jokes.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.280
 Lex, and this is from the Colonel Crew.

03:33.960 --> 03:37.080
 We've been working on a device that can read your mind

03:37.080 --> 03:39.080
 and we would love to see your thoughts.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.960
 Is that the joke?

03:43.960 --> 03:44.840
 That's the opening.

03:44.840 --> 03:49.840
 Okay.

03:49.960 --> 03:53.640
 If I'm seeing the muscle activation correctly on your lips,

03:53.640 --> 03:54.760
 you're not going to do well on this.

03:54.760 --> 03:55.600
 Let's see.

03:55.600 --> 03:56.480
 All right, here comes the first.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.320
 I'm screwed.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.240
 Here comes the first one.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.920
 Is this going to break the device?

04:01.200 --> 04:04.280
 Is it resilient to laughter?

04:07.120 --> 04:09.480
 Lex, what goes through a potato's brain?

04:09.480 --> 04:14.320
 I can't.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.760
 I got already failed.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.280
 That's the hilarious opener.

04:17.280 --> 04:18.120
 Okay.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.280
 What?

04:19.280 --> 04:20.200
 Tater thoughts.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.720
 What kind of fish performs brain surgery?

04:27.720 --> 04:29.000
 I don't know.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.160
 A neural surgeon.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.680
 And so we're getting data of everything

04:37.680 --> 04:39.040
 that's happening in my brain right now?

04:39.040 --> 04:39.880
 Lifetime, yeah.

04:39.880 --> 04:44.880
 We're getting activation patterns of your entire cortex.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.240
 I'm going to try to do better.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.240
 I'll edit out all the parts where I laughed.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.600
 Photoshop put a serious face over me.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.960
 You can recover.

04:51.960 --> 04:52.880
 Yeah, all right.

04:53.760 --> 04:57.000
 Lex, what do scholars eat when they're hungry?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.440
 I don't know, what?

04:58.440 --> 04:59.840
 Academia nuts.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.880
 That was a pretty good one.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.240
 So what we'll do is,

05:07.240 --> 05:11.360
 so you're wearing kernel flow,

05:11.360 --> 05:16.360
 which is an interface built using technology

05:16.600 --> 05:17.680
 called spectroscopy.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.640
 So it's similar to what we wear wearables on the wrist

05:20.640 --> 05:22.240
 using light.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.640
 So using LIDAR, as you know,

05:24.640 --> 05:28.960
 and we're using that to image the functional imaging

05:28.960 --> 05:30.320
 of brain activity.

05:30.320 --> 05:35.120
 And so as your neurons fire electrically and chemically,

05:35.120 --> 05:37.400
 it creates blood oxygenation levels.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.240
 We're measuring that.

05:38.240 --> 05:41.120
 And so you'll see in the reconstructions we do for you,

05:41.120 --> 05:43.040
 you'll see your activation patterns in your brain

05:43.040 --> 05:45.800
 as throughout this entire time we are wearing it.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.720
 So in the reaction to the jokes

05:47.720 --> 05:50.240
 and as we were sitting here talking,

05:50.240 --> 05:54.560
 and so we're moving towards a real time feed

05:54.560 --> 05:56.880
 of your cortical brain activity.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.440
 So there's a bunch of things that are in contact

05:59.440 --> 06:02.240
 with my skull right now.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.640
 How many of them are there?

06:03.640 --> 06:05.880
 And so how many of them are, what are they?

06:05.880 --> 06:07.120
 What are the actual sensors?

06:07.120 --> 06:09.000
 There's 52 modules,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.720
 and each module has one laser and six sensors.

06:13.720 --> 06:18.480
 And the sensors fire in about 100 picoseconds.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.480
 And then the photons scatter and absorb in your brain.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.400
 And then a few go in, a few come back out,

06:24.400 --> 06:25.880
 a bunch go in, then a few come back out,

06:25.880 --> 06:27.920
 and we sense those photons

06:27.920 --> 06:30.360
 and then we do the reconstruction for the activity.

06:30.360 --> 06:33.520
 Overall, there's about a thousand plus channels

06:33.520 --> 06:35.640
 that are sampling your activity.

06:35.640 --> 06:38.760
 How difficult is it to make it as comfortable as it is?

06:38.760 --> 06:40.720
 Because it's surprisingly comfortable.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.800
 I would not think it would be comfortable.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.320
 Something that's measuring brain activity,

06:48.320 --> 06:51.160
 I would not think it would be comfortable, but it is.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.000
 I agree.

06:52.000 --> 06:52.880
 In fact, I want to take this home.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.200
 Yeah, yeah, that's right.

06:54.200 --> 06:58.360
 So people are accustomed to being in big systems

06:58.360 --> 07:02.200
 like fMRI where there's 120 decibel sounds

07:02.200 --> 07:05.560
 and you're in a claustrophobic encasement,

07:05.560 --> 07:09.240
 or EEG, which is just painful, or surgery.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.240
 And so, yes, I agree that this is a convenient option

07:12.240 --> 07:14.360
 to be able to just put on your head

07:14.360 --> 07:15.960
 that measures your brain activity

07:15.960 --> 07:17.960
 in the contextual environment you choose.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.200
 So if we want to have it during a podcast,

07:20.200 --> 07:22.640
 if we want to be at home in a business setting,

07:24.400 --> 07:27.480
 it's freedom to record your brain activity

07:27.480 --> 07:29.000
 in the setting that you choose.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
 Yeah, but sort of from an engineering perspective,

07:31.000 --> 07:32.920
 are these, what is it?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.960
 There's a bunch of different modular parts

07:34.960 --> 07:38.080
 and they're kind of, there's like a rubber band thing

07:38.080 --> 07:40.880
 where they mold to the shape of your head.

07:40.880 --> 07:41.720
 That's right.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.480
 So we built this version of the mechanical design

07:45.480 --> 07:48.760
 to accommodate most adult heads.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.760
 But I have a giant head and it fits fine.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.800
 It fits well, actually.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.840
 So I don't think I have an average head.

07:55.840 --> 08:00.840
 Okay, maybe I feel much better about my head now.

08:01.640 --> 08:05.240
 Maybe I'm more average than I thought.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.720
 Okay, so what else is there interesting

08:08.720 --> 08:10.840
 that you could say while it's on our heads?

08:10.840 --> 08:12.120
 I can keep this on the whole time.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.480
 This is kind of awesome.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.080
 And it's amazing for me, as a fan of Ubuntu,

08:16.080 --> 08:18.880
 I use Ubuntu MATE, you guys use that too.

08:18.880 --> 08:23.360
 But it's amazing to have code running to the side,

08:23.360 --> 08:26.200
 measuring stuff and collecting data.

08:26.200 --> 08:30.360
 I mean, I feel like much more important now

08:30.360 --> 08:32.560
 that my data is being recorded.

08:32.560 --> 08:35.240
 Like, you know when you have a good friend

08:35.240 --> 08:40.240
 that listens to you, that actually is listening to you?

08:40.240 --> 08:43.080
 This is what I feel like, like a much better friend

08:43.080 --> 08:47.120
 because it's like accurately listening to me, Ubuntu.

08:47.120 --> 08:50.600
 What a cool perspective, I hadn't thought about that,

08:50.600 --> 08:53.960
 of feeling understood.

08:53.960 --> 08:54.800
 Heard.

08:54.800 --> 08:59.240
 Yeah, heard deeply by the mechanical system

08:59.240 --> 09:01.960
 that is recording your brain activity,

09:01.960 --> 09:04.480
 versus the human that you're engaging with,

09:04.480 --> 09:06.280
 that your mind immediately goes to

09:07.720 --> 09:09.520
 that there's this dimensionality

09:09.520 --> 09:12.600
 and depth of understanding of this software system

09:12.600 --> 09:14.600
 which you're intimately familiar with.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.360
 And now you're able to communicate with this system

09:17.360 --> 09:19.280
 in ways that you couldn't before.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.760
 Yeah, I feel heard.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.880
 Yeah, I mean, I guess what's interesting about this is

09:26.880 --> 09:28.760
 your intuitions are spot on.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.920
 Most people have intuitions about brain interfaces

09:30.920 --> 09:32.960
 that they've grown up with this idea

09:32.960 --> 09:34.800
 of people moving cursors on the screen

09:34.800 --> 09:38.600
 or typing or changing the channel or skipping a song.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.840
 It's primarily been anchored on control.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.920
 And I think the more relevant understanding

09:44.920 --> 09:47.280
 of brain interfaces or neuroimaging

09:47.280 --> 09:49.760
 is that it's a measurement system.

09:49.760 --> 09:53.280
 And once you have numbers for a given thing,

09:53.280 --> 09:54.920
 a seemingly endless number of possibilities

09:54.920 --> 09:57.760
 emerge around that of what to do with those numbers.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.880
 So before you tell me about the possibilities,

09:59.880 --> 10:01.520
 this was an incredible experience.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.880
 I can keep this on for another two hours,

10:03.880 --> 10:08.880
 but I'm being told that for a bunch of reasons,

10:08.960 --> 10:11.240
 just because we probably wanna keep the data small

10:11.240 --> 10:13.840
 and visualize it nicely for the final product,

10:13.840 --> 10:17.440
 we wanna cut this off and take this amazing helmet

10:17.440 --> 10:18.280
 away from me.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.240
 So Brian, thank you so much for this experience

10:21.240 --> 10:25.160
 and let's continue without helmetless.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.200
 All right.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.920
 So that was an incredible experience.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.240
 Can you maybe speak to what kind of opportunities

10:31.240 --> 10:32.960
 that opens up that stream of data,

10:32.960 --> 10:35.520
 that rich stream of data from the brain?

10:35.520 --> 10:38.360
 First, I'm curious, what is your reaction?

10:38.360 --> 10:41.560
 What comes to mind when you put that on your head?

10:41.560 --> 10:42.840
 What does it mean to you?

10:42.840 --> 10:44.120
 And what possibilities emerge

10:44.120 --> 10:46.760
 and what significance might it have?

10:46.760 --> 10:49.500
 I'm curious where your orientation is at.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.840
 Well, for me, I'm really excited by the possibility

10:54.840 --> 10:59.440
 of various information about my body,

10:59.440 --> 11:03.320
 about my mind being converted into data,

11:03.320 --> 11:06.320
 such that data can be used to create products

11:06.320 --> 11:07.360
 that make my life better.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.760
 So that to me is really exciting possibility.

11:09.760 --> 11:13.080
 Even just like a Fitbit that measures, I don't know,

11:13.080 --> 11:15.720
 some very basic measurements about your body

11:15.720 --> 11:17.120
 is really cool.

11:17.120 --> 11:20.560
 But the bandwidth of information,

11:20.560 --> 11:22.720
 the resolution of that information is very crude,

11:22.720 --> 11:23.960
 so it's not very interesting.

11:23.960 --> 11:28.000
 The possibility of just building a data set

11:29.480 --> 11:32.440
 coming in a clean way and a high bandwidth way

11:32.440 --> 11:37.440
 from my brain opens up all kinds of...

11:37.440 --> 11:40.840
 I was kind of joking when we were talking,

11:40.840 --> 11:44.680
 but it's not really, it's like I feel heard

11:44.680 --> 11:49.280
 in the sense that it feels like the full richness

11:49.280 --> 11:51.680
 of the information coming from my mind

11:51.680 --> 11:56.080
 is actually being recorded by the machine.

11:56.080 --> 12:00.160
 I mean, I can't quite put it into words,

12:00.160 --> 12:02.880
 but there is genuinely for me,

12:02.880 --> 12:05.160
 there's not some kind of joke about me being a robot.

12:05.160 --> 12:09.080
 It just genuinely feels like I'm being heard

12:09.080 --> 12:13.880
 in a way that's going to improve my life,

12:13.880 --> 12:16.320
 as long as the thing that's on the other end

12:16.320 --> 12:17.760
 can do something useful with that data.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.400
 But even the recording itself is like,

12:20.400 --> 12:24.200
 once you record, it's like taking a picture.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.480
 That moment is forever saved in time.

12:28.480 --> 12:32.680
 Now, a picture cannot allow you to step back

12:32.680 --> 12:37.680
 into that world, but perhaps recording your brain

12:38.240 --> 12:41.160
 is a much higher resolution thing,

12:41.160 --> 12:44.720
 much more personal recording of that information

12:44.720 --> 12:48.040
 than a picture that would allow you to step back

12:48.040 --> 12:51.800
 into that where you were in that particular moment

12:51.800 --> 12:54.160
 in history and then map out a certain trajectory

12:54.160 --> 12:58.520
 to tell you certain things about yourself

12:58.520 --> 13:00.360
 that could open up all kinds of applications.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.640
 Of course, there's health that I consider,

13:02.640 --> 13:06.600
 but honestly, to me, the exciting thing is just being heard.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.960
 My state of mind, the level of focus,

13:08.960 --> 13:10.920
 all those kinds of things, being heard.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.800
 What I heard you say is you have an entirety

13:13.800 --> 13:17.080
 of lived experience, some of which you can communicate

13:17.080 --> 13:20.000
 in words and in body language,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.440
 some of which you feel internally,

13:21.440 --> 13:24.440
 which cannot be captured in those communication modalities,

13:24.440 --> 13:27.640
 and that this measurement system captures

13:27.640 --> 13:29.880
 both the things you can try to articulate in words,

13:29.880 --> 13:31.480
 maybe in a lower dimensional space,

13:31.480 --> 13:34.520
 using one word, for example, to communicate focus,

13:34.520 --> 13:35.600
 when it really may be represented

13:35.600 --> 13:39.720
 in a 20 dimensional space of this particular kind of focus

13:39.720 --> 13:42.520
 and that this information is being captured,

13:42.520 --> 13:44.360
 so it's a closer representation

13:44.360 --> 13:47.480
 to the entirety of your experience captured

13:47.480 --> 13:50.920
 in a dynamic fashion that is not just a static image

13:50.920 --> 13:53.040
 of your conscious experience.

13:53.040 --> 13:58.040
 Yeah, that's the promise, that was the feeling,

13:58.280 --> 13:59.360
 and it felt like the future.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.800
 So it was a pretty cool experience.

14:00.800 --> 14:04.000
 And from the sort of mechanical perspective,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.680
 it was cool to have an actual device

14:06.680 --> 14:08.360
 that feels pretty good,

14:08.360 --> 14:11.560
 that doesn't require me to go into the lab.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.480
 And also the other thing I was feeling,

14:14.480 --> 14:16.160
 there's a guy named Andrew Huberman,

14:16.160 --> 14:17.920
 he's a friend of mine, amazing podcast,

14:17.920 --> 14:21.600
 people should listen to it, Huberman Lab Podcast.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.020
 We're working on a paper together

14:24.020 --> 14:25.500
 about eye movement and so on.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.440
 And we're kind of, he's a neuroscientist

14:28.440 --> 14:30.280
 and I'm a data person, machine learning person,

14:30.280 --> 14:35.280
 and we're both excited by how much the,

14:38.720 --> 14:42.920
 how much the data measurements of the human mind,

14:42.920 --> 14:44.840
 the brain and all the different metrics

14:44.840 --> 14:47.720
 that come from that could be used to understand

14:47.720 --> 14:50.520
 human beings and in a rigorous scientific way.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.000
 So the other thing I was thinking about

14:52.000 --> 14:55.960
 is how this could be turned into a tool for science.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.680
 Sort of not just personal science,

14:57.680 --> 15:00.520
 not just like Fitbit style,

15:00.520 --> 15:04.040
 like how am I doing on my personal metrics of health,

15:04.040 --> 15:07.760
 but doing larger scale studies of human behavior and so on.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.480
 So like data, not at the scale of an individual,

15:10.480 --> 15:12.480
 but data at a scale of many individuals

15:12.480 --> 15:14.720
 or a large number of individuals.

15:14.720 --> 15:17.000
 So personal being heard was exciting

15:17.000 --> 15:19.940
 and also just for science is exciting.

15:19.940 --> 15:23.200
 It's very easy, like there's a very powerful thing

15:23.200 --> 15:25.600
 to it being so easy to just put on

15:25.600 --> 15:28.320
 that you could scale much easier.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.140
 If you think about that second thing you said

15:30.140 --> 15:35.140
 about the science of the brain,

15:37.520 --> 15:40.600
 most, we've done a pretty good job,

15:40.600 --> 15:43.240
 like we, the human race has done a pretty good job

15:43.240 --> 15:46.140
 figuring out how to quantify the things around us

15:46.140 --> 15:51.140
 from distant stars to calories and steps and our genome.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.360
 So we can measure and quantify pretty much everything

15:55.360 --> 15:59.220
 in the known universe except for our minds.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.160
 And we can do these one offs

16:02.160 --> 16:03.640
 if we're going to get an fMRI scan

16:03.640 --> 16:08.640
 or do something with a low res EEG system,

16:08.880 --> 16:11.760
 but we haven't done this at population scale.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.840
 And so if you think about human thought

16:14.840 --> 16:19.320
 or human cognition is probably the single law,

16:19.320 --> 16:23.360
 largest raw input material into society

16:23.360 --> 16:25.720
 at any given moment is our conversations

16:25.720 --> 16:27.920
 with ourselves and with other people.

16:27.920 --> 16:32.920
 And we have this raw input that we can't,

16:33.040 --> 16:35.180
 that haven't been able to measure yet.

16:35.180 --> 16:38.760
 And if you, when I think about it through that frame,

16:41.400 --> 16:43.320
 it's remarkable, it's almost like we live

16:43.320 --> 16:48.320
 in this wild, wild West of unquantified communications

16:49.480 --> 16:52.000
 within ourselves and between each other

16:52.000 --> 16:53.440
 when everything else has been grounded in me.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.560
 For example, I know if I buy an appliance at the store

16:56.560 --> 17:00.640
 or on a website, I don't need to look at the measurements

17:00.640 --> 17:03.040
 on the appliance and make sure it can fit through my door.

17:03.040 --> 17:06.160
 That's an engineered system of appliance manufacturing

17:06.160 --> 17:07.120
 and construction.

17:07.120 --> 17:10.620
 Everyone's agreed upon engineering standards.

17:10.620 --> 17:15.360
 And we don't have engineering standards around cognition.

17:15.360 --> 17:16.880
 It's not a, it has not entered

17:16.880 --> 17:20.040
 as a formal engineering discipline that enables us

17:20.040 --> 17:23.040
 to scaffold in society with everything else we're doing,

17:23.040 --> 17:26.560
 including consuming news, our relationships,

17:26.560 --> 17:29.600
 politics, economics, education, all the above.

17:29.600 --> 17:33.720
 And so to me that the most significant contribution

17:33.720 --> 17:36.520
 that kernel technology has to offer

17:36.520 --> 17:40.720
 would be the formal, the introduction

17:40.720 --> 17:42.640
 to formal engineering of cognition

17:42.640 --> 17:45.280
 as it relates to everything else in society.

17:45.280 --> 17:50.100
 I love that idea that you kind of think that there's just

17:50.100 --> 17:53.120
 this ocean of data that's coming from people's brains

17:53.120 --> 17:57.360
 as being in a crude way, reduced down to like tweets

17:57.360 --> 18:02.160
 and texts and so on, just a very hardcore,

18:02.160 --> 18:06.060
 many scale compression of actual, the raw data.

18:06.060 --> 18:08.320
 But maybe you can comment,

18:08.320 --> 18:10.320
 because you're using the word cognition.

18:11.760 --> 18:15.240
 I think the first step is to get the brain data.

18:15.240 --> 18:19.200
 But is there a leap to be taking

18:19.200 --> 18:22.140
 to sort of interpreting that data in terms of cognition?

18:22.140 --> 18:25.440
 So is your idea is basically you need to start collecting

18:25.440 --> 18:27.800
 data at scale from the brain,

18:27.800 --> 18:32.680
 and then we start to really be able to take little steps

18:32.680 --> 18:35.300
 along the path to actually measuring

18:35.300 --> 18:37.760
 some deep sense of cognition.

18:37.760 --> 18:42.760
 Because as I'm sure you know, we understand a few things,

18:42.760 --> 18:47.280
 but we don't understand most of what makes up cognition.

18:47.280 --> 18:50.380
 This has been one of the most significant challenges

18:50.380 --> 18:52.440
 of building Kernel, and Kernel wouldn't exist

18:52.440 --> 18:55.760
 if I wasn't able to fund it initially by myself.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.280
 Because when I engage in conversations with investors,

18:59.280 --> 19:02.800
 the immediate thought is, what is the killer app?

19:02.800 --> 19:04.980
 And of course, I understand that heuristic,

19:04.980 --> 19:05.820
 that's what they're looking at,

19:05.820 --> 19:07.920
 is they're looking to de risk.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.560
 Is the product solved?

19:09.560 --> 19:10.740
 Is there a customer base?

19:10.740 --> 19:11.920
 Are people willing to pay for it?

19:11.920 --> 19:14.320
 How does it compare to competing options?

19:14.320 --> 19:15.620
 And in the case with brain interfaces,

19:15.620 --> 19:20.360
 when I started the company, there was no known path

19:20.360 --> 19:21.520
 to even build a technology

19:21.520 --> 19:24.400
 that could potentially become mainstream.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.940
 And then once we figured out the technology,

19:26.940 --> 19:28.840
 we could even, we could commence having conversations

19:28.840 --> 19:31.320
 with investors and it became, what is the killer app?

19:31.320 --> 19:33.240
 And so what has been,

19:33.240 --> 19:36.400
 so I funded the first $53 million for the company.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.820
 And to raise the round of funding, the first one we did,

19:39.820 --> 19:42.560
 I spoke to 228 investors.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.600
 One said yes, it was remarkable.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.320
 And it was mostly around this concept

19:48.320 --> 19:49.520
 around what is a killer app.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.960
 And so internally, the way we think about it is,

19:51.960 --> 19:55.320
 we think of the go to market strategy

19:55.320 --> 19:57.860
 much more like the Drake equation,

19:57.860 --> 20:00.680
 where if we can build technology

20:00.680 --> 20:02.480
 that has the characteristics of,

20:02.480 --> 20:05.120
 it has the data quality is high enough,

20:05.120 --> 20:07.480
 it meets some certain threshold,

20:07.480 --> 20:11.180
 cost, accessibility, comfort,

20:11.180 --> 20:12.680
 it can be worn in contextual environments.

20:12.680 --> 20:17.320
 If it meets the criteria of being a mass market device,

20:17.320 --> 20:22.280
 then the responsibility that we have is to figure out

20:22.280 --> 20:27.280
 how to create the algorithm that enables the human,

20:29.320 --> 20:32.400
 to enable humans to then find value with it.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.920
 So the analogy is like brain interfaces

20:34.920 --> 20:37.080
 are like early 90s of the internet,

20:37.080 --> 20:39.480
 is you wanna populate an ecosystem

20:39.480 --> 20:40.560
 with a certain number of devices,

20:40.560 --> 20:41.720
 you want a certain number of people

20:41.720 --> 20:43.440
 who play around with them, who do experiments

20:43.440 --> 20:44.480
 of certain data collection parameters,

20:44.480 --> 20:46.440
 you want to encourage certain mistakes

20:46.440 --> 20:48.020
 from experts and non experts.

20:48.020 --> 20:51.920
 These are all critical elements that ignite discovery.

20:51.920 --> 20:56.920
 And so we believe we've accomplished the first objective

20:57.560 --> 21:01.800
 of building technology that reaches those thresholds.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.500
 And now it's the Drake equation component

21:03.500 --> 21:08.500
 of how do we try to generate 20 years of value discovery

21:11.720 --> 21:12.880
 in a two or three year time period?

21:12.880 --> 21:14.280
 How do we compress that?

21:14.280 --> 21:17.520
 So just to clarify, so when you mean the Drake equation,

21:17.520 --> 21:19.120
 which for people who don't know,

21:19.120 --> 21:20.680
 I don't know why you, if you listen to this,

21:20.680 --> 21:22.600
 I bring up aliens every single conversation.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.000
 So I don't know how you would know

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
 what the Drake equation is,

21:25.000 --> 21:28.600
 but you mean like the killer app,

21:28.600 --> 21:31.240
 it would be one alien civilization in that equation.

21:31.240 --> 21:34.800
 So meaning like this is in search of an application

21:34.800 --> 21:36.520
 that's impactful, transformative.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.080
 By the way, it should be, we need to come up

21:38.080 --> 21:41.560
 with a better term than killer app as a.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.060
 It's also violent, right?

21:43.060 --> 21:43.900
 It's very violent.

21:43.900 --> 21:46.680
 You can go like viral app, that's horrible too, right?

21:46.680 --> 21:51.520
 It's some very inspiringly impactful application.

21:51.520 --> 21:52.360
 How about that?

21:52.360 --> 21:53.180
 No. Yeah.

21:53.180 --> 21:55.320
 Okay, so ballistic with killer app, that's fine.

21:55.320 --> 21:56.960
 Nobody's. But I concur with you.

21:56.960 --> 22:01.960
 I dislike the chosen words in capturing the concept.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.840
 You know, it's one of those sticky things

22:03.840 --> 22:08.440
 that is as effective to use in the tech world.

22:08.440 --> 22:11.520
 But when you now become a communicator

22:11.520 --> 22:12.720
 outside of the tech world,

22:12.720 --> 22:15.360
 especially when you're talking about software and hardware

22:15.360 --> 22:17.360
 and artificial intelligence applications,

22:17.360 --> 22:18.200
 it sounds horrible.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.040
 Yeah, no, it's interesting.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.360
 I actually regret now having called attention

22:21.360 --> 22:24.200
 to cyber regret having used that word in this conversation

22:24.200 --> 22:26.120
 because it's something I would not normally do.

22:26.120 --> 22:29.120
 I used it in order to create a bridge

22:29.120 --> 22:31.120
 of shared understanding of how others would,

22:31.120 --> 22:32.800
 what terminology others would use.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.640
 Yeah.

22:33.640 --> 22:34.880
 But yeah, I concur.

22:34.880 --> 22:38.200
 Let's go with impactful application.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.040
 Or the.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.040
 Just value creation.

22:40.040 --> 22:41.360
 Value creation.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.600
 Something people love using.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.280
 There we go, that's it.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.760
 Love app.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.440
 Okay, so what, do you have any ideas?

22:49.440 --> 22:51.040
 So you're basically creating a framework

22:51.040 --> 22:54.220
 where there's the possibility of a discovery

22:54.220 --> 22:57.360
 of an application that people love using.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.640
 Is, do you have ideas?

22:59.640 --> 23:01.560
 We've began to play a fun game internally

23:01.560 --> 23:03.080
 where when we have these discussions

23:03.080 --> 23:06.840
 or we begin circling around this concept of,

23:08.340 --> 23:10.160
 does anybody have an idea?

23:10.160 --> 23:11.400
 Does anyone have intuitions?

23:11.400 --> 23:13.840
 And if we see the conversation starting

23:13.840 --> 23:15.820
 to veer in that direction,

23:15.820 --> 23:20.480
 we flag it and say, human intuition alert, stop it.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.140
 And so we really want to focus on the algorithm

23:23.140 --> 23:26.380
 of there's a natural process of human discovery.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.480
 That when you populate a system with devices

23:30.480 --> 23:33.080
 and you give people the opportunity to play around with it

23:33.080 --> 23:35.440
 in expected and unexpected ways,

23:35.440 --> 23:40.200
 we are thinking that is a much better system of discovery

23:40.200 --> 23:41.480
 than us exercising intuitions.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.600
 And it's interesting, we're also seeing

23:42.600 --> 23:45.920
 a few neuroscientists who have been talking to us.

23:45.920 --> 23:49.440
 While I was speaking to this one young associate professor,

23:49.440 --> 23:50.960
 and I approached a conversation and said,

23:50.960 --> 23:54.820
 hey, we have these five data streams that we're pulling off.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.120
 When you hear that, what weighted value

23:58.120 --> 23:59.520
 do you add to each data source?

23:59.520 --> 24:00.880
 Which one do you think is going to be valuable

24:00.880 --> 24:03.160
 for your objectives and which one's not?

24:03.160 --> 24:05.720
 And he said, I don't care, just give me the data.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.080
 All I care about is my machine learning model.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.800
 But importantly, he did not have a theory of mind.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.380
 He did not come to the table and say,

24:12.380 --> 24:15.080
 I think the brain operates in this way

24:15.080 --> 24:16.880
 and these reasons or have these functions.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.040
 He didn't care, he just wanted the data.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.800
 And we're seeing that more and more

24:20.800 --> 24:25.800
 that certain people are devaluing human intuitions

24:26.580 --> 24:28.360
 for good reasons, as we've seen in machine learning

24:28.360 --> 24:30.580
 over the past couple years.

24:30.580 --> 24:34.480
 And we're doing the same in our value creation market

24:34.480 --> 24:36.020
 strategy.

24:36.020 --> 24:39.220
 So collect more data, clean data,

24:40.360 --> 24:42.960
 make the product such that the collection of data

24:42.960 --> 24:47.960
 is easy and fun and then the rest will just spring to life.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.540
 Through humans playing around with them.

24:50.540 --> 24:54.020
 Our objective is to create the most valuable

24:54.020 --> 24:59.020
 data collection system of the brain ever.

25:01.340 --> 25:05.780
 And with that, then applying all the best tools

25:05.780 --> 25:09.500
 of machine learning and other techniques

25:09.500 --> 25:13.780
 to extract out, to try to find insight.

25:13.780 --> 25:16.220
 But yes, our objective is really to systematize

25:16.220 --> 25:19.900
 the discovery process because we can't put

25:19.900 --> 25:22.020
 definite timeframes on discovery.

25:22.020 --> 25:25.820
 The brain is complicated and science

25:25.820 --> 25:28.140
 is not a business strategy.

25:28.140 --> 25:30.540
 And so we really need to figure out how to,

25:31.580 --> 25:34.060
 this is the difficulty of bringing technology

25:34.060 --> 25:34.900
 like this to market.

25:34.900 --> 25:38.300
 And it's why most of the time it just languishes

25:38.300 --> 25:40.980
 in academia for quite some time.

25:40.980 --> 25:44.060
 But we hope that we will cross over

25:44.060 --> 25:48.960
 and make this mainstream in the coming years.

25:48.960 --> 25:53.240
 The thing was cool to wear, but are you chasing

25:53.240 --> 25:56.880
 a good reason for millions of people to put this

25:56.880 --> 26:00.860
 on their head and keep on their head regularly?

26:00.860 --> 26:04.740
 Is there, like who's going to discover that reason?

26:04.740 --> 26:08.060
 Is it going to be people just kind of organically

26:08.060 --> 26:12.520
 or is there going to be an Angry Birds style application

26:12.520 --> 26:17.120
 that's just too exciting to not use?

26:18.140 --> 26:20.940
 If I think through the things that have changed

26:20.940 --> 26:23.500
 my life most significantly over the past few years,

26:23.500 --> 26:27.140
 when I started wearing a wearable on my wrist

26:27.140 --> 26:29.100
 that would give me data about my heart rate,

26:29.100 --> 26:31.100
 heart rate variability, respiration rate,

26:33.680 --> 26:36.140
 metabolic approximations, et cetera,

26:37.180 --> 26:38.660
 for the first time in my life,

26:38.660 --> 26:41.780
 I had access to information, sleep patterns

26:41.780 --> 26:43.220
 that were highly impactful.

26:43.220 --> 26:48.220
 They told me, for example, if I eat close to bedtime,

26:48.620 --> 26:50.840
 I'm not going to get deep sleep.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.760
 And not getting deep sleep means you have

26:52.760 --> 26:54.420
 all these follow on consequences in life.

26:54.420 --> 26:59.420
 And so it opened up this window of understanding of myself

26:59.500 --> 27:03.180
 that I cannot self introspect and deduce these things.

27:03.180 --> 27:06.180
 This is information that was available to be acquired,

27:06.180 --> 27:07.060
 but it just wasn't.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.840
 I would have to get an expensive sleep study,

27:08.840 --> 27:10.460
 then it's an end, like one night,

27:10.460 --> 27:12.500
 and that's not good enough to look at, to run all my trials.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.340
 And so if you look just at the information

27:15.340 --> 27:17.260
 that one can acquire on their wrist,

27:18.220 --> 27:20.180
 and now you're applying it to the entire cortex

27:20.180 --> 27:22.280
 on the brain and you say,

27:22.280 --> 27:25.020
 what kind of information could we acquire?

27:25.020 --> 27:28.360
 It opens up a whole new universe of possibilities.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.140
 For example, we did this internal study at Kernel

27:30.140 --> 27:31.660
 where I wore a prototype device

27:32.540 --> 27:36.180
 and we were measuring the cognitive effects of sleep.

27:36.180 --> 27:38.420
 So I had a device measuring my sleep.

27:38.420 --> 27:41.740
 I performed with 13 of my coworkers.

27:41.740 --> 27:45.740
 We performed four cognitive tasks over 13 sessions.

27:45.740 --> 27:48.620
 And we focused on reaction time, impulse control,

27:49.860 --> 27:52.780
 short term memory, and then a resting state task.

27:52.780 --> 27:55.140
 And with mine, we found, for example,

27:55.140 --> 28:00.140
 that my impulse control was independently correlated

28:00.460 --> 28:02.320
 with my sleep outside of behavioral measures

28:02.320 --> 28:04.100
 of my ability to play the game.

28:04.100 --> 28:07.540
 The point of the study was I had,

28:07.540 --> 28:12.060
 the brain study I did at Kernel confirmed my life experience

28:12.060 --> 28:17.060
 that if I, my deep sleep determined whether or not

28:18.040 --> 28:21.580
 I would be able to resist temptation the following day.

28:21.580 --> 28:24.400
 And my brain did show that as one example.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.700
 And so if you start thinking,

28:25.700 --> 28:27.900
 if you actually have data on yourself,

28:27.900 --> 28:30.880
 on your entire cortex and you can control the settings,

28:32.180 --> 28:36.860
 I think there's probably a large number of things

28:36.860 --> 28:37.980
 that we could discover about ourselves,

28:37.980 --> 28:39.860
 very, very small and very, very big.

28:39.860 --> 28:42.680
 I just, for example, like when you read news,

28:43.580 --> 28:44.820
 what's going on?

28:44.820 --> 28:47.620
 Like when you use social media, when you use news,

28:47.620 --> 28:51.340
 like all the ways we allocate attention.

28:51.340 --> 28:52.180
 That's right.

28:52.180 --> 28:53.000
 With the computer.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.540
 I mean, that seems like a compelling place

28:54.540 --> 28:58.260
 to where you would want to put on a Kernel,

28:58.260 --> 28:59.180
 by the way, what is it called?

28:59.180 --> 29:00.860
 Kernel Flux, Kernel, like what?

29:00.860 --> 29:01.780
 Flow.

29:01.780 --> 29:02.620
 Flow.

29:02.620 --> 29:04.260
 We have two technologies, you or Flow.

29:04.260 --> 29:05.540
 Flow, okay.

29:05.540 --> 29:08.280
 So when you put on the Kernel Flow,

29:11.020 --> 29:16.020
 it seems like to be a compelling time and place to do it

29:16.300 --> 29:18.660
 is when you're behind a desk, behind a computer.

29:18.660 --> 29:19.660
 Because you could probably wear it

29:19.660 --> 29:23.740
 for prolonged periods of time as you're taking in content.

29:23.740 --> 29:25.300
 And there could a lot of,

29:25.300 --> 29:28.220
 because so much of our lives happens

29:28.220 --> 29:29.960
 in the digital world now.

29:29.960 --> 29:34.620
 That kind of coupling the information about the human mind

29:34.620 --> 29:39.540
 with the consumption and the behaviors in the digital world

29:39.540 --> 29:42.100
 might give us a lot of information about the effects

29:42.100 --> 29:45.120
 of the way we behave and navigate the digital world

29:45.120 --> 29:50.120
 to the actual physical meat space effects on our body.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.420
 It's interesting to think,

29:51.420 --> 29:53.580
 so in terms of both like for work,

29:54.760 --> 29:59.740
 I'm a big fan of Cal Newport, his ideas of deep work

29:59.740 --> 30:04.740
 that I spend, with few exceptions,

30:05.020 --> 30:07.860
 I try to spend the first two hours of every day,

30:07.860 --> 30:11.340
 usually if I'm like at home and have nothing on my schedule

30:11.340 --> 30:15.020
 is going to be up to eight hours of deep work,

30:15.020 --> 30:16.740
 of focus, zero distraction.

30:16.740 --> 30:20.060
 And for me to analyze, I mean I'm very aware

30:20.060 --> 30:24.780
 of the waning of that, the ups and downs of that.

30:24.780 --> 30:27.940
 And it's almost like you're surfing the ups and downs

30:27.940 --> 30:29.440
 of that as you're doing programming,

30:29.440 --> 30:32.580
 as you're doing thinking about particular problems,

30:32.580 --> 30:34.260
 you're trying to visualize things in your mind,

30:34.260 --> 30:37.300
 you start trying to stitch them together.

30:37.300 --> 30:40.960
 You're trying to, when there's a dead end about an idea,

30:40.960 --> 30:45.520
 you have to kind of calmly like walk back and start again,

30:45.520 --> 30:47.260
 all those kinds of processes.

30:47.260 --> 30:49.020
 It'd be interesting to get data

30:49.020 --> 30:51.100
 on what my mind is actually doing.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.360
 And also recently started doing,

30:53.360 --> 30:55.940
 I just talked to Sam Harris a few days ago

30:55.940 --> 30:58.080
 and been building up to that.

30:58.080 --> 31:01.900
 I started using, started meditating using his app,

31:01.900 --> 31:05.340
 Waking Up, I very much recommend it.

31:05.340 --> 31:07.500
 It'd be interesting to get data on that

31:07.500 --> 31:10.540
 because it's, you're very, it's like you're removing

31:10.540 --> 31:13.740
 all the noise from your head and you very much,

31:13.740 --> 31:17.360
 it's an active process of active noise removal,

31:18.340 --> 31:21.220
 active noise canceling like the headphones.

31:21.220 --> 31:24.900
 And it'd be interesting to see what is going on in the mind

31:24.900 --> 31:28.400
 before the meditation, during it and after,

31:28.400 --> 31:29.240
 all those kinds of things.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.280
 And all of your examples, it's interesting

31:31.280 --> 31:35.400
 that everyone who's designed an experience for you,

31:35.400 --> 31:38.520
 so whether it be the meditation app or the Deep Work

31:38.520 --> 31:40.400
 or all the things you mentioned,

31:40.400 --> 31:43.280
 they constructed this product

31:43.280 --> 31:45.920
 with a certain number of knowns.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.040
 Yeah.

31:47.040 --> 31:50.580
 Now, what if we expanded the number of knowns by 10X

31:50.580 --> 31:54.240
 or 20X or 30X, they would reconstruct their product

31:54.240 --> 31:55.480
 or incorporate those knowns.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.520
 So it'd be, and so this is the dimensionality

31:58.520 --> 32:00.320
 that I think is the promising aspect

32:00.320 --> 32:04.600
 is that people will be able to use this quantification,

32:04.600 --> 32:09.260
 use this information to build more effective products.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.360
 And this is, I'm not talking about better products

32:11.360 --> 32:13.960
 to advertise to you or manipulate you.

32:13.960 --> 32:17.820
 I'm talking about our focus is helping people,

32:17.820 --> 32:20.360
 individuals have this contextual awareness

32:20.360 --> 32:23.040
 and this quantification and then to engage with others

32:23.040 --> 32:26.060
 who are seeking to improve people's lives,

32:26.060 --> 32:31.060
 that the objective is betterment across ourselves,

32:31.360 --> 32:33.480
 individually and also with each other.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.000
 Yeah, so it's a nice data stream to have

32:35.000 --> 32:36.120
 if you're building an app,

32:36.120 --> 32:38.040
 like if you're building a podcast listening app,

32:38.040 --> 32:40.320
 it would be nice to know data about the listener

32:40.320 --> 32:42.820
 so that like if you're bored or you fell asleep,

32:42.820 --> 32:46.000
 maybe pause the podcast, it's like really dumb,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.400
 just very simple applications

32:48.400 --> 32:50.640
 that could just improve the quality of the experience

32:50.640 --> 32:52.000
 of using the app.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.680
 I'm imagining if you have your neural, this is Lex

32:56.680 --> 32:59.880
 and there's a statistical representation of you

32:59.880 --> 33:02.540
 and you engage with the app and it says,

33:02.540 --> 33:07.540
 Lex, you're best to engage with this meditation exercise

33:09.560 --> 33:11.040
 in the following settings.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.020
 At this time of day, after eating this kind of food

33:14.020 --> 33:17.380
 or not eating, fasting with this level of blood glucose

33:17.380 --> 33:19.680
 and this kind of night's sleep.

33:19.680 --> 33:23.000
 But all these data combined

33:23.000 --> 33:26.600
 to give you this contextually relevant experience,

33:26.600 --> 33:27.800
 just like we do with our sleep.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.360
 You've optimized your entire life based upon

33:30.360 --> 33:33.240
 what information you can acquire and know about yourself.

33:34.240 --> 33:37.200
 And so the question is, how much do we really know

33:37.200 --> 33:38.480
 of the things going around us?

33:38.480 --> 33:41.520
 And I would venture to guess in my own life experience,

33:41.520 --> 33:45.920
 I capture, my self awareness captures an extremely small

33:45.920 --> 33:47.760
 percent of the things that actually influence

33:47.760 --> 33:50.500
 my conscious and unconscious experience.

33:50.500 --> 33:54.560
 Well, in some sense, the data would help encourage you

33:54.560 --> 33:57.520
 to be more self aware, not just because you trust everything

33:57.520 --> 34:02.520
 the data is saying, but it'll give you a prod

34:02.820 --> 34:04.800
 to start investigating.

34:04.800 --> 34:08.040
 Like I would love to get like a rating,

34:08.040 --> 34:11.160
 like a ranking of all the things I do

34:11.160 --> 34:13.800
 and what are the things, it's probably important to do

34:13.800 --> 34:16.280
 without the data, but the data will certainly help.

34:16.280 --> 34:19.840
 It's like rank all the things you do in life

34:19.840 --> 34:21.800
 and which ones make you feel shitty,

34:21.800 --> 34:23.600
 which ones make you feel good.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.460
 Like you're talking about evening, Brian.

34:26.460 --> 34:30.320
 Like this is a good example, somebody like,

34:30.320 --> 34:32.680
 I do pig out at night as well.

34:32.680 --> 34:35.840
 And it never makes me feel good.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.400
 Like you're in a safe space.

34:37.400 --> 34:40.440
 This is a safe space, let's hear it.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.720
 No, I definitely have much less self control

34:42.720 --> 34:44.400
 at night and it's interesting.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.760
 And the same, people might criticize this,

34:47.760 --> 34:50.000
 but I know my own body.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.800
 I know when I eat carnivores, just eat meat,

34:52.800 --> 34:57.800
 I feel much better than if I eat more carbs.

35:00.120 --> 35:02.300
 The more carbs I eat, the worse I feel.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.160
 I don't know why that is.

35:04.160 --> 35:05.260
 There is science supporting it,

35:05.260 --> 35:06.640
 but I'm not leaning on science.

35:06.640 --> 35:07.720
 I'm leaning on personal experience

35:07.720 --> 35:09.360
 and that's really important.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.560
 I don't need to read, I'm not gonna go on a whole rant

35:12.560 --> 35:15.680
 about nutrition science, but many of those studies

35:15.680 --> 35:17.160
 are very flawed.

35:17.160 --> 35:19.420
 They're doing their best, but nutrition science

35:19.420 --> 35:21.680
 is a very difficult field of study

35:21.680 --> 35:24.200
 because humans are so different

35:24.200 --> 35:26.120
 and the mind has so much impact

35:26.120 --> 35:28.440
 on the way your body behaves.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.800
 And it's so difficult from a scientific perspective

35:30.800 --> 35:32.760
 to conduct really strong studies

35:32.760 --> 35:36.960
 that you have to be almost like a scientist of one

35:36.960 --> 35:39.020
 if to do these studies on yourself.

35:39.020 --> 35:41.560
 That's the best way to understand what works for you or not.

35:41.560 --> 35:44.560
 And I don't understand why, because it sounds unhealthy,

35:44.560 --> 35:47.440
 but eating only meat always makes me feel good.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.680
 Just eat meat, that's it.

35:49.680 --> 35:52.880
 And I don't have any allergies, any of that kind of stuff.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.520
 I'm not full like Jordan Peterson,

35:54.520 --> 35:59.520
 where if he deviates a little bit from the carnivore diet,

36:01.360 --> 36:03.200
 he goes off the cliff.

36:03.200 --> 36:06.320
 No, I can have chocolate, I can go off the diet,

36:06.320 --> 36:11.320
 I feel fine, it's a gradual worsening of how I feel.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.080
 But when I eat only meat, I feel great.

36:17.080 --> 36:19.280
 And it'd be nice to be reminded of that.

36:19.280 --> 36:20.920
 Like there's a very simple fact

36:21.920 --> 36:24.200
 that I feel good when I eat carnivore.

36:24.200 --> 36:27.560
 And I think that repeats itself in all kinds of experiences.

36:27.560 --> 36:32.560
 Like I feel really good when I exercise.

36:32.560 --> 36:37.560
 I hate exercise, but in the rest of the day,

36:39.760 --> 36:43.640
 the impact it has on my mind and the clarity of mind

36:43.640 --> 36:45.800
 and the experiences and the happiness

36:45.800 --> 36:48.040
 and all those kinds of things, I feel really good.

36:48.040 --> 36:52.440
 And to be able to concretely express that through data

36:52.440 --> 36:53.800
 would be nice.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.840
 It would be a nice reminder, almost like a statement,

36:55.840 --> 36:58.280
 like remember what feels good and whatnot.

36:58.280 --> 37:01.800
 And there could be things like that,

37:01.800 --> 37:04.560
 I'm not, many things that you're suggesting

37:04.560 --> 37:07.000
 that I could not be aware of,

37:07.000 --> 37:09.080
 that might be sitting right in front of me

37:09.080 --> 37:12.160
 that make me feel really good and make me feel not good.

37:12.160 --> 37:14.000
 And the data would show that.

37:14.000 --> 37:14.840
 I agree with you.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.320
 I've actually employed the same strategy.

37:17.320 --> 37:21.480
 I fired my mind entirely from being responsible

37:21.480 --> 37:23.240
 for constructing my diet.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.600
 And so I started doing a program

37:24.600 --> 37:28.680
 where I now track over 200 biomarkers every 90 days.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.800
 And it captures, of course, the things you would expect

37:31.800 --> 37:34.360
 like cholesterol, but also DNA methylation

37:34.360 --> 37:37.120
 and all kinds of things about my body,

37:37.120 --> 37:39.360
 all the processes that make up me.

37:39.360 --> 37:42.080
 And then I let that data generate the shopping lists.

37:43.280 --> 37:45.560
 And so I never actually ask my mind what it wants.

37:45.560 --> 37:48.360
 It's entirely what my body is reporting that it wants.

37:48.360 --> 37:51.760
 And so I call this goal alignment within Brian.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.480
 And there's 200 plus actors

37:53.480 --> 37:55.240
 that I'm currently asking their opinion of.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.800
 And so I'm asking my liver, how are you doing?

37:57.800 --> 38:00.200
 And it's expressing via the biomarkers.

38:00.200 --> 38:02.280
 And so that I construct that diet

38:02.280 --> 38:06.160
 and I only eat those foods until my next testing round.

38:06.160 --> 38:10.840
 And that has changed my life more than I think anything else

38:10.840 --> 38:15.840
 because in the demotion of my conscious mind

38:15.920 --> 38:18.000
 that I gave primacy to my entire life,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.480
 it led me astray because like you were saying,

38:20.480 --> 38:22.520
 the mind then goes out into the world

38:22.520 --> 38:25.720
 and it navigates the dozens

38:25.720 --> 38:29.080
 of different dietary regimens people put together in books.

38:29.080 --> 38:32.760
 And it's all has their supporting science

38:32.760 --> 38:35.720
 in certain contextual settings, but it's not N of one.

38:35.720 --> 38:39.440
 And like you're saying, this dietary really is an N of one.

38:39.440 --> 38:41.920
 What people have published scientifically of course

38:41.920 --> 38:46.480
 can be used for nice groundings,

38:46.480 --> 38:48.580
 but it changes when you get to an N of one level.

38:48.580 --> 38:51.680
 And so that's what gets me excited about brain interfaces

38:51.680 --> 38:54.640
 is if I could do the same thing for my brain

38:54.640 --> 38:58.000
 where I can stop asking my conscious mind for its advice

38:58.000 --> 39:01.520
 or for its decision making, which is flawed.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.520
 And I'd rather just look at this data

39:03.520 --> 39:05.640
 and I've never had better health markers in my life

39:05.640 --> 39:08.000
 than when I stopped actually asking myself

39:08.000 --> 39:09.680
 to be in charge of it.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.840
 The idea of demotion of the conscious mind

39:15.040 --> 39:20.040
 is such a sort of engineering way of phrasing meditation.

39:21.680 --> 39:22.840
 That's what we're doing, right?

39:22.840 --> 39:26.120
 That's beautiful, that means really beautifully put.

39:26.120 --> 39:28.560
 By the way, testing round, what does that look like?

39:28.560 --> 39:29.900
 What's that?

39:29.900 --> 39:31.360
 Well, you mentioned.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.240
 Yeah, the test I do.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.080
 Yes.

39:34.080 --> 39:37.560
 So it includes a complete blood panel.

39:37.560 --> 39:39.040
 I do a microbiome test.

39:39.040 --> 39:43.560
 I do a diet induced inflammation.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.440
 So I look for exotokine expressions.

39:45.440 --> 39:48.400
 So foods that produce inflammatory reactions.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.120
 I look at my neuroendocrine systems.

39:50.120 --> 39:53.000
 I look at all my neurotransmitters.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.440
 I do, yeah, there's several micronutrient tests

39:57.440 --> 39:59.400
 to see how I'm looking at the various nutrients.

39:59.400 --> 40:04.400
 What about self report of how you feel?

40:04.500 --> 40:09.160
 Almost like, you can't demote your,

40:09.160 --> 40:12.520
 you still exist within your conscious mind, right?

40:12.520 --> 40:16.280
 So that lived experience is of a lot of value.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.880
 So how do you measure that?

40:17.880 --> 40:20.920
 I do a temporal sampling over some duration of time.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.720
 So I'll think through how I feel over a week,

40:23.720 --> 40:25.760
 over a month, over three months.

40:25.760 --> 40:27.540
 I don't do a temporal sampling of

40:27.540 --> 40:29.680
 if I'm at the grocery store in front of a cereal box

40:29.680 --> 40:31.800
 and be like, you know what, Captain Crunch

40:31.800 --> 40:33.320
 is probably the right thing for me today

40:33.320 --> 40:36.560
 because I'm feeling like I need a little fun in my life.

40:36.560 --> 40:37.640
 And so it's a temporal sampling.

40:37.640 --> 40:38.840
 If the data sets large enough,

40:38.840 --> 40:42.200
 then I smooth out the function of my natural oscillations

40:42.200 --> 40:45.360
 of how I feel about life where some days I may feel upset

40:45.360 --> 40:47.360
 or depressed or down or whatever.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.920
 And I don't want those moments

40:48.920 --> 40:50.480
 to then rule my decision making.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.480
 That's why the demotion happens.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.160
 And it says, really, if you're looking at

40:54.160 --> 40:56.520
 health over a 90 day period of time,

40:56.520 --> 41:00.040
 all my 200 voices speak up on that interval.

41:00.040 --> 41:02.360
 And they're all given voice to say,

41:02.360 --> 41:04.600
 this is how I'm doing and this is what I want.

41:04.600 --> 41:07.120
 And so it really is an accounting system for everybody.

41:07.120 --> 41:10.140
 So that's why I think that if you think about

41:10.140 --> 41:11.740
 the future of being human,

41:11.740 --> 41:16.740
 there's two things I think that are really going on.

41:17.820 --> 41:20.020
 One is the design, manufacturing,

41:20.020 --> 41:21.620
 and distribution of intelligence

41:22.860 --> 41:25.620
 is heading towards zero on a cost curve

41:26.740 --> 41:30.180
 over a certain design, over a certain timeframe

41:30.180 --> 41:33.140
 that our ability to, you know, evolution produced us

41:33.140 --> 41:35.580
 an intelligent form of intelligence.

41:35.580 --> 41:38.580
 We are now designing our own intelligence systems

41:38.580 --> 41:40.140
 and the design, manufacturing, distribution

41:40.140 --> 41:42.860
 of that intelligence over a certain timeframe

41:42.860 --> 41:45.100
 is going to go to a cost of zero.

41:45.100 --> 41:48.060
 Design, manufacturing, distribution of intelligence

41:48.060 --> 41:49.700
 cost is going to zero.

41:49.700 --> 41:50.540
 For example.

41:50.540 --> 41:52.540
 Again, just give me a second.

41:52.540 --> 41:54.540
 That's brilliant, okay.

41:54.540 --> 41:58.300
 And evolution is doing the design, manufacturing,

41:58.300 --> 41:59.880
 distribution of intelligence.

41:59.880 --> 42:02.380
 And now we are doing the design, manufacturing,

42:02.380 --> 42:04.420
 distribution of intelligence.

42:04.420 --> 42:06.660
 And the cost of that is going to zero.

42:06.660 --> 42:10.780
 That's a very nice way of looking at life on Earth.

42:10.780 --> 42:14.740
 So if that's going on and then now in parallel to that,

42:15.580 --> 42:19.060
 then you say, okay, what then happens

42:19.060 --> 42:23.420
 if when that cost curve is heading to zero?

42:24.700 --> 42:28.780
 Our existence becomes a goal alignment problem,

42:28.780 --> 42:31.340
 a goal alignment function.

42:31.340 --> 42:33.060
 And so the same thing I'm doing

42:33.060 --> 42:34.880
 where I'm doing goal alignment within myself

42:34.880 --> 42:37.580
 of these 200 biomarkers, where I'm saying,

42:37.580 --> 42:41.740
 when Brian exists on a daily basis

42:41.740 --> 42:43.740
 and this entity is deciding what to eat

42:43.740 --> 42:45.300
 and what to do and et cetera,

42:45.300 --> 42:47.780
 it's not just my conscious mind, which is opining,

42:47.780 --> 42:50.220
 it's 200 biological processes

42:50.220 --> 42:52.140
 and there's a whole bunch of more voices involved.

42:52.140 --> 42:55.460
 So in that equation,

42:57.400 --> 43:02.060
 we're going to increasingly automate the things

43:02.060 --> 43:05.340
 that we spend high energy on today because it's easier.

43:05.340 --> 43:09.260
 And now we're going to then negotiate the terms

43:09.260 --> 43:11.200
 and conditions of intelligent life.

43:11.200 --> 43:13.180
 Now we say conscious existence because we're biased

43:13.180 --> 43:15.100
 because that's what we have,

43:15.100 --> 43:18.140
 but it will be the largest computational exercise

43:18.140 --> 43:20.380
 in history because you're now doing goal alignment

43:20.380 --> 43:24.100
 with planet Earth, within yourself, with each other,

43:24.980 --> 43:26.900
 within all the intelligent agents we're building,

43:26.900 --> 43:29.420
 bots and other voice assistants.

43:29.420 --> 43:32.020
 You basically have a trillions and trillions of agents

43:32.020 --> 43:35.860
 working on the negotiation of goal alignment.

43:35.860 --> 43:39.180
 Yeah, this is in fact true.

43:39.180 --> 43:40.580
 And what was the second thing?

43:40.580 --> 43:41.420
 That was it.

43:41.420 --> 43:44.300
 So the cost, the design, manufacturing, distribution

43:44.300 --> 43:45.860
 of intelligence going to zero,

43:45.860 --> 43:48.660
 which then means what's really going on?

43:48.660 --> 43:50.180
 What are we really doing?

43:50.180 --> 43:55.100
 We're negotiating the terms and conditions of existence.

43:55.100 --> 43:59.220
 Do you worry about the survival of this process

43:59.220 --> 44:04.220
 that life as we know it on Earth comes to an end

44:04.900 --> 44:06.620
 or at least intelligent life,

44:06.620 --> 44:11.580
 that as the cost goes to zero something happens

44:11.580 --> 44:14.980
 where all of that intelligence is thrown in the trash

44:14.980 --> 44:19.220
 by something like nuclear war or development of AGI systems

44:19.220 --> 44:21.960
 that are very dumb, not AGI I guess,

44:21.960 --> 44:25.380
 but AI systems, the paperclip thing,

44:25.380 --> 44:28.980
 en masse is dumb but has unintended consequences

44:28.980 --> 44:31.060
 where it destroys human civilization.

44:31.060 --> 44:32.260
 Do you worry about those kinds of things?

44:32.260 --> 44:37.140
 I mean, it's unsurprising that a new thing

44:37.140 --> 44:40.980
 comes into the sphere of human consciousness.

44:40.980 --> 44:43.020
 Humans identify the foreign object,

44:43.020 --> 44:45.460
 in this case, artificial intelligence.

44:45.460 --> 44:49.100
 Our amygdala fires up and says scary, foreign,

44:50.660 --> 44:53.300
 we should be apprehensive about this.

44:53.300 --> 44:57.020
 And so it makes sense from a biological perspective

44:57.020 --> 45:00.960
 that humans, the knee jerk reaction is fear.

45:02.060 --> 45:07.060
 What I don't think has been properly weighted with that

45:08.260 --> 45:13.260
 is that we are the first generation of intelligent beings

45:13.940 --> 45:17.260
 on this Earth that has been able to look out

45:17.260 --> 45:18.900
 over their expected lifetime

45:20.420 --> 45:23.420
 and see there is a real possibility of evolving

45:23.420 --> 45:28.420
 into entirely novel forms of consciousness, so different

45:28.780 --> 45:33.060
 that it would be totally unrecognizable to us today.

45:33.060 --> 45:34.900
 We don't have words for it, we can't hint at it,

45:34.900 --> 45:36.900
 we can't point at it, we can't,

45:36.900 --> 45:38.460
 you can't look in the sky and see that thing

45:38.460 --> 45:40.940
 that is shining, we're gonna go up there.

45:40.940 --> 45:45.940
 You cannot even create an aspirational statement about it.

45:46.780 --> 45:51.780
 And instead we've had this knee jerk reaction of fear

45:51.780 --> 45:53.540
 about everything that could go wrong.

45:53.540 --> 45:58.540
 But in my estimation, this should be the defining aspiration

46:00.500 --> 46:04.540
 of all intelligent life on Earth that we would aspire,

46:04.540 --> 46:08.020
 that basically every generation surveys the landscape

46:08.020 --> 46:09.380
 of possibilities that are afforded,

46:09.380 --> 46:10.980
 given the technological, cultural

46:10.980 --> 46:14.500
 and other contextual situation that they're in.

46:14.500 --> 46:17.940
 We're in this context, we haven't yet identified this

46:17.940 --> 46:22.660
 and said, this is unbelievable, we should carefully

46:22.660 --> 46:26.060
 think this thing through, not just of mitigating

46:26.060 --> 46:27.100
 the things that'll wipe us out,

46:27.100 --> 46:29.540
 but we have this potential,

46:29.540 --> 46:31.580
 and so we just haven't given voice to it,

46:31.580 --> 46:33.740
 even though it's within this realm of possibilities.

46:33.740 --> 46:35.340
 So you're excited about the possibility

46:35.340 --> 46:37.020
 of superintelligence systems

46:37.020 --> 46:38.980
 and the opportunities that bring,

46:38.980 --> 46:41.660
 I mean, there's parallels to this,

46:41.660 --> 46:43.940
 you think about people before the internet

46:43.940 --> 46:45.940
 as the internet was coming to life,

46:45.940 --> 46:50.940
 I mean, there's kind of a fog through which you can't see,

46:51.020 --> 46:52.620
 what does the future look like?

46:54.340 --> 46:56.460
 Predicting collective intelligence,

46:56.460 --> 46:57.740
 which I don't think we're understanding

46:57.740 --> 46:59.300
 that we're living through that now,

46:59.300 --> 47:03.100
 is that there's now, we've in some sense

47:03.100 --> 47:05.580
 stopped being individual intelligences

47:05.580 --> 47:09.420
 and become much more like collective intelligences,

47:09.420 --> 47:13.780
 because ideas travel much, much faster now,

47:13.780 --> 47:16.700
 and they can, in a viral way,

47:16.700 --> 47:18.940
 sweep across the populations,

47:18.940 --> 47:23.340
 and so it's almost, I mean, it almost feels like

47:23.340 --> 47:26.500
 a thought is had by many people now,

47:26.500 --> 47:27.940
 thousands or millions of people

47:27.940 --> 47:29.780
 as opposed to an individual person,

47:29.780 --> 47:30.860
 and that's changed everything,

47:30.860 --> 47:33.060
 but to me, I don't think we're realizing

47:33.060 --> 47:36.220
 how much that actually changed people or societies,

47:36.220 --> 47:38.980
 but to predict that before the internet

47:38.980 --> 47:41.220
 would have been very difficult,

47:41.220 --> 47:43.220
 and in that same way, we're sitting here

47:43.220 --> 47:45.300
 with the fog before us, thinking,

47:45.300 --> 47:49.620
 what is superintelligence systems,

47:49.620 --> 47:51.780
 how is that going to change the world?

47:51.780 --> 47:54.740
 What is increasing the bandwidth,

47:54.740 --> 47:59.380
 like plugging our brains into this whole thing,

47:59.380 --> 48:01.340
 how is that going to change the world?

48:01.340 --> 48:05.740
 And it seems like it's a fog, you don't know,

48:05.740 --> 48:10.740
 and it could be, it could, whatever comes to be,

48:10.820 --> 48:12.460
 could destroy the world,

48:12.460 --> 48:13.940
 we could be the last generation,

48:14.980 --> 48:18.100
 but it also could transform in ways

48:18.100 --> 48:23.100
 that creates an incredibly fulfilling life experience

48:24.500 --> 48:27.380
 that's unlike anything we've ever experienced.

48:27.380 --> 48:30.420
 It might involve dissolution of ego and consciousness

48:30.420 --> 48:32.620
 and so on, you're no longer one individual,

48:32.620 --> 48:35.980
 it might be more, you know,

48:35.980 --> 48:38.900
 that might be a certain kind of death, an ego death,

48:38.900 --> 48:42.220
 but the experience might be really exciting and enriching,

48:42.220 --> 48:44.020
 maybe we'll live in a virtual,

48:44.020 --> 48:47.020
 like it's like, it's funny to think about

48:48.100 --> 48:49.900
 a bunch of sort of hypothetical questions

48:49.900 --> 48:54.900
 of would it be more fulfilling to live in a virtual world?

48:57.820 --> 48:59.540
 Like if you were able to plug your brain in

48:59.540 --> 49:02.700
 in a very dense way into a video game,

49:03.580 --> 49:05.700
 like which world would you want to live in?

49:05.700 --> 49:08.860
 In the video game or in the physical world?

49:08.860 --> 49:12.940
 For most of us, we're kind of toying it

49:12.940 --> 49:14.100
 with the idea of the video game,

49:14.100 --> 49:16.060
 but we still want to live in the physical world,

49:16.060 --> 49:20.060
 have friendships and relationships in the physical world,

49:20.060 --> 49:23.380
 but we don't know that, again, it's a fog,

49:23.380 --> 49:25.460
 and maybe in 100 years,

49:25.460 --> 49:27.180
 we're all living inside a video game,

49:27.180 --> 49:29.060
 hopefully not Call of Duty,

49:29.060 --> 49:33.060
 hopefully more like Sims 5, which version is it on?

49:33.940 --> 49:36.060
 For you individually though,

49:36.060 --> 49:39.940
 does it make you sad that your brain ends?

49:41.620 --> 49:44.340
 That you die one day very soon?

49:45.900 --> 49:49.220
 That the whole thing, that data source

49:49.220 --> 49:53.620
 just goes offline sooner than you would like?

49:54.660 --> 49:56.060
 That's a complicated question.

49:56.060 --> 49:59.180
 I would have answered it differently

49:59.180 --> 50:00.620
 in different times in my life.

50:00.620 --> 50:03.300
 I had chronic depression for 10 years,

50:03.300 --> 50:06.060
 and so in that 10 year time period,

50:06.060 --> 50:09.140
 I desperately wanted lights to be off,

50:09.140 --> 50:11.060
 and the thing that made it even worse

50:11.060 --> 50:15.860
 is I was in a religious, I was born into a religion.

50:15.860 --> 50:17.780
 It was the only reality I ever understood,

50:17.780 --> 50:20.340
 and it's difficult to articulate to people

50:20.340 --> 50:22.180
 when you're born into that kind of reality

50:22.180 --> 50:24.860
 and it's the only reality you're exposed to,

50:24.860 --> 50:28.220
 you are literally blinded to the existence of other realities

50:28.220 --> 50:31.460
 because it's so much the in group, out group thing,

50:31.460 --> 50:33.820
 and so in that situation,

50:33.820 --> 50:37.300
 it was not only that I desperately wanted lights out forever,

50:37.300 --> 50:38.860
 it was that I couldn't have lights out forever.

50:38.860 --> 50:40.700
 It was that there was an afterlife,

50:40.700 --> 50:45.460
 and this afterlife had this system

50:45.460 --> 50:50.460
 that would either penalize or reward you for your behaviors,

50:50.500 --> 50:52.420
 and so it was almost like this,

50:53.860 --> 50:57.820
 this indescribable hopelessness

50:57.820 --> 51:01.060
 of not only being in hopeless despair

51:01.060 --> 51:02.180
 of not wanting to exist,

51:02.180 --> 51:05.180
 but then also being forced to exist,

51:05.180 --> 51:06.780
 and so there was a duration of my time,

51:06.780 --> 51:08.620
 a duration of life where I'd say,

51:08.620 --> 51:13.300
 like yes, I have no remorse for lights being out,

51:13.300 --> 51:15.380
 and I actually want it more than anything

51:15.380 --> 51:16.380
 in the entire world.

51:18.700 --> 51:21.260
 There are other times where I'm looking out at the future

51:21.260 --> 51:24.980
 and I say this is an opportunity

51:24.980 --> 51:27.860
 for a future evolving human conscious experience

51:27.860 --> 51:31.540
 that is beyond my ability to understand,

51:31.540 --> 51:34.380
 and I jump out of bed and I race to work

51:34.380 --> 51:37.620
 and I can't think about anything else,

51:37.620 --> 51:42.620
 but I think the reality for me is,

51:44.300 --> 51:45.740
 I don't know what it's like to be in your head,

51:45.740 --> 51:48.980
 but in my head, when I wake up in the morning,

51:48.980 --> 51:52.900
 I don't say good morning, Brian, I'm so happy to see you.

51:52.900 --> 51:55.980
 Like I'm sure you're just gonna be beautiful to me today.

51:55.980 --> 51:57.620
 You're not gonna make a huge long list

51:57.620 --> 51:59.140
 of everything you should be anxious about.

51:59.140 --> 52:01.420
 You're not gonna repeat that list to me 400 times.

52:01.420 --> 52:03.060
 You're not gonna have me relive

52:03.060 --> 52:04.660
 all the regrets I've made in life.

52:04.660 --> 52:06.060
 I'm sure you're not doing any of that.

52:06.060 --> 52:08.900
 You're just gonna just help me along all day long.

52:08.900 --> 52:11.820
 I mean, it's a brutal environment in my brain,

52:11.820 --> 52:15.580
 and we've just become normalized to this environment

52:15.580 --> 52:18.420
 that we just accept that this is what it means to be human,

52:18.420 --> 52:21.820
 but if we look at it, if we try to muster

52:21.820 --> 52:24.100
 as much soberness as we can

52:24.100 --> 52:27.260
 about the realities of being human, it's brutal.

52:27.260 --> 52:31.940
 If it is for me, and so am I sad

52:31.940 --> 52:34.100
 that the brain may be off one day?

52:37.060 --> 52:38.300
 It depends on the contextual setting.

52:38.300 --> 52:39.140
 Like how am I feeling?

52:39.140 --> 52:40.540
 At what moment are you asking me that?

52:40.540 --> 52:42.460
 And my mind is so fickle.

52:42.460 --> 52:45.180
 And this is why, again, I don't trust my conscious mind.

52:45.180 --> 52:47.500
 I have been given realities.

52:47.500 --> 52:51.540
 I was given a religious reality that was a video game.

52:51.540 --> 52:54.540
 And then I figured out it was not a real reality.

52:54.540 --> 52:56.260
 And then I lived in a depressive reality,

52:56.260 --> 52:59.740
 which delivered this terrible hopelessness.

52:59.740 --> 53:00.780
 That wasn't a real reality.

53:00.780 --> 53:03.180
 Then I discovered behavioral psychology,

53:03.180 --> 53:06.420
 and I figured out how biased, 188 chronicle biases,

53:06.420 --> 53:08.900
 and how my brain is distorting reality all the time.

53:08.900 --> 53:11.300
 I have gone from one reality to another.

53:11.300 --> 53:13.580
 I don't trust reality.

53:13.580 --> 53:15.860
 I don't trust realities are given to me.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.540
 And so to try to make a decision

53:17.540 --> 53:20.620
 on what I value or not value that future state,

53:20.620 --> 53:22.020
 I don't trust my response.

53:22.020 --> 53:27.020
 So not fully listening to the conscious mind

53:28.260 --> 53:31.020
 at any one moment as the ultimate truth,

53:31.020 --> 53:33.780
 but allowing it to go up and down as it does,

53:33.780 --> 53:35.300
 and just kind of being observing it.

53:35.300 --> 53:38.780
 Yes, I assume that whatever my conscious mind delivers up

53:38.780 --> 53:43.220
 to my awareness is wrong upon landing.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.060
 And I just need to figure out where it's wrong,

53:45.060 --> 53:46.900
 how it's wrong, how wrong it is,

53:46.900 --> 53:49.260
 and then try to correct for it as best I can.

53:49.260 --> 53:52.380
 But I assume that on impact,

53:52.380 --> 53:55.620
 it's mistaken in some critical ways.

53:55.620 --> 53:58.340
 Is there something you can say by way of advice

53:59.340 --> 54:00.860
 when the mind is depressive,

54:00.860 --> 54:03.700
 when the conscious mind serves up something that,

54:06.300 --> 54:08.980
 dark thoughts, how you deal with that,

54:08.980 --> 54:11.100
 like how in your own life you've overcome that,

54:11.100 --> 54:14.480
 and others who are experiencing that can overcome it?

54:15.500 --> 54:16.340
 Two things.

54:16.340 --> 54:21.340
 One, those depressive states are biochemical states.

54:25.660 --> 54:27.660
 It's not you.

54:28.700 --> 54:31.540
 And the suggestions that these things,

54:31.540 --> 54:33.060
 that this state delivers to you

54:33.060 --> 54:35.100
 about suggestion of the hopelessness of life

54:35.100 --> 54:37.420
 or the meaninglessness of it,

54:37.420 --> 54:41.260
 or that you should hit the eject button,

54:42.380 --> 54:44.020
 that's a false reality.

54:44.020 --> 54:47.660
 And that it's when,

54:47.660 --> 54:51.980
 I completely understand the rational decision

54:51.980 --> 54:53.340
 to commit suicide.

54:53.340 --> 54:55.180
 It is not lost on me at all

54:55.180 --> 54:57.340
 that that is an irrational situation,

54:57.340 --> 54:59.780
 but the key is when you're in that situation

54:59.780 --> 55:01.720
 and those thoughts are landing,

55:01.720 --> 55:04.880
 to be able to say, thank you, you're not real.

55:06.660 --> 55:08.140
 I know you're not real.

55:08.140 --> 55:10.620
 And so I'm in a situation where for whatever reason

55:10.620 --> 55:13.740
 I'm having this neurochemical state,

55:13.740 --> 55:16.300
 but that state can be altered.

55:16.300 --> 55:18.620
 And so again, it goes back to the realities

55:18.620 --> 55:21.240
 of the difficulties of being human.

55:21.240 --> 55:22.940
 And like when I was trying to solve my depression,

55:22.940 --> 55:27.900
 I tried literally, you name it, I tried it systematically,

55:27.900 --> 55:29.380
 and nothing would fix it.

55:29.380 --> 55:32.320
 And so this is what gives me hope with brain interfaces,

55:32.320 --> 55:35.420
 for example, like, could I have numbers on my brain?

55:35.420 --> 55:36.500
 Can I see what's going on?

55:36.500 --> 55:38.260
 Because I go to the doctor and it's like,

55:38.260 --> 55:39.100
 how do you feel?

55:39.100 --> 55:41.360
 I don't know, terrible.

55:41.360 --> 55:42.200
 Like on a scale from one to 10,

55:42.200 --> 55:43.460
 how bad do you want to commit suicide?

55:43.460 --> 55:44.300
 10.

55:45.680 --> 55:48.420
 Okay, here's his bottle.

55:48.420 --> 55:49.260
 How much should I take?

55:49.260 --> 55:51.060
 Well, I don't know, like just.

55:51.060 --> 55:52.900
 Yeah, it's very, very crude.

55:52.900 --> 55:55.060
 And this data opens up the,

55:56.540 --> 56:00.300
 yeah, it opens up the possibility of really helping

56:00.300 --> 56:03.460
 in those dark moments to first understand

56:03.460 --> 56:06.080
 the ways, the ups and downs of those dark moments.

56:06.080 --> 56:07.880
 On the complete flip side of that,

56:07.880 --> 56:12.880
 right, I am very conscious in my own brain

56:14.880 --> 56:19.120
 and deeply, deeply grateful that what there,

56:19.120 --> 56:23.000
 it's almost like a chemistry thing, a biochemistry thing

56:23.000 --> 56:26.080
 that I go many times throughout the day.

56:26.080 --> 56:31.080
 I'll look at like this cup and I'll be overcome with joy

56:31.720 --> 56:34.120
 how amazing it is to be alive.

56:34.120 --> 56:37.440
 Like I actually think my biochemistry is such

56:37.440 --> 56:42.440
 that it's not as common, like I've talked to people

56:42.440 --> 56:44.660
 and I don't think that's that common.

56:44.660 --> 56:48.220
 Like it's a, and it's not a rational thing at all.

56:48.220 --> 56:51.920
 It's like, I feel like I'm on drugs

56:51.920 --> 56:54.160
 and I'll just be like, whoa.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.400
 And a lot of people talk about like the meditative

56:57.400 --> 56:59.960
 experience will allow you to sort of, you know,

56:59.960 --> 57:02.840
 look at some basic things like the movement of your hand

57:02.840 --> 57:06.240
 as deeply joyful because it's like, that's life.

57:06.240 --> 57:08.480
 But I get that from just looking at a cup.

57:08.480 --> 57:10.000
 Like I'm waiting for the coffee to brew

57:10.000 --> 57:15.000
 and I'll just be like, fuck, life is awesome.

57:15.080 --> 57:17.440
 And I'll sometimes tweet that, but then I'll like regret

57:17.440 --> 57:20.040
 it later, like, God damn it, you're so ridiculous.

57:20.040 --> 57:24.880
 But yeah, so, but that is purely chemistry.

57:24.880 --> 57:27.400
 Like there's no rational, it doesn't fit

57:27.400 --> 57:28.240
 with the rest of my life.

57:28.240 --> 57:30.760
 I have all this shit, I'm always late to stuff.

57:30.760 --> 57:32.680
 I'm always like, there's all this stuff, you know,

57:32.680 --> 57:35.640
 I'm super self critical, like really self critical

57:35.640 --> 57:38.840
 about everything I do, to the point I almost hate

57:38.840 --> 57:41.840
 everything I do, but there's this engine of joy

57:41.840 --> 57:43.480
 for life outside of all that.

57:43.480 --> 57:45.200
 And that has to be chemistry.

57:45.200 --> 57:48.480
 And this flip side of that is what depression probably is,

57:48.480 --> 57:53.520
 is the opposite of that feeling of like,

57:53.520 --> 57:57.680
 cause I bet you that feeling of the cup being amazing

57:57.680 --> 58:01.000
 would save anybody in a state of depression.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.840
 Like that would be like fresh, you're in a desert

58:03.840 --> 58:08.160
 and it's a drink of water, shit man.

58:08.160 --> 58:11.560
 The brain is a, it would be nice to understand

58:11.560 --> 58:16.560
 where that's coming from, to be able to understand

58:17.440 --> 58:19.240
 how you hit those lows and those highs

58:19.240 --> 58:21.840
 that have nothing to do with the actual reality.

58:21.840 --> 58:24.280
 It has to do with some very specific aspects

58:25.320 --> 58:28.440
 of how you maybe see the world, maybe,

58:28.440 --> 58:31.040
 it could be just like basic habits that you engage in

58:31.040 --> 58:34.120
 and then how to walk along the line to find

58:34.120 --> 58:35.560
 those experiences of joy.

58:35.560 --> 58:37.440
 And this goes back to the discussion we're having

58:37.440 --> 58:42.440
 of human cognition is in volume, the largest input

58:43.120 --> 58:44.840
 of raw material into society.

58:45.960 --> 58:47.840
 And it's not quantified.

58:47.840 --> 58:50.200
 We have no bearings on it.

58:50.200 --> 58:55.200
 And so we just, you wonder, we both articulated

58:55.720 --> 58:58.640
 some of the challenges we have in our own mind.

58:58.640 --> 59:02.280
 And it's likely that others would say,

59:02.280 --> 59:03.840
 I have something similar.

59:03.840 --> 59:05.920
 And you wonder when you look at society,

59:08.920 --> 59:11.520
 how does that contribute to all the other compounder

59:11.520 --> 59:12.760
 problems that we're experiencing?

59:12.760 --> 59:16.760
 How does that blind us to the opportunities

59:16.760 --> 59:18.560
 we could be looking at?

59:18.560 --> 59:23.560
 And so it really, it has this potential distortion effect

59:24.040 --> 59:27.080
 on reality that just makes everything worse.

59:27.080 --> 59:30.160
 And I hope if we can put some,

59:30.160 --> 59:34.560
 if we can assign some numbers to these things

59:34.560 --> 59:36.280
 and just to get our bearings,

59:36.280 --> 59:38.040
 so we're aware of what's going on,

59:38.040 --> 59:40.120
 if we could find greater stabilization

59:40.120 --> 59:42.760
 in how we conduct our lives and how we build society,

59:46.160 --> 59:49.520
 it might be the thing that enables us to scaffold.

59:50.480 --> 59:52.560
 Because we've really, again, we've done it,

59:52.560 --> 59:53.920
 humans have done a fantastic job

59:53.920 --> 59:58.160
 systematically scaffolding technology

59:58.160 --> 1:00:00.400
 and science and institutions.

1:00:00.400 --> 1:00:02.840
 It's human, it's our own selves,

1:00:02.840 --> 1:00:05.360
 which we have not been able to scaffold.

1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:08.440
 We are the one part of this intelligence infrastructure

1:00:08.440 --> 1:00:09.700
 that remains unchanged.

1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:15.160
 Is there something you could say about coupling

1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:19.640
 this brain data with not just the basic human experience,

1:00:19.640 --> 1:00:22.640
 but say an experience, you mentioned sleep,

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:26.560
 but the wildest experience, which is psychedelics,

1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:29.920
 is there, and there's been quite a few studies now

1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:33.400
 that are being approved and run,

1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:36.520
 which is exciting from a scientific perspective

1:00:36.520 --> 1:00:38.120
 on psychedelics.

1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:40.840
 Do you think, what do you think happens

1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:42.320
 to the brain on psychedelics?

1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:47.440
 And how can data about this help us understand it?

1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:50.640
 And when you're on DMT, do you see Ls?

1:00:50.640 --> 1:00:53.560
 And can we convert that into data?

1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:56.400
 Can you add aliens in there?

1:00:56.400 --> 1:00:57.640
 Yeah, aliens, definitely.

1:00:57.640 --> 1:00:58.760
 Do you actually meet aliens?

1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:00.600
 And Ls, are Ls the aliens?

1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:04.100
 I'm asking for a few Austin friends, yeah,

1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:08.940
 that are convinced that they've actually met the Ls.

1:01:08.940 --> 1:01:09.780
 What are Ls like?

1:01:09.780 --> 1:01:11.000
 Are they friendly?

1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:11.840
 Are they help?

1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:12.680
 I haven't met them personally.

1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:15.240
 Are they like the smurfs of like they're industrious

1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:17.200
 and they have different skill sets and?

1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:20.680
 Yeah, I think they're very,

1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:24.880
 they're very critical as friends.

1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:26.240
 They're trolls.

1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:27.300
 The Ls are trolls.

1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:30.200
 No, but they care about you.

1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:33.760
 So there's a bunch of different version of trolls.

1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:37.400
 There's loving trolls that are harsh on you,

1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:38.640
 but they want you to be better.

1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:42.680
 And there's trolls that just enjoy your destruction.

1:01:42.680 --> 1:01:45.280
 And I think they're the ones that care for you.

1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:47.560
 I think they're a criticism for my,

1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:49.320
 see, I haven't met them directly,

1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:51.120
 so it's like a friend of a friend.

1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:53.280
 Yeah, they gave him a telephone.

1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:54.720
 Yeah, a bit of a,

1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:57.440
 and the whole point is that in psychedelics,

1:01:57.440 --> 1:01:59.520
 and certainly at DMT,

1:01:59.520 --> 1:02:04.520
 word, this is where the brain data versus word data fails,

1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:08.240
 which is, you know, words can't convey the experience.

1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:10.560
 Most people that, you can be poetic and so on,

1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:12.320
 but it really does not convey the experience

1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:15.800
 of what it actually means to meet the Ls.

1:02:15.800 --> 1:02:18.960
 I mean, to me, what baselines this conversation is,

1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:23.200
 imagine if we were interested in the health of your heart,

1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:28.520
 and we started and said, okay, Lex, self interest back,

1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:30.040
 tell me how's the health of your heart.

1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:31.760
 And you sit there and you close your eyes

1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:36.640
 and you think, feels all right, like things feel okay.

1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:38.320
 And then you went to the cardiologist

1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:39.760
 and the cardiologist is like, hey Lex,

1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:41.040
 you know, tell me how you feel.

1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:43.360
 You're like, well, actually, what I'd really like you to do

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:47.440
 is do an EKG and a blood panel and look at arterial plaques

1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:49.360
 and let's look at my cholesterol.

1:02:49.360 --> 1:02:53.240
 And there's like five to 10 studies you would do.

1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:54.480
 They would then give you this report and say,

1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:58.080
 here's the quantified health of your heart.

1:02:58.080 --> 1:02:59.840
 Now with this data,

1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:03.120
 I'm going to prescribe the following regime of exercise

1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:06.160
 and maybe I'll put you on a statin, like, et cetera.

1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:08.560
 But the protocol is based upon this data.

1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:11.560
 You would think the cardiologist is out of their mind

1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:14.320
 if they just gave you a bottle of statins based upon,

1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:16.240
 you're like, well, I think something's kind of wrong.

1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:20.080
 And they're just kind of experiment and see what happens.

1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:22.600
 But that's what we do with our mental health today.

1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:25.080
 So it's kind of absurd.

1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:28.160
 And so if you look at psychedelics to have,

1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:29.440
 again, to be able to measure the brain

1:03:29.440 --> 1:03:31.520
 and get a baseline state,

1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:33.880
 and then to measure during a psychedelic experience

1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:35.160
 and post the psychedelic experience

1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:37.160
 and then do it longitudinally,

1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:39.440
 you now have a quantification of what's going on.

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:41.720
 And so you could then pose questions,

1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:45.040
 what molecule is appropriate at what dosages,

1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:47.720
 at what frequency, in what contextual environment,

1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:50.080
 what happens when I have this diet with this molecule,

1:03:50.080 --> 1:03:51.320
 with this experience,

1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:52.640
 all the experimentation you do

1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:55.560
 when you have good sleep data or HRV.

1:03:55.560 --> 1:03:57.720
 And so that's what I think happens,

1:03:57.720 --> 1:04:00.400
 what we could potentially do with psychedelics

1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:03.080
 is we could add this level of sophistication

1:04:03.080 --> 1:04:05.200
 that is not in the industry currently.

1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:09.000
 And it may improve the outcomes people experience,

1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.560
 it may improve the safety and efficacy.

1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:14.120
 And so that's what I hope we are able to achieve.

1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:19.040
 And it would transform mental health

1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:21.200
 because we would finally have numbers

1:04:21.200 --> 1:04:22.480
 to work with to baseline ourselves.

1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:24.080
 And then if you think about it,

1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:26.800
 when we talk about things related to the mind,

1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:28.280
 we talk about the modality.

1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:30.480
 We use words like meditation or psychedelics

1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:32.000
 or something else,

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.120
 because we can't talk about a marker in the brain.

1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:35.920
 We can't use a word to say,

1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:36.960
 we can't talk about cholesterol.

1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:38.320
 We don't talk about plaque in the arteries.

1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:40.440
 We don't talk about HRV.

1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:41.440
 And so if we have numbers,

1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:45.440
 then the solutions get mapped to numbers

1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:47.640
 instead of the modalities being the thing we talk about.

1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:51.320
 Meditation just does good things in a crude fashion.

1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:53.720
 So in your blog post,

1:04:53.720 --> 1:04:56.040
 Zero Principle Thinking, good title,

1:04:56.040 --> 1:04:57.600
 you ponder how do people come up

1:04:57.600 --> 1:04:59.760
 with truly original ideas.

1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:02.800
 What's your thoughts on this as a human

1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:05.600
 and as a person who's measuring brain data?

1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:09.520
 Zero principles are building blocks.

1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:14.440
 First principles are understanding of system laws.

1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:17.320
 So if you take, for example, like in Sherlock Holmes,

1:05:17.320 --> 1:05:18.800
 he's a first principles thinker.

1:05:18.800 --> 1:05:23.800
 So he says, once you've eliminated the impossible,

1:05:25.120 --> 1:05:29.000
 anything that remains, however improbable, is true.

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.600
 Whereas Dirk Gently, the holistic detective

1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:33.840
 by Douglas Adams says,

1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:36.440
 I don't like eliminating the impossible.

1:05:36.440 --> 1:05:38.040
 So when someone says,

1:05:38.040 --> 1:05:40.480
 from a first principles perspective,

1:05:42.280 --> 1:05:47.000
 and they're trying to assume the fewest number of things

1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.680
 within a given timeframe.

1:05:50.080 --> 1:05:53.880
 And so when I, after Braintree Venmo,

1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:57.760
 I set my mind to the question of,

1:05:57.760 --> 1:06:00.880
 what single thing can I do that would maximally increase

1:06:00.880 --> 1:06:02.880
 the probability that the human race thrives

1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:05.120
 beyond what we can even imagine?

1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:08.600
 And I found that in my conversations with others

1:06:08.600 --> 1:06:11.680
 in the books I read, in my own deliberations,

1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:14.400
 I had a missing piece of the puzzle,

1:06:15.280 --> 1:06:17.440
 because I didn't feel like,

1:06:17.440 --> 1:06:22.440
 yeah, I didn't feel like the future could be deduced

1:06:22.440 --> 1:06:24.480
 from first principles thinking.

1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:27.040
 And that's when I read the book, Zero,

1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:29.400
 A Biography of a Dangerous Idea.

1:06:29.400 --> 1:06:30.240
 And I...

1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:32.800
 It's a really good book, by the way.

1:06:32.800 --> 1:06:34.720
 I think it's my favorite book I've ever read.

1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:37.080
 It's also a really interesting number, zero.

1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:40.000
 And I wasn't aware that the number zero

1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:40.840
 had to be discovered.

1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:43.800
 I didn't realize that it caused a revolution in philosophy

1:06:43.800 --> 1:06:46.880
 and just tore up math and it tore up,

1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:48.600
 I mean, it builds modern society,

1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:51.640
 but it wrecked everything in its way.

1:06:51.640 --> 1:06:55.440
 It was an unbelievable disruptor, and it was so difficult

1:06:55.440 --> 1:06:57.840
 for society to get their heads around it.

1:06:57.840 --> 1:07:00.240
 And so zero is, of course,

1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:03.440
 the representation of a zero principle thinking,

1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:06.400
 which is it's the caliber

1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:08.760
 and consequential nature of an idea.

1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:13.560
 And so when you talk about what kind of ideas

1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:19.160
 have civilization transforming properties,

1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:21.840
 oftentimes they fall in the zeroth category.

1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:24.680
 And so in thinking this through,

1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:28.320
 I was wanting to find a quantitative structure

1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:31.720
 on how to think about these zeroth principles.

1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:33.640
 And that's, so I came up with that

1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:37.200
 to be a coupler with first principles thinking.

1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:39.680
 And so now it's a staple as part of how I think about

1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:41.640
 the world and the future.

1:07:41.640 --> 1:07:44.040
 So it emphasizes trying to identify,

1:07:44.040 --> 1:07:46.320
 it lands on that word impossible.

1:07:46.320 --> 1:07:50.080
 Like what is impossible, essentially trying to identify

1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:52.200
 what is impossible and what is possible.

1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:57.200
 And being as, how do you, I mean, this is the thing,

1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:01.000
 is most of society tells you the range of things

1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:02.960
 they say is impossible is very wide.

1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:04.760
 So you need to be shrinking that.

1:08:04.760 --> 1:08:08.560
 I mean, that's the whole process of this kind of thinking

1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:13.560
 is you need to be very rigorous in thinking about

1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:17.800
 and be very rigorous in trying to be,

1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:22.240
 trying to draw the lines of what is actually impossible

1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:26.400
 because very few things are actually impossible.

1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:28.480
 I don't know what is actually impossible.

1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:33.040
 Like it's the Joe Rogan, it's entirely possible.

1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:37.280
 I like that approach to science, to engineering,

1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:40.560
 to entrepreneurship, it's entirely possible.

1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:43.400
 Basically shrink the impossible to zero,

1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:45.400
 to a very small set.

1:08:45.400 --> 1:08:50.400
 Yeah, life constraints favor first principle thinking

1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:55.200
 because it enables faster action

1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:57.600
 with higher probability of success.

1:08:57.600 --> 1:09:00.920
 Pursuing zero with principle optionality

1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:02.600
 is expensive and uncertain.

1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:06.120
 And so in a society constrained by resources,

1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:10.080
 time and money and a desire for social status,

1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:13.640
 accomplishment, et cetera, it minimizes zero

1:09:13.640 --> 1:09:14.480
 with principle thinking.

1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:16.800
 But the reason why I think zero with principle thinking

1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:21.800
 should be a staple of our shared cognitive infrastructure

1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:24.760
 is if you look through the history

1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:26.160
 of the past couple of thousand years

1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:29.960
 and let's just say we arbitrarily,

1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:33.840
 we subjectively try to assess what is a zero level idea.

1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:37.880
 And we say how many have occurred on what time scales

1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:40.120
 and what were the contextual settings for it?

1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:43.360
 I would argue that if you look at AlphaGo,

1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:48.680
 when it played Go from another dimension,

1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:53.480
 with the human Go players, when it saw AlphaGo's moves,

1:09:53.480 --> 1:09:55.720
 it attributed to like playing with an alien,

1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:00.120
 playing Go with AlphaGo being from another dimension.

1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:04.320
 And so if you say computational intelligence

1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:09.320
 has an attribute of introducing zero like insights,

1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:14.320
 then if you say what is going to be the occurrence

1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:16.960
 of zeros in society going forward?

1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:19.560
 And you could reasonably say

1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:21.440
 probably a lot more than have occurred

1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:24.160
 and probably more at a faster pace.

1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:25.000
 So then if you say,

1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:28.160
 what happens if you have this computational intelligence

1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:30.680
 throughout society that the manufacturing design

1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:31.600
 and distribution of intelligence

1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:33.760
 is now going to heading towards zero,

1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:37.040
 you have an increased number of zeros being produced

1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:40.360
 with a tight connection between human and computers.

1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:43.280
 That's when I got to a point and said,

1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:45.560
 we cannot predict the future

1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:47.480
 with first principles thinking.

1:10:47.480 --> 1:10:50.360
 We can't, that cannot be our imagination set.

1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:55.360
 It can't be our sole anchor in the situation

1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:57.520
 that basically the future of our conscious existence,

1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:01.400
 20, 30, 40, 50 years is probably a zero.

1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:06.400
 So just to clarify, when you say zero,

1:11:06.920 --> 1:11:11.480
 you're referring to basically a truly revolutionary idea.

1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:17.000
 Yeah, something that is currently not a building block

1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:21.400
 of our shared conscious existence,

1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:23.080
 either in the form of knowledge.

1:11:24.480 --> 1:11:26.560
 Yeah, it's currently not manifest

1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:28.520
 in what we acknowledge.

1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:32.440
 So zero principle thinking is playing with ideas

1:11:32.440 --> 1:11:37.440
 that are so revolutionary that we can't even clearly reason

1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:42.000
 about the consequences once those ideas come to be.

1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.040
 Yeah, or for example, like Einstein,

1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:49.520
 that was a zeroeth, I would categorize it

1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:51.400
 as a zeroeth principle insight.

1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:53.000
 You mean general relativity, space time.

1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000
 Yeah, space time, yep, yep.

1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:59.080
 That basically building upon what Newton had done

1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:04.080
 and said, yes, also, and it just changed the fabric

1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:06.680
 of our understanding of reality.

1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:09.720
 And so that was unexpected, it existed.

1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:13.240
 We just, it became part of our awareness

1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:16.720
 and the moves AlphaGo made existed.

1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:19.080
 It just came into our awareness.

1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:24.080
 And so to your point, there's this question

1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:27.800
 of what do we know and what don't we know?

1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:30.160
 Do we think we know 99% of all things

1:12:30.160 --> 1:12:33.760
 or do we think we know 0.001% of all things?

1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:35.760
 And that goes back to no known, no unknowns

1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:37.000
 and unknown unknowns.

1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000
 And first principles and zero principle thinking

1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:42.240
 gives us a quantitative framework to say,

1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:44.640
 there's no way for us to mathematically

1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:47.240
 try to create probabilities for these things.

1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:50.200
 Therefore, it would be helpful

1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:52.920
 if they were just part of our standard thought processes

1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:57.920
 because it may encourage different behaviors

1:12:58.360 --> 1:13:01.320
 in what we do individually, collectively as a society,

1:13:01.320 --> 1:13:03.480
 what we aspire to, what we talk about,

1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:05.680
 the possibility sets we imagine.

1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:09.080
 Yeah, I've been engaged in that kind of thinking

1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:14.080
 quite a bit and thinking about engineering of consciousness.

1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:17.400
 I think it's feasible, I think it's possible

1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:19.240
 in the language that we're using here.

1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:21.680
 And it's very difficult to reason about a world

1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:26.680
 when inklings of consciousness can be engineered

1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:29.800
 into artificial systems.

1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:33.440
 Not from a philosophical perspective,

1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:35.600
 but from an engineering perspective,

1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:39.720
 I believe a good step towards engineering consciousness

1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:44.360
 is creating engineering the illusion of consciousness.

1:13:44.360 --> 1:13:49.360
 So I'm captivated by our natural predisposition

1:13:51.920 --> 1:13:53.920
 to anthropomorphize things.

1:13:55.280 --> 1:13:56.640
 And I think that's what we,

1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:00.720
 I don't wanna hear from the philosophers,

1:14:00.720 --> 1:14:04.720
 but I think that's what we kind of do to each other.

1:14:05.640 --> 1:14:10.640
 That consciousness is created socially,

1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:14.640
 that like much of the power of consciousness

1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:16.600
 is in the social interaction.

1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:19.720
 I create your consciousness, no,

1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:23.120
 I create my consciousness by having interacted with you.

1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.320
 And that's the display of consciousness.

1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:28.640
 It's the same as like the display of emotion.

1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:31.480
 Emotion is created through communication.

1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:34.720
 Language is created through its use.

1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:36.560
 And then we somehow humans kind of,

1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:39.400
 especially philosophers, the hard problem of consciousness

1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:40.840
 or the hard problem of consciousness,

1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:44.480
 really wanna believe that we possess this thing.

1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:49.480
 That's like there's an elf sitting there with a hat

1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:52.680
 or like name tag says consciousness,

1:14:52.680 --> 1:14:57.640
 and they're like feeding this subjective experience to us

1:14:57.640 --> 1:15:02.160
 as opposed to like it actually being an illusion

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:05.480
 that we construct to make social communication more effective.

1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:09.440
 And so I think if you focus on creating the illusion

1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:11.160
 of consciousness, you can create

1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:14.840
 some very fulfilling experiences in software.

1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:18.760
 And so that to me is a compelling space of ideas to explore.

1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:19.600
 I agree with you.

1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:21.680
 And I think going back to our experience together

1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:23.280
 with Brain Interfaces on,

1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:26.080
 you could imagine if we get to a certain level of maturity.

1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:28.760
 So first let's take the inverse of this.

1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:30.720
 So you and I text back and forth

1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:33.120
 and we're sending each other emojis.

1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:37.080
 That has a certain amount of information transfer rate

1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:39.280
 as we're communicating with each other.

1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:41.920
 And so in our communication with people via email

1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:42.760
 and texts and whatnot,

1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:46.880
 we've taken the bandwidth of human interaction,

1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:49.920
 the information transfer rate, and we've reduced it.

1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:51.480
 We have less social cues.

1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:53.000
 We have less information to work with.

1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.280
 There's a lot more opportunity for misunderstanding.

1:15:55.280 --> 1:15:57.480
 So that is altering the conscious experience

1:15:57.480 --> 1:15:59.400
 between two individuals.

1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:01.600
 And if we add Brain Interfaces to the equation,

1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:04.120
 let's imagine now we amplify the dimensionality

1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:05.560
 of our communications.

1:16:05.560 --> 1:16:07.240
 That to me is what you're talking about,

1:16:07.240 --> 1:16:09.120
 which is consciousness engineering.

1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:13.360
 Perhaps I understand you with dimensions.

1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:15.160
 So maybe I understand your,

1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:17.640
 when you look at the cup and you experience that happiness,

1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:18.640
 you can tell me you're happy.

1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:20.520
 And I then do theory of mine and say,

1:16:20.520 --> 1:16:23.160
 I can imagine what it might be like to be Lex

1:16:23.160 --> 1:16:25.320
 and feel happy about seeing this cup.

1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:26.760
 But if the interface could then quantify

1:16:26.760 --> 1:16:30.080
 and give me a 50 vector space model and say,

1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:32.640
 this is the version of happiness that Lex is experiencing

1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:34.240
 as he looked at this cup,

1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:36.440
 then it would allow me potentially

1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:38.040
 to have much greater empathy for you

1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:39.120
 and understand you as a human.

1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:41.880
 This is how you experience joy,

1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:44.160
 which is entirely unique from how I experienced joy,

1:16:44.160 --> 1:16:46.080
 even though we assumed ahead of time

1:16:46.080 --> 1:16:48.120
 that we're having some kind of similar experience.

1:16:48.120 --> 1:16:51.520
 But I agree with you that we do consciousness engineering

1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:52.800
 today in everything we do.

1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:55.760
 When we talk to each other, when we're building products

1:16:55.760 --> 1:17:00.280
 and that we're entering into a stage where

1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:02.200
 it will be much more methodical

1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:06.200
 and quantitative based and computational

1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:07.280
 in how we go about doing it.

1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:09.120
 Which to me, I find encouraging

1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:12.320
 because I think it creates better guardrails

1:17:14.360 --> 1:17:18.760
 to create ethical systems versus right now,

1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:21.200
 I feel like it's really a wild, wild west

1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:23.440
 on how these interactions are happening.

1:17:23.440 --> 1:17:25.600
 Yeah, and it's funny you focus on human to human,

1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:29.240
 but that this kind of data enables human to machine

1:17:29.240 --> 1:17:33.520
 interaction, which is what we're kind of talking about

1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:35.480
 when we say engineering consciousness.

1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:39.040
 And that will happen, of course,

1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:40.520
 let's flip that on its head.

1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:44.520
 Right now we're putting humans as the central node.

1:17:44.520 --> 1:17:48.600
 What if we gave GPT3 a bunch of human brains

1:17:48.600 --> 1:17:52.760
 and said, hey, GPT3, learn some manners when you speak.

1:17:52.760 --> 1:17:54.080
 Yeah.

1:17:54.080 --> 1:17:56.520
 And run your algorithms on humans brains

1:17:56.520 --> 1:17:58.560
 and see how they respond.

1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:01.720
 So you can be polite and so that you can be friendly

1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:04.640
 and so that you can be conversationally appropriate,

1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:09.240
 but to inverse it, to give our machines a training set

1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:11.800
 in real time with closed loop feedback

1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:15.280
 so that our machines were better equipped to

1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:19.760
 find their way through our society

1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:22.360
 in polite and kind and appropriate ways.

1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:23.200
 I love that idea.

1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:25.560
 Or better yet, teach it some,

1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:30.040
 have it read the following documents

1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:32.120
 and have it visit Austin and Texas.

1:18:32.120 --> 1:18:34.640
 And so that when you ask, when you tell it,

1:18:34.640 --> 1:18:36.600
 why don't you learn some manners,

1:18:36.600 --> 1:18:38.720
 GPT3 learns to say no.

1:18:41.120 --> 1:18:43.600
 It learns what it means to be free

1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:45.320
 and a sovereign individual.

1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:47.440
 So that, it depends.

1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:50.200
 So it depends what kind of a version of GPT3 you want.

1:18:50.200 --> 1:18:52.720
 One that's free, one that behaves well with the social.

1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:54.760
 Viva la revolution.

1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:59.760
 You want a socialist GPT3, you want an anarchist GPT3,

1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:03.320
 you want a polite, like you take it home

1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:06.680
 to visit mom and dad GPT3 and you want like party

1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:11.200
 and like Vegas to a strip club GPT3, you want all flavors.

1:19:11.200 --> 1:19:14.200
 And then you've gotta have goal alignment between all those.

1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:19.200
 Yeah, they don't want to manipulate each other for sure.

1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:24.640
 So that's, I mean, you kind of spoke to ethics.

1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:28.600
 One of the concerns that people have in this modern world,

1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:32.000
 the digital data is that of privacy and security.

1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:35.920
 But privacy, they're concerned that when they share data,

1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:40.840
 it's the same thing with you when we trust other human beings

1:19:40.840 --> 1:19:44.200
 in being fragile and revealing something

1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:47.320
 that we're vulnerable about.

1:19:48.200 --> 1:19:51.960
 There's a leap of faith, there's a leap of trust

1:19:51.960 --> 1:19:54.240
 that that's going to be just between us.

1:19:54.240 --> 1:19:55.360
 There's a privacy to it.

1:19:55.360 --> 1:19:58.280
 And then the challenge is when you're in the digital space

1:19:58.280 --> 1:20:01.680
 then sharing your data with companies

1:20:01.680 --> 1:20:03.680
 that use that data for advertisement

1:20:03.680 --> 1:20:05.080
 and all those kinds of things,

1:20:05.080 --> 1:20:08.480
 there's a hesitancy to share that much data,

1:20:08.480 --> 1:20:10.760
 to share a lot of deep personal data.

1:20:10.760 --> 1:20:14.080
 And if you look at brain data, that feels a whole lot

1:20:14.080 --> 1:20:17.800
 like it's richly, deeply personal data.

1:20:17.800 --> 1:20:20.080
 So how do you think about privacy

1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:22.160
 with this kind of ocean of data?

1:20:22.160 --> 1:20:26.120
 I think we got off to a wrong start with the internet

1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:31.120
 where the basic rules of play for the company that be was,

1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:36.000
 if you're a company, you can go out

1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:39.120
 and get as much information on a person

1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:42.960
 as you can find without their approval.

1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:46.360
 And you can also do things to induce them

1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:48.080
 to give you as much information.

1:20:48.080 --> 1:20:50.960
 And you don't need to tell them what you're doing with it.

1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:52.320
 You can do anything on the backside,

1:20:52.320 --> 1:20:54.920
 you can make money on it, but the game is

1:20:54.920 --> 1:20:56.800
 who can acquire the most information

1:20:56.800 --> 1:21:00.400
 and devise the most clever schemes to do it.

1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:01.920
 That was a bad starting place.

1:21:02.800 --> 1:21:05.720
 And so we are in this period

1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:07.560
 where we need to correct for that.

1:21:07.560 --> 1:21:09.760
 And we need to say, first of all,

1:21:09.760 --> 1:21:14.760
 the individual always has control over their data.

1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:15.840
 It's not a free for all.

1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:17.520
 It's not like a game of hungry hippo,

1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:20.200
 but they can just go out and grab as much as they want.

1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:22.480
 So for example, when your brain data was recorded today,

1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:24.240
 the first thing we did in the kernel app

1:21:24.240 --> 1:21:27.680
 was you have control over your data.

1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:31.320
 And so it's individual consent, it's individual control.

1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:33.280
 And then you can build up on top of that,

1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:36.480
 but it has to be based upon some clear rules of play

1:21:36.480 --> 1:21:39.200
 if everyone knows what's being collected,

1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:40.600
 they know what's being done with it,

1:21:40.600 --> 1:21:42.120
 and the person has control over it.

1:21:42.120 --> 1:21:43.760
 So transparency and control.

1:21:43.760 --> 1:21:46.920
 So everybody knows what does control look like,

1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:48.840
 my ability to delete the data if I want.

1:21:48.840 --> 1:21:51.040
 Yeah, delete it and to know who is being shared with

1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:53.200
 under what terms and conditions.

1:21:53.200 --> 1:21:55.760
 We haven't reached that level of sophistication

1:21:55.760 --> 1:21:59.800
 with our products of if you say, for example,

1:22:00.800 --> 1:22:04.360
 hey Spotify, please give me a customized playlist

1:22:04.360 --> 1:22:08.120
 according to my neurome, you could say,

1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:10.760
 you can have access to this vector space model,

1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:12.360
 but only for this duration of time

1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:15.240
 and then you've got to delete it.

1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:16.920
 We haven't gotten there to that level of sophistication,

1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:19.320
 but these are ideas we need to start talking about

1:22:19.320 --> 1:22:22.200
 of how would you actually structure permissions?

1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:23.040
 Yeah.

1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:26.240
 And I think it creates a much more stable set

1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:31.080
 for society to build where we understand the rules of play

1:22:31.080 --> 1:22:34.720
 and people aren't vulnerable to being taken advantage.

1:22:34.720 --> 1:22:39.720
 It's not fair for an individual to be taken advantage of

1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:42.200
 without their awareness with some other practice

1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:44.600
 that some company is doing for their sole benefit.

1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:46.680
 And so hopefully we are going through a process now

1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:48.240
 where we're correcting for these things

1:22:48.240 --> 1:22:53.240
 and that it can be an economy wide shift that,

1:22:54.880 --> 1:22:59.360
 because really these are fundamentals

1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:01.280
 we need to have in place.

1:23:01.280 --> 1:23:05.000
 It's kind of fun to think about like in Chrome

1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:07.800
 when you install an extension or like install an app,

1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:10.560
 it's ask you like what permissions you're willing to give

1:23:10.560 --> 1:23:13.160
 and be cool if in the future it says like,

1:23:13.160 --> 1:23:15.120
 you can have access to my brain data.

1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:20.440
 I mean, it's not unimaginable in the future

1:23:21.560 --> 1:23:24.440
 that the big technology companies have built a business

1:23:24.440 --> 1:23:26.200
 based upon acquiring data about you

1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:27.720
 that they can then create a view to model of you

1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:29.480
 and sell that predictability.

1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:31.520
 And so it's not unimaginable that you will create

1:23:31.520 --> 1:23:33.920
 with like kernel device, for example,

1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:37.280
 a more reliable predictor of you than they could.

1:23:37.280 --> 1:23:39.200
 And that they're asking you for permission

1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:41.000
 to complete their objectives and you're the one

1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.960
 that gets to negotiate that with them and say, sure.

1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:47.740
 But so it's not unimaginable that might be the case.

1:23:49.040 --> 1:23:52.760
 So there's a guy named Dela Musk and he has a company

1:23:52.760 --> 1:23:55.360
 in one of the many companies called Neuralink

1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:59.160
 that's also excited about the brain.

1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:01.440
 So it'd be interesting to hear your kind of opinions

1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:03.800
 about a very different approach that's invasive,

1:24:03.800 --> 1:24:06.940
 that require surgery, that implants,

1:24:06.940 --> 1:24:09.040
 a data collection device in the brain.

1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:10.840
 How do you think about the difference between kernel

1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:15.120
 and Neuralink in the approaches of getting

1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:17.440
 that stream of brain data?

1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:20.460
 Elon and I spoke about this a lot early on.

1:24:20.460 --> 1:24:24.320
 We met up, I had started kernel and he had an interest

1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:25.560
 in brain interfaces as well.

1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:28.320
 And we explored doing something together,

1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:31.900
 him joining kernel and ultimately it wasn't the right move.

1:24:31.900 --> 1:24:35.320
 And so he started Neuralink and I continued building kernel,

1:24:35.320 --> 1:24:39.160
 but it was interesting because we were both

1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:44.160
 at this very early time where it wasn't certain

1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:47.700
 if there was a path to pursue,

1:24:49.020 --> 1:24:51.080
 if now was the right time to do something

1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:53.080
 and then the technological choice of doing that.

1:24:53.080 --> 1:24:54.960
 And so we were both,

1:24:54.960 --> 1:24:58.200
 our starting point was looking at invasive technologies.

1:24:58.200 --> 1:25:01.380
 And I was building invasive technology at the time.

1:25:01.380 --> 1:25:03.080
 That's ultimately where he's gone.

1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:08.840
 Little less than a year after Elon and I were engaged,

1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:11.480
 I shifted kernel to do noninvasive.

1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:15.200
 And we had this neuroscientist come to kernel.

1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:16.040
 We were talking about,

1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:17.680
 he had been doing neural surgery for 30 years,

1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:20.160
 one of the most respected neuroscientists in the US.

1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:21.900
 And we brought him to kernel to figure out

1:25:21.900 --> 1:25:23.520
 the ins and outs of his profession.

1:25:23.520 --> 1:25:26.160
 And at the very end of our three hour conversation,

1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:30.280
 he said, you know, every 15 or so years,

1:25:30.280 --> 1:25:34.720
 a new technology comes along that changes everything.

1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:37.360
 He said, it's probably already here.

1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:38.660
 You just can't see it yet.

1:25:39.700 --> 1:25:40.800
 And my jaw dropped.

1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:44.600
 I thought, because I had spoken to Bob Greenberg

1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:48.240
 who had built a second site first on the optical nerve

1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:53.240
 and then he did an array on the optical cortex.

1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:57.280
 And then I also became friendly with Neuropace

1:25:57.280 --> 1:25:59.800
 who does the implants for seizure detection

1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:01.560
 and remediation.

1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:06.560
 And I saw in their eyes what it was like

1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:10.040
 to take something through an implantable device

1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:11.760
 through for a 15 year run.

1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:13.800
 They initially thought it was seven years

1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:15.160
 and ended up being 15 years.

1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:16.240
 And they thought it'd be a hundred million

1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:18.960
 because it was 300, 400 million.

1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:22.280
 And I really didn't want to build invasive technology.

1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:25.680
 It was the only thing that appeared to be possible.

1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:28.640
 But then once I spun up an internal effort

1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:30.400
 to start looking at noninvasive options,

1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:32.000
 we said, is there something here?

1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.700
 Is there anything here that again has the characteristics

1:26:34.700 --> 1:26:37.280
 of it has the high quality data,

1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:39.240
 it could be low cost, it could be accessible.

1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:42.200
 Could it make brain interfaces mainstream?

1:26:42.200 --> 1:26:43.860
 And so I did a bet the company move.

1:26:43.860 --> 1:26:47.520
 We shifted from noninvasive to invasive to noninvasive.

1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:49.020
 So the answer is yes to that.

1:26:49.020 --> 1:26:51.600
 There is something there that's possible.

1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:52.680
 The answer is we'll see.

1:26:52.680 --> 1:26:55.080
 We've now built both technologies

1:26:55.080 --> 1:26:58.100
 and they're now you experienced one of them today.

1:26:58.100 --> 1:27:02.560
 We were applying, we're now deploying it.

1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:04.640
 So we're trying to figure out what value is really there.

1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:07.680
 But I'd say it's really too early to express confidence.

1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:12.680
 Whether it's too, I think it's too early to assess

1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:17.600
 which technological choice is the right one

1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:19.240
 on what time scales.

1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:20.680
 Yeah, time scales are really important here.

1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:22.240
 Very important because if you look at the,

1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:24.280
 like on the invasive side,

1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:27.000
 there's so much activity going on right now

1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:32.000
 of less invasive techniques to get at the neuron firings,

1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:36.840
 which would what Neuralink is building.

1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:39.840
 It's possible that in 10, 15 years

1:27:39.840 --> 1:27:40.960
 when they're scaling that technology,

1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:42.480
 other things have come along.

1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:44.000
 And you'd much rather do that.

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:45.740
 That thing starts to clock again.

1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:47.480
 It may not be the case.

1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:48.520
 It may be the case that Neuralink

1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:50.760
 has properly chosen the right technology

1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:53.080
 and that that's exactly what they want to be.

1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:53.960
 Totally possible.

1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:55.680
 And it's also possible that the path we chose

1:27:55.680 --> 1:27:58.640
 that are noninvasive fall short for a variety of reasons.

1:27:58.640 --> 1:28:00.600
 It's just, it's unknown.

1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:03.200
 And so right now the two technologies we chose,

1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:06.320
 the analogy I'd give you to create a baseline

1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:09.000
 of understanding is if you think of it

1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:11.320
 like the internet in the nineties,

1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:12.960
 the internet became useful

1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:15.740
 when people could do a dial up connection.

1:28:15.740 --> 1:28:19.320
 And then as bandwidth increased,

1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:21.080
 so did the utility of that connection

1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:22.880
 and so did the ecosystem improve.

1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:26.200
 And so if you say what kernel flow

1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:28.920
 is going to give you a full screen

1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:30.720
 on the picture of information,

1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:32.520
 but as you're gonna be watching a movie,

1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:34.620
 but the image is going to be blurred

1:28:34.620 --> 1:28:36.320
 and the audio is gonna be muffled.

1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:40.560
 So it has a lower resolution of coverage.

1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:43.480
 A kernel flux, our MEG technology

1:28:43.480 --> 1:28:46.140
 is gonna give you the full movie and 1080p.

1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:51.560
 And Neuralink is gonna give you a circle

1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:53.600
 on the screen of 4K.

1:28:55.320 --> 1:28:57.760
 And so each one has their pros and cons

1:28:57.760 --> 1:28:59.920
 and it's give and take.

1:28:59.920 --> 1:29:03.300
 And so the decision I made with kernel

1:29:03.300 --> 1:29:06.280
 was that these two technologies, flux and flow

1:29:06.280 --> 1:29:10.560
 were basically the answer for the next seven years.

1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:12.640
 And that they would give rise to the ecosystem

1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:14.000
 which would become much more valuable

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:15.400
 than the hardware itself.

1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:16.620
 And that we would just continue to improve

1:29:16.620 --> 1:29:18.480
 on the hardware over time.

1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:20.880
 And you know, it's early days, so.

1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:23.520
 It's kind of fascinating to think about that.

1:29:23.520 --> 1:29:27.120
 You don't, it's very true that you don't know

1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:30.880
 both paths are very promising.

1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:35.880
 And it's like 50 years from now we will look back

1:29:37.640 --> 1:29:39.680
 and maybe not even remember one of them.

1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:43.120
 And the other one might change the world.

1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:44.840
 It's so cool how technology is.

1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:47.000
 I mean, that's what entrepreneurship is,

1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:50.040
 is like, it's the zero principle.

1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:52.360
 It's like you're marching ahead into the darkness,

1:29:52.360 --> 1:29:54.720
 into the fog, not knowing.

1:29:54.720 --> 1:29:56.320
 It's wonderful to have someone else

1:29:56.320 --> 1:29:57.920
 out there with us doing this.

1:29:57.920 --> 1:30:02.080
 Because if you look at brain interfaces, anything

1:30:02.080 --> 1:30:07.080
 that's off the shelf right now is inadequate.

1:30:07.160 --> 1:30:09.560
 It's had its run for a couple of decades.

1:30:09.560 --> 1:30:11.240
 It's still in hacker communities.

1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:12.880
 It hasn't gone to the mainstream.

1:30:14.560 --> 1:30:17.820
 The room size machines are on their own path.

1:30:19.040 --> 1:30:20.560
 But there is no answer right now

1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:23.600
 of bringing brain interfaces mainstream.

1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:27.000
 And so it both, you know, both they and us,

1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:29.560
 we've both spent over a hundred million dollars.

1:30:29.560 --> 1:30:32.720
 And that's kind of what it takes to have a go at this.

1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:34.880
 Cause you need to build full stack.

1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:37.480
 I mean, at Kernel, we are from the photon

1:30:37.480 --> 1:30:40.000
 and the atom through the machine learning.

1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:41.520
 We have just under a hundred people.

1:30:41.520 --> 1:30:45.080
 I think it's something like 36, 37 PhDs

1:30:45.080 --> 1:30:47.440
 in these specialties, in these areas

1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:48.640
 that there's only a few people in the world

1:30:48.640 --> 1:30:50.160
 who have these abilities.

1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:53.160
 And that's what it takes to build next generation,

1:30:53.160 --> 1:30:57.520
 to make an attempt at breaking into brain interfaces.

1:30:57.520 --> 1:30:58.920
 And so we'll see over the next couple of years,

1:30:58.920 --> 1:31:00.040
 whether it's the right time

1:31:00.040 --> 1:31:01.640
 or whether we were both too early

1:31:01.640 --> 1:31:04.400
 or whether something else comes along in seven to 10 years,

1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:08.000
 which is the right thing that brings it mainstream.

1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:11.040
 So you see Elon as a kind of competitor

1:31:11.040 --> 1:31:16.040
 or a fellow traveler along the path of uncertainty or both?

1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:19.000
 It's a fellow traveler.

1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:21.800
 It's like at the beginning of the internet

1:31:21.800 --> 1:31:25.480
 is how many companies are going to be invited

1:31:25.480 --> 1:31:27.520
 to this new ecosystem?

1:31:29.480 --> 1:31:30.520
 Like an endless number.

1:31:30.520 --> 1:31:33.200
 Because if you think that the hardware

1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:36.040
 just starts the process.

1:31:36.040 --> 1:31:37.960
 And so, okay, back to your initial example,

1:31:37.960 --> 1:31:39.360
 if you take the Fitbit, for example,

1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:42.840
 you say, okay, now I can get measurements on the body.

1:31:42.840 --> 1:31:44.840
 And what do we think the ultimate value

1:31:44.840 --> 1:31:45.800
 of this device is going to be?

1:31:45.800 --> 1:31:47.760
 What is the information transfer rate?

1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:50.120
 And they were in the market for a certain duration of time

1:31:50.120 --> 1:31:52.960
 and Google bought them for two and a half billion dollars.

1:31:53.840 --> 1:31:55.600
 They didn't have ancillary value add.

1:31:55.600 --> 1:31:58.560
 There weren't people building on top of the Fitbit device.

1:31:58.560 --> 1:32:01.240
 They also didn't have increased insight

1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:02.400
 with additional data streams.

1:32:02.400 --> 1:32:04.240
 So it was really just the device.

1:32:04.240 --> 1:32:07.120
 If you look, for example, at Apple and the device they sell,

1:32:07.120 --> 1:32:09.160
 you have value in the device that someone buys,

1:32:09.160 --> 1:32:11.760
 but also you have everyone who's building on top of it.

1:32:11.760 --> 1:32:13.440
 So you have this additional ecosystem value

1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:15.640
 and then you have additional data streams that come in

1:32:15.640 --> 1:32:17.480
 which increase the value of the product.

1:32:17.480 --> 1:32:20.600
 And so if you say, if you look at the hardware

1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:24.440
 as the instigator of value creation,

1:32:24.440 --> 1:32:28.200
 over time what we've built may constitute five or 10%

1:32:28.200 --> 1:32:29.800
 of the value of the overall ecosystem.

1:32:29.800 --> 1:32:30.960
 And that's what we really care about.

1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:33.280
 What we're trying to do is kickstart

1:32:33.280 --> 1:32:38.280
 the mainstream adoption of quantifying the brain.

1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:41.840
 And the hardware just opens the door to say

1:32:41.840 --> 1:32:44.040
 what kind of ecosystem could exist.

1:32:44.040 --> 1:32:46.800
 And that's why the examples are so relevant

1:32:46.800 --> 1:32:49.240
 of the things you've outlined in your life.

1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:52.680
 I hope those things, the books people write,

1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:55.480
 the experiences people build, the conversations you have,

1:32:55.480 --> 1:32:58.040
 your relationship with your AI systems,

1:32:58.040 --> 1:33:01.160
 I hope those all are feeding on the insights

1:33:01.160 --> 1:33:04.200
 built upon this ecosystem we've created to better your life.

1:33:04.200 --> 1:33:06.200
 And so that's the thinking behind it.

1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:07.560
 Again, with the Drake equation

1:33:07.560 --> 1:33:10.920
 being the underlying driver of value.

1:33:10.920 --> 1:33:13.520
 And the people at Kernel have joined

1:33:13.520 --> 1:33:17.920
 not because we have certainty of success,

1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:21.080
 but because we find it to be the most exhilarating

1:33:21.080 --> 1:33:25.080
 opportunity we could ever pursue in this time to be alive.

1:33:26.320 --> 1:33:30.840
 You founded the payment system Braintree in 2007

1:33:30.840 --> 1:33:34.240
 that acquired Venmo in 2012,

1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:39.240
 in that same year was acquired by PayPal, which is now eBay.

1:33:39.240 --> 1:33:42.240
 Can you tell me the story of the vision

1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:44.800
 and the challenge of building an online payment system

1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:48.080
 and just building a large successful business in general?

1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:51.000
 I discovered payments by accident.

1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:56.000
 When I was 21, I just returned from Ecuador

1:33:57.800 --> 1:33:59.320
 living among extreme poverty for two years.

1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:03.320
 And I came back to the US and I was shocked by the opulence

1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:07.320
 of the United States of America.

1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:09.440
 Yeah, of the United States.

1:34:09.440 --> 1:34:12.000
 And I just thought this is, I couldn't believe it.

1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:16.680
 And I decided I wanted to try to spend my life helping others.

1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:18.600
 Like that was the, that was a life objective

1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:20.320
 that I thought was worthwhile to pursue

1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:23.040
 versus making money and whatever the case may be

1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:24.480
 for its own right.

1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:26.520
 And so I decided in that moment that I was going to

1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:30.040
 try to make enough money by the age of 30

1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:32.160
 to never have to work again.

1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:33.920
 And then with some abundance of money,

1:34:33.920 --> 1:34:38.440
 I could then choose to do things that might be beneficial

1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:40.320
 to others, but may not meet the criteria

1:34:40.320 --> 1:34:42.400
 of being a standalone business.

1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:46.160
 And so in that process, I started a few companies,

1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:49.760
 had some small successes, had some failures.

1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:53.000
 In one of the endeavors, I was up to my eyeballs in debt.

1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:54.040
 Things were not going well.

1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:57.840
 And I needed a part time job to pay my bills.

1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:02.840
 And so I, one day I saw in the paper in Utah

1:35:02.840 --> 1:35:05.400
 where I was living the 50 richest people in Utah.

1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:07.920
 And I emailed each one of their assistants and said,

1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:11.440
 you know, I'm young, I'm resourceful, I'll do anything.

1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:13.640
 I'll just want to, I'm entrepreneurial.

1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:15.520
 I tried to get a job that would be flexible

1:35:15.520 --> 1:35:17.400
 and no one responded.

1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:21.280
 And then I interviewed at a few dozen places.

1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:23.280
 Nobody would even give me the time of day.

1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:25.360
 Like it wouldn't want to take me seriously.

1:35:25.360 --> 1:35:27.680
 And so finally I, it was on monster.com

1:35:27.680 --> 1:35:30.920
 that I saw this job posting for credit card sales

1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:31.760
 door to door.

1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:32.600
 Commission.

1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:35.360
 I did not know the story, this is great.

1:35:35.360 --> 1:35:37.400
 I love the head drop, that's exactly right.

1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:38.240
 So it was.

1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:41.720
 The low points to which we go in life.

1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:46.080
 So I responded and you know, the person made an attempt

1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:48.640
 at suggesting that they had some kind of standards

1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:50.360
 that they would consider hiring.

1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:53.160
 But it's kind of like, if you could fog a mirror,

1:35:53.160 --> 1:35:55.680
 like come and do this because it's 100% commission.

1:35:55.680 --> 1:35:57.520
 And so I started walking up and down the street

1:35:57.520 --> 1:36:00.520
 in my community selling credit card processing.

1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:03.480
 And so what you learn immediately in doing that is

1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:06.640
 if you walk into a business, first of all,

1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:08.600
 the business owner is typically there.

1:36:09.600 --> 1:36:10.880
 And you walk in the door and they can tell

1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:12.200
 by how you're dressed or how you walk,

1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:14.440
 whatever their pattern recognition is.

1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:15.680
 And they just hate you immediately.

1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:17.040
 It's like, stop wasting my time.

1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:18.400
 I really am trying to get stuff done.

1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:19.760
 I don't want us to a sales pitch.

1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:23.200
 And so you have to overcome the initial get out.

1:36:23.200 --> 1:36:26.200
 And then once you engage, when you say the word

1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:28.640
 credit card processing, the person's like,

1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:31.200
 I already hate you because I have been taken advantage

1:36:31.200 --> 1:36:35.520
 of dozens of times because you all are weasels.

1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:37.480
 And so I had to figure out an algorithm

1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:39.200
 to get past all those different conditions.

1:36:39.200 --> 1:36:41.360
 Cause I was still working on my other startup

1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:42.600
 for the majority of my time.

1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:44.000
 So I was doing this part time.

1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:48.760
 And so I figured out that the industry really was built

1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:53.760
 on people, on deceit, basically people promising things

1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:56.160
 that were not reality.

1:36:56.160 --> 1:36:57.480
 And so I don't know if you've heard of it,

1:36:57.480 --> 1:36:59.320
 but we're not reality and so I'd walk into a business.

1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:01.760
 I'd say, look, I would give you a hundred dollars.

1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:02.920
 I'd put a hundred dollar bill and say,

1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:04.000
 I'll give you a hundred dollars

1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:05.440
 for three minutes of your time.

1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:06.760
 If you don't say yes to what I'm saying,

1:37:06.760 --> 1:37:08.400
 I'll give you a hundred dollars.

1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:10.680
 And then he usually crack a smile and say, okay,

1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:12.640
 like what do you got for me son?

1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:15.000
 And so I'd sit down, I just opened my book and I'd say,

1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:16.280
 here's the credit card industry.

1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:17.120
 Here's how it works.

1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:17.960
 Here are the players.

1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:18.780
 Here's what they do.

1:37:18.780 --> 1:37:20.520
 Here's how they deceive you.

1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:21.360
 Here's what I am.

1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:22.480
 I'm no different than anyone else.

1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:24.080
 I it's like, you're gonna process your credit card.

1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:25.040
 You're gonna get the money in the account.

1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:27.640
 You're just gonna get a clean statement, you're gonna have

1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:29.600
 someone who answers the call when someone asks and you know,

1:37:29.600 --> 1:37:31.720
 just like the basic, like you're okay.

1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:32.800
 And people started saying yes.

1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:34.440
 And then of course I went to the next business and be like,

1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:37.520
 you know, Joe and Susie and whoever said yes too.

1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:39.400
 And so I built a social proof structure

1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:42.400
 and I became the number one salesperson

1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:45.400
 out of 400 people nationwide doing this.

1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:47.080
 And I worked, you know, half time

1:37:47.080 --> 1:37:49.360
 still doing this other startup and.

1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:51.080
 That's a brilliant strategy, by the way.

1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:55.680
 It's very well, very well strategized and executed.

1:37:55.680 --> 1:37:57.640
 I did it for nine months.

1:37:57.640 --> 1:38:00.800
 And at the time my customer base was making,

1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:03.680
 was generating around, I think it was six,

1:38:03.680 --> 1:38:07.480
 if I remember correctly, $62,504 a month

1:38:07.480 --> 1:38:08.520
 were the overall revenues.

1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:09.920
 I thought, wow, that's amazing.

1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:13.260
 If I built that as my own company,

1:38:13.260 --> 1:38:16.880
 I would just make $62,000 a month of income passively

1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:19.280
 with these merchants processing credit cards.

1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:20.400
 So I thought, hmm.

1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:23.720
 And so that's when I thought I'm gonna create a company.

1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:25.840
 And so then I started Braintree.

1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:29.920
 And the idea was the online world was broken

1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:34.920
 because PayPal had been acquired by eBay

1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:38.160
 around, I think, 1999 or 2000.

1:38:38.160 --> 1:38:39.840
 And eBay had not innovated much with PayPal.

1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:42.880
 So it basically sat still for seven years

1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:45.160
 as the software world moved along.

1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:46.840
 And then authorize.net was also a company

1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:47.680
 that was relatively stagnant.

1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:49.840
 So you basically had software engineers

1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:51.880
 who wanted modern payment tools,

1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:53.560
 but there were none available for them.

1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:55.080
 And so they just dealt with software they didn't like.

1:38:55.080 --> 1:38:57.320
 And so with Braintree,

1:38:57.320 --> 1:38:59.000
 I thought the entry point is to build software

1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:00.400
 that engineers will love.

1:39:00.400 --> 1:39:02.120
 And if we can find the entry point via software

1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:03.800
 and make it easy and beautiful

1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:05.400
 and just a magical experience

1:39:05.400 --> 1:39:06.960
 and then provide customer service on top of that,

1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:08.720
 that would be easy, that would be great.

1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:11.560
 What I was really going after though, it was PayPal.

1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:14.960
 They were the only company in payments making money.

1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:19.800
 Because they had the relationship with eBay early on,

1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:22.240
 people created a PayPal account,

1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:24.080
 they'd fund their account with their checking account

1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:25.480
 versus their credit cards.

1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:28.320
 And then when they'd use PayPal to pay a merchant,

1:39:28.320 --> 1:39:31.000
 PayPal had a cost of payment of zero

1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.880
 versus if you have coming from a credit card,

1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:35.120
 you have to pay the bank the fees.

1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:39.920
 So PayPal's margins were 3% on a transaction

1:39:39.920 --> 1:39:41.600
 versus a typical payments company,

1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:43.400
 which may be a nickel or a penny or a dime

1:39:43.400 --> 1:39:44.920
 or something like that.

1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:48.320
 And so I knew PayPal really was the model to replicate,

1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:50.400
 but a bunch of companies had tried to do that.

1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:52.600
 They tried to come in and build a two sided marketplace.

1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:55.280
 So get consumers to fund the checking account

1:39:55.280 --> 1:39:56.680
 and the merchants to accept it,

1:39:56.680 --> 1:39:58.240
 but they'd all failed because building

1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:01.840
 a two sided marketplace is very hard at the same time.

1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:04.600
 So my plan was I'm going to build a company

1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:06.920
 and get the best merchants in the whole world

1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:08.440
 to use our service.

1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:10.760
 Then in year five, I'm going to have,

1:40:10.760 --> 1:40:12.800
 I'm going to acquire a consumer payments company

1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:14.960
 and I'm going to bring the two together.

1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:19.160
 And to focus on the merchant side and then get

1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:21.240
 the payments company that does the customer,

1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:24.640
 the whatever, the other side of it.

1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:26.680
 This is the plan I presented when I was

1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:28.440
 at University of Chicago.

1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:32.360
 And weirdly it happened exactly like that.

1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:36.160
 So four years in our customer base included Uber,

1:40:36.160 --> 1:40:40.240
 Airbnb, GitHub, 37 Signals, not Basecamp.

1:40:40.240 --> 1:40:43.640
 We had a fantastic collection of companies

1:40:43.640 --> 1:40:47.160
 that represented the fastest growing,

1:40:47.160 --> 1:40:49.280
 some of the fastest growing tech companies in the world.

1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:53.440
 And then we met up with Venmo and they had done

1:40:53.440 --> 1:40:55.040
 a remarkable job in building product.

1:40:55.040 --> 1:40:56.800
 It does up then something very counterintuitive,

1:40:56.800 --> 1:40:59.400
 which is make public your private financial transactions

1:40:59.400 --> 1:41:01.760
 which people previously thought were something

1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:03.960
 that should be hidden from others.

1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:08.720
 And we acquired Venmo and at that point we now had,

1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:11.840
 we replicated the model because now people could fund

1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:13.240
 their Venmo account with their checking account,

1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:14.960
 keep money in the account.

1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:17.520
 And then you could just plug Venmo as a form of payment.

1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:19.880
 And so I think PayPal saw that,

1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:22.720
 that we were getting the best merchants in the world.

1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:25.440
 We had people using Venmo.

1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:28.120
 They were both the up and coming millennials at the time

1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:30.440
 who had so much influence online.

1:41:30.440 --> 1:41:34.840
 And so they came in and offered us an attractive number.

1:41:34.840 --> 1:41:39.240
 And my goal was not to build

1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:40.920
 the biggest payments company in the world.

1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:44.160
 It wasn't to try to climb the Forbes billionaire list.

1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:47.880
 It was, the objective was I want to earn enough money

1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:52.640
 so that I can basically dedicate my attention

1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:56.200
 to doing something that could potentially be useful

1:41:56.200 --> 1:41:58.800
 on a society wide scale.

1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:03.240
 And more importantly, that could be considered to be valuable

1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:08.240
 from the vantage point of 2050, 2100 and 2500.

1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:12.360
 So thinking about it on a few hundred year timescale.

1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:16.240
 And there was a certain amount of money I needed to do that.

1:42:16.240 --> 1:42:20.280
 So I didn't require the permission of anybody to do that.

1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:22.760
 And so that what PayPal offered was sufficient for me

1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:25.000
 to get that amount of money to basically have a go.

1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:30.000
 And that's when I set off to survey everything

1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:32.600
 I could identify an existence to say

1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:35.320
 of anything in the entire world I could do.

1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:36.760
 What one thing could I do

1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:40.480
 that would actually have the highest value potential

1:42:40.480 --> 1:42:42.160
 for the species?

1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:44.680
 And so it took me a little while to arrive at Brainerd Faces,

1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:45.520
 but.

1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:51.680
 Payments in themselves are revolutionary technologies

1:42:51.960 --> 1:42:53.960
 that can change the world.

1:42:53.960 --> 1:42:58.960
 Like let's not forget that too easily.

1:43:00.760 --> 1:43:02.480
 I mean, obviously you know this,

1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:07.480
 but there's quite a few lovely folks

1:43:08.680 --> 1:43:13.080
 who are now fascinated with the space of cryptocurrency.

1:43:13.080 --> 1:43:17.000
 And payments are very much connected to this,

1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:18.600
 but in general, just money.

1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:21.240
 And many of the folks I've spoken with,

1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:22.840
 they also kind of connect that

1:43:22.840 --> 1:43:25.840
 to not just purely financial discussions,

1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:28.600
 but philosophical and political discussions.

1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:33.600
 And they see Bitcoin as a way, almost as activism,

1:43:34.680 --> 1:43:38.000
 almost as a way to resist the corruption

1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:40.720
 of centralized centers of power.

1:43:40.720 --> 1:43:42.760
 And sort of basically in the 21st century,

1:43:42.760 --> 1:43:44.440
 decentralizing control.

1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:46.640
 Whether that's Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,

1:43:46.640 --> 1:43:51.640
 they see that's one possible way to give power

1:43:51.800 --> 1:43:55.480
 to those that live in regimes that are corrupt

1:43:55.480 --> 1:43:58.240
 or are not respectful of human rights

1:43:58.240 --> 1:43:59.760
 and all those kinds of things.

1:43:59.760 --> 1:44:03.960
 What's your sense, just all your expertise with payments

1:44:03.960 --> 1:44:05.600
 and seeing how that changed the world,

1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:09.680
 what's your sense about the lay of the land

1:44:09.680 --> 1:44:12.440
 for the future of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies

1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:16.000
 in the positive impact it may have on the world?

1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:20.120
 To be clear, my communication wasn't meant

1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:23.520
 to minimize payments or to denigrate it in any way.

1:44:23.520 --> 1:44:26.480
 It was an attempt at communication

1:44:26.480 --> 1:44:29.400
 that when I was surveying the world,

1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:35.280
 it was an algorithm of what could I individually do?

1:44:35.840 --> 1:44:38.320
 So there are things that exist

1:44:38.320 --> 1:44:41.120
 that have a lot of potential that can be done.

1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:43.960
 And then there's a filtering of how many people

1:44:43.960 --> 1:44:46.440
 are qualified to do this given thing.

1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:48.200
 And then there's a further characterization

1:44:48.200 --> 1:44:49.840
 that can be done of, okay, given the number

1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:54.840
 of qualified people, will somebody be a unique out performer

1:44:54.840 --> 1:44:57.960
 of that group to make something truly impossible

1:44:57.960 --> 1:44:59.520
 to be something done that otherwise couldn't get done?

1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:02.480
 So there's a process of assessing

1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:04.480
 where can you add unique value in the world?

1:45:04.480 --> 1:45:08.560
 And some of that has to do with you being very formal

1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:11.080
 and calculative here, but some of that is just like,

1:45:11.080 --> 1:45:15.040
 what do you sense, like part of that equation

1:45:15.040 --> 1:45:17.240
 is how much passion you sense within yourself

1:45:17.240 --> 1:45:19.080
 to be able to drive that through,

1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:21.520
 to discover the impossibilities and make them possible.

1:45:21.520 --> 1:45:23.920
 That's right, and so we were at Braintree,

1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:26.880
 I think we were the first company to integrate Coinbase

1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:30.080
 into our, I think we were the first payments company

1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:35.080
 to formally incorporate crypto, if I'm not mistaken.

1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:36.720
 For people who are not familiar,

1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:39.640
 Coinbase is a place where you can trade cryptocurrencies.

1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:42.080
 Yeah, which was one of the only places you could.

1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:45.080
 So we were early in doing that.

1:45:45.080 --> 1:45:49.080
 And of course, this was in the year 2013.

1:45:49.080 --> 1:45:52.400
 So an attorney to go in cryptocurrency land.

1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:56.320
 I concur with the statement you made

1:45:56.320 --> 1:46:01.320
 of the potential of the principles

1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:03.120
 underlying cryptocurrencies.

1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:07.640
 And that many of the things that they're building

1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:12.640
 in the name of money and of moving value

1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:16.400
 is equally applicable to the brain

1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:19.360
 and equally applicable to how the brain interacts

1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:20.840
 with the rest of the world

1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:25.600
 and how we would imagine doing goal alignment with people.

1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:29.080
 So to me, it's a continuous spectrum of possibility.

1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:32.200
 And your question is isolated on the money.

1:46:32.200 --> 1:46:35.000
 And I think it just is basically a scaffolding layer

1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:35.840
 for all of society.

1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:38.720
 So you don't see this money as particularly distinct

1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:39.760
 from other? I don't.

1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:44.520
 I think we at Kernel, we will benefit greatly

1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:47.080
 from the progress being made in cryptocurrency

1:46:47.080 --> 1:46:48.960
 because it will be a similar technology stack

1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:51.680
 we will want to use for many things we want to accomplish.

1:46:51.680 --> 1:46:55.040
 And so I'm bullish on what's going on

1:46:55.040 --> 1:46:58.800
 and think it could greatly enhance brain interfaces

1:46:58.800 --> 1:47:01.160
 and the value of the brain interface ecosystem.

1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:02.920
 I mean, is there something you could say about,

1:47:02.920 --> 1:47:05.960
 first of all, bullish on cryptocurrency versus fiat money?

1:47:05.960 --> 1:47:08.760
 So do you have a sense that in 21st century

1:47:08.760 --> 1:47:13.040
 cryptocurrency will be embraced by governments

1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:16.720
 and changed the face of governments,

1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:18.520
 the structure of governments?

1:47:18.520 --> 1:47:23.520
 It's the same way I think about my diet,

1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:27.160
 where previously it was conscious Brian,

1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:32.240
 looking at foods in certain biochemical states.

1:47:32.240 --> 1:47:34.160
 Am I hungry? Am I irritated? Am I depressed?

1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:37.440
 And then I choose based upon those momentary windows.

1:47:37.440 --> 1:47:39.440
 Do I eat at night when I'm fatigued

1:47:39.440 --> 1:47:40.680
 and I have low willpower?

1:47:40.680 --> 1:47:42.840
 Am I going to pig out on something?

1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:46.200
 And the current monetary system is based

1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:48.360
 upon human conscious decision making.

1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:51.480
 And politics and power and this whole mess of things.

1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:55.360
 And what I like about the building blocks

1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:58.640
 of cryptocurrencies, it's methodical, it's structured,

1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:02.120
 it is accountable, it's transparent.

1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:04.720
 And so it introduces this scaffolding,

1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:07.640
 which I think, again, is the right starting point

1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:09.400
 for how we think about building

1:48:09.400 --> 1:48:13.520
 next generation institutions for society.

1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:16.480
 And that's why I think it's much broader than money.

1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:19.680
 So I guess what you're saying is Bitcoin is the demotion

1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:21.300
 of the conscious mind as well.

1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:25.240
 In the same way you were talking about diet,

1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:29.680
 it's like giving less priority to the ups and downs

1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:33.000
 of any one particular human mind, in this case your own,

1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:37.000
 and giving more power to the sort of data driven.

1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.200
 Yes, yeah, I think that is accurate,

1:48:41.200 --> 1:48:46.200
 that cryptocurrency is a version of what I would call

1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:51.320
 my autonomous self that I'm trying to build.

1:48:51.320 --> 1:48:54.960
 It is an introduction of an autonomous system

1:48:54.960 --> 1:48:59.960
 of value exchange and the process of value creation

1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:04.880
 in the society, yes, I see their similarities.

1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:06.520
 So I guess what you're saying is Bitcoin

1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:08.680
 will somehow help me not pig out at night,

1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:11.800
 or the equivalent of, speaking of diet,

1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:15.440
 if we could just linger on that topic a little bit,

1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:20.080
 we already talked about your blog post of I fired myself,

1:49:20.080 --> 1:49:23.560
 I fired Brian, the evening Brian,

1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:28.560
 who's too willing to, not making good decisions

1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:32.220
 for the long term well being and happiness

1:49:32.220 --> 1:49:34.840
 of the entirety of the organism.

1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:36.720
 Basically you were like pigging out at night.

1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:41.120
 But it's interesting, because I do the same,

1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:43.440
 in fact I often eat one meal a day,

1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:49.440
 and like I have been this week actually,

1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:54.320
 especially when I travel, and it's funny

1:49:54.320 --> 1:49:59.320
 that it never occurred to me to just basically look

1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:02.360
 at the fact that I'm able to be much smarter

1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:04.240
 about my eating decisions in the morning

1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:06.720
 and the afternoon than I am at night.

1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:09.080
 So if I eat one meal a day, why not eat

1:50:09.080 --> 1:50:11.360
 that one meal a day in the morning?

1:50:12.680 --> 1:50:16.040
 Like I'm not, it never occurred to me,

1:50:16.040 --> 1:50:21.040
 this revolutionary act, until you've outlined that.

1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:23.220
 So maybe, can you give some details,

1:50:23.220 --> 1:50:26.360
 and this is just you, this is one person,

1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:29.800
 Brian, arrives at a particular thing that they do,

1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:32.560
 but it's fascinating to kind of look

1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:34.080
 at this one particular case study,

1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:36.340
 so what works for you, diet wise?

1:50:36.340 --> 1:50:38.760
 What's your actual diet, what do you eat,

1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:40.200
 how often do you eat?

1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:44.220
 My current protocol is basically the result

1:50:44.220 --> 1:50:48.800
 of thousands of experiments and decision making.

1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:51.880
 So I do this every 90 days, I do the tests,

1:50:51.880 --> 1:50:54.720
 I do the cycle throughs, then I measure again,

1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:56.280
 and then I'm measuring all the time.

1:50:56.280 --> 1:50:59.440
 And so what I, of course I'm optimizing

1:50:59.440 --> 1:51:01.800
 for my biomarkers, I want perfect cholesterol

1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:03.720
 and I want perfect blood glucose levels

1:51:03.720 --> 1:51:07.880
 and perfect DNA methylation processes.

1:51:10.440 --> 1:51:12.480
 I also want perfect sleep.

1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:14.960
 And so for example, recently, the past two weeks,

1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:19.960
 my resting heart rate has been at 42 when I sleep.

1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:22.120
 And when my resting heart rate's at 42,

1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:24.120
 my HRV is at its highest.

1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:29.120
 And I wake up in the morning feeling more energized

1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:30.420
 than any other configuration.

1:51:30.420 --> 1:51:32.400
 And so I know from all these processes

1:51:32.400 --> 1:51:34.720
 that eating at roughly 8.30 in the morning,

1:51:34.720 --> 1:51:37.640
 right after I work out on an empty stomach,

1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:41.460
 creates enough distance between that completed eating

1:51:41.460 --> 1:51:45.520
 and bedtime where I have almost no digestion processes

1:51:45.520 --> 1:51:47.360
 going on in my body,

1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:49.800
 therefore my resting heart rate goes very low.

1:51:49.800 --> 1:51:51.380
 And when my resting heart rate's very low,

1:51:51.380 --> 1:51:52.440
 I sleep with high quality.

1:51:52.440 --> 1:51:54.360
 And so basically I've been trying to optimize

1:51:54.360 --> 1:51:58.280
 the entirety of what I eat to my sleep quality.

1:51:58.280 --> 1:52:00.480
 And my sleep quality then of course feeds into my willpower

1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:02.600
 so it creates this virtuous cycle.

1:52:02.600 --> 1:52:06.440
 And so at 8.30 what I do is I eat what I call super veggie,

1:52:06.440 --> 1:52:10.280
 which is, it's a pudding of 250 grams of broccoli,

1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:11.600
 150 grams of cauliflower,

1:52:11.600 --> 1:52:13.360
 and a whole bunch of other vegetables

1:52:13.360 --> 1:52:16.080
 that I eat what I call nutty pudding, which is.

1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:17.040
 You make the pudding yourself?

1:52:17.040 --> 1:52:20.320
 Like, what do you call it?

1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:23.520
 Like a veggie mix, whatever thing, like a blender?

1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:25.680
 Yeah, you can be made in a high speed blender.

1:52:25.680 --> 1:52:27.800
 But basically I eat the same thing every day,

1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:30.920
 veggie bowl as in the form of pudding,

1:52:30.920 --> 1:52:34.400
 and then a bowl in the form of nuts.

1:52:34.400 --> 1:52:35.480
 And then I have.

1:52:35.480 --> 1:52:36.320
 Vegan.

1:52:36.320 --> 1:52:37.140
 Vegan, yes.

1:52:37.140 --> 1:52:39.680
 Vegan, so that's fat and that's like,

1:52:40.640 --> 1:52:43.600
 that's fat and carbs and that's the protein and so on.

1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:44.440
 Then I have a third dish.

1:52:44.440 --> 1:52:45.280
 Does it taste good?

1:52:45.280 --> 1:52:46.200
 I love it.

1:52:46.200 --> 1:52:49.480
 I love it so much I dream about it.

1:52:49.480 --> 1:52:50.880
 Yeah, that's awesome.

1:52:50.880 --> 1:52:52.200
 This is a.

1:52:52.200 --> 1:52:53.760
 And then I have a third dish which is,

1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:55.280
 it changes every day.

1:52:55.280 --> 1:52:58.200
 Today it was kale and spinach and sweet potato.

1:52:58.200 --> 1:53:02.160
 And then I take about 20 supplements

1:53:03.040 --> 1:53:03.880
 that

1:53:05.600 --> 1:53:09.120
 hopefully make, constitute a perfect nutritional profile.

1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:12.040
 So what I'm trying to do is create the perfect diet

1:53:12.040 --> 1:53:14.200
 for my body every single day.

1:53:14.200 --> 1:53:16.360
 Where sleep is part of the optimization.

1:53:16.360 --> 1:53:17.200
 That's right.

1:53:17.200 --> 1:53:18.400
 You're like, one of the things you're really tracking.

1:53:18.400 --> 1:53:21.060
 I mean, can you, well, I have a million question,

1:53:21.060 --> 1:53:23.680
 but 20 supplements, like what kind are like,

1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:25.160
 would you say are essential?

1:53:25.160 --> 1:53:30.160
 Cause I only take, I only take athletic greens.com slash.

1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:33.120
 That's like the multivitamin essentially.

1:53:33.120 --> 1:53:35.720
 That's like the lazy man, you know, like,

1:53:35.720 --> 1:53:37.640
 like if you don't actually want to think about shit,

1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:40.480
 that's what you take and then fish oil and that's it.

1:53:40.480 --> 1:53:41.620
 That's all I take.

1:53:41.620 --> 1:53:45.080
 Yeah, you know, Alfred North Whitehead said,

1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:48.760
 civilization advances as it extends the number

1:53:48.760 --> 1:53:50.540
 of important operations it can do

1:53:50.540 --> 1:53:52.540
 without thinking about them.

1:53:52.540 --> 1:53:53.380
 Yes.

1:53:53.380 --> 1:53:57.360
 So my objective on this is I want an algorithm

1:53:57.360 --> 1:54:00.920
 for perfect health that I never have to think about.

1:54:00.920 --> 1:54:03.840
 And then I want that system to be scalable to anybody

1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:05.480
 so that they don't have to think about it.

1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:07.720
 And right now it's expensive for me to do it.

1:54:07.720 --> 1:54:09.060
 It's time consuming for me to do it.

1:54:09.060 --> 1:54:10.400
 And I have infrastructure to do it,

1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:14.800
 but the future of being human is not going

1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:17.520
 to the grocery store and deciding what to eat.

1:54:17.520 --> 1:54:19.560
 It's also not reading scientific papers,

1:54:19.560 --> 1:54:21.360
 trying to decide this thing or that thing.

1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:23.000
 It's all N of one.

1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:26.040
 So it's devices on the outside and inside your body,

1:54:26.040 --> 1:54:28.280
 assessing real time what your body needs

1:54:28.280 --> 1:54:30.760
 and then creating closed loop systems for that to happen.

1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:33.760
 Yeah, so right now you're doing the data collection

1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:35.860
 and you're being the scientist,

1:54:35.860 --> 1:54:39.060
 it'd be much better if you just did the data collect

1:54:39.060 --> 1:54:40.820
 or it was being essentially done for you

1:54:40.820 --> 1:54:43.760
 and you can outsource that to another scientist

1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:46.040
 that's doing the N of one study of you.

1:54:46.040 --> 1:54:48.540
 That's right, because every time I spend time thinking

1:54:48.540 --> 1:54:50.400
 about this or executing, spending time on it,

1:54:50.400 --> 1:54:53.680
 I'm spending less time thinking about building kernel

1:54:53.680 --> 1:54:55.320
 or the future of being human.

1:54:55.320 --> 1:54:58.000
 And so it's, we just all have the budget

1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:01.320
 of our capacity on an everyday basis

1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:05.580
 and we will scaffold our way up out of this.

1:55:05.580 --> 1:55:07.800
 And so, yeah, hopefully what I'm doing is really,

1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:11.480
 it serves as a model that others can also build on.

1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:12.520
 That's why I wrote about it,

1:55:12.520 --> 1:55:15.520
 is hopefully people can then take it and improve upon it.

1:55:15.520 --> 1:55:16.500
 I hold nothing sacred.

1:55:16.500 --> 1:55:19.680
 I change my diet almost every day

1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:21.680
 based upon some new test results or science

1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:23.000
 or something like that, but.

1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:24.920
 Can you maybe elaborate on the sleep thing?

1:55:24.920 --> 1:55:27.360
 Why is sleep so important?

1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:32.360
 And why, presumably, like what does good sleep mean to you?

1:55:34.680 --> 1:55:39.680
 I think sleep is a contender for being the most powerful

1:55:43.900 --> 1:55:46.000
 health intervention in existence.

1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:49.440
 It's a contender.

1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:53.480
 I mean, it's magical what it does if you're well rested

1:55:53.480 --> 1:55:56.760
 and what your body can do.

1:55:56.760 --> 1:56:00.400
 And I mean, for example, I know when I eat close

1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:05.400
 to my bedtime and I've done a systematic study for years

1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:07.800
 looking at like 15 minute increments on time of day

1:56:07.800 --> 1:56:09.760
 on where I eat my last meal,

1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:12.600
 my willpower is directly correlated

1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:14.520
 to the amount of deep sleep I get.

1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:18.660
 So my ability to not binge eat at night

1:56:18.660 --> 1:56:22.220
 when rascal Brian's out and about

1:56:22.220 --> 1:56:24.460
 is based upon how much deep sleep I got the night before.

1:56:24.460 --> 1:56:27.340
 Yeah, there's a lot to that, yeah.

1:56:27.340 --> 1:56:30.300
 And so I've seen it manifest itself.

1:56:30.300 --> 1:56:34.020
 And so I think the way I summarize this is

1:56:34.020 --> 1:56:36.260
 in society we've had this myth of,

1:56:36.260 --> 1:56:39.100
 we tell stories, for example, of entrepreneurship

1:56:39.100 --> 1:56:41.580
 where this person was so amazing,

1:56:41.580 --> 1:56:43.180
 they stayed at the office for three days

1:56:43.180 --> 1:56:44.860
 and slept under their desk.

1:56:44.860 --> 1:56:48.720
 And we say, wow, that's amazing, that's amazing.

1:56:49.740 --> 1:56:52.620
 And now I think we're headed towards a state

1:56:52.620 --> 1:56:54.920
 where we'd say that's primitive

1:56:54.920 --> 1:56:58.680
 and really not a good idea on every level.

1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:03.440
 And so the new mythology is going to be the exact opposite.

1:57:05.020 --> 1:57:08.540
 Yeah, by the way, just to sort of maybe push back

1:57:08.540 --> 1:57:10.180
 a little bit on that idea.

1:57:10.180 --> 1:57:13.780
 Did you sleep under your desk collects?

1:57:13.780 --> 1:57:14.620
 Well, yeah, a lot.

1:57:14.620 --> 1:57:16.020
 I'm a big believer in that actually.

1:57:16.020 --> 1:57:19.460
 I'm a big believer in chaos

1:57:19.460 --> 1:57:22.420
 and giving into your passion

1:57:22.420 --> 1:57:25.540
 and sometimes doing things that are out of the ordinary

1:57:25.540 --> 1:57:29.300
 that are not trying to optimize health

1:57:29.300 --> 1:57:34.300
 for certain periods of time in lieu of your passions

1:57:35.740 --> 1:57:39.540
 is a signal to yourself that you're throwing everything away.

1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:42.340
 So I think what you're referring to

1:57:42.340 --> 1:57:46.180
 is how to have good performance for prolonged periods

1:57:46.180 --> 1:57:47.580
 of time.

1:57:47.580 --> 1:57:50.620
 I think there's moments in life

1:57:50.620 --> 1:57:52.640
 where you need to throw all of that away,

1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:54.920
 all the plans away, all the structure away.

1:57:54.920 --> 1:57:59.920
 So I'm not sure I have an eloquent way

1:58:00.680 --> 1:58:02.340
 describing exactly what I'm talking about,

1:58:02.340 --> 1:58:07.340
 but it all depends on people, people are different,

1:58:07.340 --> 1:58:10.220
 but there's a danger of over optimization

1:58:11.380 --> 1:58:14.420
 to where you don't just give into the madness

1:58:14.420 --> 1:58:17.940
 of the way your brain flows.

1:58:17.940 --> 1:58:21.940
 I mean, to push back on my pushback is like,

1:58:21.940 --> 1:58:26.940
 it's nice to have like where the foundations

1:58:29.100 --> 1:58:31.660
 of your brain are not messed with.

1:58:31.660 --> 1:58:35.340
 So you have a fixed foundation where the diet is fixed,

1:58:35.340 --> 1:58:37.820
 where the sleep is fixed and that all of that is optimal

1:58:37.820 --> 1:58:39.940
 and the chaos happens in the space of ideas

1:58:39.940 --> 1:58:41.740
 as opposed to the space of biology.

1:58:42.980 --> 1:58:46.220
 But I'm not sure if there's a,

1:58:47.880 --> 1:58:50.900
 that requires real discipline and forming habits.

1:58:50.900 --> 1:58:54.940
 There's some aspect to which some of the best days

1:58:54.940 --> 1:58:56.460
 and weeks of my life have been, yeah,

1:58:56.460 --> 1:58:58.520
 sleeping under a desk kind of thing.

1:58:58.520 --> 1:59:03.520
 And I don't, I'm not too willing to let go

1:59:03.520 --> 1:59:06.520
 of things that empirically worked

1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:10.360
 for things that work in theory.

1:59:11.460 --> 1:59:16.040
 And so I'm, again, I'm absolutely with you on sleep.

1:59:16.040 --> 1:59:19.560
 Also, I'm with you on sleep conceptually,

1:59:19.560 --> 1:59:23.900
 but I'm also very humbled to understand

1:59:23.900 --> 1:59:26.760
 that for different people,

1:59:26.760 --> 1:59:28.760
 good sleep means different things.

1:59:28.760 --> 1:59:33.040
 I'm very hesitant to trust science on sleep.

1:59:33.040 --> 1:59:35.760
 I think you should also be a scholar of your own body.

1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:38.200
 Again, the experiment of NF1.

1:59:38.200 --> 1:59:43.200
 I'm not so sure that a full night's sleep is great for me.

1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:46.480
 There is something about that power nap

1:59:47.840 --> 1:59:50.160
 that I just have not fully studied yet,

1:59:50.160 --> 1:59:52.560
 but that nap is something special.

1:59:52.560 --> 1:59:54.880
 That I'm not sure I found the optimal thing.

1:59:55.960 --> 1:59:57.600
 So like there's a lot to be explored

1:59:57.600 --> 2:00:00.200
 to what is exactly optimal amount of sleep,

2:00:00.200 --> 2:00:02.400
 optimal kind of sleep combined with diet

2:00:02.400 --> 2:00:03.240
 and all those kinds of things.

2:00:03.240 --> 2:00:05.560
 I mean, that all maps the sort of data,

2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:08.840
 at least the truth, exactly what you're referring to.

2:00:08.840 --> 2:00:10.520
 Here's a data point for your consideration.

2:00:10.520 --> 2:00:11.360
 Yes.

2:00:12.760 --> 2:00:17.400
 The progress in biology over the past, say decade,

2:00:17.400 --> 2:00:18.800
 has been stunning.

2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:19.640
 Yes.

2:00:19.640 --> 2:00:24.240
 And it now appears as if we will be able to replace

2:00:25.220 --> 2:00:28.300
 our organs, zero X for a transplantation.

2:00:28.300 --> 2:00:33.300
 And so we probably have a path to replace

2:00:33.880 --> 2:00:37.840
 and regenerate every organ of your body,

2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:38.940
 except for your brain.

2:00:42.480 --> 2:00:45.280
 You can lose your hand and your arm and a leg.

2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:47.520
 You can have an artificial heart.

2:00:47.520 --> 2:00:49.640
 You can't operate without your brain.

2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:52.180
 And so when you make that trade off decision

2:00:52.180 --> 2:00:54.760
 of whether you're going to sleep under the desk or not

2:00:54.760 --> 2:00:59.760
 and go all out for a four day marathon, right?

2:01:00.280 --> 2:01:02.760
 There's a cost benefit trade off of what's going on,

2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:05.740
 what's happening to your brain in that situation.

2:01:05.740 --> 2:01:07.600
 We don't know the consequences

2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:09.940
 of modern day life on our brain.

2:01:09.940 --> 2:01:14.940
 We don't, it's the most valuable organ in our existence.

2:01:14.940 --> 2:01:18.200
 And we don't know what's going on if we,

2:01:18.200 --> 2:01:20.660
 in how we're treating it today with stress

2:01:20.660 --> 2:01:23.400
 and with sleep and with dietary.

2:01:23.400 --> 2:01:28.400
 And to me, then if you say that you're trying to,

2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:30.000
 you're trying to optimize life

2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:31.960
 for whatever things you're trying to do.

2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:36.380
 The game is soon with the progress in anti aging and biology,

2:01:36.380 --> 2:01:38.160
 the game is very soon going to become different

2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:41.240
 than what it is right now with organ rejuvenation,

2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:42.660
 organ replacement.

2:01:42.660 --> 2:01:47.660
 And I would conjecture that we will value

2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:52.440
 the health status of our brain above all things.

2:01:52.440 --> 2:01:53.960
 Yeah, no, absolutely.

2:01:53.960 --> 2:01:58.200
 Everything you're saying is true, but we die.

2:01:58.200 --> 2:02:01.160
 We die pretty quickly, life is short.

2:02:01.160 --> 2:02:06.160
 And I'm one of those people that I would rather die in battle

2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:11.160
 than stay safe at home.

2:02:11.160 --> 2:02:14.860
 It's like, yeah, you look at kind of,

2:02:14.860 --> 2:02:17.120
 there's a lot of things that you can reasonably say,

2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:19.040
 these are, this is the smart thing to do

2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:21.640
 that can prevent you, that becomes conservative,

2:02:21.640 --> 2:02:24.440
 that can prevent you from fully embracing life.

2:02:24.440 --> 2:02:27.560
 I think ultimately you can be very intelligent

2:02:27.560 --> 2:02:30.760
 and data driven and also embrace life.

2:02:30.760 --> 2:02:33.760
 But I err on the side of embracing life.

2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:36.720
 It's very, it takes a very skillful person

2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:40.280
 to not sort of that hovering parent that says,

2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:44.600
 you know what, there's a 3% chance that if you go out,

2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:47.700
 if you go out by yourself and play, you're going to die,

2:02:47.700 --> 2:02:51.820
 get run over by a car, come to a slow or a sudden end.

2:02:51.820 --> 2:02:56.820
 And I am more a supporter of just go out there.

2:02:57.480 --> 2:02:59.280
 If you die, you die.

2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:02.880
 And that's a, it's a balance you have to strike.

2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:04.880
 I think there's a balance to strike

2:03:04.880 --> 2:03:09.880
 in the longterm optimization and short term freedom.

2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:15.320
 For me, for a programmer, for a programming mind,

2:03:15.320 --> 2:03:18.240
 I tend to over optimize and I'm very cautious

2:03:18.240 --> 2:03:21.440
 and afraid of that, to not over optimize

2:03:21.440 --> 2:03:26.080
 and thereby be overly cautious, suboptimally cautious

2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:27.520
 about everything I do.

2:03:27.520 --> 2:03:30.360
 And that's the ultimate thing I'm trying to optimize for.

2:03:30.360 --> 2:03:33.440
 It's funny you said like sleep and all those kinds of things.

2:03:33.440 --> 2:03:38.440
 I tend to think, this is, you're being more precise

2:03:38.440 --> 2:03:43.440
 than I am, but I think I tend to want to minimize stress,

2:03:47.440 --> 2:03:49.900
 which everything comes into that from your sleep

2:03:49.900 --> 2:03:50.860
 and all those kinds of things.

2:03:50.860 --> 2:03:54.800
 But I worry that whenever I'm trying to be too strict

2:03:54.800 --> 2:03:57.640
 with myself, then the stress goes up

2:03:57.640 --> 2:04:00.520
 when I don't follow the strictness.

2:04:00.520 --> 2:04:02.880
 And so you have to kind of, it's a weird,

2:04:02.880 --> 2:04:05.680
 it's a, there's so many variables in an objective function

2:04:05.680 --> 2:04:07.320
 as it's hard to get right.

2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:09.640
 And sort of not giving a damn about sleep

2:04:09.640 --> 2:04:11.940
 and not giving a damn about diet is a good thing

2:04:11.940 --> 2:04:14.040
 to inject in there every once in a while

2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:17.080
 for somebody who's trying to optimize everything.

2:04:17.080 --> 2:04:20.240
 But that's me just trying to, it's exactly like you said,

2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:22.700
 you're just a scientist, I'm a scientist of myself,

2:04:22.700 --> 2:04:24.120
 you're a scientist of yourself.

2:04:24.120 --> 2:04:25.800
 It'd be nice if somebody else was doing it

2:04:25.800 --> 2:04:28.680
 and had much better data, because I don't trust

2:04:28.680 --> 2:04:30.820
 my conscious mind and I pigged out last night

2:04:30.820 --> 2:04:34.120
 at some brisket in LA that I regret deeply.

2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:37.040
 It's just so, uh.

2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:38.880
 There's no point to anything I just said.

2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:39.720
 But.

2:04:39.720 --> 2:04:40.540
 But.

2:04:40.540 --> 2:04:45.080
 What is the nature of your regret on the brisket?

2:04:46.680 --> 2:04:49.800
 Is it, do you wish you hadn't eaten it entirely?

2:04:49.800 --> 2:04:51.800
 Is it that you wish you hadn't eaten as much as you did?

2:04:51.800 --> 2:04:53.000
 Is it that?

2:04:55.200 --> 2:04:58.520
 I think, well, the most regret, I mean,

2:04:58.520 --> 2:05:03.520
 if we want to be specific, I drank way too much like that.

2:05:03.520 --> 2:05:05.260
 Like diet soda.

2:05:05.260 --> 2:05:08.100
 My biggest regret is like having drank so much diet soda.

2:05:08.100 --> 2:05:10.380
 That's the thing that really was the problem.

2:05:10.380 --> 2:05:12.160
 I had trouble sleeping because of that.

2:05:12.160 --> 2:05:14.660
 Because I was like programming and then I was editing.

2:05:14.660 --> 2:05:15.740
 And so I'd stay up late at night

2:05:15.740 --> 2:05:18.500
 and then I had to get up to go pee a few times

2:05:18.500 --> 2:05:19.460
 and it was just a mess.

2:05:19.460 --> 2:05:20.360
 A mess of a night.

2:05:20.360 --> 2:05:22.340
 It was, well, it's not really a mess,

2:05:22.340 --> 2:05:25.980
 but like it's so many, it's like the little things.

2:05:25.980 --> 2:05:30.100
 I know if I just eat, I drink a little bit of water

2:05:30.100 --> 2:05:31.780
 and that's it, and there's a certain,

2:05:31.780 --> 2:05:36.580
 all of us have perfect days that we know diet wise

2:05:36.580 --> 2:05:39.180
 and so on that's good to follow, you feel good.

2:05:39.180 --> 2:05:41.700
 I know what it takes for me to do that.

2:05:41.700 --> 2:05:43.820
 I didn't fully do that and thereby,

2:05:43.820 --> 2:05:47.660
 because there's an avalanche effect

2:05:47.660 --> 2:05:50.140
 where the other sources of stress,

2:05:50.140 --> 2:05:53.180
 all the other to do items I have piled on,

2:05:53.180 --> 2:05:55.660
 my failure to execute on some basic things

2:05:55.660 --> 2:05:58.860
 that I know make me feel good and all of that combines

2:05:58.860 --> 2:06:02.460
 to create a mess of a day.

2:06:02.460 --> 2:06:05.020
 But some of that chaos, you have to be okay with it,

2:06:05.020 --> 2:06:07.900
 but some of it I wish was a little bit more optimal.

2:06:07.900 --> 2:06:11.020
 And your ideas about eating in the morning

2:06:11.020 --> 2:06:14.380
 are quite interesting as an experiment to try.

2:06:14.380 --> 2:06:18.540
 Can you elaborate, are you eating once a day?

2:06:18.540 --> 2:06:19.780
 Yes.

2:06:19.780 --> 2:06:22.240
 In the morning and that's it.

2:06:22.240 --> 2:06:24.380
 Can you maybe speak to how that,

2:06:24.380 --> 2:06:29.380
 you spoke, it's funny, you spoke about the metrics of sleep,

2:06:30.660 --> 2:06:34.780
 but you're also, you run a business,

2:06:34.780 --> 2:06:36.180
 you're incredibly intelligent,

2:06:36.180 --> 2:06:40.260
 mostly your happiness and success

2:06:40.260 --> 2:06:43.240
 relies on you thinking clearly.

2:06:43.240 --> 2:06:45.900
 So how does that affect your mind and your body

2:06:45.900 --> 2:06:47.180
 in terms of performance?

2:06:47.180 --> 2:06:50.020
 So not just sleep, but actual mental performance.

2:06:50.980 --> 2:06:53.620
 As you were explaining your objective function of,

2:06:53.620 --> 2:06:56.660
 for example, in the criteria you were including,

2:06:56.660 --> 2:06:59.740
 you like certain neurochemical states,

2:06:59.740 --> 2:07:02.520
 like you like feeling like you're living life,

2:07:02.520 --> 2:07:04.580
 that life has enjoyment,

2:07:04.580 --> 2:07:07.540
 that sometimes you want to disregard certain rules

2:07:07.540 --> 2:07:10.220
 to have a moment of passion, of focus.

2:07:10.220 --> 2:07:13.260
 There's this architecture of the way Lex is,

2:07:13.260 --> 2:07:16.340
 which makes you happy as a story you tell,

2:07:16.340 --> 2:07:17.740
 as something you kind of experience,

2:07:17.740 --> 2:07:19.340
 maybe the experience is a bit more complicated,

2:07:19.340 --> 2:07:22.500
 but it's in this idea you have, this is a version of you.

2:07:22.500 --> 2:07:26.860
 And the reason why I maintain the schedule I do

2:07:26.860 --> 2:07:29.620
 is I've chosen a game to say,

2:07:29.620 --> 2:07:31.780
 I would like to live a life

2:07:31.780 --> 2:07:36.220
 where I care more about what intelligent,

2:07:37.740 --> 2:07:41.660
 what people who live in the year 2500

2:07:41.660 --> 2:07:43.420
 think of me than I do today.

2:07:44.780 --> 2:07:46.620
 That's the game I'm trying to play.

2:07:46.620 --> 2:07:51.140
 And so therefore the only thing I really care about

2:07:51.140 --> 2:07:56.140
 on this optimization is trying to see past myself,

2:07:56.420 --> 2:07:59.700
 past my limitations, using zeroes principle thinking,

2:08:01.060 --> 2:08:04.220
 pull myself out of this contextual mesh we're in right now

2:08:04.220 --> 2:08:07.380
 and say, what will matter 100 years from now

2:08:07.380 --> 2:08:08.460
 and 200 years from now?

2:08:08.460 --> 2:08:11.220
 What are the big things really going on

2:08:11.220 --> 2:08:13.300
 that are defining reality?

2:08:13.300 --> 2:08:21.300
 And I find that if I were to hang out with Diet Soda Lex

2:08:22.300 --> 2:08:24.940
 and Diet Soda Brian were to play along with that

2:08:24.940 --> 2:08:28.500
 and my deep sleep were to get crushed as a result,

2:08:28.500 --> 2:08:30.580
 my mind would not be on what matters

2:08:30.580 --> 2:08:32.140
 in 100 years or 200 years or 300 years.

2:08:32.140 --> 2:08:34.300
 I would be irritable.

2:08:34.300 --> 2:08:37.460
 I would be, I'd be in a different state.

2:08:37.460 --> 2:08:41.100
 And so it's just gameplay selection.

2:08:41.100 --> 2:08:43.660
 It's what you and I have chosen to think about.

2:08:43.660 --> 2:08:47.500
 It's what we've chosen to work on.

2:08:47.500 --> 2:08:51.740
 And this is why I'm saying that no generation of humans

2:08:51.740 --> 2:08:54.580
 have ever been afforded the opportunity

2:08:54.580 --> 2:08:58.660
 to look at their lifespan and contemplate

2:08:58.660 --> 2:09:03.180
 that they will have the possibility of experiencing

2:09:03.180 --> 2:09:06.860
 an evolved form of consciousness that is undeniable.

2:09:06.860 --> 2:09:10.980
 They would fall in a zero category of potential.

2:09:10.980 --> 2:09:14.100
 That to me is the most exciting thing in existence.

2:09:14.100 --> 2:09:19.100
 And I would not trade any momentary neurochemical state

2:09:19.700 --> 2:09:21.500
 right now in exchange for that.

2:09:21.500 --> 2:09:23.660
 I would, I'd be willing to deprive myself

2:09:23.660 --> 2:09:27.060
 of all momentary joy in pursuit of that goal

2:09:27.060 --> 2:09:28.860
 because that's what makes me happy.

2:09:29.780 --> 2:09:30.780
 That's brilliant.

2:09:30.780 --> 2:09:34.300
 But I'm a bit, I just looked it up.

2:09:34.300 --> 2:09:38.620
 I'm with, I just looked up Braveheart's speech

2:09:38.620 --> 2:09:41.780
 and William Wallace, but I don't know if you've seen it.

2:09:41.780 --> 2:09:45.500
 Fight and you may die, run and you'll live at least a while.

2:09:45.500 --> 2:09:48.020
 And dying in your beds many years from now,

2:09:48.020 --> 2:09:51.420
 would you be willing to trade all the days

2:09:51.420 --> 2:09:53.700
 from this day to that for one chance,

2:09:53.700 --> 2:09:57.060
 just one chance, picture Mel Gibson saying this,

2:09:57.060 --> 2:09:59.060
 to come back here and tell our enemies

2:09:59.060 --> 2:10:03.700
 that they may take our lives with growing excitement,

2:10:03.700 --> 2:10:06.380
 but they'll never take our freedom.

2:10:06.380 --> 2:10:08.700
 I get excited every time I see that in the movie,

2:10:08.700 --> 2:10:11.020
 but that's kind of how I approach life and eating.

2:10:11.020 --> 2:10:13.140
 Do you think they were tracking their sleep?

2:10:13.140 --> 2:10:14.460
 They were not tracking their sleep

2:10:14.460 --> 2:10:16.180
 and they ate way too much brisket

2:10:16.180 --> 2:10:19.420
 and they were fat, unhealthy, died early,

2:10:19.420 --> 2:10:22.420
 and were primitive.

2:10:22.420 --> 2:10:25.420
 But there's something in my ape brain

2:10:25.420 --> 2:10:28.380
 that's attracted to that, even though most of my life

2:10:29.340 --> 2:10:32.620
 is fully aligned with the way you see yours.

2:10:32.620 --> 2:10:34.100
 Part of it is for comedy, of course,

2:10:34.100 --> 2:10:38.820
 but part of it is I'm almost afraid of overoptimization.

2:10:38.820 --> 2:10:39.860
 Really what you're saying though,

2:10:39.860 --> 2:10:41.580
 if we're looking at this,

2:10:41.580 --> 2:10:43.460
 let's say from a first principles perspective,

2:10:43.460 --> 2:10:44.700
 when you read those words,

2:10:44.700 --> 2:10:46.540
 they conjure up certain life experiences,

2:10:46.540 --> 2:10:47.460
 but you're basically saying,

2:10:47.460 --> 2:10:50.340
 I experienced a certain neurotransmitter state

2:10:50.340 --> 2:10:53.060
 when these things are in action.

2:10:53.060 --> 2:10:53.940
 That's all you're saying.

2:10:53.940 --> 2:10:55.300
 So whether it's that or something else,

2:10:55.300 --> 2:10:57.180
 you're just saying you have a selection

2:10:57.180 --> 2:10:59.380
 for how your state for your body.

2:10:59.380 --> 2:11:02.780
 And so if you as an engineer of consciousness,

2:11:02.780 --> 2:11:05.180
 that should just be engineerable.

2:11:05.180 --> 2:11:08.260
 And that's just triggering certain chemical reactions.

2:11:08.260 --> 2:11:11.300
 And so it doesn't mean they have to be mutually exclusive.

2:11:11.300 --> 2:11:12.980
 You can have that and experience that

2:11:12.980 --> 2:11:15.780
 and also not sacrifice longterm health.

2:11:15.780 --> 2:11:17.540
 And I think that's the potential of where we're going

2:11:17.540 --> 2:11:22.540
 is we don't have to assume they are trade offs

2:11:23.980 --> 2:11:25.660
 that must be had.

2:11:25.660 --> 2:11:26.500
 Absolutely.

2:11:26.500 --> 2:11:28.860
 And so I guess for my particular brain,

2:11:28.860 --> 2:11:32.100
 it's useful to have the outlier experiences

2:11:32.100 --> 2:11:35.660
 that also come along with the illusion of free will

2:11:35.660 --> 2:11:37.780
 where I chose those experiences

2:11:37.780 --> 2:11:39.540
 that make me feel like it's freedom.

2:11:39.540 --> 2:11:42.380
 Listen, going to Texas made me realize I spent,

2:11:42.380 --> 2:11:46.740
 so I still am, but I lived at Cambridge at MIT

2:11:46.740 --> 2:11:49.140
 and I never felt like home there.

2:11:49.140 --> 2:11:52.580
 I felt like home in the space of ideas with the colleagues,

2:11:52.580 --> 2:11:54.340
 like when I was actually discussing ideas,

2:11:54.340 --> 2:11:57.860
 but there is something about the constraints,

2:11:58.780 --> 2:12:00.260
 how cautious people are,

2:12:00.260 --> 2:12:05.140
 how much they valued also kind of a material success,

2:12:05.140 --> 2:12:06.820
 career success.

2:12:06.820 --> 2:12:11.820
 When I showed up to Texas, it felt like I belong.

2:12:12.020 --> 2:12:14.740
 That was very interesting, but that's my neurochemistry,

2:12:14.740 --> 2:12:17.260
 whatever the hell that is, whatever,

2:12:17.260 --> 2:12:18.740
 maybe probably is rooted to the fact

2:12:18.740 --> 2:12:20.060
 that I grew up in the Soviet Union

2:12:20.060 --> 2:12:22.020
 and it was such a constrained system

2:12:22.020 --> 2:12:23.940
 that you'd really deeply value freedom

2:12:23.940 --> 2:12:27.420
 and you always want to escape the man

2:12:27.420 --> 2:12:29.060
 and the control of centralized systems.

2:12:29.060 --> 2:12:32.380
 I don't know what it is, but at the same time,

2:12:32.380 --> 2:12:33.820
 I love strictness.

2:12:33.820 --> 2:12:37.700
 I love the dogmatic authoritarianism of diet,

2:12:38.620 --> 2:12:41.340
 of like the same habit, exactly the habit you have.

2:12:41.340 --> 2:12:43.740
 I think that's actually when bodies perform optimally,

2:12:43.740 --> 2:12:45.540
 my body performs optimally.

2:12:45.540 --> 2:12:48.860
 So balancing those two, I think if I have the data,

2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:51.620
 every once in a while, party with some wild people,

2:12:51.620 --> 2:12:53.620
 but most of the time eat once a day,

2:12:54.580 --> 2:12:56.220
 perhaps in the morning, I'm gonna try that.

2:12:56.220 --> 2:12:57.900
 That might be very interesting,

2:12:57.900 --> 2:12:59.980
 but I'd rather not try it.

2:12:59.980 --> 2:13:03.100
 I'd rather have the data that tells me to do it.

2:13:03.100 --> 2:13:07.180
 But in general, you're able to, eating once a day,

2:13:07.180 --> 2:13:09.940
 think deeply about stuff like this.

2:13:09.940 --> 2:13:13.860
 Concern that people have is like does your energy wane,

2:13:13.860 --> 2:13:15.140
 all those kinds of things.

2:13:15.140 --> 2:13:19.220
 Do you find that it's, especially because it's unique,

2:13:19.220 --> 2:13:21.020
 it's vegan as well.

2:13:21.020 --> 2:13:23.860
 So you find that you're able to have a clear mind,

2:13:23.860 --> 2:13:27.740
 a focus, and just physically and mentally throughout?

2:13:27.740 --> 2:13:29.820
 Yeah, and I find like my personal experience

2:13:29.820 --> 2:13:34.820
 in thinking about hard things is,

2:13:36.020 --> 2:13:40.180
 like oftentimes I feel like I'm looking through a telescope

2:13:40.180 --> 2:13:42.260
 and like I'm aligning two or three telescopes.

2:13:42.260 --> 2:13:44.100
 And you kind of have to close one eye

2:13:44.100 --> 2:13:46.180
 and move it back and forth a little bit

2:13:46.180 --> 2:13:47.940
 and just find just the right alignment.

2:13:47.940 --> 2:13:49.820
 Then you find just a sneak peek

2:13:49.820 --> 2:13:51.660
 at the thing you're trying to find, but it's fleeting.

2:13:51.660 --> 2:13:54.780
 If you move just one little bit, it's gone.

2:13:54.780 --> 2:13:58.820
 And oftentimes what I feel like are the ideas

2:13:58.820 --> 2:14:00.620
 I value the most are like that.

2:14:00.620 --> 2:14:05.620
 They're so fragile and fleeting and slippery and elusive.

2:14:06.700 --> 2:14:11.700
 And it requires a sensitivity to thinking

2:14:13.860 --> 2:14:16.500
 and a sensitivity to maneuver through these things.

2:14:16.500 --> 2:14:21.500
 If I concede to a world where I'm on my phone texting,

2:14:21.500 --> 2:14:22.340
 I'm also on social media.

2:14:22.340 --> 2:14:25.340
 I'm also doing 15 things at the same time

2:14:25.340 --> 2:14:26.380
 because I'm running a company

2:14:26.380 --> 2:14:28.980
 and I'm also feeling terrible from the last night.

2:14:30.620 --> 2:14:31.860
 It all just comes crashing down.

2:14:31.860 --> 2:14:35.860
 And the quality of my thoughts goes to a zero.

2:14:35.860 --> 2:14:40.100
 I'm a functional person to respond to basic level things,

2:14:40.100 --> 2:14:43.260
 but I don't feel like I am doing anything interesting.

2:14:44.940 --> 2:14:46.940
 I think that's a good word, sensitivity,

2:14:46.940 --> 2:14:50.420
 because that's the word that's used the most.

2:14:50.420 --> 2:14:53.860
 That's what thinking deeply feels like

2:14:53.860 --> 2:14:55.820
 is you're sensitive to the fragile thoughts.

2:14:55.820 --> 2:14:56.660
 And you're right.

2:14:56.660 --> 2:14:59.100
 All those other distractions kind of dull

2:14:59.100 --> 2:15:02.980
 your ability to be sensitive to the fragile thoughts.

2:15:02.980 --> 2:15:04.180
 It's a really good word.

2:15:05.540 --> 2:15:08.140
 Out of all the things you've done,

2:15:08.140 --> 2:15:11.700
 you've also climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.

2:15:13.100 --> 2:15:14.120
 Is this true?

2:15:14.120 --> 2:15:14.960
 It's true.

2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:19.960
 Why and how, and what do you take from that experience?

2:15:25.680 --> 2:15:26.880
 I guess the backstory is relevant

2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:31.880
 because in that moment, it was the darkest time in my life.

2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:34.280
 I was ending a 13 year marriage.

2:15:34.280 --> 2:15:35.320
 I was leaving my religion.

2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:38.480
 I sold Braintree and I was battling depression

2:15:38.480 --> 2:15:40.880
 where I was just at the end.

2:15:40.880 --> 2:15:45.800
 And I got invited to go to Tanzania

2:15:45.800 --> 2:15:47.120
 as part of a group that was raising money

2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:49.400
 to build clean water wells.

2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:51.560
 And I had made some money from Braintree,

2:15:51.560 --> 2:15:54.480
 and so I was able to donate $25,000.

2:15:54.480 --> 2:15:59.280
 And it was the first time I had ever had money to donate

2:15:59.280 --> 2:16:01.720
 outside of paying tithing in my religion.

2:16:01.720 --> 2:16:04.400
 It was such a phenomenal experience

2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:09.400
 to contribute something meaningful to someone else

2:16:09.400 --> 2:16:11.280
 in that form.

2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:12.720
 And as part of this process,

2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:13.800
 we were gonna climb the mountain.

2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:16.600
 And so we went there and we saw the clean water wells

2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:17.440
 we were building.

2:16:17.440 --> 2:16:20.520
 We spoke to the people there and it was very energizing.

2:16:20.520 --> 2:16:21.920
 And then we climbed Kilimanjaro

2:16:21.920 --> 2:16:26.920
 and I came down with a stomach flu on day three.

2:16:29.240 --> 2:16:30.720
 And I also had altitude sickness,

2:16:30.720 --> 2:16:33.080
 but I became so sick that on day four,

2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:34.760
 we are somebody on day five,

2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:39.480
 I came into the camp, base camp at 15,000 feet,

2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:42.840
 just going to the bathroom on myself

2:16:42.840 --> 2:16:44.520
 and falling all over.

2:16:44.520 --> 2:16:47.160
 I was just a disaster, I was so sick.

2:16:47.160 --> 2:16:49.920
 So stomach flu and altitude sickness.

2:16:49.920 --> 2:16:54.920
 Yeah, and I just was destroyed from the situation.

2:16:57.120 --> 2:17:00.880
 Plus, it was psychologically one of the lowest points.

2:17:00.880 --> 2:17:03.360
 Yeah, and I think that was probably a big contributor.

2:17:03.360 --> 2:17:06.600
 I was just smoked as a human, just absolutely done.

2:17:06.600 --> 2:17:07.760
 And I had three young children.

2:17:07.760 --> 2:17:09.680
 And so I was trying to reconcile,

2:17:09.680 --> 2:17:12.960
 this is not a, whether I live or not

2:17:12.960 --> 2:17:14.920
 is not my decision by itself.

2:17:14.920 --> 2:17:19.600
 I'm now intertwined with these three little people

2:17:19.600 --> 2:17:22.960
 and I have an obligation whether I like it or not,

2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:24.480
 I need to be there.

2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:26.440
 And so it did, it felt like I was just stuck

2:17:26.440 --> 2:17:27.680
 in a straight jacket.

2:17:27.680 --> 2:17:32.240
 And I had to decide whether I was going to summit

2:17:32.240 --> 2:17:34.120
 the next day with the team.

2:17:35.280 --> 2:17:36.600
 And it was a difficult decision

2:17:36.600 --> 2:17:38.200
 because once you start hiking,

2:17:38.200 --> 2:17:40.800
 there's no way to get off the mountain.

2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:44.000
 And a midnight came and our guide came in

2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:44.960
 and he said, where are you at?

2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:48.200
 And I said, I think I'm okay, I think I can try.

2:17:48.200 --> 2:17:49.760
 And so we went.

2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:54.760
 And so from midnight to, I made it to the summit at 5 a.m.

2:17:56.840 --> 2:17:59.640
 It was one of the most transformational moments

2:17:59.640 --> 2:18:00.960
 of my existence.

2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:05.960
 And the mountain became my problem.

2:18:06.560 --> 2:18:09.920
 It became everything that I was struggling with.

2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:12.560
 And when I started hiking, it was,

2:18:12.560 --> 2:18:17.560
 the pain got so ferocious that it was kind of like this.

2:18:19.080 --> 2:18:24.080
 It became so ferocious that I turned my music to Eminem

2:18:25.040 --> 2:18:26.920
 and it was, Eminem was the,

2:18:26.920 --> 2:18:31.160
 he was the only person in existence that spoke to my soul.

2:18:31.160 --> 2:18:33.680
 And it was something about his anger

2:18:33.680 --> 2:18:38.040
 and his vibrancy and his multi eventually,

2:18:38.040 --> 2:18:39.960
 he's the only person who I could turn on

2:18:39.960 --> 2:18:42.760
 and I could just say, I feel some relief.

2:18:42.760 --> 2:18:46.760
 I turned on Eminem and I made it to the summit

2:18:46.760 --> 2:18:51.000
 after five hours, but just 100 yards from the top.

2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:54.440
 I was with my guide Ike and I started getting very dizzy

2:18:54.440 --> 2:18:56.960
 and I felt like I was gonna fall backwards

2:18:56.960 --> 2:18:58.520
 off this cliff area we were on.

2:18:58.520 --> 2:19:00.440
 I was like, this is dangerous.

2:19:00.440 --> 2:19:03.520
 And he said, look, Brian, I know where you're at.

2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:06.200
 I know where you're at.

2:19:06.200 --> 2:19:08.400
 And I can tell you, you've got it in you.

2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:13.400
 So I want you to look up, take a step, take a breath

2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:16.520
 and look up, take a breath and take a step.

2:19:16.520 --> 2:19:19.240
 And I did and I made it.

2:19:19.240 --> 2:19:22.720
 And so I got there and I just sat down with him at the top.

2:19:22.720 --> 2:19:24.200
 I just cried like a baby.

2:19:24.200 --> 2:19:25.040
 Broke down.

2:19:25.040 --> 2:19:26.720
 Yeah, I just lost it.

2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:29.520
 And so he'd let me do my thing.

2:19:29.520 --> 2:19:31.920
 And then we pulled out the pulse oximeter

2:19:31.920 --> 2:19:33.240
 and he measured my blood oxygen levels

2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:36.080
 and it was like 50 something percent

2:19:36.080 --> 2:19:36.960
 and it was danger zone.

2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:39.560
 So he looked at it and I think he was like really alarmed

2:19:39.560 --> 2:19:41.160
 that I was in this situation.

2:19:41.160 --> 2:19:44.840
 And so he said, we can't get a helicopter here

2:19:44.840 --> 2:19:46.160
 and we can't get you emergency evacuated.

2:19:46.160 --> 2:19:47.000
 You've gotta go down.

2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:49.720
 You've gotta hike down to 15,000 feet to get base camp.

2:19:49.720 --> 2:19:53.080
 And so we went out on the mountain.

2:19:53.080 --> 2:19:55.000
 I got back down to base camp.

2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:57.560
 And again, that was pretty difficult.

2:19:57.560 --> 2:19:59.160
 And then they put me on a stretcher,

2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:01.040
 this metal stretcher with this one wheel

2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:04.680
 and a team of six people wheeled me down the mountain.

2:20:04.680 --> 2:20:06.440
 And it was pretty torturous.

2:20:06.440 --> 2:20:07.600
 I'm very appreciative they did.

2:20:07.600 --> 2:20:09.080
 Also the trail was very bumpy.

2:20:09.080 --> 2:20:10.240
 So they'd go over the big rocks.

2:20:10.240 --> 2:20:11.880
 And so my head would just slam

2:20:11.880 --> 2:20:14.880
 against this metal thing for hours.

2:20:14.880 --> 2:20:15.960
 And so I just felt awful.

2:20:15.960 --> 2:20:18.880
 Plus I'd get my head slammed every couple of seconds.

2:20:18.880 --> 2:20:22.080
 So the whole experience was really a life changing moment.

2:20:22.080 --> 2:20:25.040
 And that was the demarcation of me

2:20:25.040 --> 2:20:26.680
 basically building a new life.

2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:31.440
 Basically I said, I'm going to reconstruct Brian,

2:20:31.440 --> 2:20:35.000
 my understanding of reality, my existential realities,

2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:36.760
 what I want to go after.

2:20:36.760 --> 2:20:39.640
 And I try, I mean, as much as that's possible as a human,

2:20:39.640 --> 2:20:44.360
 but that's when I set out to rebuild everything.

2:20:44.360 --> 2:20:46.040
 Was it the struggle of that?

2:20:46.040 --> 2:20:50.840
 I mean, there's also just like the romantic poetic,

2:20:50.840 --> 2:20:52.320
 it's a fricking mountain.

2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:58.040
 There's a man in pain, psychological and physical

2:20:58.040 --> 2:20:59.840
 struggling up a mountain.

2:20:59.840 --> 2:21:03.960
 But it's just struggle, just in the face of,

2:21:05.600 --> 2:21:09.800
 just pushing through in the face of hardship or nature too.

2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:11.360
 Something much bigger than you.

2:21:12.480 --> 2:21:14.880
 Is that, was that the thing that just clicked?

2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:18.000
 For me, it felt like I was just locked in with reality

2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:21.280
 and it was a death match.

2:21:21.280 --> 2:21:24.040
 It was in that moment, one of us is going to die.

2:21:24.040 --> 2:21:27.480
 So you were pondering death, like not surviving.

2:21:27.480 --> 2:21:28.320
 Yep.

2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:29.880
 And it was, and that was the moment.

2:21:29.880 --> 2:21:32.280
 And it was, the summit to me was,

2:21:33.720 --> 2:21:35.920
 I'm going to come out on top and I can do this.

2:21:35.920 --> 2:21:40.640
 And giving in was, it's like, I'm just done.

2:21:40.640 --> 2:21:43.400
 And so it did, I locked in and that's why,

2:21:43.400 --> 2:21:47.640
 yeah, mountains are magical to me.

2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:50.320
 I didn't expect that.

2:21:50.320 --> 2:21:51.240
 I didn't design that.

2:21:51.240 --> 2:21:52.960
 I didn't know that was going to be the case.

2:21:52.960 --> 2:21:55.000
 I not, it would not have been something

2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:56.280
 I would have anticipated.

2:21:58.120 --> 2:22:00.320
 But you were not the same man afterwards.

2:22:01.600 --> 2:22:02.840
 Yeah.

2:22:02.840 --> 2:22:06.320
 Is there advice you can give to young people today

2:22:06.320 --> 2:22:07.400
 that look at your story,

2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:09.360
 that's successful in many dimensions,

2:22:10.600 --> 2:22:13.240
 advice you can give to them about how to be successful

2:22:13.240 --> 2:22:16.160
 in their career, successful in life,

2:22:16.160 --> 2:22:17.840
 whatever path they choose?

2:22:18.880 --> 2:22:22.560
 Yes, I would say, listen to advice

2:22:22.560 --> 2:22:27.440
 and see it for what it is, a mirror of that person,

2:22:28.840 --> 2:22:31.920
 and then map and know that your future

2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:34.760
 is going to be in a zero principle land.

2:22:34.760 --> 2:22:38.080
 And so what you're hearing today is a representation

2:22:38.080 --> 2:22:39.800
 of what may have been the right principles

2:22:39.800 --> 2:22:41.360
 to build upon previously,

2:22:41.360 --> 2:22:45.680
 but they're likely depreciating very fast.

2:22:45.680 --> 2:22:49.120
 And so I am a strong proponent

2:22:49.120 --> 2:22:54.120
 that people ask for advice, but they don't take advice.

2:22:57.280 --> 2:22:59.320
 So how do you take advice properly?

2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:03.320
 It's in the careful examination of the advice.

2:23:03.320 --> 2:23:06.600
 It's actually the person makes a statement

2:23:06.600 --> 2:23:09.120
 about a given thing somebody should follow.

2:23:09.120 --> 2:23:10.640
 The value is not doing that.

2:23:10.640 --> 2:23:13.480
 The value is understanding the assumption stack they built,

2:23:13.480 --> 2:23:15.320
 the assumption and knowledge stack they built

2:23:15.320 --> 2:23:18.080
 around that body of knowledge.

2:23:18.080 --> 2:23:18.920
 That's the value.

2:23:18.920 --> 2:23:20.800
 It's not doing what they say.

2:23:20.800 --> 2:23:25.080
 Considering the advice, but digging deeper

2:23:25.080 --> 2:23:27.920
 to understand the assumption stack,

2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:29.560
 like the full person,

2:23:29.560 --> 2:23:32.400
 I mean, this is deep empathy, essentially,

2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:34.200
 to understand the journey of the person

2:23:34.200 --> 2:23:36.320
 that arrived at the advice.

2:23:36.320 --> 2:23:39.040
 And the advice is just the tip of the iceberg

2:23:39.040 --> 2:23:41.080
 that ultimately is not the thing that gives you.

2:23:41.080 --> 2:23:43.560
 It could be the right thing to do.

2:23:43.560 --> 2:23:45.080
 It could be the complete wrong thing to do

2:23:45.080 --> 2:23:47.000
 depending on the assumption stack.

2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:49.520
 So you need to investigate the whole thing.

2:23:49.520 --> 2:23:54.080
 Is there some, are there been people in your startup

2:23:54.080 --> 2:23:59.080
 and your business journey that have served that role

2:23:59.360 --> 2:24:02.640
 of advice giver that's been helpful?

2:24:02.640 --> 2:24:07.640
 Or do you feel like your journey felt like a lonely path?

2:24:07.640 --> 2:24:11.520
 Or was it one that was, of course,

2:24:11.520 --> 2:24:14.080
 we're all there born and die alone.

2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:20.240
 But do you fundamentally remember the experiences,

2:24:21.360 --> 2:24:23.960
 one where you leaned on people

2:24:23.960 --> 2:24:26.920
 at a particular moment in time that changed everything?

2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:30.840
 Yeah, the most significant moments of my memory,

2:24:30.840 --> 2:24:33.040
 for example, like on Kilimanjaro,

2:24:33.040 --> 2:24:38.040
 when Ike, some person I'd never met in Tanzania,

2:24:38.160 --> 2:24:41.800
 was able to, in that moment, apparently see my soul

2:24:41.800 --> 2:24:45.000
 when I was in this death match with reality.

2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:48.680
 And he gave me the instructions, look up, step.

2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:53.680
 And so there's magical people in my life

2:24:54.880 --> 2:24:56.640
 that have done things like that.

2:24:57.640 --> 2:25:00.760
 And I suspect they probably don't know.

2:25:00.760 --> 2:25:04.480
 I probably should be better at identifying those things.

2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:07.760
 And, but yeah, hopefully the,

2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.960
 I suppose like the wisdom I would aspire to

2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:22.920
 is to have the awareness and the empathy

2:25:22.920 --> 2:25:24.920
 to be that for other people.

2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:29.920
 And not a retail advertiser of advice,

2:25:33.640 --> 2:25:38.640
 of tricks for life, but deeply meaningful

2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:41.800
 and empathetic with a one on one context

2:25:41.800 --> 2:25:44.400
 with people that it really can make a difference.

2:25:45.560 --> 2:25:47.400
 Yeah, I actually kind of experience,

2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:49.040
 I think about that sometimes.

2:25:49.040 --> 2:25:51.560
 You have like an 18 year old kid come up to you.

2:25:51.560 --> 2:25:56.080
 And it's not always obvious,

2:25:56.080 --> 2:26:00.120
 it's not always easy to really listen to them.

2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:04.600
 Like not the facts, but like see who that person is.

2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:07.040
 I think people say that about being a parent

2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:10.840
 is you want to consider that,

2:26:11.960 --> 2:26:14.200
 you don't want to be the authority figure

2:26:14.200 --> 2:26:16.040
 in the sense that you really want to consider

2:26:16.040 --> 2:26:18.720
 that there's a special unique human being there

2:26:18.720 --> 2:26:23.520
 with a unique brain that may be brilliant

2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:25.520
 in ways that you are not understanding

2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:29.360
 that you'll never be and really try to hear that.

2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:31.640
 So when giving advice, there's something to that.

2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:34.000
 It's a both sides should be deeply empathetic

2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:35.440
 about the assumption stack.

2:26:36.880 --> 2:26:38.800
 I love that terminology.

2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:42.520
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing of life?

2:26:43.400 --> 2:26:46.080
 Why the hell are we here, Brian Johnson?

2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:48.320
 We've been talking about brains and studying brains

2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:51.440
 and you had this very eloquent way of describing life

2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:55.400
 on Earth as an optimization problem

2:26:55.400 --> 2:26:59.400
 of the cost of intelligence going to zero.

2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:01.760
 At first through the evolutionary process

2:27:01.760 --> 2:27:04.140
 and then eventually through building,

2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:06.720
 through our technology,

2:27:06.720 --> 2:27:09.280
 building more and more intelligent systems.

2:27:09.280 --> 2:27:13.600
 You ever ask yourself why is doing that?

2:27:13.600 --> 2:27:17.440
 Yeah, I think the answer to this question,

2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:21.640
 again, the information value is more in the mirror

2:27:21.640 --> 2:27:24.360
 it provides of that person,

2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:26.960
 which is a representation of the technological,

2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:30.120
 social, political context of the time.

2:27:30.120 --> 2:27:32.240
 So if you ask this question a hundred years ago,

2:27:32.240 --> 2:27:33.280
 you would get a certain answer

2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:35.040
 that reflects that time period.

2:27:35.040 --> 2:27:36.960
 Same thing would be true of a thousand years ago.

2:27:36.960 --> 2:27:40.920
 It's rare, it's difficult for a person to pull themselves

2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:43.080
 out of their contextual awareness

2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:45.240
 and offer a truly original response.

2:27:45.240 --> 2:27:48.520
 And so knowing that I am contextually influenced

2:27:48.520 --> 2:27:52.400
 by the situation, that I am a mirror for our reality,

2:27:52.400 --> 2:27:54.240
 I would say that in this moment,

2:27:55.160 --> 2:27:59.160
 I think the real game going on

2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:06.280
 is that evolution built a system

2:28:07.920 --> 2:28:10.600
 of scaffolding intelligence that produced us.

2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:13.880
 We are now building intelligence systems

2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:18.880
 that are scaffolding higher dimensional intelligence,

2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:23.480
 that's developing more robust systems of intelligence.

2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:32.680
 In doing in that process with the cost going to zero,

2:28:32.680 --> 2:28:37.680
 then the meaning of life becomes goal alignment,

2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:41.520
 which is the negotiation of our conscious

2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:43.680
 and unconscious existence.

2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:45.040
 And then I'd say the third thing is,

2:28:45.040 --> 2:28:47.800
 if we're thinking that we wanna be explorers

2:28:48.800 --> 2:28:52.920
 is our technological progress is getting to a point

2:28:52.920 --> 2:28:57.240
 where we could aspirationally say,

2:28:57.240 --> 2:29:01.240
 we want to figure out what is really going on,

2:29:01.240 --> 2:29:06.240
 really going on, because does any of this really make sense?

2:29:06.600 --> 2:29:09.200
 Now we may be a hundred, 200, 500, a thousand years away

2:29:09.200 --> 2:29:14.200
 from being able to poke our way out of whatever is going on.

2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:20.120
 But it's interesting that we could even state an aspiration

2:29:20.120 --> 2:29:22.960
 to say, we wanna poke at this question.

2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:26.000
 But I'd say in this moment of time,

2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:30.680
 the meaning of life is that we can build a future state

2:29:31.880 --> 2:29:35.200
 of existence that is more fantastic

2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:37.120
 than anything we could ever imagine.

2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:41.960
 The striving for something more amazing.

2:29:43.640 --> 2:29:48.640
 And that defies expectations that we would consider

2:29:50.920 --> 2:29:55.720
 bewildering and all the things that that's,

2:29:55.720 --> 2:29:57.280
 and I guess the last thing,

2:29:57.280 --> 2:29:59.120
 if there's multiple meanings of life,

2:29:59.120 --> 2:30:00.480
 it would be infinite games.

2:30:00.480 --> 2:30:01.960
 James Kars wrote the book,

2:30:01.960 --> 2:30:04.120
 Finite Games, Infinite Games.

2:30:04.120 --> 2:30:08.600
 The only game to play right now is to keep playing the game.

2:30:09.640 --> 2:30:11.400
 And so this goes back to the algorithm

2:30:11.400 --> 2:30:14.640
 of the Lex algorithm of diet soda and brisket

2:30:14.640 --> 2:30:16.200
 and pursuing the passion.

2:30:16.200 --> 2:30:19.320
 What I'm suggesting is there's a moment here

2:30:19.320 --> 2:30:22.560
 where we can contemplate playing infinite games.

2:30:22.560 --> 2:30:25.840
 Therefore, it may make sense to err on the side

2:30:25.840 --> 2:30:27.720
 of making sure one is in a situation

2:30:27.720 --> 2:30:31.240
 to be playing infinite games if that opportunity arises.

2:30:31.240 --> 2:30:35.320
 So the landscape of possibility is changing very, very fast

2:30:35.320 --> 2:30:37.000
 and therefore our old algorithms

2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:38.440
 of how we might assess risk assessment

2:30:38.440 --> 2:30:39.280
 and what things we might pursue

2:30:39.280 --> 2:30:42.640
 and why those assumptions may fall away very quickly.

2:30:44.120 --> 2:30:46.120
 Well, I think I speak for a lot of people

2:30:46.120 --> 2:30:50.520
 when I say that the game you, Mr. Brian Johnson,

2:30:50.520 --> 2:30:53.200
 have been playing is quite incredible.

2:30:53.200 --> 2:30:54.280
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

2:30:54.280 --> 2:30:55.120
 Thanks, Lex.

2:30:56.160 --> 2:30:57.680
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:30:57.680 --> 2:30:59.480
 with Brian Johnson and thank you

2:30:59.480 --> 2:31:04.480
 to Four Sigmatic, NetSuite, Grammarly, and ExpressVPN.

2:31:05.040 --> 2:31:08.360
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:10.120
 And now let me leave you with some words

2:31:10.120 --> 2:31:12.000
 from Diane Ackerman.

2:31:12.000 --> 2:31:15.120
 Our brain is a crowded chemistry lab,

2:31:15.120 --> 2:31:18.760
 bustling with nonstop neural conversations.

2:31:18.760 --> 2:31:30.040
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
