00:00.000 --> 00:03.560
 The following is a conversation with Gary Kasparov.

00:03.560 --> 00:06.460
 He's considered by many to be the greatest chess player

00:06.460 --> 00:07.680
 of all time.

00:07.680 --> 00:11.240
 From 1986 until his retirement in 2005,

00:11.240 --> 00:13.360
 he dominated the chess world,

00:13.360 --> 00:17.200
 ranking world number one for most of those 19 years.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.880
 While he has many historical matches

00:18.880 --> 00:20.840
 against human chess players,

00:20.840 --> 00:24.040
 in the long arc of history he may be remembered

00:24.040 --> 00:28.840
 for his match against the machine, IBM's Deep Blue.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.840
 His initial victories and eventual loss to Deep Blue

00:31.840 --> 00:34.680
 captivated the imagination of the world,

00:34.680 --> 00:37.440
 of what role artificial intelligence systems may play

00:37.440 --> 00:39.720
 in our civilization's future.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.420
 That excitement inspired an entire generation

00:42.420 --> 00:45.160
 of AI researchers, including myself,

00:45.160 --> 00:47.240
 to get into the field.

00:47.240 --> 00:51.320
 Gary is also a pro democracy political thinker and leader,

00:51.320 --> 00:53.280
 a fearless human rights activist,

00:53.280 --> 00:54.960
 and author of several books,

00:54.960 --> 00:57.320
 including How Life Imitates Chess,

00:57.320 --> 01:00.080
 which is a book on strategy and decision making,

01:00.080 --> 01:01.400
 Winter is Coming,

01:01.400 --> 01:03.560
 which is a book articulating his opposition

01:03.560 --> 01:05.000
 to the Putin regime,

01:05.000 --> 01:06.280
 and Deep Thinking,

01:06.280 --> 01:07.680
 which is a book on the role

01:07.680 --> 01:11.480
 of both artificial intelligence and human intelligence

01:11.480 --> 01:13.560
 in defining our future.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.520
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:28.160 --> 01:32.400
 And now, here's my conversation with Gary Kasparov.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.960
 As perhaps the greatest chess player of all time,

01:35.960 --> 01:39.080
 when you look introspectively at your psychology

01:39.080 --> 01:40.720
 throughout your career,

01:40.720 --> 01:42.560
 what was the bigger motivator,

01:42.560 --> 01:45.260
 the love of winning or the hatred of losing?

01:46.940 --> 01:47.840
 Tough question.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.800
 Have to confess I never heard it before,

01:51.800 --> 01:53.720
 which is again, congratulations.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.120
 It's quite an accomplishment.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.200
 Losing was always painful.

02:01.200 --> 02:04.480
 For me, it was almost like a physical pain

02:04.480 --> 02:08.120
 because I knew that if I lost the game,

02:09.640 --> 02:11.560
 it's just because I made a mistake.

02:11.560 --> 02:16.480
 So I always believed that the result of the game

02:18.160 --> 02:21.000
 had to be decided by the quality of my play.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.360
 Okay, you may say it sounds arrogant,

02:24.360 --> 02:26.520
 but it helped me to move forward

02:26.520 --> 02:30.080
 because I always knew that there was room for improvement.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.120
 So it's the...

02:31.120 --> 02:32.960
 Was there the fear of the mistake?

02:32.960 --> 02:36.680
 Actually, fear of mistake guarantees mistakes.

02:36.680 --> 02:40.180
 And the difference between top players at the very top

02:40.180 --> 02:44.620
 is that it's the ability to make a decision

02:44.620 --> 02:46.400
 without predictable consequences.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.560
 You don't know what's happening.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.680
 It's just intuitively.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.600
 I can go this way or that way.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.680
 And there are always hesitations.

02:52.680 --> 02:55.040
 People are like, you are just at the crossroad.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.240
 You can go right, you can go left, you can go straight.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.760
 You can turn and go back.

02:58.760 --> 03:03.160
 And the consequences are just very uncertain.

03:03.160 --> 03:07.040
 Yes, you have certain ideas what happens on the right

03:07.040 --> 03:09.020
 or on the left or on just if you go straight,

03:09.020 --> 03:13.440
 but it's not enough to make well calculated choice.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.400
 And when you play chess at the very top,

03:16.400 --> 03:18.740
 it's about your inner strength.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.080
 So I can make this decision.

03:21.080 --> 03:24.880
 I will stand firm and I'm not going to waste my time

03:24.880 --> 03:28.740
 because I have full confidence that I will go through.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.160
 Going back to your original question is,

03:32.160 --> 03:34.340
 I would say neither.

03:34.340 --> 03:39.020
 It's just, it's love for winning, hate for losing.

03:39.020 --> 03:41.640
 There were important elements, psychological elements,

03:41.640 --> 03:46.640
 but the key element, I would say the driving force

03:46.640 --> 03:51.640
 was always my passion for making a difference.

03:53.320 --> 03:57.080
 It's just, I can move forward and I can always,

03:57.080 --> 03:59.920
 I can always enjoy not just playing,

03:59.920 --> 04:01.660
 but creating something new.

04:01.660 --> 04:03.160
 Creating something new.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.520
 How do you think about that?

04:04.520 --> 04:07.440
 It's just finding new ideas in the openings,

04:07.440 --> 04:09.580
 some original plan in the middle game.

04:09.580 --> 04:13.300
 It's actually, that helped me to make the transition

04:13.300 --> 04:15.920
 from the game of chess where I was on the very top

04:15.920 --> 04:20.160
 to another life where I knew I would not be number one.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.080
 I would not be necessarily on the top,

04:22.080 --> 04:26.720
 but I could still be very active and productive

04:26.720 --> 04:30.240
 by my ability to make a difference,

04:30.240 --> 04:34.400
 by influencing people, say joining the democratic movement

04:34.400 --> 04:36.580
 in Russia or talking to people

04:36.580 --> 04:38.560
 about human machine relations.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.920
 There's so many things where I knew my influence

04:42.800 --> 04:45.720
 may not be as decisive as in chess,

04:45.720 --> 04:49.040
 but still strong enough to help people

04:49.040 --> 04:51.640
 to make their choices.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.120
 So you can still create something new

04:53.120 --> 04:57.160
 that makes a difference in the world outside of chess.

04:57.160 --> 05:01.880
 But wait, you've kind of painted a beautiful picture

05:01.880 --> 05:04.220
 of your motivations in chess to create something new,

05:04.220 --> 05:08.460
 to look for those moments of some brilliant new ideas.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.080
 But were you haunted by something?

05:11.080 --> 05:15.120
 See, you make it seem like to be at the level you're at,

05:15.120 --> 05:18.440
 you can get away without having demons,

05:18.440 --> 05:21.760
 without having fears,

05:21.760 --> 05:25.380
 without being driven by some of the darker forces.

05:26.840 --> 05:29.640
 I mean, you sound almost religious.

05:29.640 --> 05:32.800
 The darker forces, spiritual demons.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.800
 I mean, do you have a call for a priest?

05:34.800 --> 05:37.480
 That's what I'm dressing as.

05:37.480 --> 05:42.400
 Now, just let's go back to these crucial chess moments

05:42.400 --> 05:44.480
 where I had to make big decisions.

05:44.480 --> 05:49.480
 As I said, it was all about my belief from very early days

05:50.120 --> 05:52.920
 that I can make all the difference by playing well

05:52.920 --> 05:53.960
 or by making mistakes.

05:53.960 --> 05:57.080
 So yes, I always had an opponent

05:57.080 --> 06:00.240
 across the chess board, opposite me.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.920
 But no matter how strong the opponent was,

06:02.920 --> 06:04.360
 whether it just was ordinary player

06:04.360 --> 06:07.720
 or another world champion like Anatoly Karpov,

06:09.400 --> 06:10.880
 having all respect for my opponent,

06:10.880 --> 06:14.400
 I still believe that it's up to me to make the difference.

06:14.400 --> 06:19.400
 And I knew I was not invincible.

06:21.600 --> 06:22.560
 I made mistakes.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.800
 I made some blunders.

06:23.800 --> 06:28.240
 And with age, I made more blunders.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.400
 So I knew it.

06:30.400 --> 06:34.360
 But it's still, it's very much for me

06:34.360 --> 06:37.000
 to be decisive factor in the game.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.360
 I mean, even now, look, I just,

06:38.360 --> 06:40.360
 my latest chess experience was horrible.

06:40.360 --> 06:44.920
 I mean, I played Caruana, Fabi Caruana,

06:44.920 --> 06:46.120
 this number two, number two,

06:46.120 --> 06:47.840
 number three player in the world these days.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.520
 We played this 960 with the Fischer,

06:50.520 --> 06:52.960
 so called Fischer random chess, reshuffling pieces.

06:52.960 --> 06:56.240
 Yeah, I lost very badly, but it's because I made mistakes.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.720
 I mean, I had so many winning positions.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.000
 I mean, 15 years ago, I would have crushed him.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.640
 So, and it's, you know, while I lost,

07:03.640 --> 07:05.160
 I was not so much upset.

07:05.160 --> 07:08.280
 I mean, I know, as I said in the interview,

07:08.280 --> 07:10.840
 I can fight any opponent, but not my biological clock.

07:10.840 --> 07:15.840
 So it's fighting time is always a losing proposition.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.920
 But even today at age 56, you know,

07:18.920 --> 07:22.120
 I knew that, you know, I could play great game.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.400
 I couldn't finish it because I didn't have enough energy

07:24.400 --> 07:25.560
 or just, you know,

07:25.560 --> 07:27.640
 I couldn't have the same level of concentration.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.720
 But, you know, in number of games

07:29.720 --> 07:31.960
 where I completely outplayed one of the top players

07:31.960 --> 07:35.360
 in the world, I mean, gave me a certain amount of pleasure.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.440
 That is, even today, I haven't lost my touch.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.320
 Not the same, you know.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.080
 Okay, the jaws are not as strong

07:43.080 --> 07:44.760
 and the teeth are not as sharp,

07:44.760 --> 07:47.040
 but I could get to him just, you know,

07:47.040 --> 07:49.240
 almost, you know, on the ropes.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.080
 Still got it.

07:50.080 --> 07:50.920
 Still got it.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.320
 And it's, you know, and it's,

07:52.320 --> 07:54.560
 I think it's, my wife said it well.

07:54.560 --> 07:55.920
 I mean, she said, look, Gary,

07:55.920 --> 07:59.720
 it's somehow, it's not just fighting your biological clock.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.480
 It's just, you know, maybe it's a signal

08:01.480 --> 08:03.720
 because, you know, the goddess of chess,

08:03.720 --> 08:05.640
 since you spoke great about demons.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.560
 The goddess of chess, Keisha,

08:07.560 --> 08:09.000
 maybe she didn't want you to win

08:09.000 --> 08:11.560
 because, you know, if you could beat

08:12.480 --> 08:14.480
 number two, number three player in the world,

08:14.480 --> 08:16.600
 I mean, that's one of the top players

08:16.600 --> 08:19.280
 who just recently played World Championship match.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.840
 If you could beat him,

08:20.840 --> 08:23.040
 that would be really bad for the game of chess.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.880
 But just, what people will say,

08:24.880 --> 08:26.280
 oh, look, the game of chess, you know,

08:26.280 --> 08:28.400
 it's not making any progress.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.520
 The game is just, you know,

08:29.520 --> 08:32.480
 it's totally devalued because, look,

08:32.480 --> 08:34.080
 the guy coming out of retirement,

08:34.080 --> 08:35.600
 you know, just, you know, winning games,

08:35.600 --> 08:37.800
 maybe that was good for chess, not good for you.

08:37.800 --> 08:41.520
 But it's, look, I've been following your logic.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.480
 We should always look for, you know, demons,

08:43.480 --> 08:46.360
 you know, superior forces and other things

08:46.360 --> 08:48.960
 that could, you know, if not dominate our lives,

08:48.960 --> 08:52.640
 but somehow, you know, play a significant role

08:52.640 --> 08:55.560
 in the outcome.

08:55.560 --> 08:58.240
 Yeah, so the goddess of chess had to send a message.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.840
 Yeah, that's okay.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.680
 So Gary, you should do something else.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.000
 Time.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.920
 Now for a question that you have heard before,

09:06.920 --> 09:09.320
 but give me a chance.

09:09.320 --> 09:12.280
 You've dominated the chess world for 20 years,

09:12.280 --> 09:14.240
 even still got it.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.880
 Is there a moment, you said,

09:15.880 --> 09:17.560
 you always look to create something new.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.320
 Is there games or moments

09:21.320 --> 09:23.400
 where you're especially proud of

09:23.400 --> 09:27.240
 in terms of your brilliance of a new creative move?

09:27.240 --> 09:28.600
 You've talked about Mikhail Tal

09:28.600 --> 09:31.840
 as somebody who was aggressive and creative chess player

09:31.840 --> 09:33.480
 in your own game.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.560
 Look, you mentioned Mikhail Tal.

09:35.560 --> 09:39.400
 It's very aggressive, very sharp player,

09:39.400 --> 09:42.280
 famous for his combinations and sacrifices,

09:42.280 --> 09:44.120
 even called magician from Riga,

09:44.120 --> 09:47.400
 so for his very unique style.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.920
 But any world champion, you know,

09:50.920 --> 09:53.160
 it's, yeah, was a creator.

09:53.160 --> 09:57.600
 Some of them were so flamboyant and flash like Tal.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.160
 Some of them were no just, you know,

09:59.160 --> 10:04.000
 less discerned at the chess board like Tigran Petrosian,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.120
 but every world champion, every top player

10:07.120 --> 10:09.000
 brought something into the game of chess.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.680
 And each contribution was priceless

10:11.680 --> 10:13.680
 because it's not just about sacrifices.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.920
 Of course, amateurs, they enjoy, you know,

10:15.920 --> 10:18.800
 the brilliant games where pieces being sacrificed.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.520
 It's all just, you know, it's all piece of hanging.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.040
 And it's all of a sudden, you know,

10:24.040 --> 10:26.320
 being material down, a rook down,

10:26.320 --> 10:28.280
 or just, you know, queen down.

10:28.280 --> 10:33.280
 The weaker side delivers the final blow

10:33.880 --> 10:36.200
 on just, you know, mating opponent's king.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.600
 But there are other kinds of beauty.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.080
 I mean, it's a slow positional maneuvering,

10:41.080 --> 10:42.520
 you know, looking for weaknesses

10:42.520 --> 10:44.880
 and just, and gradually, you know,

10:44.880 --> 10:47.280
 strangling your opponent

10:47.280 --> 10:51.720
 and eventually delivering sort of a positional masterpiece.

10:51.720 --> 10:55.280
 So I think I made more difference in the game of chess

10:55.280 --> 10:58.800
 than I could have imagined when I started playing.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.600
 And the reason I thought it was time for me to leave

11:01.600 --> 11:04.680
 was just, I mean, I knew that I was not,

11:05.560 --> 11:08.880
 I was not, no longer the position to

11:10.360 --> 11:14.800
 bring the same kind of contribution,

11:14.800 --> 11:18.320
 the same kind of new knowledge into the game.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.640
 So, and going back,

11:21.640 --> 11:24.160
 I could immediately look at my games

11:24.160 --> 11:25.280
 against Anatoly Karpov.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.800
 It's not just I won the match in 1985

11:27.800 --> 11:31.160
 and became a world champion at age 22,

11:31.160 --> 11:34.600
 but there were at least two games in that match.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.680
 Of course, the last one, game 24,

11:36.680 --> 11:38.120
 that was decisive game of the match,

11:38.120 --> 11:40.760
 I won and became world champion.

11:40.760 --> 11:45.640
 But also the way I won, it was a very sharp game

11:45.640 --> 11:48.920
 and I found a unique maneuver that was absolutely new

11:48.920 --> 11:52.280
 and it became some sort of just a typical now,

11:52.280 --> 11:54.320
 though just when the move was made,

11:55.200 --> 11:58.920
 was made on the board and put on display,

11:58.920 --> 12:01.360
 a lot of people thought it was ugly.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.600
 And another game, game 16 in the match

12:03.600 --> 12:06.800
 where I just also managed to outplay Karpov completely

12:06.800 --> 12:10.840
 with black pieces, just paralyzing his entire army

12:10.840 --> 12:13.280
 in its own camp.

12:13.280 --> 12:14.800
 Technically or psychologically,

12:14.800 --> 12:17.560
 or was that a mix of both in game 16?

12:17.560 --> 12:19.960
 Yeah, I think it was a big blow to Karpov.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.840
 I think it was a big psychological victory

12:21.840 --> 12:22.920
 for a number of reasons.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.280
 One, the score was equal at the time

12:25.280 --> 12:28.040
 and the world champion by the rules

12:28.040 --> 12:30.760
 could retain his title in case of a tie.

12:30.760 --> 12:35.080
 So we still have, before game 16, we have nine games to go.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.080
 And also it was some sort of a bluff

12:37.080 --> 12:41.520
 because neither me nor Karpov saw the refutation

12:41.520 --> 12:42.840
 of this opening idea.

12:42.840 --> 12:46.640
 And I think it says for Karpov, it was double blow

12:46.640 --> 12:48.840
 because not that he lost the game, I should triple blow.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.960
 He lost the game, it was a brilliant game

12:50.960 --> 12:55.240
 and I played impeccably after just this opening bluff.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.440
 And then they discovered that it was a bluff.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.480
 So it's the, again, I didn't know, I was not bluffing.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.160
 So that's why it happens very often.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.520
 Some ideas could be refuted.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.240
 And it's just, what I found out,

13:06.240 --> 13:09.200
 and this is again, going back to your spiritual theme

13:09.200 --> 13:13.000
 is that you could spend a lot of time working.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.400
 And when I say you could, it's in the 80s, in the 90s.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.960
 It doesn't happen these days because everybody

13:17.960 --> 13:18.880
 has a computer.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.400
 You could immediately see if it works or it doesn't work.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.600
 Machine shows your refutation in a split of a second.

13:24.600 --> 13:28.640
 But many of the analysis in the 80s or in the 90s,

13:28.640 --> 13:31.560
 they were not perfect simply because we're humans

13:31.560 --> 13:34.080
 and just you analyze the game,

13:34.080 --> 13:36.040
 you look for some fresh ideas.

13:36.040 --> 13:39.280
 And then just it happens that there was something

13:39.280 --> 13:42.720
 that you missed because the level of the concentration

13:42.720 --> 13:45.960
 at the chess board is different from when you analyze

13:45.960 --> 13:47.760
 the game, just moving the pieces around.

13:47.760 --> 13:52.480
 And, but somehow if you spend a lot of time

13:52.480 --> 13:55.360
 at the chess board preparing, so in your studies

13:55.360 --> 13:59.880
 with your coaches, hours and hours and hours,

13:59.880 --> 14:03.560
 and nothing of what you found could,

14:03.560 --> 14:08.560
 had materialized on the chess board.

14:08.920 --> 14:12.280
 Somehow these hours help, I don't know why,

14:12.280 --> 14:14.200
 always helped you.

14:14.200 --> 14:19.200
 It's as if the amount of work you did could be transformed

14:19.640 --> 14:23.840
 into some sort of spiritual energy that helped you

14:23.840 --> 14:27.400
 to come up with other great ideas during the board.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.320
 Again, even if there was no direct connection

14:30.320 --> 14:33.880
 between your preparation and your victory in the game,

14:33.880 --> 14:37.760
 there was always some sort of invisible connection

14:37.760 --> 14:39.880
 between the amount of work you did,

14:39.880 --> 14:42.840
 your dedication to actually, and your passion

14:42.840 --> 14:47.440
 to discover new ideas, and your ability during the game

14:47.440 --> 14:49.320
 at the chess board, when the clock was ticking,

14:49.320 --> 14:52.120
 we still had ticking clock, not digital clock at the time.

14:52.120 --> 14:55.120
 So to come up with some brilliance.

14:55.120 --> 14:59.800
 And I also can mention many games from the 90s.

14:59.800 --> 15:04.240
 So it's the, obviously all amateurs would pick up my game

15:04.240 --> 15:07.360
 against Veselin Topalov in 1999 and V. Konzai.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.680
 Again, because it was a brilliant game,

15:09.680 --> 15:13.560
 the Black King traveled from its own camp

15:13.560 --> 15:17.760
 to into White's camp across the entire board.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.600
 It doesn't happen often, trust me, as you know,

15:20.600 --> 15:23.280
 in the games with professional players,

15:23.280 --> 15:24.520
 top professional players.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.720
 So that's why visually it was one

15:26.720 --> 15:28.360
 of the most impressive victories.

15:28.360 --> 15:33.280
 But I could bring to your attention many other games

15:33.280 --> 15:37.600
 that were not so impressive for amateurs,

15:37.600 --> 15:42.600
 not so beautiful, just because it's sacrifice

15:43.080 --> 15:44.840
 is always beautiful, you sacrifice pieces.

15:44.840 --> 15:48.840
 And then eventually you have very few resources left

15:48.840 --> 15:53.840
 and you use them just to crush your opponent basically.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.240
 You have to make the king because you have almost

15:58.240 --> 16:01.280
 nothing left at your disposal.

16:01.280 --> 16:06.160
 But up to the very end, again, less and less,

16:06.160 --> 16:08.880
 but still up to the very end, I always had games

16:08.880 --> 16:11.880
 with some sort of interesting ideas

16:11.880 --> 16:14.800
 and games that gave me great satisfaction.

16:14.800 --> 16:19.800
 But I think it's what happened from 2005 up to these days

16:20.840 --> 16:24.600
 was also a very big accomplishment

16:24.600 --> 16:28.640
 since I had to find myself to sort of relocate myself.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.680
 Yeah, rechannel the creative energies.

16:30.680 --> 16:35.680
 Exactly, and to find something where I feel comfortable,

16:35.680 --> 16:39.440
 even confident that my participation

16:39.440 --> 16:41.400
 still makes the difference.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.560
 Beautifully put.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.880
 So let me ask perhaps a silly question,

16:44.880 --> 16:48.440
 but sticking on chest for just a little longer.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.120
 Where do you put Magnus Carlsen, the current world champion

16:51.120 --> 16:52.880
 in the list of all time greats?

16:54.200 --> 16:57.880
 In terms of style, moments of brilliance, consistency.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.520
 It's a tricky question.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.600
 The moment you start ranking world champions.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.560
 Yeah, you lose something?

17:04.560 --> 17:09.560
 I think it's not fair because any new generation

17:12.040 --> 17:15.120
 knows much more about the game than the previous one.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.640
 So when people say, oh, Gary was the greatest,

17:17.640 --> 17:19.680
 Fischer was the greatest, Magnus was the greatest,

17:19.680 --> 17:24.360
 it disregard the fact that the great players of the past,

17:24.360 --> 17:26.800
 whether it was Alaskia, Capoplank, Alokian,

17:26.800 --> 17:28.800
 I mean, they knew so little about chess

17:28.800 --> 17:29.920
 by today's standards.

17:29.920 --> 17:32.640
 I mean, today, just any kid that spent a few years

17:32.640 --> 17:37.520
 with his or her chess computer knows much more

17:37.520 --> 17:40.080
 about the game simply just because you have access

17:40.080 --> 17:40.960
 to this information.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.480
 And it has been discovered generation after generation.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.880
 We added more and more knowledge to the game of chess.

17:46.880 --> 17:50.360
 It's about the gap between the world champion

17:50.360 --> 17:51.720
 and the rest of the field.

17:51.720 --> 17:55.240
 So it's the, now, if you look at the gap,

17:55.240 --> 17:58.280
 then probably Fischer could be on top,

17:58.280 --> 17:59.800
 but very short period of time.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.960
 Then you should also add a time factor.

18:01.960 --> 18:05.640
 I was on top, not as big as Fischer, but much longer.

18:05.640 --> 18:08.440
 So, and also, unlike Fischer,

18:08.440 --> 18:11.760
 I succeeded in beating next generation.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.240
 Here's the question.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.800
 Let's see if you still got the fire,

18:14.800 --> 18:15.960
 speaking of the next generation,

18:15.960 --> 18:19.000
 because you did succeed beating the next generation.

18:19.000 --> 18:19.840
 It's close.

18:19.840 --> 18:22.920
 Okay, Anand, Short, Anand, the sheer of,

18:22.920 --> 18:24.440
 Kramnik is already 12 years younger.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.560
 So that's the next.

18:25.560 --> 18:28.200
 But still yet, I competed with them

18:28.200 --> 18:30.000
 and I just, I beat most of them.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.200
 And I was still dominant when I left at age of 41.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.800
 So back to Magnus.

18:36.800 --> 18:40.240
 Magnus, I mean, consistency is phenomenal.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.920
 The reason Magnus is on top,

18:42.920 --> 18:46.640
 and it seems unbeatable today,

18:46.640 --> 18:50.680
 Magnus is a lethal combination of Fischer and Karpov,

18:50.680 --> 18:52.920
 which is very, it's very unusual

18:52.920 --> 18:54.840
 because Fischer's style was very dynamic,

18:54.840 --> 18:56.800
 just fighting to the last point,

18:56.800 --> 18:59.120
 just using every resource available.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.320
 Karpov was very different.

19:01.320 --> 19:04.680
 It's just an unparalleled ability

19:04.680 --> 19:07.600
 to use every piece with a maximum effect.

19:07.600 --> 19:12.040
 Just its minimal resources always produce maximum effect.

19:12.040 --> 19:15.160
 So now imagine that you merge these two styles.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.160
 So it's like, you know,

19:17.160 --> 19:20.080
 it's squeezing every stone for a drop of water,

19:21.280 --> 19:22.880
 but doing it, you know, just, you know,

19:22.880 --> 19:25.080
 for 50, 60, 70, 80 moves.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.280
 I mean, Magnus could go on as long as Fischer

19:27.280 --> 19:28.920
 with all his passion and energy.

19:28.920 --> 19:31.440
 And at the same time being as meticulous

19:31.440 --> 19:35.200
 and deadly as Karpov by just, you know,

19:35.200 --> 19:36.840
 using every little advantage.

19:36.840 --> 19:40.560
 So, and he has good, you know, very good health.

19:40.560 --> 19:41.400
 It's important.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.600
 I mean, physical conditions are, by the way,

19:42.600 --> 19:43.440
 very important.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.720
 So a lot of people don't recognize it.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.920
 Their latest study shows that chess players

19:46.920 --> 19:50.920
 burn thousands of calories during the game.

19:50.920 --> 19:54.480
 So that puts him on the top of this field

19:54.480 --> 19:56.000
 of the world champions.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.440
 But again, it's the discussion that is,

19:59.440 --> 20:00.720
 I saw recently on the internet,

20:00.720 --> 20:03.200
 whether Garry Kasparov of his peak,

20:03.200 --> 20:06.600
 let's say late eighties, could beat Magnus Carlsen today.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.600
 I mean, it's certainly irrelevant

20:07.600 --> 20:10.920
 because Garry Kasparov in 1989, okay,

20:10.920 --> 20:12.760
 has played great chess,

20:12.760 --> 20:15.200
 but still I knew very little about chess

20:15.200 --> 20:17.160
 compared to Magnus Carlsen in 2019,

20:17.160 --> 20:18.840
 who by the way, learned from me as well.

20:18.840 --> 20:20.480
 So that's why, yeah.

20:20.480 --> 20:24.040
 I'm extremely cautious in making any judgment

20:24.040 --> 20:26.560
 that involves, you know, time gaps.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.720
 You ask, you know, soccer fans.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.120
 So who is your favorite?

20:30.120 --> 20:31.960
 Pele, Maradona, or Messi?

20:31.960 --> 20:32.800
 Yeah.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.960
 Yeah, who's your favorite?

20:33.960 --> 20:34.800
 Messi.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.640
 Messi.

20:35.640 --> 20:36.720
 Yeah, why?

20:36.720 --> 20:37.560
 Because?

20:37.560 --> 20:38.520
 Maybe Maradona, maybe.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.040
 Not because you're younger, but that's simple.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.720
 Your instinctive answer is correct

20:41.720 --> 20:44.480
 because you saw, you didn't see Maradona in action.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.880
 I saw all of them in action.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.080
 So that's why, but since, you know,

20:48.080 --> 20:50.240
 when I was, you know, just following it, you know,

20:50.240 --> 20:52.800
 just Pele and Maradona, they were just, you know,

20:52.800 --> 20:55.280
 they were big stars and it's, Messi's already just,

20:55.280 --> 20:58.800
 I was gradually losing interest in just other things.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.240
 So I remember Pele in 1970, the final match Brazil Italy.

21:02.240 --> 21:05.720
 So that's the first World Cup soccer I watched.

21:05.720 --> 21:09.280
 So that's the, and actually my answer when I just,

21:09.280 --> 21:10.400
 when I just, you know,

21:10.400 --> 21:12.480
 because I was asked this question as well.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.840
 So I say that it's just,

21:13.840 --> 21:15.640
 while it's impossible to make a choice,

21:15.640 --> 21:18.440
 I would still probably go with Maradona for simple reason.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.960
 The Brazilian team in 1970 could have won without Pele.

21:21.960 --> 21:23.200
 It was absolutely great.

21:23.200 --> 21:26.280
 Still could have won, maybe, but it is,

21:26.280 --> 21:28.720
 Argentinian team in 1986 without Maradona

21:28.720 --> 21:29.760
 would not be in the final.

21:29.760 --> 21:33.880
 So this is, and Messi, he still hasn't won a title.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.600
 You could argue for that for an hour,

21:35.600 --> 21:38.680
 but you could say, if you ask Maradona,

21:38.680 --> 21:40.680
 if you look in his eyes, especially,

21:40.680 --> 21:43.520
 let's say Gary Kasparov in 1989,

21:43.520 --> 21:45.200
 he would have said,

21:45.200 --> 21:48.560
 I was sure as hell would beat Magnus Carlsen.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.480
 Just simply because. The confidence, the fire.

21:50.480 --> 21:54.080
 Simply because, again, they saw me in action.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.880
 So this, again, it's the age factor that's important.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.640
 Definitely with the passion and energy

21:58.640 --> 22:01.720
 and being equipped with all modern ideas.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.040
 But again, then you make, you know,

22:04.040 --> 22:05.880
 a very just important assumption

22:05.880 --> 22:08.720
 that you could empower Gary Kasparov in 1989

22:08.720 --> 22:11.560
 with all ideas that have been accumulated over 30 years.

22:11.560 --> 22:12.720
 That would not be Gary Kasparov.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.320
 That would be someone else.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.280
 Because again, I belong to 1989.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.960
 I was way ahead of the field.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.840
 And I beat Karpov several times

22:21.840 --> 22:23.240
 in the World Championship matches.

22:23.240 --> 22:26.440
 And I crossed 2800, which, by the way,

22:26.440 --> 22:28.480
 if you look at the, in the rating,

22:28.480 --> 22:31.480
 which is just, even today,

22:31.480 --> 22:33.680
 so this is the rating that I retire.

22:33.680 --> 22:37.120
 So it's still, you know, it's just, it's a top two, three.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.840
 So that's Caruana and Ding.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.600
 It's about the same rating now.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.440
 And I crossed 2800 in 1990.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.000
 Well, just you look at the inflation.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.440
 When I crossed 2800 in 1990,

22:47.440 --> 22:49.720
 there was only one player in 2700 category,

22:49.720 --> 22:50.720
 and not only Karpov.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.240
 Now we had more than 50.

22:52.240 --> 22:55.160
 So just, when you see this, so if you add inflation,

22:55.160 --> 22:58.160
 so I think my 2851, it could probably,

22:58.160 --> 23:02.160
 could be more valuable as Magnus 2882,

23:02.160 --> 23:04.240
 which was his highest rating.

23:04.240 --> 23:07.080
 But anyway, again, too many hypotheticals.

23:07.080 --> 23:10.960
 You're lost to IBM Deep Blue in 1997.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.440
 In my eyes, that is one of the most seminal moments

23:13.440 --> 23:15.040
 in the history.

23:15.040 --> 23:18.560
 Again, I apologize for being romanticizing the notion,

23:18.560 --> 23:20.520
 but in the history of our civilization,

23:20.520 --> 23:25.280
 because humans, as the civilizations,

23:25.280 --> 23:27.200
 for centuries saw chess as, you know,

23:27.200 --> 23:29.360
 the peak of what man can accomplish

23:29.360 --> 23:31.720
 of intellectual mastery, right?

23:31.720 --> 23:36.600
 And that moment when a machine could beat a human being

23:36.600 --> 23:40.240
 was inspiring to just an entire,

23:40.240 --> 23:43.360
 anyone who cares about science, innovation,

23:43.360 --> 23:46.280
 an entire generation of AI researchers.

23:46.280 --> 23:50.800
 And yet, to you that loss, at least if reading your face,

23:50.800 --> 23:53.640
 was, seemed like a tragedy, extremely painful.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.560
 Like you said, physically painful.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.560
 Why?

23:56.560 --> 23:59.720
 When you look back at your psychology of that loss,

23:59.720 --> 24:01.240
 why was it so painful?

24:01.240 --> 24:05.640
 Were you not able to see the seminal nature of that moment?

24:07.240 --> 24:10.240
 Or was that exactly why it was that painful?

24:10.240 --> 24:15.240
 As I already said, losing was painful, physically painful.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.960
 And the match I lost in 1997

24:18.960 --> 24:22.000
 was not the first match I lost to a machine.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.720
 It was the first match I lost, period.

24:23.720 --> 24:24.560
 Yeah.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.400
 That's...

24:27.120 --> 24:28.440
 Oh, wow.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.280
 So...

24:29.280 --> 24:30.400
 Oh, wow.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.800
 Yeah, it's...

24:31.800 --> 24:32.640
 Right.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.840
 Yeah, that makes all the difference to me.

24:35.840 --> 24:36.680
 Yes.

24:36.680 --> 24:38.360
 First time I lost, it's just...

24:38.360 --> 24:42.360
 Now, I lost, and the reason I was so angry

24:42.360 --> 24:46.120
 that I just, you know, I had suspicions

24:46.120 --> 24:49.160
 that my loss was not just a result of my bad play.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.000
 Yes.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.520
 So though I played quite poorly, you know,

24:51.520 --> 24:53.240
 just when you started looking at the games today,

24:53.240 --> 24:54.880
 I made tons of mistakes.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.760
 But, you know, I had all reasons to believe that,

24:57.760 --> 25:00.160
 you know, there were other factors

25:00.160 --> 25:01.720
 that had nothing to do with the game of chess.

25:01.720 --> 25:02.920
 And that's why I was angry.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.440
 But look, it was 22 years ago.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.200
 It's water under the bridge.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.920
 We can analyze this match,

25:08.920 --> 25:10.640
 and this is with everything you said.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.280
 I agree with probably one exception,

25:13.280 --> 25:16.360
 is that considering chess, you know,

25:16.360 --> 25:20.200
 as the sort of, as a pinnacle of intellectual activities,

25:20.200 --> 25:21.320
 was our mistake.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.960
 Because, you know, we just thought,

25:22.960 --> 25:25.680
 oh, it's a game of the highest intellect,

25:25.680 --> 25:27.480
 and it's just, you know, you have to be so,

25:27.480 --> 25:29.560
 you know, intelligent, and you could see things

25:29.560 --> 25:34.560
 that, you know, the ordinary mortals could not see.

25:34.560 --> 25:39.560
 It's a game, and all machines had to do with this game

25:40.080 --> 25:43.040
 is just to make fewer mistakes, not to solve the game.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.600
 Because the game cannot be solved.

25:44.600 --> 25:45.760
 I mean, according to Kovalevich Shannon,

25:45.760 --> 25:49.040
 the number of legal moves is 10 to the 46th power.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.680
 Too many zeros, so just for any computer

25:51.680 --> 25:56.680
 to finish the job, you know, in next few billion years.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.120
 But it doesn't have to.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.480
 It's all about making fewer mistakes.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.560
 And I think that's the, this match,

26:03.560 --> 26:06.000
 this match actually, and what's happened afterwards

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
 with other games, with Go, with Shoggy, with video games.

26:12.640 --> 26:17.320
 It's a demonstration that machines will always be humans

26:17.320 --> 26:19.360
 in what I call closed systems.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.000
 The moment you build a closed system,

26:22.000 --> 26:26.040
 no matter how the system's called, chess, Go, Shoggy,

26:26.040 --> 26:31.040
 Dota, machines will prevail simply because they will

26:31.040 --> 26:34.800
 bring down a number of mistakes.

26:34.800 --> 26:38.320
 Machines don't have to solve it, they just have to,

26:38.320 --> 26:41.080
 the way they outplay us, it's not by just being

26:41.080 --> 26:45.040
 more intelligent, it's just by doing something else,

26:45.040 --> 26:48.720
 but eventually it's just, it's capitalizing on our mistakes.

26:48.720 --> 26:51.760
 When you look at the chess machines ratings today,

26:51.760 --> 26:54.280
 and compare this to Magnus Carlsen,

26:54.280 --> 26:57.160
 it's the same as comparing Ferrari to Usain Bolt.

26:57.160 --> 27:01.160
 It's the, the gap is, I mean, by chess standards,

27:01.160 --> 27:06.160
 is insane, 34, 3500 to 2800, 2850 on Magnus.

27:06.400 --> 27:09.880
 It's like difference between Magnus and an ordinary player

27:09.880 --> 27:11.800
 from an open international tournament.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.200
 It's not because machine understanding

27:15.200 --> 27:17.040
 is better than Magnus Carlsen,

27:17.040 --> 27:19.320
 but simply because it's steady.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.480
 Machine has steady hand.

27:21.480 --> 27:24.920
 And I think that is what we, we, we,

27:24.920 --> 27:28.920
 we have to learn from 1997 experience,

27:28.920 --> 27:31.680
 and from further encounters with computers,

27:31.680 --> 27:36.120
 and sort of the current state of affairs with AlphaZero,

27:36.120 --> 27:38.320
 beating other machines.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.880
 The idea that we can compete with computers

27:41.880 --> 27:43.680
 in so called intellectual fields,

27:44.800 --> 27:47.400
 it was wrong from the very beginning.

27:47.400 --> 27:50.240
 It's just, it's, by the way, the 1997 match

27:50.240 --> 27:54.680
 was not the first victory of machines over AlphaZero.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.680
 Or grandmasters.

27:56.680 --> 27:57.640
 Or grandmasters.

27:57.640 --> 28:00.720
 No, actually it's, I played against

28:00.720 --> 28:04.120
 first decent chess computers from late, from late 80s.

28:04.120 --> 28:07.200
 So I played with the prototype of Deep Blue

28:07.200 --> 28:09.280
 called Deep Thought in 1989,

28:09.280 --> 28:10.600
 two rapid chess games in New York,

28:10.600 --> 28:13.120
 I won handily to both games.

28:13.120 --> 28:17.240
 We played against new chess engines like Fritz,

28:17.240 --> 28:18.800
 and other programs.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.320
 And then it's the, it was Israeli program Junior

28:21.320 --> 28:23.240
 that appeared in 1995.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.440
 Yeah, so there were, there were several programs.

28:25.440 --> 28:28.240
 I, you know, I lost few games in Blitz.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.160
 I lost one match against the computer chess engine

28:31.160 --> 28:33.120
 1994 rapid chess.

28:33.120 --> 28:36.120
 So I lost one game to Deep Blue in 1996 match,

28:36.120 --> 28:38.160
 the man, the match I won.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.000
 Some people, you know, tend to forget about it

28:40.000 --> 28:41.360
 that I won the first match.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.280
 Yes.

28:42.280 --> 28:44.520
 But it's, it's, we,

28:45.520 --> 28:48.280
 we made a very important psychological mistake

28:48.280 --> 28:51.120
 thinking that the reason we lost Blitz matches,

28:51.120 --> 28:52.440
 five, five minutes games.

28:52.440 --> 28:55.440
 The reason we lost some of the rapid chess matches,

28:55.440 --> 28:56.560
 25 minutes chess.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.200
 Because we didn't have enough time.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.040
 If you play a longer match,

29:00.040 --> 29:02.080
 we will not make the same mistakes.

29:02.080 --> 29:02.960
 Nonsense.

29:02.960 --> 29:05.120
 So this, yeah, we had more time,

29:05.120 --> 29:06.160
 but we still make mistakes.

29:06.160 --> 29:07.600
 And machine also has more time.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.120
 And machines, machine will always, you know,

29:10.120 --> 29:13.080
 will always be steady and consistent

29:13.080 --> 29:18.080
 compared to humans instabilities and inconsistencies.

29:18.120 --> 29:20.800
 And today we are at the point where yes,

29:20.800 --> 29:23.320
 nobody talks about, you know,

29:23.320 --> 29:24.560
 humans playing as machines.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.600
 Now machines can offer handicap to top players

29:27.600 --> 29:31.280
 and still, you know, will, will, will be favored.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.320
 I think we're just learning that it's, it's,

29:33.320 --> 29:35.400
 it's no longer human versus machines.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.880
 It's about human working with machines.

29:37.880 --> 29:41.760
 That's what I recognized in 1998,

29:41.760 --> 29:44.000
 just after leaking my wounds and spending one year

29:44.000 --> 29:46.080
 in just, you know, ruminating so the,

29:46.080 --> 29:48.400
 so what's happened in this match.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.840
 And I knew that though we still could play

29:50.840 --> 29:51.680
 against the machines.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.960
 I had two more matches in, in 2003,

29:53.960 --> 29:56.640
 playing both Deep Fritz and Deep Junior.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.560
 Both matches ended as a tie.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.920
 Though these machines were not weaker,

30:01.920 --> 30:05.000
 at least actually probably stronger than Deep Blue.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.800
 And by the way, today chess app on your mobile phone

30:08.800 --> 30:10.520
 is probably stronger than Deep Blue.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.440
 I'm not speaking about chess engines

30:12.440 --> 30:13.920
 that are so much superior.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.360
 And by the way, when you analyze games

30:16.360 --> 30:19.240
 we played against Deep Blue in 1997 on your chess engine,

30:19.240 --> 30:20.600
 they'll be laughing.

30:20.600 --> 30:23.240
 So this is, and it's also shows that's how chess changed

30:23.240 --> 30:26.760
 because chess commentators, they look at some of our games

30:26.760 --> 30:29.360
 like game four, game five, brilliant idea.

30:29.360 --> 30:34.360
 Now you ask Stockfish, you ask Houdini,

30:35.200 --> 30:37.600
 you ask Commodore, all the leading chess engines.

30:37.600 --> 30:40.160
 Within 30 seconds, they will show you how many mistakes

30:40.160 --> 30:43.880
 both Gary and Deep Blue made in the game

30:43.880 --> 30:48.880
 that was trumpeted as the, as a great chess match in 1997.

30:50.920 --> 30:51.760
 Well, okay.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.000
 So you've made an interesting,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.400
 if you can untangle that comment.

30:56.400 --> 31:01.040
 So now in retrospect, it was a mistake to see chess

31:01.040 --> 31:03.520
 as the peak of human intellect.

31:03.520 --> 31:06.640
 Nevertheless, that was done for centuries.

31:06.640 --> 31:10.320
 So by the way, in Europe, because you know,

31:10.320 --> 31:13.240
 you move to the far East, they will go,

31:13.240 --> 31:14.600
 they had show games.

31:14.600 --> 31:15.440
 But games, games.

31:15.440 --> 31:20.040
 Again, some of the games like, you know, board games.

31:20.040 --> 31:20.880
 Yes.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.000
 Yeah, I agree.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.400
 So if I push back a little bit, so now you say that,

31:26.400 --> 31:29.200
 okay, but it was a mistake to see chess as the epitome

31:29.200 --> 31:32.280
 and now, and then now there's other things maybe

31:32.280 --> 31:34.880
 like language, that conversation,

31:34.880 --> 31:36.840
 like some of the things that in your view

31:36.840 --> 31:40.840
 is still way out of reach of computers, but inside humans.

31:40.840 --> 31:44.320
 Do you think, can you talk about what those things might be?

31:44.320 --> 31:47.680
 And do you think just like chess, they might fall?

31:48.880 --> 31:51.000
 Soon with the same set of approaches,

31:51.000 --> 31:52.920
 if you look at AlphaZero,

31:52.920 --> 31:55.240
 the same kind of learning approaches

31:55.240 --> 31:57.400
 as the machines grow in size.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.280
 No, no, it's not about growing in size.

31:59.280 --> 32:02.360
 It's about, again, it's about understanding the difference

32:02.360 --> 32:05.240
 between closed system and open ended system.

32:05.240 --> 32:06.880
 So you think that key difference,

32:06.880 --> 32:11.000
 so the board games are closed in terms of the rule set,

32:11.000 --> 32:15.920
 the actions, the state space, everything is just constrained.

32:15.920 --> 32:19.800
 You think once you open it, the machines are lost?

32:19.800 --> 32:22.920
 Not lost, but again, the effectiveness is very different

32:22.920 --> 32:25.600
 because machine does not understand the moment

32:25.600 --> 32:28.520
 it's reaching territory of diminishing returns.

32:28.520 --> 32:32.480
 It's the, to put it in a different way,

32:32.480 --> 32:35.880
 machine doesn't know how to ask right questions.

32:35.880 --> 32:38.200
 It can ask questions, but it will never tell you

32:38.200 --> 32:39.440
 which questions are relevant.

32:39.440 --> 32:41.200
 So there's the, it's like about the, it's the,

32:41.200 --> 32:42.360
 it's a direction.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.080
 So these, it's, I think it's in human machine relations,

32:45.080 --> 32:48.320
 we have to consider, so our role and people,

32:48.320 --> 32:50.280
 many people feel uncomfortable that this,

32:50.280 --> 32:54.320
 the territory that belongs to us is shrinking.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.640
 I'm saying, so what, you know, this is,

32:57.640 --> 33:00.720
 eventually we'll belong to the last few decimal points,

33:00.720 --> 33:05.480
 but it's like having, so a very powerful gun,

33:05.480 --> 33:09.840
 that's, and all you can do there is slightly,

33:09.840 --> 33:11.640
 you know, alter direction of the bullet.

33:11.640 --> 33:16.160
 Maybe, you know, 0.1 degree of this angle,

33:16.160 --> 33:21.080
 but that means a mile away, 10 meters of target.

33:21.080 --> 33:25.120
 So that's, we have to recognize that is a certain

33:25.120 --> 33:30.120
 unique human qualities that machines in a foreseeable future

33:30.200 --> 33:33.000
 will not be able to reproduce.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.880
 And the effectiveness of this cooperation,

33:35.880 --> 33:38.280
 collaboration depends on our understanding

33:38.280 --> 33:40.400
 what exactly we can bring into the game.

33:40.400 --> 33:43.840
 So the greatest danger is when we try to interfere

33:43.840 --> 33:45.600
 with machine superior knowledge.

33:45.600 --> 33:48.560
 So that's why I always say that sometimes you'd rather have,

33:48.560 --> 33:51.640
 by reading these pictures in radiology,

33:51.640 --> 33:55.440
 you may probably prefer an experienced nurse

33:55.440 --> 33:57.640
 than rather than having top professor,

33:57.640 --> 34:00.600
 because she will not try to interfere

34:00.600 --> 34:02.200
 with machines understanding.

34:02.200 --> 34:05.000
 So it's very important to know that if machines knows

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
 how to do better things in 95%, 96% of territory,

34:09.000 --> 34:11.360
 we should not touch it because it's happened.

34:11.360 --> 34:15.400
 It's like in chess, recognize they do it better.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.160
 See where we can make the difference.

34:17.160 --> 34:20.320
 You mentioned AlphaZero, I mean, AlphaZero is,

34:20.320 --> 34:24.200
 it's actually a first step into what you may call AI,

34:24.200 --> 34:26.800
 because everything that's being called AI today,

34:26.800 --> 34:30.840
 it's just, it's one or another variation

34:30.840 --> 34:34.000
 of what Claude Shannon characterized as a brute force.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.680
 It's a type A machine, whether it's Deep Blue,

34:36.680 --> 34:41.480
 whether it's Watson, and all these modern technologies

34:41.480 --> 34:45.320
 that are being trumpeted as AI, it's still brute force.

34:45.320 --> 34:48.760
 It's the, all they do, it's they do optimization.

34:48.760 --> 34:52.560
 It's this, they are, you know, they keep, you know,

34:52.560 --> 34:56.920
 improving the way to process human generated data.

34:56.920 --> 35:01.920
 Now, AlphaZero is the first step towards, you know,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.840
 machine produced knowledge.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.880
 Which is, by the way, it's quite ironic

35:06.880 --> 35:10.400
 that the first company that championed that was IBM.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.560
 Oh, it's in backgammon.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.400
 Interesting, in backgammon.

35:15.400 --> 35:19.640
 Yes, you should look at IBM, it's a newer gammon.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.040
 It's the scientist called Cesaro.

35:22.040 --> 35:23.520
 He's still working at IBM.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.520
 They had it in the early 90s.

35:25.520 --> 35:29.360
 It's the program that played, you know, the AlphaZero type,

35:29.360 --> 35:31.720
 so just trying to come up with own strategies.

35:31.720 --> 35:34.360
 But because of success of Deep Blue,

35:34.360 --> 35:36.720
 this project had been not abandoned,

35:36.720 --> 35:40.000
 but just, you know, it was put on hold.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.520
 And now we just, you know, it's, you know,

35:42.520 --> 35:44.520
 everybody talks about this,

35:44.520 --> 35:48.480
 the machines generated knowledge, so as revolutionary.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.400
 And it is, but there's still, you know,

35:51.400 --> 35:54.120
 many open ended questions.

35:54.120 --> 35:58.160
 Yes, AlphaZero generates its own data.

35:58.160 --> 36:00.800
 Many ideas that AlphaZero generated in chess

36:00.800 --> 36:02.200
 were quite intriguing.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.640
 So I looked at these games with,

36:06.040 --> 36:08.160
 not just with interest, but with, you know,

36:08.160 --> 36:11.360
 it was quite exciting to learn how machine

36:11.360 --> 36:13.880
 could actually, you know, juggle all the pieces

36:13.880 --> 36:17.400
 and just play positions with a broken material balance,

36:17.400 --> 36:20.480
 sacrificing material, always being ahead of other programs,

36:20.480 --> 36:22.040
 you know, one or two moves ahead

36:22.040 --> 36:24.840
 by foreseeing the consequences,

36:24.840 --> 36:27.440
 not overcalculating because machines,

36:27.440 --> 36:30.280
 other machines were at least as powerful in calculating,

36:30.280 --> 36:33.200
 but it's having this unique knowledge

36:33.200 --> 36:37.240
 based on discovered patterns after playing 60 million games.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.680
 Almost something that feels like intuition.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.400
 Exactly, but there's one problem.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.240
 Yeah.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.800
 Now, the simple question,

36:44.800 --> 36:47.640
 if AlphaZero faces superior point,

36:47.640 --> 36:52.640
 let's say another powerful computer accompanied by a human

36:53.760 --> 36:56.240
 who could help just to discover certain problems,

36:56.240 --> 36:58.720
 because I already, I look at many AlphaZero games.

36:58.720 --> 37:00.280
 I visited their lab, you know,

37:00.280 --> 37:01.840
 spoke to Demis Hassabis and his team,

37:01.840 --> 37:04.200
 and I know there's certain weaknesses there.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.680
 Now, if these weaknesses are exposed,

37:05.680 --> 37:07.680
 the question is how many games will it take

37:07.680 --> 37:09.560
 for AlphaZero to correct it?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.560
 The answer is hundreds of thousands.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.320
 Even if it keeps losing, it can,

37:13.320 --> 37:16.400
 it's just because the whole system is based.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.160
 So it's now, imagine so this is,

37:19.160 --> 37:21.680
 you can have a human by just making a few tweaks.

37:21.680 --> 37:24.520
 So humans are still more flexible.

37:24.520 --> 37:28.360
 And as long as we recognize what is our role,

37:28.360 --> 37:30.720
 where we can play sort of,

37:30.720 --> 37:34.280
 so the most valuable part in this collaboration.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.960
 So it's, it will help us to understand

37:36.960 --> 37:40.440
 what are the next steps in human machine collaboration.

37:40.440 --> 37:41.280
 Beautifully put.

37:41.280 --> 37:43.240
 So let's talk about the thing that machines

37:43.240 --> 37:46.120
 certainly don't know how to do yet, which is morality.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.480
 Machines and morality.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.760
 It's another question that, you know,

37:48.760 --> 37:51.560
 just it's being asked all the time these days.

37:51.560 --> 37:54.280
 And I think it's another phantom

37:54.280 --> 37:57.320
 that is haunting a general public

37:57.320 --> 37:59.280
 because it's just being fed with this,

37:59.280 --> 38:03.600
 you know, illusions is that how can we avoid machines,

38:03.600 --> 38:07.640
 you know, having bias, being prejudiced?

38:07.640 --> 38:10.480
 You cannot, because it's like looking in the mirror

38:10.480 --> 38:12.080
 and complaining about what you see.

38:12.080 --> 38:14.760
 If you have certain bias in the society,

38:14.760 --> 38:17.440
 machine will just follow it.

38:17.440 --> 38:19.760
 It's just, it's, you know, you look at the mirror,

38:19.760 --> 38:20.960
 you don't like what you see there.

38:20.960 --> 38:23.680
 You can, you know, you can break it.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.480
 You can try to distort it.

38:25.480 --> 38:27.960
 Or you can try to actually change something.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.400
 Just by yourself.

38:29.400 --> 38:30.360
 By yourself, yes.

38:30.360 --> 38:31.880
 So it's very important to understand

38:31.880 --> 38:33.640
 is that you cannot expect machines

38:33.640 --> 38:37.280
 to improve the ills of our society.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.680
 And moreover machines will simply, you know,

38:39.680 --> 38:41.240
 just, you know, amplify it.

38:41.240 --> 38:42.120
 Yes. Yeah.

38:42.120 --> 38:45.600
 But the thing is people are more comfortable

38:45.600 --> 38:50.600
 with other people doing injustice, with being biased.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.440
 We're not comfortable with machines

38:52.440 --> 38:54.280
 having the same kind of bias.

38:54.280 --> 38:58.040
 So that's an interesting standard

38:58.040 --> 38:59.320
 that we place on machines.

38:59.320 --> 39:01.960
 With autonomous vehicles, they have to be much safer.

39:01.960 --> 39:04.080
 With automated systems.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.200
 Of course they're much safer.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.120
 Statistically, they're much safer than.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.560
 It's not of course.

39:08.560 --> 39:10.720
 Why would, it's not of course.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.680
 It's not given.

39:13.720 --> 39:16.400
 Autonomous vehicles, you have to work really hard

39:16.400 --> 39:19.080
 to make them safer.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.760
 I think it just, it goes without saying

39:22.760 --> 39:25.600
 is the outcome of this,

39:25.600 --> 39:29.040
 I would call it competition with comparison is very clear.

39:29.040 --> 39:32.320
 But the problem is not about being, you know, safer.

39:32.320 --> 39:36.200
 It's the 40,000 people or so every year died

39:36.200 --> 39:38.280
 in car accidents in the United States.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.120
 And it's statistics.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.680
 One accident with autonomous vehicle

39:42.680 --> 39:43.920
 and it's front page of a newspaper.

39:43.920 --> 39:44.760
 Yes.

39:44.760 --> 39:47.240
 So it's, again, it's about psychology.

39:47.240 --> 39:49.400
 So it's while people, you know,

39:49.400 --> 39:50.600
 kill each other in car accidents

39:50.600 --> 39:52.680
 because they make mistakes, they make more mistakes.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.400
 For me, it's not a question.

39:54.400 --> 39:57.040
 Of course we make more mistakes because we're human.

39:57.040 --> 39:58.520
 Yes, machines are old.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.360
 And by the way, no machine will ever reach 100% perfection.

40:01.360 --> 40:04.000
 That's another important fake story

40:04.000 --> 40:05.840
 that is being fed to the public.

40:05.840 --> 40:09.040
 If machine doesn't reach 100% performance, it's not safe.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.640
 No, all you can ask any computer,

40:11.640 --> 40:13.560
 whether it's, you know, playing chess

40:13.560 --> 40:16.280
 or doing the stock market calculations

40:16.280 --> 40:18.640
 or driving your autonomous vehicle,

40:18.640 --> 40:21.200
 it's to make fewer mistakes.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.160
 And yes, I know it's not, you know,

40:23.160 --> 40:25.600
 it's not easy for us to accept because ah,

40:25.600 --> 40:28.200
 if, you know, if you have two humans, you know,

40:28.200 --> 40:31.280
 colliding in their cars, okay, it's like,

40:31.280 --> 40:34.120
 if one of these cars is autonomous vehicle,

40:34.120 --> 40:37.320
 and by the way, even if it's humans fault, terrible.

40:37.320 --> 40:40.560
 How could you allow a machine to run

40:40.560 --> 40:42.600
 without a driver at the wheel?

40:42.600 --> 40:45.160
 So, you know, let's linger that for a second,

40:45.160 --> 40:48.040
 that double standard, the way you felt

40:48.040 --> 40:51.560
 with your first loss against Deep Blue,

40:51.560 --> 40:54.400
 were you treating the machine differently

40:54.400 --> 40:56.560
 than you would have a human?

40:56.560 --> 40:58.640
 Or, so what do you think about that difference

40:58.640 --> 41:02.120
 between the way we see machines and humans?

41:02.120 --> 41:04.240
 No, it's the, at that time, you know, for me it was a match.

41:04.240 --> 41:06.480
 And that's why I was angry because I believed that

41:06.480 --> 41:08.840
 the match was not, you know, fairly organized.

41:08.840 --> 41:12.960
 So it's, definitely there were unfair advantages for IBM

41:12.960 --> 41:16.840
 and I wanted to play another match, like a rubber match.

41:16.840 --> 41:20.600
 So your anger or displeasure was aimed more like

41:20.600 --> 41:24.520
 at the humans behind IBM versus the actual pure algorithm.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.760
 Absolutely, look, I knew at the time,

41:26.760 --> 41:29.040
 and by the way, I was, objectively speaking,

41:29.040 --> 41:30.280
 I was stronger at that time.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.480
 So that probably added to my anger

41:32.480 --> 41:34.000
 because I knew I could beat the machine.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.560
 Yeah. Yeah, so that's, and that's the,

41:35.560 --> 41:38.040
 and as I lost, and I knew I was not well prepared.

41:38.040 --> 41:39.920
 So because they, I have to give them credit.

41:39.920 --> 41:43.560
 They did some good work from 1996 and I,

41:43.560 --> 41:45.240
 but I still could beat the machine.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.000
 So I made too many mistakes.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.440
 Also, this is the whole, it's this,

41:48.440 --> 41:49.800
 the publicity around the match.

41:49.800 --> 41:53.160
 So I underestimated the effect, you know, just it's,

41:53.160 --> 41:56.680
 and being called the, you know, the brain's last stand,

41:56.680 --> 41:59.280
 you know, okay, no pressure.

42:02.160 --> 42:04.000
 Okay, well, let me ask.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.840
 So I was born also in the Soviet Union.

42:06.840 --> 42:09.240
 What lessons do you draw from the rise and fall

42:09.240 --> 42:11.440
 of the Soviet Union in the 20th century?

42:11.440 --> 42:15.240
 When you just look at this nation

42:15.240 --> 42:19.440
 that is now pushing forward into what Russia is,

42:19.440 --> 42:22.920
 if you look at the long arc of history of the 20th century,

42:22.920 --> 42:25.440
 what do we take away?

42:27.000 --> 42:28.800
 What do we take away from that?

42:28.800 --> 42:35.320
 I think the lesson of history is clear.

42:35.320 --> 42:38.560
 Undemocratic systems, totalitarian regimes,

42:38.560 --> 42:42.800
 systems that are based on controlling their citizens

42:42.800 --> 42:46.000
 and just every aspect of their life,

42:46.000 --> 42:52.640
 not offering opportunities to, for private initiative,

42:52.640 --> 42:55.080
 central planning systems, they're doomed.

42:55.080 --> 42:59.480
 They just, you know, they cannot be driving force

42:59.480 --> 43:02.560
 for innovation, so they, in the history timeline,

43:02.560 --> 43:06.200
 I mean, they could cause certain, you know,

43:06.200 --> 43:11.360
 distortion of the concept of progress.

43:11.360 --> 43:13.200
 They, by the way, they may call themselves progressive,

43:13.200 --> 43:17.240
 but we know that the damage that they caused to humanity

43:17.240 --> 43:19.760
 is just, it's yet to be measured.

43:19.760 --> 43:22.200
 But at the end of the day, they fail.

43:22.200 --> 43:26.640
 They fail, and the end of the Cold War was a great triumph

43:26.640 --> 43:28.320
 of the free world.

43:28.320 --> 43:30.080
 It's not that the free world is perfect.

43:30.080 --> 43:32.840
 It's very important to recognize the fact that,

43:32.840 --> 43:34.280
 I always like to mention, you know,

43:34.280 --> 43:36.560
 one of my favorite books, The Lord of the Rings,

43:36.560 --> 43:42.080
 that there's no absolute good, but there is an absolute evil.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.960
 Good, you know, comes in many forms,

43:43.960 --> 43:47.200
 but we all, you know, it's being humans

43:47.200 --> 43:49.640
 or being even, you know, humans from fairy tales

43:49.640 --> 43:52.160
 or just some sort of mythical creatures.

43:52.160 --> 43:57.160
 It's the, you can always find spots on the songs.

43:57.480 --> 44:01.280
 So this is conducting war and just,

44:01.280 --> 44:03.280
 and fighting for justice.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.800
 There are always things that, you know,

44:04.800 --> 44:06.440
 can be easily criticized.

44:06.440 --> 44:08.120
 And human history is the,

44:08.120 --> 44:11.000
 is a never ending quest for perfection.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.200
 But we know that there is absolute evil.

44:13.200 --> 44:16.120
 We know it's, for me, it's no clear, it's, I mean,

44:16.120 --> 44:18.680
 nobody argues about Hitler being absolute evil,

44:18.680 --> 44:19.840
 but I think it's very important to recognize

44:19.840 --> 44:21.240
 Stalin was absolute evil.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.280
 Communism caused more damage

44:23.280 --> 44:26.360
 than any other ideology in the 20th century.

44:26.360 --> 44:28.400
 And unfortunately, while we all know

44:28.400 --> 44:30.400
 that fascism was condemned,

44:30.400 --> 44:32.160
 but there was no Nuremberg for communism.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.600
 And that's why we could see, you know,

44:33.600 --> 44:36.840
 still the successors of Stalin

44:36.840 --> 44:39.080
 are feeling far more comfortable.

44:39.080 --> 44:40.880
 And Putin is one of them.

44:40.880 --> 44:43.280
 You highlight a few interesting connections actually

44:43.280 --> 44:45.040
 between Stalin and Hitler.

44:45.040 --> 44:49.520
 I mean, in terms of the adjusting

44:49.520 --> 44:53.240
 or clarifying the history of World War II,

44:53.240 --> 44:54.080
 which is very interesting.

44:54.080 --> 44:55.320
 Of course, we don't have time.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.160
 So let me ask.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.000
 You can ask, you know,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.960
 I just recently delivered a speech in Toronto

44:59.960 --> 45:02.400
 at 80th anniversary of Molotov Ribbentrop Pact.

45:02.400 --> 45:03.880
 It's something that I believe, you know,

45:03.880 --> 45:07.040
 just, you know, has, must be taught in the schools

45:07.040 --> 45:11.560
 that the World War II had been started by two dictators

45:11.560 --> 45:15.440
 by signing these criminal treaty,

45:15.440 --> 45:19.160
 collusion of two tyrants in August 1939

45:19.160 --> 45:21.280
 that led to the beginning of the World War II.

45:21.280 --> 45:24.200
 And the fact is that eventually Stalin had no choice

45:24.200 --> 45:27.600
 but to join allies because Hitler attacked him.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.960
 So it just doesn't, you know,

45:29.960 --> 45:33.320
 eliminate the fact that Stalin helped Hitler

45:33.320 --> 45:34.360
 to start World War II.

45:34.360 --> 45:37.840
 And he was one of the beneficiaries at early stage

45:37.840 --> 45:40.480
 by annexing a part of Eastern Europe.

45:40.480 --> 45:42.080
 And as a result of the World War II,

45:42.080 --> 45:44.560
 he annexed almost entire Eastern Europe.

45:44.560 --> 45:46.440
 And for many Eastern European nations,

45:46.440 --> 45:47.760
 the end of the World War II

45:47.760 --> 45:50.520
 was the beginning of communist occupation.

45:50.520 --> 45:55.520
 So Putin, you've talked about as a man who stands

45:56.560 --> 46:00.440
 between Russia and democracy, essentially today.

46:00.440 --> 46:04.280
 You've been a strong opponent and critic of Putin.

46:04.280 --> 46:07.840
 Let me ask again, how much does fear

46:07.840 --> 46:09.320
 enter your mind and heart?

46:09.320 --> 46:12.720
 So in 2007, there's this interesting comment

46:12.720 --> 46:17.720
 from Oleg Kalugin, KGB general.

46:17.960 --> 46:19.840
 He said that I do not talk details.

46:19.840 --> 46:21.880
 People who knew them are all dead now

46:21.880 --> 46:23.800
 because they were vocal.

46:23.800 --> 46:25.000
 I'm quiet.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.480
 There's only one man who's vocal and he may be in trouble.

46:28.480 --> 46:30.680
 World Chess champion Kasparov.

46:30.680 --> 46:33.640
 He has been very outspoken in his attacks on Putin.

46:33.640 --> 46:36.320
 And I believe he's probably next on the list.

46:36.320 --> 46:38.840
 So clearly your life has been

46:38.840 --> 46:40.920
 and perhaps continues to be in danger.

46:40.920 --> 46:45.520
 How do you think about having the views you have,

46:45.520 --> 46:48.280
 the ideas you have, being in opposition as you are

46:49.960 --> 46:53.880
 in this kind of context when your life could be in danger?

46:55.720 --> 46:58.080
 That's the reason I live in New York.

46:58.080 --> 47:00.200
 So it was not my first choice,

47:00.200 --> 47:01.960
 but I knew I had to leave Russia at one point.

47:01.960 --> 47:05.480
 And among other places, New York is the safest.

47:05.480 --> 47:07.040
 Is it safe?

47:07.040 --> 47:07.880
 No.

47:07.880 --> 47:11.280
 It's the, I know what happened,

47:11.280 --> 47:14.720
 what is happening with many of Putin's enemies.

47:14.720 --> 47:18.720
 But at the end of the day, I mean, what can I do?

47:18.720 --> 47:21.600
 I could be very proactive

47:21.600 --> 47:24.560
 by trying to change things I can influence.

47:24.560 --> 47:26.360
 But here are a few facts.

47:26.360 --> 47:30.560
 I cannot stop doing what I've been doing for a long time.

47:30.560 --> 47:32.480
 It's the right thing to do.

47:32.480 --> 47:36.280
 I grew up with my family teaching me

47:36.280 --> 47:38.080
 sort of the wisdom of Soviet dissidents,

47:38.080 --> 47:39.560
 do what you must and so be.

47:41.680 --> 47:44.920
 I could try to be cautious by not traveling

47:44.920 --> 47:49.600
 to certain places where my security could be at risk.

47:49.600 --> 47:51.200
 There are so many invitations to speak

47:51.200 --> 47:52.640
 at different locations in the world.

47:52.640 --> 47:57.440
 And I have to say that many countries are just now

47:57.440 --> 48:00.440
 are not destinations that I can afford to travel.

48:01.320 --> 48:02.680
 My mother still lives in Moscow.

48:02.680 --> 48:04.320
 I meet her a few times a year.

48:04.320 --> 48:07.320
 She was devastated when I had to leave Russia

48:07.320 --> 48:10.560
 because since my father died in 1971,

48:10.560 --> 48:14.080
 so she was 33 and she dedicated her entire life

48:14.080 --> 48:15.640
 to her only son.

48:15.640 --> 48:19.480
 But she recognized in just a year or so

48:19.480 --> 48:22.120
 since I left Russia that it was the only chance

48:22.120 --> 48:25.880
 for me to continue my normal life.

48:25.880 --> 48:29.560
 So just to, I mean, to be relatively safe

48:29.560 --> 48:34.560
 and to do what she taught me to do to make the difference.

48:35.880 --> 48:37.880
 Do you think you will ever return to Russia

48:37.880 --> 48:39.360
 or let me ask a different way?

48:39.360 --> 48:40.200
 When?

48:40.200 --> 48:41.640
 Even sooner than many people think

48:41.640 --> 48:43.080
 because I think Putin's regime

48:43.080 --> 48:46.640
 is facing unsurmountable difficulties.

48:46.640 --> 48:49.400
 And again, I read enough historical books

48:49.400 --> 48:54.400
 to know that dictatorships, they end suddenly.

48:54.400 --> 48:59.400
 It's just on Sunday, dictator feels comfortable.

49:01.120 --> 49:05.960
 He believes he's popular on Monday morning, he's bust.

49:05.960 --> 49:07.120
 The good news and bad news.

49:07.120 --> 49:09.720
 I mean, the bad news is that I don't know

49:09.720 --> 49:13.040
 when and how Putin rule ends.

49:13.040 --> 49:14.840
 The good news, he also doesn't know.

49:14.840 --> 49:19.280
 Okay, well put.

49:19.280 --> 49:24.280
 Let me ask a question that seems to preoccupy

49:24.880 --> 49:28.920
 the American mind from the perspective of Russia.

49:28.920 --> 49:33.920
 One, did Russia interfere in the 2016 U.S. election,

49:33.960 --> 49:37.920
 government sanction and future?

49:37.920 --> 49:41.840
 Two, will Russia interfere in the 2020 U.S. election?

49:42.880 --> 49:45.840
 And what does that interference look like?

49:45.840 --> 49:46.680
 It's very old.

49:46.680 --> 49:48.480
 We had such an intelligent conversation.

49:48.480 --> 49:51.880
 And you are ruining everything

49:51.880 --> 49:53.720
 by asking such a stupid question.

49:53.720 --> 49:58.720
 It's insulting for my intellect.

50:01.120 --> 50:03.480
 Of course they did interfere.

50:03.480 --> 50:05.720
 Of course they did absolutely everything to elect Trump.

50:05.720 --> 50:07.400
 I mean, they said it many times.

50:07.400 --> 50:11.320
 It is just, you know, I met enough KGB colonels in my life

50:11.320 --> 50:12.680
 to tell you that, you know,

50:12.680 --> 50:16.160
 just the way Putin looks at Trump, this is the way.

50:16.160 --> 50:18.600
 Look, and I don't have to hear what he says,

50:18.600 --> 50:20.360
 what Trump says, it just is,

50:20.360 --> 50:23.040
 I don't need to go through congressional investigations.

50:23.040 --> 50:24.800
 The way Putin looks at Trump

50:24.800 --> 50:28.440
 is the way the KGB officers looked at the assets.

50:28.440 --> 50:31.480
 It's just, and following to 2020,

50:31.480 --> 50:33.160
 of course they will do absolutely everything

50:33.160 --> 50:35.160
 to help Trump to survive.

50:35.160 --> 50:37.880
 Because I think the damage that Trump's reelections

50:37.880 --> 50:40.320
 could cause to America and to the free world,

50:40.320 --> 50:42.760
 it's just, it's beyond one's imagination.

50:42.760 --> 50:44.520
 I think basically if Trump is reelected,

50:44.520 --> 50:47.040
 he will ruin NATO, because he's already heading

50:47.040 --> 50:49.400
 in this direction, but now he's just,

50:49.400 --> 50:52.960
 he's still limited by the reelection hurdles.

50:56.920 --> 51:01.480
 If he's still in the office after November, 2020,

51:01.480 --> 51:05.960
 okay, January, 2021, I don't want to think about it.

51:05.960 --> 51:07.320
 My problem is not just Trump,

51:07.320 --> 51:09.520
 because Trump is basically, it's a symptom.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.960
 But the problem is that I don't see,

51:11.960 --> 51:16.240
 it's just, it's the, in American political horizon,

51:18.000 --> 51:19.920
 politicians who could take on Trump

51:22.040 --> 51:25.960
 for all damage that he's doing for the free world.

51:25.960 --> 51:27.400
 Not just things that has happened

51:27.400 --> 51:28.800
 that went wrong in America.

51:28.800 --> 51:30.920
 So there's the, it seems to me that the campaign,

51:30.920 --> 51:32.680
 political campaign on the Democratic side

51:32.680 --> 51:37.680
 is fixed on certain important, but still secondary issues.

51:37.800 --> 51:40.560
 Because when you have the foundation of the republic

51:40.560 --> 51:44.080
 in jeopardy, I mean, you cannot talk about healthcare.

51:44.080 --> 51:45.920
 I mean, I understand how important it is,

51:45.920 --> 51:48.680
 but it's still secondary because the entire framework

51:48.680 --> 51:50.680
 of American political life is at risk.

51:50.680 --> 51:53.320
 And you have Vladimir Putin just,

51:53.320 --> 51:56.160
 it's having, fortunately, free hands

51:56.160 --> 52:00.600
 by attacking America and other free countries.

52:00.600 --> 52:02.440
 And by the way, we have so much evidence

52:02.440 --> 52:04.400
 about Russian interference in Brexit,

52:04.400 --> 52:07.280
 in elections in almost every European country.

52:07.280 --> 52:11.080
 And thinking that they will be shy of attacking America

52:11.080 --> 52:15.520
 in 2020, now with Trump in the office, yeah.

52:15.520 --> 52:19.120
 I think it's, yeah, it definitely diminishes

52:19.120 --> 52:21.360
 the intellectual quality of our conversation.

52:21.360 --> 52:24.800
 I do what I can.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.000
 Last question.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.920
 If you can go back, just look at the entirety of your life,

52:28.920 --> 52:33.400
 you accomplished more than most humans will ever do.

52:33.400 --> 52:35.640
 If you could go back and relive a single moment

52:35.640 --> 52:38.680
 in your life, what would that moment be?

52:43.400 --> 52:46.280
 There are moments in my life when I think

52:46.280 --> 52:50.680
 about what could be done differently, but.

52:52.160 --> 52:56.680
 No, experience happiness and joy and pride.

52:56.680 --> 52:58.520
 Just a touch once again.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.280
 I know, I know, but it's the, it's the,

53:00.280 --> 53:01.760
 I made many mistakes in my life.

53:01.760 --> 53:05.480
 So I just, it's the, I know that at the end of the day,

53:05.480 --> 53:07.520
 it's, I believe in the butterfly effect.

53:07.520 --> 53:11.560
 So it's the, it's the, I knew moments where I could,

53:11.560 --> 53:16.560
 now if I'm there at that point in 89 and 93,

53:16.760 --> 53:20.840
 you pick up a year, I could improve my actions

53:20.840 --> 53:22.400
 by not doing this stupid thing.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.040
 But then how do you know

53:26.040 --> 53:27.880
 that I will have all other accomplishments?

53:27.880 --> 53:31.640
 I just, I'm, I'm afraid that, you know,

53:31.640 --> 53:34.840
 we just have to just follow this,

53:34.840 --> 53:36.720
 if you may call wisdom before is gump, you know,

53:36.720 --> 53:38.800
 it's the life is this, you know, it's, this is,

53:38.800 --> 53:41.520
 it's a box of, of, of, of chocolate

53:41.520 --> 53:42.760
 and you don't know what's inside,

53:42.760 --> 53:44.600
 but you have to go one by one.

53:44.600 --> 53:47.800
 So it's the, I'm, I'm happy with who I am

53:47.800 --> 53:49.000
 and where I am today.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.920
 And I am very proud, not only with my chess accomplishments,

53:52.920 --> 53:54.880
 but that I made this transition.

53:54.880 --> 53:56.520
 And since I left chess, you know,

53:56.520 --> 54:00.200
 I built my own reputation that had some influence

54:00.200 --> 54:03.240
 on the game of chess, but not, it's not, you know,

54:03.240 --> 54:06.640
 directly derived from, from, from the game.

54:06.640 --> 54:08.160
 I'm grateful for my wife.

54:08.160 --> 54:10.200
 So help me to build this life.

54:10.200 --> 54:11.600
 We actually married in 2005.

54:11.600 --> 54:12.600
 It was my third marriage.

54:12.600 --> 54:14.200
 That's why I said I'd made mistakes in my life.

54:14.200 --> 54:17.200
 But, and by the way, I'm close with two kids

54:17.200 --> 54:18.480
 from my previous marriages.

54:18.480 --> 54:20.240
 So that's, that's the, I'm, you know,

54:20.240 --> 54:23.800
 I managed to sort of to balance my life and,

54:23.800 --> 54:25.120
 and here in, I live in New York.

54:25.120 --> 54:28.040
 So we have our two kids born here in New York.

54:28.040 --> 54:31.640
 It's, it's new life and it's, you know, it's, it's busy.

54:31.640 --> 54:33.760
 Sometimes I wish I could, you know, I could limit

54:33.760 --> 54:37.520
 my engagement in many other things that are still,

54:37.520 --> 54:42.120
 you know, taking time and energy,

54:42.120 --> 54:44.880
 but life is exciting.

54:44.880 --> 54:48.760
 And as long as I can feel that I have energy,

54:48.760 --> 54:53.640
 I have strengths, I have passion to make the difference,

54:54.640 --> 54:55.480
 I'm happy.

54:56.760 --> 54:59.400
 I think that's a beautiful moment to end on.

54:59.400 --> 55:02.520
 Gary, thank you very much for talking today.

55:02.520 --> 55:29.520
 Thank you.
