00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
 The following is a conversation with Stephen Kotkin,

00:02.640 --> 00:04.720
 his second time on the podcast.

00:04.720 --> 00:08.080
 Stephen is one of the greatest historians of all time,

00:08.080 --> 00:11.320
 specializing in 20th and 21st century history

00:11.320 --> 00:13.680
 of Russia and Eastern Europe.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.000
 And he has written what is widely considered

00:16.000 --> 00:20.320
 to be the definitive biography of Stalin in three volumes,

00:20.320 --> 00:22.280
 two of which have been published.

00:22.280 --> 00:25.280
 And the third focused on World War II

00:25.280 --> 00:28.680
 and the years after he is in the midst of writing now.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.840
 This conversation includes a response

00:30.840 --> 00:33.680
 to my previous podcast episode with Oliver Stone

00:33.680 --> 00:37.160
 that was focused on Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine.

00:38.040 --> 00:41.200
 Stephen provides a hard hitting criticism of Putin

00:41.200 --> 00:43.440
 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

00:43.440 --> 00:45.760
 weighed and contextualized deeply

00:45.760 --> 00:49.480
 in the complex geopolitics and history of our world,

00:49.480 --> 00:52.560
 all with an intensity and rigor,

00:52.560 --> 00:55.600
 but also wit and humor that makes Stephen

00:55.600 --> 00:58.960
 one of my favorite human beings.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.840
 Please also allow me to mention something

01:02.840 --> 01:05.720
 that has been apparent and has weighed heavy

01:05.720 --> 01:07.320
 on my heart and mind.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.200
 This conversation with Stephen Kotkin

01:11.200 --> 01:13.800
 makes it more dangerous for me to travel in Russia.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.040
 The previous conversation with Oliver Stone

01:18.040 --> 01:21.000
 makes it more dangerous for me to travel in Ukraine.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.440
 This makes me sad, but it is the way of the world.

01:25.440 --> 01:29.880
 I will nevertheless travel to both Ukraine and Russia.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.800
 I need to once again see with my own eyes

01:33.800 --> 01:38.480
 the land of my ancestors, where they suffered but flourished

01:38.480 --> 01:41.760
 and eventually gave birth to say the old me.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.600
 I need to hear directly the pain, anger and hope

01:47.600 --> 01:51.320
 from both Ukrainians and Russians.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.120
 I won't give details to my travel plans

01:53.120 --> 01:55.200
 in terms of location and timing,

01:55.200 --> 01:57.840
 but the trip is very soon.

01:57.840 --> 02:02.840
 Whatever happens, I'm truly grateful for every day I'm alive

02:03.480 --> 02:05.400
 and I hope to spend each such day

02:05.400 --> 02:07.320
 adding a bit of love to the world.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.280
 I love you all.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.040
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

02:12.040 --> 02:17.040
 And now, dear friends, here's Stephen Kotkin.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.200
 You are one of the great historians of our time

02:20.200 --> 02:22.680
 specializing in the man, the leader,

02:22.680 --> 02:24.680
 the historical figure of Stalin.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.880
 So let me ask a challenging question.

02:27.760 --> 02:32.760
 If you can perhaps think about the echo of 80 years

02:34.760 --> 02:38.120
 between Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Putin,

02:38.120 --> 02:40.160
 what are the similarities and differences

02:40.160 --> 02:42.600
 between the man and the historical figure,

02:42.600 --> 02:45.080
 the historical trajectory of Stalin and Putin?

02:46.720 --> 02:47.560
 Thank you, Lex.

02:47.560 --> 02:50.200
 It's very nice to be here again with you.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.400
 It's been a while.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.240
 Good to see you.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.240
 Yeah, good to see you as well.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.520
 You're looking good.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.360
 You as well.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.160
 I see this podcast stuff is doing you right.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.480
 Yeah.

03:00.480 --> 03:05.000
 So we can't really put very easily Vladimir Putin

03:05.000 --> 03:07.240
 in the same sentence with Joseph Stalin.

03:07.240 --> 03:10.640
 Stalin is a singular figure

03:10.640 --> 03:14.000
 and his category is really small.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.440
 Hitler, Mao, that's really about it.

03:18.440 --> 03:22.760
 And even in that category, Stalin is the dominant figure,

03:22.760 --> 03:25.680
 both by how long he was in power

03:25.680 --> 03:27.680
 and also by the amount of power,

03:27.680 --> 03:30.280
 the military industrial complex he helped build

03:30.280 --> 03:31.120
 and commanded.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.560
 So Putin can't be compared to that.

03:34.560 --> 03:39.000
 However, Putin's in the same building as Stalin.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.240
 He uses some of the same offices as Stalin used.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.520
 On some of those television broadcasts

03:46.520 --> 03:48.480
 that we see of Putin at meetings

03:48.480 --> 03:50.800
 and Putin inside the Kremlin,

03:51.840 --> 03:53.640
 Stalin used to sit in those rooms

03:53.640 --> 03:55.400
 and hold meetings in those rooms.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.680
 That's the Imperial Senate

03:57.680 --> 04:01.160
 built by Catherine the Great in 18th century building.

04:01.160 --> 04:04.640
 Built by Catherine the Great in 18th century building

04:04.640 --> 04:05.840
 inside the Kremlin.

04:06.720 --> 04:11.720
 It's a dome building and you can see it on the panorama,

04:12.600 --> 04:13.440
 the top of the building,

04:13.440 --> 04:15.200
 at least you can see it on the panorama

04:15.200 --> 04:17.000
 when you look over the Kremlin wall

04:17.000 --> 04:20.240
 from many sites inside Moscow.

04:21.320 --> 04:26.120
 So if he's not comparable to Stalin,

04:26.120 --> 04:28.880
 he still works, as I said, in those same buildings,

04:28.880 --> 04:31.800
 those same offices, partly.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.800
 And so therefore, he's got some of the problems

04:34.800 --> 04:36.080
 that Stalin had,

04:36.080 --> 04:39.640
 which was managing Russian power in the world

04:39.640 --> 04:43.600
 from a position of weakness vis a vis the West,

04:43.600 --> 04:48.600
 but from an ambition, a grandiosity, in fact.

04:49.480 --> 04:54.480
 And so this combination of weakness and grandeur, right?

04:54.840 --> 04:56.960
 Of not being as strong as the West,

04:56.960 --> 05:01.360
 but aspiring to be as great or greater than the West.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.240
 That's the dilemma of Russian history

05:04.240 --> 05:06.200
 for the past many centuries.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.040
 It was the dilemma for the Tsars.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.720
 It was the dilemma for Peter the Great.

05:09.720 --> 05:12.120
 It was the dilemma for Alexander.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.480
 It was the dilemma for Stalin.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.800
 And it's the dilemma for Putin.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.960
 Russia is smaller now

05:18.960 --> 05:22.080
 compared to when Stalin was in that Kremlin.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.440
 It's got pushed back to borders

05:25.440 --> 05:28.000
 almost the time of Peter the Great.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.200
 It's farther from the main European capitals now

05:31.200 --> 05:34.160
 than any time since that 18th century.

05:35.320 --> 05:39.080
 And the West has only grown stronger

05:39.080 --> 05:40.160
 in that period of time.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.640
 So the dilemma is greater than ever.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.920
 The irony of being in that position,

05:46.920 --> 05:48.240
 of sitting in the Kremlin,

05:48.240 --> 05:50.680
 trying to manage Russian power in the world,

05:50.680 --> 05:53.680
 trying to be a providential power,

05:53.680 --> 05:57.080
 a country with a special mission in the world,

05:57.080 --> 06:01.360
 a country which imagines itself to be a whole civilization

06:01.360 --> 06:03.520
 and yet not having the capabilities

06:03.520 --> 06:05.880
 to meet those aspirations

06:05.880 --> 06:09.200
 and falling farther and farther behind the West.

06:09.200 --> 06:12.480
 The irony of all of that is the attempted solutions

06:13.560 --> 06:17.000
 put Russia in a worse place every single time.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.200
 So you try to manage the gap with the West.

06:20.200 --> 06:23.760
 You try to realize these aspirations.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.640
 You try to raise your capabilities

06:26.640 --> 06:28.360
 and you build a strong state.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.440
 The quest to build a strong state

06:30.440 --> 06:33.400
 and use coercive modernization

06:34.600 --> 06:38.400
 to try somehow, if not to close the gap with the West,

06:38.400 --> 06:39.640
 at least to manage it.

06:40.720 --> 06:45.720
 And the result is different versions of personalist rule.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.600
 So they don't build a strong state.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.520
 They build a personal dictatorship.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.040
 They build an autocracy.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.400
 And moreover, that autocracy undertakes measures

06:56.400 --> 07:00.400
 which then worsen the very geopolitical dilemma

07:00.400 --> 07:04.960
 that gave rise to this personalist rule in the first place.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.400
 And so I call this Russia's perpetual geopolitics.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.360
 I've been writing about this for many, many years.

07:11.360 --> 07:14.840
 What's important about this analysis

07:14.840 --> 07:19.840
 is this is not a story of eternal Russian

07:20.240 --> 07:24.560
 cultural proclivity to aggression, right?

07:24.560 --> 07:26.800
 It's not something that's in the mother's milk.

07:26.800 --> 07:30.280
 It's not something that can't be changed.

07:30.280 --> 07:33.320
 Russia doesn't have an innate

07:33.320 --> 07:35.840
 cultural tendency to aggression.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.000
 This is a choice.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.560
 It's a strategic choice

07:39.560 --> 07:42.480
 to try to match the power of the West,

07:42.480 --> 07:46.560
 which from Russia's vantage point is actually unmatchable,

07:46.560 --> 07:49.000
 but it's a choice that's made again and again.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.520
 And Putin has made this choice,

07:50.520 --> 07:52.920
 just as Stalin made the choice, right?

07:52.920 --> 07:56.480
 Stalin presided over the World War II victory,

07:56.480 --> 07:57.920
 and then he lost the peace.

07:59.240 --> 08:02.400
 After he died in 1953,

08:02.400 --> 08:06.680
 there was, of course, other rulers who succeeded him.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.440
 He was still the most important person in the country

08:09.440 --> 08:11.080
 after he died,

08:11.080 --> 08:13.040
 because they were trying to manage that system

08:13.040 --> 08:15.120
 that he built, and more importantly,

08:15.120 --> 08:17.560
 manage that growing gap with the West.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.120
 By the time the 90s rolled around,

08:21.120 --> 08:25.040
 former Soviet troops, now Russian troops,

08:25.040 --> 08:28.680
 withdrew from all those advanced positions

08:28.680 --> 08:30.480
 that they had achieved as a result

08:30.480 --> 08:32.320
 of the World War II victory,

08:32.320 --> 08:34.640
 and it was Napoleon in reverse.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.720
 They went on the same roads,

08:36.720 --> 08:39.840
 but not from Moscow back to Paris,

08:39.840 --> 08:44.440
 but instead from Warsaw and from East Berlin

08:44.440 --> 08:48.720
 and from Tallinn and Riga and all the other places

08:48.720 --> 08:53.560
 of former Warsaw Pact and former Soviet republics

08:53.560 --> 08:55.480
 in the Baltic region.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.040
 They went back to Russia in retreat,

08:58.040 --> 09:02.000
 and so Stalin, in the fullness of time, lost the peace.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
 And Putin, in his own way, inheriting some of this,

09:07.000 --> 09:11.120
 attempting to reverse it when, as I said,

09:11.120 --> 09:14.080
 Russia was smaller, farther away, weaker,

09:14.080 --> 09:16.280
 the West was bigger and stronger

09:16.280 --> 09:21.280
 and had absorbed those former Warsaw Pact countries

09:22.280 --> 09:24.120
 and Baltic states,

09:24.120 --> 09:27.960
 because they voluntarily begged to join the West.

09:27.960 --> 09:30.360
 The West didn't impose itself on them.

09:30.360 --> 09:34.400
 It's a voluntary sphere of influence that the West conducts.

09:34.400 --> 09:38.280
 And so that dilemma is where you can put Putin and Stalin

09:38.280 --> 09:40.120
 in the same sentence,

09:40.120 --> 09:43.400
 and the terrible outcome for Russia

09:43.400 --> 09:46.640
 in the fullness of time also has echoes.

09:46.640 --> 09:51.640
 But of course, Putin hasn't murdered 18 to 20 million people

09:51.680 --> 09:54.840
 and the scale of his abilities to cause grief

09:56.520 --> 09:59.960
 with the nuclear weapons aside is nothing like Stalin's.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.200
 And so we have to be careful, right?

10:02.200 --> 10:05.280
 Only Mao put bigger numbers on the board

10:06.280 --> 10:08.240
 from a tragic point of view than Stalin.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.120
 And numbers matter here,

10:10.120 --> 10:12.920
 if we compare these singular figures.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.760
 Yeah, Mao killed more people than Stalin

10:16.760 --> 10:20.480
 because Mao had more people to kill.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.440
 The most amazing thing about Mao

10:22.440 --> 10:25.160
 is he watched Stalin do it.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.640
 He watched Stalin collectivize agriculture

10:28.640 --> 10:30.720
 and famine result.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.880
 He watched Stalin impose this communist monopoly,

10:34.880 --> 10:37.880
 and all of those people sent to prison

10:37.880 --> 10:40.320
 or given a bullet in the back of the neck.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.400
 He watched all of that,

10:41.400 --> 10:43.680
 and then he did it again himself in China.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.200
 Do you think he saw the human cost directly

10:46.200 --> 10:48.280
 that when you say he saw,

10:48.280 --> 10:51.160
 do you think he was focused on the policies

10:51.160 --> 10:54.560
 or was he also aware distinctly as a human being

10:54.560 --> 10:58.000
 of the human costs in the lives of peasants

10:58.000 --> 11:01.720
 and in the lives of the working class and lives of the poor?

11:01.720 --> 11:03.760
 I think the prima facie evidence

11:03.760 --> 11:06.000
 is that he didn't value human life.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.440
 Otherwise, I don't think after seeing

11:09.440 --> 11:11.080
 the amount of lives that were taken

11:11.080 --> 11:12.840
 in the Soviet experiment,

11:12.840 --> 11:16.320
 he would have done something similar after that.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.640
 I think the answer, Lex,

11:17.640 --> 11:21.200
 is it's very hard to get inside Mao's head

11:21.200 --> 11:24.080
 and figure out what he was really thinking.

11:24.080 --> 11:27.160
 But if you just look at the results that happened,

11:27.160 --> 11:29.120
 the policies that were undertaken

11:29.120 --> 11:31.240
 and the consequences of them,

11:31.240 --> 11:34.040
 you would have to conclude that there was,

11:34.040 --> 11:38.640
 let's say, no value or little value placed on human life.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.840
 Unfortunately, that's characteristic

11:40.840 --> 11:43.000
 not only of communist dictators, right,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.600
 of post communist dictators as well,

11:45.600 --> 11:49.280
 but the scale of the horrors that they inflict,

11:50.280 --> 11:54.520
 as horrific as they are, just can't compare.

11:54.520 --> 11:58.480
 And so we're in a situation where Eurasia,

11:58.480 --> 12:02.960
 that is to say the ancient civilizations of Eurasia,

12:02.960 --> 12:07.160
 which would be Russia, Iran, China,

12:08.560 --> 12:13.320
 all have some version of non democratic,

12:13.320 --> 12:16.200
 illiberal autocratic regimes,

12:16.200 --> 12:18.080
 and they're all pushing up against

12:18.080 --> 12:21.080
 the greater power of the West in some form.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.200
 Sometimes they coordinate their actions

12:23.200 --> 12:25.280
 and sometimes they don't.

12:25.280 --> 12:28.640
 But this is a very longstanding phenomenon, Lex,

12:28.640 --> 12:33.400
 that predates Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping

12:33.400 --> 12:37.520
 or the latest incarnation of the supreme leader in Iran.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.720
 So we'll talk about this, I think,

12:40.720 --> 12:44.520
 really powerful framework of five dimensions

12:44.520 --> 12:47.080
 of authoritarian regimes that you've put together.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.720
 But first, let's go to this Napoleon

12:49.720 --> 12:54.720
 and reverse retreat from Warsaw back.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.800
 Putin has called, from the perspective of Putin,

12:59.800 --> 13:02.600
 this retreat, this collapse of Stalin

13:02.600 --> 13:07.540
 is one of the great tragedies of that region, of Russia.

13:09.160 --> 13:14.160
 Do you think there's a sense where as Putin sits now

13:14.200 --> 13:16.640
 in power for 22 plus years,

13:16.640 --> 13:21.640
 he really dreams of a return to the power,

13:25.240 --> 13:30.240
 the influence, the land of Stalin?

13:31.280 --> 13:35.040
 So while you said that they're not in the same place

13:35.040 --> 13:37.000
 in terms of the numbers of people

13:38.360 --> 13:40.880
 that suffer due to their regime,

13:40.880 --> 13:44.520
 do you think he hopes to have the same power,

13:44.520 --> 13:47.080
 the same influence for a nation

13:47.080 --> 13:50.480
 that was in the 30s, in the 40s, in the 50s

13:51.800 --> 13:54.000
 of the 20th century under Stalin?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.440
 If he does, Lex, he's deluding himself.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.680
 We don't know for sure.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.400
 Very few people talk to him.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.560
 Very few people have access to him.

14:05.560 --> 14:09.720
 A handful of Western leaders have met with him

14:09.720 --> 14:11.240
 for short periods of time.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.740
 Those inside Russia barely meet with him.

14:13.740 --> 14:18.220
 His own minions in the regime barely have FaceTime with him.

14:19.420 --> 14:21.620
 We don't know exactly what he thinks.

14:21.620 --> 14:26.620
 It could be that he has delusions

14:26.940 --> 14:29.580
 of reconquering Russian influence,

14:29.580 --> 14:34.020
 if not direct control over the territories that broke away,

14:34.820 --> 14:36.180
 but it's not gonna happen.

14:36.180 --> 14:40.020
 Let's talk a little bit about this guy, Nikolai Patrushev.

14:40.020 --> 14:43.500
 Nikolai Patrushev is probably not well known

14:43.500 --> 14:45.220
 to your listeners.

14:45.220 --> 14:48.700
 He's the head of Russia's Security Council.

14:49.580 --> 14:53.500
 And so you could probably call him the second most important

14:53.500 --> 14:56.860
 or second most powerful man in Russia,

14:56.860 --> 14:58.780
 certainly inside the regime.

14:59.780 --> 15:03.220
 Arguably, Navalny is the second most important person

15:03.220 --> 15:06.140
 in the country and Russia is the second most powerful man

15:06.140 --> 15:08.020
 and we'll talk about that later, I'm sure.

15:08.020 --> 15:09.340
 In terms of influence, yes.

15:09.340 --> 15:14.340
 Yes, but Patrushev is a version of Putin's right hand man.

15:17.380 --> 15:22.380
 And Patrushev has been giving interviews in the press.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.020
 You probably saw the interview

15:24.020 --> 15:27.540
 with Nizavisimaya Gazeta not that long ago.

15:27.540 --> 15:31.620
 He writes also his own blog like interventions

15:31.620 --> 15:36.620
 in the public sphere using the few channels that are left.

15:38.660 --> 15:41.100
 And what's interesting about Patrushev,

15:41.100 --> 15:45.860
 and this could well reflect similar thinking to Putin's,

15:45.860 --> 15:47.500
 which is why I'm bringing this up,

15:48.700 --> 15:53.140
 is that he's got this conspiratorial theory

15:53.140 --> 15:57.940
 that the West has been on a forever campaign

15:57.940 --> 15:59.740
 to destroy Russia,

15:59.740 --> 16:02.260
 just like it destroyed the Soviet Union

16:02.260 --> 16:04.900
 and that everything the West does

16:04.900 --> 16:07.420
 is meant to dismember Russia

16:07.420 --> 16:11.100
 and that Russia is fighting an existential battle

16:11.100 --> 16:13.020
 against the West.

16:13.020 --> 16:16.580
 And so for example, the CIA and the American government

16:16.580 --> 16:19.020
 wanted to bring down the Soviet Union.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.100
 Nevermind that the Bush administration,

16:21.100 --> 16:23.260
 the first Bush, the father,

16:23.260 --> 16:26.540
 was trying desperately to hold the Soviet Union together

16:26.540 --> 16:30.420
 because they were afraid of the chaos that might ensue

16:30.420 --> 16:33.540
 and the nukes that might get loose

16:33.540 --> 16:37.540
 as a result of a Soviet collapse.

16:37.540 --> 16:40.580
 And it wasn't until the very last moment

16:40.580 --> 16:44.780
 where Bush decided, his administration decided

16:44.780 --> 16:48.780
 to back those Republican leaders

16:48.780 --> 16:51.460
 who were breaking away from Mikhail Gorbachev

16:51.460 --> 16:53.820
 and the Soviet Union, right?

16:53.820 --> 16:56.340
 So nevermind the empirics of it.

16:56.340 --> 16:59.060
 Nevermind that Bill Clinton's administration

16:59.060 --> 17:03.580
 following George Bush sent boatloads of money,

17:03.580 --> 17:06.660
 Western taxpayer money to Russia.

17:06.660 --> 17:08.740
 We don't know exactly how much

17:08.740 --> 17:10.620
 because it came from different sources.

17:10.620 --> 17:13.260
 People talk about how there was no Marshall Plan.

17:13.260 --> 17:17.620
 It was tens of billions of dollars from various sources,

17:17.620 --> 17:20.180
 from the IMF and other sources.

17:20.180 --> 17:22.780
 And next it disappeared, it's gone.

17:22.780 --> 17:25.100
 Just like the German money that went to Gorbachev

17:25.100 --> 17:26.740
 for unification disappeared

17:26.740 --> 17:28.980
 even before the Soviet collapsed.

17:28.980 --> 17:32.220
 The money disappeared, but the West sent the money.

17:32.220 --> 17:33.980
 So how was that a plot?

17:33.980 --> 17:37.220
 And then you could go all the way, Obama's administration,

17:37.220 --> 17:39.860
 George Bush trying to do business deals

17:39.860 --> 17:43.180
 and reset the relations and Obama administration

17:43.180 --> 17:44.780
 trying to reset the relations

17:44.780 --> 17:48.060
 and doing nothing after the Georgian war

17:48.060 --> 17:51.980
 and slapping Putin on the wrist,

17:51.980 --> 17:55.100
 following the seizure force of Putin.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.740
 And you could go on and you could go on

17:56.740 --> 17:59.100
 all the way through the Trump administration

17:59.100 --> 18:01.940
 telling Putin that he's right.

18:01.940 --> 18:05.140
 Trump believes Putin and doesn't believe US intelligence

18:05.140 --> 18:07.020
 about Russian efforts to interfere

18:07.020 --> 18:08.860
 in American domestic politics.

18:08.860 --> 18:11.780
 So despite all the empirics of it,

18:11.780 --> 18:14.820
 you have Patrushev and likely Putin

18:14.820 --> 18:19.500
 talking about this multi decade Western conspiracy

18:19.500 --> 18:21.580
 to bring Russia down.

18:21.580 --> 18:23.580
 At the same time as that's happening,

18:23.580 --> 18:27.060
 the Germans are voluntarily increasing

18:27.060 --> 18:30.020
 their dependence on Russian energy,

18:30.020 --> 18:33.020
 voluntarily increasing their dependence on Russia.

18:33.020 --> 18:36.020
 So here's the conspiracy to bring Russia down.

18:36.020 --> 18:39.940
 The French who fantasize about themselves

18:39.940 --> 18:43.140
 as a diplomatic superpower are constantly,

18:43.140 --> 18:46.220
 the French leaders are constantly running to the Kremlin

18:46.220 --> 18:48.220
 to ask what Russia needs,

18:48.220 --> 18:51.540
 what concessions from the West Russia needs to be filled

18:51.540 --> 18:53.740
 to feel respected again.

18:53.740 --> 18:58.700
 The British provide all manner of money laundering

18:58.700 --> 19:01.540
 and reputation laundering services

19:01.540 --> 19:03.580
 for the whole Russian oligarchy,

19:03.580 --> 19:07.780
 including the state officials who are looting the state

19:07.780 --> 19:10.940
 and using the West British institutions

19:10.940 --> 19:11.980
 to launder their money.

19:11.980 --> 19:15.740
 So all of this is happening and yet Patrushev imagines

19:15.740 --> 19:19.220
 this conspiracy to bring Russia down by the West.

19:19.220 --> 19:22.020
 And so that's what we've got in the Kremlin again.

19:22.020 --> 19:26.900
 Stalin had that same conspiratorial mentality of the West.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.500
 Everything that happened in the world

19:28.500 --> 19:30.540
 was part of a Western conspiracy

19:30.540 --> 19:32.300
 directed against the Soviet Union

19:32.300 --> 19:34.140
 and now directed against Russia.

19:34.140 --> 19:37.700
 Even though the West is trying to appease,

19:37.700 --> 19:39.620
 the West is offering its services,

19:39.620 --> 19:42.220
 the West is trying to change Russia through investment

19:42.220 --> 19:46.660
 in a positive way, but instead the West is what's changing.

19:46.660 --> 19:48.460
 The West is becoming more corrupt.

19:48.460 --> 19:50.540
 Western services are being corrupted

19:50.540 --> 19:52.860
 by the relationship with Russia.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.860
 So you have to ask yourself,

19:54.860 --> 19:58.140
 who are these people in power in the Kremlin

19:58.140 --> 20:02.300
 who imagine that while they're availing themselves

20:02.300 --> 20:07.020
 of every service and every blandishment of the West,

20:07.020 --> 20:09.220
 while they're availing themselves of this,

20:09.220 --> 20:12.620
 that they're fighting a conspiracy by the West

20:12.620 --> 20:14.420
 to bring them down.

20:14.420 --> 20:19.420
 So this is what they call the Abyssinia in Russian,

20:21.460 --> 20:23.540
 which is a term, as you know,

20:23.540 --> 20:26.860
 that means those who are resentful,

20:26.860 --> 20:29.140
 or you might call them the losers,

20:29.140 --> 20:30.980
 the losers in the transition.

20:31.860 --> 20:34.380
 So when the Soviet Union fell

20:34.380 --> 20:38.740
 and there was a very substantial diminution

20:38.740 --> 20:41.580
 in Russian power and influence in the world,

20:41.580 --> 20:43.980
 a lot of people lost out.

20:43.980 --> 20:46.900
 They weren't able to steal the property.

20:46.900 --> 20:50.500
 They weren't able to loot the state in the 90s.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.740
 And they were on the outside.

20:52.740 --> 20:55.220
 They gradually came back in.

20:55.220 --> 20:58.300
 They were the losers in the transition domestically.

20:59.180 --> 21:04.180
 And for them, they wanted to reverse

21:04.180 --> 21:05.940
 being on the losing side.

21:05.940 --> 21:10.060
 And so they began to expropriate, to steal the money,

21:10.060 --> 21:14.900
 steal the property from those first thieves

21:14.900 --> 21:16.940
 who stole in the 90s.

21:16.940 --> 21:20.100
 And the 2000s and on have been about restealing,

21:20.100 --> 21:23.180
 taking the losers in the transition,

21:23.180 --> 21:25.900
 taking the money from the winners

21:25.900 --> 21:30.620
 and reversing this resentment, this loser status.

21:30.620 --> 21:33.620
 Those are your Patrushevs and your Putins.

21:33.620 --> 21:36.580
 But at the same time, this blows out

21:36.580 --> 21:41.580
 to let's reverse the losses, being on the losing side,

21:41.740 --> 21:43.580
 the roiling resentment

21:43.580 --> 21:47.020
 at the decline of their power internationally.

21:47.020 --> 21:49.620
 Let's try to reverse that too.

21:49.620 --> 21:54.620
 So you have a profound psychological whole generation

21:55.140 --> 21:58.340
 of people who are on the losing end domestically

21:58.340 --> 22:00.460
 and reverse that domestically.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.260
 That's what the Putin regime is about.

22:02.260 --> 22:06.180
 Remember Mikhail Khodorkovsky's Yukos?

22:06.180 --> 22:09.300
 Remember all the companies that are now owned

22:09.300 --> 22:12.660
 by Putin cronies because they were taken away

22:12.660 --> 22:15.700
 from whoever stole them in the first place.

22:15.700 --> 22:19.180
 And now they're trying to do that on the international scale.

22:19.180 --> 22:22.860
 It's one thing to put domestic opponents in jail.

22:22.860 --> 22:27.020
 It's one thing to take away someone's property domestically,

22:27.020 --> 22:30.020
 but you're not gonna reverse the power of the West

22:30.020 --> 22:33.180
 with the diminished Russia that you have.

22:33.180 --> 22:37.860
 And so that project, that Patrushev project,

22:37.860 --> 22:41.140
 which we see him expressing again and again,

22:41.140 --> 22:43.020
 he speaks about it publicly.

22:43.020 --> 22:48.020
 It's not something that we need to go looking for,

22:48.020 --> 22:50.460
 a quest, the secret, we can't find it.

22:50.460 --> 22:51.540
 What are they thinking?

22:51.540 --> 22:53.740
 It's right there in front of our face.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.660
 And Putin has spoken the same way for a long time.

22:56.660 --> 22:59.820
 People point to the 2007 speech

22:59.820 --> 23:01.580
 at the Munich Security Conference

23:01.580 --> 23:04.180
 that Putin delivered, and certainly your listeners

23:04.180 --> 23:06.540
 could use a snippet or two of that,

23:06.540 --> 23:09.180
 just like they could use a couple of quotes

23:09.180 --> 23:13.140
 from Patrushev to contextualize what we're talking about.

23:13.140 --> 23:16.980
 But it predates the 2007 Munich speech,

23:16.980 --> 23:21.980
 the reaction to Ukraine's uprising in 2004,

23:22.900 --> 23:27.900
 attempt to steal the election inside Ukraine,

23:27.900 --> 23:31.020
 which the Ukrainian people rose up valiantly

23:31.020 --> 23:34.940
 against and risked their lives and overturned, right?

23:34.940 --> 23:38.420
 So there were public statements from Putin already back then,

23:38.420 --> 23:41.300
 the statements about Khodorkovsky in 2003

23:41.300 --> 23:44.020
 when he was arrested and expropriated.

23:44.020 --> 23:49.020
 This is a longstanding deeply psychological issue,

23:51.100 --> 23:53.740
 which is about managing Russian power in the world,

23:53.740 --> 23:55.940
 as I was saying, the gap with the West,

23:55.940 --> 23:59.140
 but has this further dimension of feeling like losers

23:59.140 --> 24:03.540
 and wanting to reverse that, that's their life experience.

24:03.540 --> 24:04.580
 I'd be a zhenei.

24:04.580 --> 24:09.580
 So there's that resentment that fuels this narrative,

24:09.980 --> 24:14.500
 fuels this geopolitics and internal policy.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.860
 But so resentment is behind some of the worst things

24:16.860 --> 24:19.220
 that have ever been done in human history.

24:19.220 --> 24:22.540
 Hitler was probably fueled by resentment.

24:22.540 --> 24:26.020
 So resentment is a really powerful force, yes.

24:26.020 --> 24:30.260
 Just to maybe not push back,

24:30.260 --> 24:33.300
 but to give fuller context on the West,

24:33.300 --> 24:38.300
 you said there's a narrative from Putin's Russia

24:39.460 --> 24:42.220
 that the West is somehow an enemy,

24:42.220 --> 24:44.340
 you position everything against the West,

24:45.180 --> 24:47.860
 but is there a degree and to what degree

24:47.860 --> 24:50.860
 is the West willing to feed that narrative?

24:50.860 --> 24:53.980
 That it's also convenient for the West to have an enemy.

24:53.980 --> 24:56.740
 It seems like in the place, in the span,

24:58.260 --> 25:00.580
 it seems like in geopolitics,

25:00.580 --> 25:05.580
 having an enemy is useful for forming a narrative.

25:06.380 --> 25:09.860
 Now, having an enemy for the basic respect of humanity

25:09.860 --> 25:12.980
 is not good, but in terms of maintaining power,

25:12.980 --> 25:15.580
 if you're a leader in a game of geopolitics,

25:15.580 --> 25:18.580
 it seems to be good to have an enemy.

25:18.580 --> 25:21.700
 It seems to be good to have something like a cold war.

25:21.700 --> 25:23.500
 We can always point your finger and says,

25:23.500 --> 25:27.220
 all our actions are fighting this evil,

25:27.220 --> 25:28.540
 whatever that evil is.

25:28.540 --> 25:32.260
 It could be like with George W. Bush, the war on terror.

25:32.260 --> 25:33.660
 Terrorism is this evil.

25:33.660 --> 25:35.400
 You can always point at something.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.080
 So you've made it seem that the West is trying.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.740
 There's a lot of forces within the West

25:39.740 --> 25:42.660
 that are trying to reach out a friendly hand,

25:42.660 --> 25:46.580
 trying to help, sending money, sending compassion,

25:46.580 --> 25:48.020
 trying to sort of.

25:48.020 --> 25:51.100
 Trying to integrate Russia into a global institution.

25:51.100 --> 25:51.940
 Exactly.

25:51.940 --> 25:55.180
 Which was a longstanding multi decade effort

25:55.180 --> 25:56.780
 across multiple countries

25:56.780 --> 25:59.660
 and multiple administrations in those countries.

25:59.660 --> 26:02.140
 But is there also warmongers on the West?

26:02.140 --> 26:03.020
 Of course, Lex.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.420
 Of course you're right about that.

26:04.420 --> 26:06.120
 But let's put it this way.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.060
 People talk about the cold war

26:08.940 --> 26:12.860
 and they usually looking to assign blame for the cold war

26:12.860 --> 26:17.020
 as if it's some kind of mistake, a misunderstanding,

26:17.020 --> 26:20.060
 or a search for an enemy that was convenient

26:20.060 --> 26:23.100
 to rally domestic politics.

26:23.100 --> 26:28.100
 So Lex, there's a coup in Czechoslovakia

26:28.100 --> 26:32.860
 and somebody installs a communist regime in February 1948.

26:33.700 --> 26:34.820
 No reaction to that?

26:34.820 --> 26:36.660
 That's just okay?

26:36.660 --> 26:39.060
 There's a blockade of Berlin.

26:39.060 --> 26:40.660
 Is that cool by you?

26:40.660 --> 26:44.340
 Where they try to strangle West Berlin

26:44.340 --> 26:46.500
 so that they can swallow West Berlin

26:46.500 --> 26:48.080
 and add it to East Berlin.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.220
 You cool with that?

26:50.220 --> 26:54.700
 How about Korean War, invasion of North Korea,

26:54.700 --> 26:57.100
 invasion of South Korea by North Korea?

26:57.100 --> 26:58.940
 You cool with that?

26:58.940 --> 27:01.660
 How about the murders and the show trials

27:01.660 --> 27:05.220
 up and down Eastern Europe in the late 40s

27:05.220 --> 27:08.060
 after the imposition of the clone regimes?

27:08.060 --> 27:09.780
 You good with that?

27:09.780 --> 27:12.300
 Yeah, it's very convenient to have an enemy.

27:12.300 --> 27:13.700
 I agree with you.

27:13.700 --> 27:17.120
 But you know, there was some actions, Lex.

27:17.120 --> 27:19.860
 There was some threats to people's freedom.

27:19.860 --> 27:21.860
 There was some invasions.

27:21.860 --> 27:25.920
 There was some aggression and violence on a mass scale,

27:25.920 --> 27:28.140
 like collectivization of Eastern Europe.

27:28.140 --> 27:30.640
 And we could go on, Lex, with the examples.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.100
 I'm just giving a few of them.

27:33.100 --> 27:36.060
 And so the Cold War was not a mistake.

27:36.060 --> 27:38.500
 It was not a misunderstanding.

27:38.500 --> 27:41.340
 We don't have to blame someone for the Cold War.

27:41.340 --> 27:44.040
 We have to give credit for the Cold War.

27:44.040 --> 27:47.620
 The Truman administration deserves credit

27:47.620 --> 27:50.580
 for standing up to Stalin's regime,

27:50.580 --> 27:53.380
 for standing up to these actions,

27:53.380 --> 27:57.020
 for saying, yeah, we're not just gonna take this.

27:57.020 --> 27:59.040
 We're not gonna let this go on.

27:59.040 --> 28:02.660
 We're not gonna let this expand to further territories.

28:02.660 --> 28:04.980
 We're gonna create the NATO alliance.

28:04.980 --> 28:09.760
 And we're gonna rally democratic liberal regimes

28:09.760 --> 28:12.160
 to stand up to this illiberalism,

28:12.160 --> 28:14.500
 this violence, and this aggression.

28:14.500 --> 28:19.180
 And so, yeah, Lex, it's always convenient to have an enemy.

28:19.180 --> 28:20.720
 But there was an enemy.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.200
 Nikolai Leonov, who recently died,

28:24.200 --> 28:28.900
 he died in April 2022, and he had a major funeral.

28:28.900 --> 28:33.900
 He was the last head analyst of the Soviet KGB.

28:36.420 --> 28:39.320
 And Leonov is one of the most important figures

28:39.320 --> 28:41.780
 for understanding the Soviet collapse.

28:41.780 --> 28:45.140
 And he has the best memoir on the Soviet collapse,

28:45.140 --> 28:48.060
 which is known in Russian as Likholetya.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.960
 You will understand that.

28:50.960 --> 28:55.960
 And you'll help your podcast listeners understand.

28:56.140 --> 29:00.820
 There's a singularity to that kind of expression, Likholetya.

29:00.820 --> 29:02.280
 Leonov just died.

29:02.280 --> 29:04.940
 But one of the things, and in fact,

29:04.940 --> 29:09.580
 the people who were supposedly arrested by Putin

29:09.580 --> 29:12.100
 as scapegoats for the Ukraine war,

29:12.100 --> 29:16.300
 the main one, Sergei Beseda, gave the eulogy

29:16.300 --> 29:19.620
 at Leonov's funeral in April 2022,

29:19.620 --> 29:22.180
 showing that it's a lie that all of these people

29:22.180 --> 29:23.740
 have been arrested and purged

29:23.740 --> 29:27.500
 and other nonsense in social media.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.500
 But to get back to what Leonov said

29:29.500 --> 29:33.020
 and get back to your enemy point, Leonov said,

29:33.020 --> 29:35.700
 you know, the West spent all this time

29:35.700 --> 29:39.020
 blackening the image of the Soviet Union.

29:39.020 --> 29:43.980
 All these resources and propaganda and covert operations

29:43.980 --> 29:45.800
 to blacken the Soviet image.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.140
 And they did, Lex, the West did do that.

29:48.140 --> 29:50.620
 And then Leonov wrote in the next sentence,

29:50.620 --> 29:51.660
 and you know what?

29:51.660 --> 29:54.700
 We gave them a lot of material to work with

29:54.700 --> 29:57.220
 to blacken our image.

29:57.220 --> 30:02.220
 Yeah, so you're saying a kind of sobering reality,

30:02.360 --> 30:05.100
 which it is possible to some degree to draw a line

30:05.100 --> 30:07.580
 between the good guys and the bad guys.

30:07.580 --> 30:10.020
 Freedom is better than unfreedom, Lex.

30:10.980 --> 30:12.820
 It's a lot better than unfreedom,

30:12.820 --> 30:15.660
 and a guy like you understands that really well.

30:15.660 --> 30:18.940
 Well, so yes, but those are all, you know,

30:18.940 --> 30:21.300
 there's words like justice, freedom.

30:24.940 --> 30:26.220
 What else?

30:26.220 --> 30:31.220
 Love, you can use a lot of words that Hitler himself used

30:31.340 --> 30:36.260
 to describe why he is actually creating a better world

30:36.260 --> 30:37.860
 than those he's fighting.

30:37.860 --> 30:39.280
 So some of it is propaganda.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.300
 The question is on the ground,

30:41.300 --> 30:43.400
 what is actually increasing the amount of freedom

30:43.400 --> 30:44.240
 in the world, human prosperity?

30:44.240 --> 30:45.860
 Institutions, Lex, right?

30:45.860 --> 30:48.500
 We're not talking about propaganda here.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.820
 When we use words like freedom,

30:50.820 --> 30:53.340
 we're talking about rule of law.

30:53.340 --> 30:55.900
 We're talking about protection of civil liberties.

30:55.900 --> 30:58.980
 We're talking about protection of private property.

30:58.980 --> 31:01.220
 We're talking about an independent

31:01.220 --> 31:03.460
 and well funded judiciary.

31:03.460 --> 31:07.220
 We're talking about an impartial, non corrupt,

31:07.220 --> 31:09.360
 competent civil service.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.580
 We're talking about separation of powers

31:11.580 --> 31:14.660
 where the executive branch's power is limited,

31:14.660 --> 31:17.220
 usually by an elected parliament.

31:17.220 --> 31:19.860
 In fact, yes, let's talk about elections.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.960
 Let's talk about freedom of speech

31:22.960 --> 31:25.220
 and freedom of the public sphere.

31:25.220 --> 31:28.020
 We're not talking about freedom as a slogan here.

31:28.020 --> 31:31.660
 We're talking about a huge array of institutions

31:31.660 --> 31:35.300
 and practices and norms ultimately, right?

31:35.300 --> 31:39.160
 And if they exist, you know, and you live under them.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.420
 And if they don't exist,

31:40.420 --> 31:43.380
 you fully understand that as well, right?

31:43.380 --> 31:48.380
 Ukraine was a flawed democracy before Russia invaded.

31:50.460 --> 31:55.220
 It's utterly corrupt, many ways dysfunctional,

31:55.220 --> 31:58.500
 especially the elites were dysfunctional.

31:58.500 --> 32:02.500
 The gas industry in Ukraine was absolutely terrible

32:02.500 --> 32:04.620
 because of the corruption that it generated,

32:04.620 --> 32:06.660
 the oligarch problem,

32:06.660 --> 32:10.060
 a handful of people stealing the state resources.

32:10.060 --> 32:13.940
 And yet Ukraine had an open public sphere

32:13.940 --> 32:16.580
 and it had a parliament that functioned.

32:16.580 --> 32:21.580
 And so despite its flaws, it was still a democracy.

32:23.460 --> 32:26.560
 The regime in Moscow, you can't say that Lex.

32:26.560 --> 32:30.480
 It's not a comparable regime to Ukraine.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.920
 You could say, oh, well, there were oligarchs in Ukraine

32:32.920 --> 32:34.480
 and there were oligarchs in Russia.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.200
 There's corruption in Ukraine, there's corruption in Russia.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.960
 So really what's the big difference?

32:38.960 --> 32:43.000
 And the answer is, well, Ukraine had the open public sphere.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.340
 Ukraine had a real parliament.

32:44.340 --> 32:47.680
 Can you call Russia's Duma a real parliament?

32:47.680 --> 32:49.400
 I don't think so.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.920
 I don't think you can.

32:50.920 --> 32:54.080
 Can you say that there were any checks whatsoever

32:54.080 --> 32:57.320
 on the executive branch in Russia?

32:57.320 --> 33:01.360
 Can you say that the Russian judiciary had any independence

33:02.360 --> 33:05.840
 or really full level of competence

33:05.840 --> 33:08.360
 even compared to the Ukrainian judiciary,

33:08.360 --> 33:10.040
 which was nothing to brag about?

33:10.040 --> 33:12.020
 No, you can't say that Lex.

33:12.020 --> 33:16.880
 So we can differentiate between the very flawed,

33:16.880 --> 33:21.880
 corrupt oligarchic democracy in Ukraine

33:21.880 --> 33:26.360
 and the very corrupt oligarchic autocracy in Russia.

33:26.360 --> 33:29.120
 I think that's a fair distinction.

33:29.120 --> 33:32.200
 Yeah, we should say that Russia and Ukraine

33:32.200 --> 33:34.200
 have the great honor of being the number one

33:34.200 --> 33:37.000
 and the number two most corrupt nations in Europe

33:37.000 --> 33:38.640
 by many measures.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.240
 But there is a fundamental difference,

33:40.240 --> 33:42.000
 as you were highlighting.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.640
 Russia is a corrupt autocracy.

33:44.640 --> 33:48.000
 Ukraine, we can say, is a corrupt democracy.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.420
 And to that level, there's a fundamental difference.

33:53.680 --> 33:57.720
 Ukraine is not murdering its own journalists

33:57.720 --> 33:59.720
 in systematic fashion.

33:59.720 --> 34:03.380
 If journalists are killed in Ukraine, it's a tragedy.

34:03.380 --> 34:05.160
 If journalists are killed in Russia

34:05.160 --> 34:07.160
 or Russian journalists are killed abroad,

34:07.160 --> 34:08.640
 it's regime policy.

34:08.640 --> 34:11.520
 And the degree to which a nation is authoritarian

34:12.520 --> 34:15.880
 means that it's suffocating its own spirit,

34:15.880 --> 34:18.320
 its capacity to flourish.

34:19.200 --> 34:24.200
 We're not just talking about sort of the freedom

34:24.960 --> 34:26.820
 of the press, those kinds of things,

34:26.820 --> 34:30.840
 but basically all industries get suffocated

34:30.840 --> 34:33.280
 and you're no longer being able to,

34:33.280 --> 34:36.040
 yeah, flourish as a nation, grow the production,

34:36.040 --> 34:38.280
 the GDP, the scientists, the art, the culture,

34:38.280 --> 34:39.160
 all those kinds of things.

34:39.160 --> 34:40.760
 Yes, Lex, you're absolutely right.

34:40.760 --> 34:45.000
 And so before the invasion, the full blown invasion

34:45.000 --> 34:48.200
 of February 2022 into Ukraine, because as you know,

34:48.200 --> 34:52.040
 the war has been going on for many years at a lower level

34:52.040 --> 34:54.240
 compared to what it is these days,

34:54.240 --> 34:57.320
 but still a tragic war with many deaths

34:57.320 --> 35:00.320
 prior to February 2022.

35:00.320 --> 35:03.140
 Before this latest war, we could have said

35:03.140 --> 35:05.760
 that the greatest victims of the Putin regime

35:05.760 --> 35:10.040
 are Russian, domestic, that the people

35:10.040 --> 35:13.560
 who are suffering the most from the Putin regime

35:13.560 --> 35:16.000
 are not sitting here in New York City,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.820
 but in fact are sitting there in Russia.

35:18.820 --> 35:21.880
 Now, of course, with the invasion of Ukraine

35:21.880 --> 35:26.880
 and really the atrocities that have been well documented

35:28.540 --> 35:30.400
 and more are being investigated,

35:32.080 --> 35:34.940
 we can't easily say anymore that Russians

35:34.940 --> 35:37.280
 are the greatest victims of the Putin regime,

35:38.120 --> 35:43.120
 but in ways other than bombing and murdering civilians,

35:43.120 --> 35:46.760
 children, mothers, grandmothers, grandfathers,

35:49.160 --> 35:52.440
 after you include that, then of course,

35:52.440 --> 35:55.240
 the larger number of victims of the Putin regime

35:55.240 --> 35:58.240
 are not Ukrainians, but ultimately Russians,

35:58.240 --> 36:00.680
 and there's how many of them now that have fled?

36:02.120 --> 36:07.060
 So your powerful, precise, rigorous words

36:07.060 --> 36:11.800
 are then in a stark contrast, I would say,

36:11.800 --> 36:15.120
 to my very recent conversation with Oliver Stone,

36:15.120 --> 36:18.360
 and I would love you to elaborate this agreement

36:18.360 --> 36:21.420
 you have here with his words and maybe words

36:21.420 --> 36:25.420
 of people like John Mearsheimer.

36:25.420 --> 36:29.520
 The idea is that Putin's hand in this invasion of 2022

36:29.520 --> 36:34.120
 was forced by the expansion of NATO,

36:34.120 --> 36:38.360
 the imperialist imperative of the United States

36:38.360 --> 36:41.800
 and the NATO forces.

36:43.680 --> 36:48.420
 You disagree with this point in terms of placing the blame

36:48.420 --> 36:53.080
 somehow on the invasion on forces larger

36:53.080 --> 36:55.340
 than the particular two nations involved,

36:55.340 --> 36:59.600
 but more on the geopolitics of the world

36:59.600 --> 37:02.160
 that's driven by the most powerful military nation

37:02.160 --> 37:04.280
 in the world, which is the United States.

37:04.280 --> 37:09.280
 Yeah, Lex, so let's imagine that a tragedy's happened here

37:09.680 --> 37:12.400
 in New York, and a woman got raped.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.920
 We know the perpetrator.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.460
 They go to trial, and Oliver Stone gets up and says,

37:19.460 --> 37:20.760
 you know what?

37:20.760 --> 37:23.920
 The woman was wearing a short skirt,

37:23.920 --> 37:28.760
 and there was no option but for the rapist to rape her.

37:28.760 --> 37:31.960
 The woman was wearing lipstick,

37:31.960 --> 37:35.160
 or the woman was applying for NATO membership

37:35.160 --> 37:37.320
 and just had to be raped.

37:37.320 --> 37:41.040
 There's, I mean, didn't want to rape her,

37:41.040 --> 37:44.280
 but was compelled because of what she was doing

37:44.280 --> 37:47.880
 and what she looked like and the clothes she was wearing

37:47.880 --> 37:51.600
 and the alliances that she was under international law

37:51.600 --> 37:54.960
 signed by Moscow, all the treaties

37:54.960 --> 37:57.160
 that sovereign countries get to choose

37:57.160 --> 37:59.300
 whatever alliance they belong to.

37:59.300 --> 38:04.300
 The treaties that the UN Charter signed by Russia,

38:04.820 --> 38:09.820
 Soviet Union, the 1975 Helsinki Agreement

38:11.740 --> 38:13.340
 signed by the Soviet Union,

38:13.340 --> 38:16.340
 the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe

38:16.340 --> 38:17.700
 signed by the Soviet Union,

38:17.700 --> 38:21.300
 the 1997 NATO Russia Founding Act

38:21.300 --> 38:24.500
 signed by the Russian government, the post Soviet Russia.

38:24.500 --> 38:29.500
 All of those documents signed by either the Soviet regime

38:30.540 --> 38:31.620
 or the Russian regime,

38:31.620 --> 38:36.000
 which is the legally recognized international inheritor,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.460
 right, successor of the Soviet state.

38:38.460 --> 38:40.460
 All of those agreements are still in force

38:40.460 --> 38:44.880
 and all of them say that countries are sovereign

38:44.880 --> 38:48.340
 and can freely choose their foreign policy

38:48.340 --> 38:50.860
 and what alliances they want to join.

38:50.860 --> 38:52.660
 Let's even go farther than that.

38:52.660 --> 38:55.340
 I mean, you don't have to go farther than that,

38:55.340 --> 38:57.980
 but let's go farther than that, Lex.

38:57.980 --> 39:01.020
 Is an autocratic repressive regime

39:01.020 --> 39:04.780
 that invades its neighbors in the name of its own security

39:04.780 --> 39:07.000
 something new in Russian history?

39:07.000 --> 39:08.960
 Did we not see this before?

39:08.960 --> 39:13.540
 Is this, does this not predate NATO expansion?

39:13.540 --> 39:17.160
 Does this not predate the existence of NATO?

39:17.160 --> 39:20.100
 Would Oliver Stone sit here in this chair and say to you,

39:20.100 --> 39:25.100
 you know, they had to impose serfdom in the 17th century

39:25.600 --> 39:27.720
 because NATO expanded.

39:27.720 --> 39:30.060
 They had no choice, their hands were tied.

39:30.060 --> 39:33.520
 They were compelled to treat their own population

39:33.520 --> 39:37.560
 like slaves because, you know, NATO expanded.

39:37.560 --> 39:39.620
 I mean, I could go on through the examples

39:39.620 --> 39:43.520
 of Russian history that predate the existence,

39:43.520 --> 39:46.100
 let alone the expansion of NATO,

39:46.100 --> 39:51.100
 where you have behavior, policies, actions,

39:51.620 --> 39:55.660
 very similar to what we see now from the Kremlin.

39:55.660 --> 39:59.940
 And you can't explain those by NATO expansion, can you?

39:59.940 --> 40:03.600
 And so that argument doesn't wash for me

40:03.600 --> 40:07.620
 because I have a pattern here that predates NATO expansion.

40:07.620 --> 40:10.980
 I have international agreements, founding documents,

40:10.980 --> 40:15.980
 signed by the Kremlin over many, many decades

40:15.980 --> 40:18.460
 acknowledging the freedom of countries

40:18.460 --> 40:20.500
 to choose their alliances.

40:20.500 --> 40:24.120
 And then I have this problem where when you rape somebody,

40:24.120 --> 40:26.860
 it's not because they're wearing a short skirt.

40:26.860 --> 40:29.200
 It's because you have raped them.

40:32.340 --> 40:35.100
 You've committed a criminal act, Lex.

40:35.100 --> 40:38.500
 That's a, I think there's a lot of people listening to this

40:38.500 --> 40:41.420
 that will agree to the emotion, the power,

40:41.420 --> 40:43.420
 and the spirit of this metaphor.

40:43.420 --> 40:46.820
 And I was struggling to think how to dance

40:46.820 --> 40:49.540
 within this metaphor because it feels like

40:49.540 --> 40:51.700
 it wasn't precisely the right one,

40:51.700 --> 40:53.720
 but I think it captures the spirit.

40:55.140 --> 40:58.940
 I'm not suggesting, Lex, that everything the West has done

40:59.860 --> 41:03.020
 has been honorable or intelligent.

41:03.900 --> 41:06.260
 Fortunately, we live in a democracy.

41:06.260 --> 41:07.900
 We live in liberal regimes.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.180
 We live under rule of law,

41:10.180 --> 41:13.460
 liberal in the classical sense of rule of law,

41:13.460 --> 41:15.540
 not liberal in the leftist sense.

41:17.060 --> 41:20.400
 We live in places like that and we can criticize ourselves.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.940
 And we can criticize the mistakes that we made

41:22.940 --> 41:26.820
 or the policy choices or the inactions that were taken.

41:26.820 --> 41:30.580
 And there are a whole lot of things to answer for.

41:30.580 --> 41:35.580
 And you can now discuss the ones that are your favorites,

41:36.780 --> 41:39.380
 the dishonor or the mistakes.

41:39.380 --> 41:42.540
 And I could discuss mine and we could spend

41:42.540 --> 41:44.940
 the whole rest of our meeting today

41:44.940 --> 41:47.260
 discussing the West's mistakes and problems.

41:47.260 --> 41:49.660
 And we won't end up in prison for it.

41:49.660 --> 41:53.540
 Yeah, Lex, and so I'm thankful for that.

41:53.540 --> 41:55.680
 And I'm thankful that people may disagree

41:55.680 --> 41:57.180
 and that people make the argument

41:57.180 --> 41:59.660
 that NATO expansion is to blame.

41:59.660 --> 42:02.820
 But you see, I'm countering two arguments here.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.960
 I'm countering one argument,

42:04.960 --> 42:08.700
 which is very deeply popular, pervasive,

42:08.700 --> 42:13.180
 about how Russia has this cultural tendency to aggression.

42:13.180 --> 42:16.140
 And it can help, but invade its neighbors

42:16.140 --> 42:17.620
 and it does it again and again.

42:17.620 --> 42:21.020
 And it's eternal Russian imperialism

42:21.020 --> 42:23.080
 and you have to watch out for it.

42:23.080 --> 42:26.060
 This very popular argument in the Baltic States,

42:26.060 --> 42:28.500
 it's really popular in Warsaw.

42:28.500 --> 42:31.720
 It's really popular with the liberal interventionists

42:31.720 --> 42:34.380
 and it's very, very popular with those

42:34.380 --> 42:36.620
 who were part of the Iraq war squad

42:36.620 --> 42:39.100
 that got us into that mess.

42:39.100 --> 42:40.660
 So I'm against that.

42:40.660 --> 42:43.500
 And the reason I'm against it is because it's not true.

42:43.500 --> 42:44.760
 It's empirically false.

42:44.760 --> 42:47.560
 There is no cultural trait,

42:47.560 --> 42:50.540
 inherent tendency for Russia to be aggressive.

42:50.540 --> 42:53.140
 It's a strategic choice that they make.

42:53.140 --> 42:55.060
 Every time it's a choice made,

42:55.060 --> 42:56.540
 it's not some kind of momentum.

42:56.540 --> 42:59.500
 Every time it's a choice that we should judge

42:59.500 --> 43:01.300
 for the choice that it is for the decision.

43:01.300 --> 43:03.100
 And therefore they could make different choices.

43:03.100 --> 43:06.020
 They could say, we don't have to stand up to the West.

43:06.020 --> 43:08.800
 We don't have the capabilities to do that.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.580
 We can still be a great country.

43:10.580 --> 43:13.180
 We can still be a civilization unto itself.

43:13.180 --> 43:15.140
 We can still be Russia.

43:15.140 --> 43:18.500
 We can still worship in Orthodox cathedrals

43:18.500 --> 43:21.940
 or we can still be ourselves,

43:21.940 --> 43:25.960
 but we don't have to pursue this chimerical pursuit,

43:25.960 --> 43:29.260
 this elusive quest to stand up to the West

43:29.260 --> 43:31.940
 and be in the first ranks of powers.

43:31.940 --> 43:33.420
 So I'm countering that argument.

43:33.420 --> 43:36.820
 I'm saying it's perpetual geopolitics.

43:36.820 --> 43:40.740
 It's a geopolitical choice rising out of this dilemma

43:40.740 --> 43:44.960
 of the mismatch between aspirations and capabilities.

43:44.960 --> 43:47.980
 It's not eternal Russian imperialism.

43:47.980 --> 43:51.020
 And I'm also countering the other argument here, Lex,

43:51.020 --> 43:53.860
 which is to say that it's the West's fault.

43:53.860 --> 43:56.180
 It's Western imperialism.

43:56.180 --> 43:57.940
 I'm very popular on the left,

43:57.940 --> 44:00.580
 very popular with realist scholars,

44:00.580 --> 44:02.340
 very popular with some of the people

44:02.340 --> 44:04.860
 recently on your podcast.

44:04.860 --> 44:08.420
 And so it's neither eternal Russian imperialism

44:08.420 --> 44:11.260
 nor is it Western imperialism, right?

44:11.260 --> 44:14.700
 The mere fact that the West is stronger than Russia

44:14.700 --> 44:17.900
 is not a crime on the part of the West.

44:17.900 --> 44:21.380
 It's not a crime that countries voluntarily

44:21.380 --> 44:24.300
 wanna join the West, that beg to get in,

44:24.300 --> 44:29.300
 either the EU or NATO or other bilateral alliances

44:29.860 --> 44:31.620
 or other trade agreements.

44:31.620 --> 44:35.860
 Those are voluntarily entered into and that's not criminal.

44:35.860 --> 44:37.780
 If the West's sphere of influence,

44:37.780 --> 44:41.580
 which is open, an open sphere of influence,

44:41.580 --> 44:43.840
 which as I say, people voluntarily join,

44:43.840 --> 44:46.220
 if that expands, that's not a crime,

44:46.220 --> 44:49.740
 nor is that a threat to Russia, ipso facto, right?

44:49.740 --> 44:52.020
 NATO is a defensive alliance

44:52.020 --> 44:54.020
 and the countries are largely pacifists

44:54.020 --> 44:55.660
 who are members of NATO.

44:55.660 --> 44:57.340
 And NATO doesn't attack,

44:57.340 --> 45:00.700
 it defends members if they are attacked.

45:00.700 --> 45:04.380
 And so the idea that Ukraine, which had the legal right,

45:04.380 --> 45:08.340
 might wanna join NATO and the EU,

45:08.340 --> 45:10.980
 which was not gonna happen in our lifetimes

45:10.980 --> 45:13.380
 and was not a direct threat to the Putin regime

45:13.380 --> 45:18.380
 since the Western countries that make up the EU and NATO

45:21.260 --> 45:24.340
 decided that Ukraine was not ready for membership,

45:24.340 --> 45:26.780
 there was no consensus, it was not gonna happen,

45:26.780 --> 45:31.420
 but it's Ukraine's free choice to express that desire.

45:31.420 --> 45:34.300
 And if your government is elected by your people,

45:34.300 --> 45:39.020
 freely elected, meaning you can unelect that government

45:39.020 --> 45:40.820
 in the next election,

45:40.820 --> 45:43.500
 and that government makes foreign policy choices

45:43.500 --> 45:46.960
 on the basis of its perceived interests,

45:46.960 --> 45:50.220
 that's not a crime, Lex, that's not a provocation,

45:50.220 --> 45:52.660
 that's not something that compels the leader

45:52.660 --> 45:55.960
 of another country to invade you, right?

45:55.960 --> 45:59.100
 That is legal under international law,

45:59.100 --> 46:02.100
 and it's also a realist fact of life.

46:02.100 --> 46:06.780
 The realists like to tell you that Russia here

46:06.780 --> 46:10.500
 was disrespected, Russia's interests were not taken

46:10.500 --> 46:12.340
 into account, et cetera, et cetera,

46:12.340 --> 46:15.140
 but the real world works in such a way

46:15.140 --> 46:19.060
 that treaties matter, that international law matters.

46:19.060 --> 46:21.380
 That's why people like me were not in favor

46:21.380 --> 46:25.820
 of the US 2003 invasion of Iraq, Lex,

46:25.820 --> 46:29.240
 because it wasn't legal, in addition to the fact

46:29.240 --> 46:31.100
 that we thought it might backfire.

46:32.020 --> 46:35.420
 But you know, Lex, like I said, there are a lot of things

46:35.420 --> 46:38.900
 about the West that we ought to criticize as citizens,

46:38.900 --> 46:42.660
 and we do criticize, but we have to be clear

46:42.660 --> 46:47.340
 about where responsibility lies in these events

46:47.340 --> 46:48.780
 that we're talking about today.

46:48.780 --> 46:51.940
 So you get into trouble, it's largely erroneous

46:51.940 --> 46:56.140
 to think about both the West or the United States

46:56.140 --> 46:58.500
 from an imperialist perspective and Russia

46:58.500 --> 47:00.340
 from an imperialist perspective.

47:00.340 --> 47:04.000
 It's better, clearer to think about each individual

47:04.000 --> 47:07.380
 aggressive decision on its own as a choice that was made.

47:07.380 --> 47:10.580
 So let's talk about the most recent choice

47:10.580 --> 47:12.220
 made by Vladimir Putin.

47:14.140 --> 47:17.880
 The choice to invade Ukraine, or to escalate

47:17.880 --> 47:22.800
 the invasion of Ukraine on February 24th, 2022.

47:22.800 --> 47:26.820
 Now we're a few months removed from that decision,

47:26.820 --> 47:30.580
 initial decision, why do you think he did it?

47:30.580 --> 47:35.580
 What are the errors in understanding the situation,

47:35.580 --> 47:40.580
 in calculating the outcomes, and everything else

47:40.620 --> 47:42.660
 about this decision in your view?

47:42.660 --> 47:47.660
 Yeah, Lex, when a war doesn't go well,

47:48.140 --> 47:52.380
 it looks like lunacy to have launched it in the first place.

47:52.380 --> 47:54.140
 Does it ever go well?

47:54.140 --> 47:56.820
 War never goes according to plan.

47:56.820 --> 47:59.900
 All war is based upon miscalculation,

47:59.900 --> 48:03.780
 but not everybody is punished for their miscalculation.

48:03.780 --> 48:07.620
 All aggressive war we're talking about, not defensive war,

48:07.620 --> 48:10.140
 is based upon miscalculation.

48:10.140 --> 48:13.660
 But you can adjust, you can recalibrate.

48:13.660 --> 48:15.700
 You know, when you're driving down the road

48:15.700 --> 48:18.420
 and that very annoying voice is telling you

48:18.420 --> 48:23.260
 in a thousand feet, make a right,

48:23.260 --> 48:26.340
 and you fail to make a right, it recalibrates, right?

48:26.340 --> 48:29.740
 It tells you, okay, now go turn around,

48:29.740 --> 48:31.860
 or U turn, or make a left.

48:31.860 --> 48:33.980
 It doesn't say you're an idiot in turn around

48:33.980 --> 48:37.020
 and make a U turn, but it does recalibrate.

48:37.020 --> 48:39.220
 So you can miscalculate, and the problem

48:39.220 --> 48:41.140
 is not the miscalculation usually,

48:41.140 --> 48:45.420
 it's the failure to do that adjustment, right?

48:45.420 --> 48:49.140
 People I know who are hedge fund traders,

48:50.340 --> 48:52.860
 I ask them, you know, what's your favorite trade?

48:52.860 --> 48:55.260
 And the line from the mall, and this is a cliche,

48:55.260 --> 48:58.940
 is my favorite trade is when I made a mistake,

48:58.940 --> 49:02.660
 but I got out early before all the carnage.

49:02.660 --> 49:04.820
 So their favorite trade is not when they made

49:04.820 --> 49:08.700
 some brilliant choice, but it's when they miscalculated

49:08.700 --> 49:12.100
 but they reduce the consequences of their miscalculation

49:12.100 --> 49:14.820
 by recalibrating quickly, right?

49:14.820 --> 49:16.700
 So let's talk about the calculation

49:16.700 --> 49:19.380
 and miscalculation of February.

49:19.380 --> 49:21.740
 Let's imagine, Lex, that you've been getting away

49:21.740 --> 49:26.460
 with murder, I don't mean murder in a figurative sense.

49:26.460 --> 49:28.780
 I mean, you've been murdering people,

49:28.780 --> 49:30.780
 you've been murdering them domestically,

49:30.780 --> 49:33.820
 and you've been murdering them all across Europe,

49:33.820 --> 49:38.820
 and you've been murdering them not just with, for example,

49:38.820 --> 49:41.820
 a car accident, a staged car accident,

49:41.820 --> 49:44.820
 or using a handgun, you use Novichok,

49:47.700 --> 49:51.860
 or you use some other internationally outlawed

49:51.860 --> 49:53.100
 chemical weapon.

49:54.620 --> 49:56.660
 And let's imagine that you did it

49:56.660 --> 49:58.820
 and nothing happened to you.

49:58.820 --> 50:01.380
 It wasn't like you were removed from power,

50:01.380 --> 50:04.020
 it wasn't like you paid a personal price.

50:04.020 --> 50:06.900
 Sure, maybe there was some sanctions on your economy,

50:06.900 --> 50:09.620
 but you didn't pay the price of those sanctions.

50:09.620 --> 50:12.620
 Little people paid the price of those sanctions.

50:12.620 --> 50:15.820
 Other people in your country paid the price.

50:15.820 --> 50:19.580
 Let's imagine not only were you murdering people literally,

50:19.580 --> 50:24.580
 but you decided to entice the idiotic ruler of Georgia

50:24.580 --> 50:29.580
 into a provocation that you could then invade the country.

50:30.060 --> 50:31.540
 And you invaded the country

50:31.540 --> 50:33.900
 and you bit off these territories,

50:33.900 --> 50:36.460
 Abkhazia and South Ossetia,

50:36.460 --> 50:38.300
 and what price did you pay for that?

50:39.260 --> 50:41.300
 And then you decided, you know,

50:41.300 --> 50:45.740
 I think I'll now invade Crimea and forcibly annex Crimea,

50:45.740 --> 50:49.700
 and I'll instigate an insurrection in the Donbass

50:49.700 --> 50:51.420
 in Eastern Ukraine.

50:51.420 --> 50:54.660
 In Luhansk. Let's imagine you did all that

50:54.660 --> 50:56.900
 and then you had to stick out your wrist

50:56.900 --> 51:00.940
 so that, you know, it could be slapped a couple of times.

51:00.940 --> 51:04.420
 And you said, you know, I can pretty much do what I want.

51:05.300 --> 51:07.660
 They're putting a sanction here and there

51:07.660 --> 51:09.860
 and they're doing this and they're doing that.

51:09.860 --> 51:11.180
 And you know what?

51:11.180 --> 51:14.180
 They're more energy dependent on me than before.

51:14.180 --> 51:17.260
 I got better money laundering and reputation services

51:17.260 --> 51:18.740
 than anybody had.

51:18.740 --> 51:21.740
 Maybe the Middle East and the Chinese would disagree with you

51:21.740 --> 51:24.340
 that you have better than them, but yours are pretty good.

51:24.340 --> 51:27.220
 And the Panama Papers get released,

51:27.220 --> 51:31.140
 revealing all of your offshoring and your corruption

51:31.140 --> 51:33.500
 and what happened, nothing happens, Lex.

51:33.500 --> 51:36.900
 So the first and most important consideration here is,

51:36.900 --> 51:41.100
 in your own mind, you've been getting away with murder,

51:41.100 --> 51:43.620
 literally, as well as figuratively,

51:43.620 --> 51:44.940
 and you think, you know,

51:44.940 --> 51:47.060
 I probably should have done that.

51:47.060 --> 51:50.380
 You think, you know, I probably can do something again

51:50.380 --> 51:51.460
 and get away with it.

51:52.340 --> 51:55.980
 And so the failure to respond at scale,

51:55.980 --> 51:58.620
 in fact, the indulgences,

51:58.620 --> 52:01.780
 the further dependencies that are introduced,

52:01.780 --> 52:05.580
 the illusion that trade is the mechanism

52:05.580 --> 52:08.340
 to manage authoritarian regimes.

52:08.340 --> 52:11.180
 You know, that great German cliche,

52:11.180 --> 52:16.180
 Wandel durch Handel, right, change through trade

52:16.700 --> 52:18.420
 or transformation through trade,

52:18.420 --> 52:21.980
 one of Angela Merkel's favorite expressions, right?

52:21.980 --> 52:25.660
 You're gonna get the other side to be better

52:26.740 --> 52:31.700
 rather than confront them in a Cold War fashion

52:31.700 --> 52:33.580
 where you stand up to their aggressions

52:33.580 --> 52:35.140
 and you punish them severely

52:35.140 --> 52:37.620
 in order to deter further behavior.

52:37.620 --> 52:39.740
 So that's the first and most important part

52:39.740 --> 52:41.580
 of the calculation, miscalculation.

52:41.580 --> 52:42.940
 There are a lot of other dimensions.

52:42.940 --> 52:44.780
 So can we pause on that really quick?

52:45.780 --> 52:49.740
 So this is kind of idea of it's okay to crack a few eggs

52:49.740 --> 52:53.420
 to make an omelet, which is a more generous description

52:53.420 --> 52:54.660
 of what you're saying,

52:55.580 --> 53:00.260
 that you don't incorporate into the calculation

53:00.260 --> 53:04.020
 the amount of human suffering that the decisions cause,

53:04.020 --> 53:08.620
 but instead you look at sort of the success

53:08.620 --> 53:11.860
 based on some kind of measure for you personally

53:11.860 --> 53:16.860
 and for the nation, not in terms of in a humanitarian sense,

53:17.700 --> 53:19.780
 but in some kind of economic sense

53:19.780 --> 53:22.460
 and a geopolitical power sense.

53:22.460 --> 53:25.580
 Yeah, you're not sentimental, Lex.

53:25.580 --> 53:30.580
 You say to yourself, the cause of Russian greatness

53:31.500 --> 53:34.020
 is greater than any individual life.

53:35.020 --> 53:38.500
 Russia being in the first rank of the great powers,

53:38.500 --> 53:43.500
 Russia realizing its mission to be a special country

53:44.580 --> 53:46.260
 with a special mission in the world,

53:46.260 --> 53:48.260
 a civilization unto itself,

53:49.580 --> 53:51.940
 the first rank of the great powers,

53:51.940 --> 53:53.940
 maybe even the greatest power.

53:53.940 --> 53:58.060
 That's worth the price that we have to pay,

53:58.060 --> 54:00.980
 especially in other people's lives, right?

54:00.980 --> 54:03.820
 We have a lot of literature on the Putin regime,

54:03.820 --> 54:06.700
 which talks about the kleptocracy,

54:06.700 --> 54:10.380
 the place is a kleptocracy, and it is a kleptocracy.

54:11.420 --> 54:15.860
 We all can see that, and anybody in London,

54:15.860 --> 54:19.220
 living the high life, servicing this kleptocracy

54:19.220 --> 54:21.700
 can testify that it's a kleptocracy,

54:21.700 --> 54:23.620
 and not only in London, of course,

54:23.620 --> 54:25.900
 right here in the United States, in New York.

54:27.140 --> 54:30.820
 But you know, it's not only a kleptocracy, Lex.

54:30.820 --> 54:33.900
 That was the problem of the Russian studies literature.

54:33.900 --> 54:37.580
 It wasn't just about stealing, looting the state.

54:37.580 --> 54:39.900
 It was about Russian greatness.

54:39.900 --> 54:43.140
 You see those rituals in the Kremlin,

54:43.140 --> 54:45.460
 right in the Grand Kremlin Palace,

54:45.460 --> 54:47.740
 in the St. George's Hall,

54:47.740 --> 54:50.820
 some of the greatest interiors in the world,

54:50.820 --> 54:55.460
 and you see award ceremonies, and you see marking holidays,

54:55.460 --> 54:57.660
 and all of these looters of the state

54:57.660 --> 55:00.420
 have their uniforms on with their medals,

55:00.420 --> 55:03.060
 and someone's given a speech or singing

55:03.060 --> 55:05.980
 a ballad, and their eyes are moist.

55:07.180 --> 55:11.140
 Their eyes are moist because they're thieves and looters?

55:11.140 --> 55:15.660
 No, Lex, because they believe in Russian greatness.

55:15.660 --> 55:20.660
 They have a deep and fundamental passionate commitment

55:20.660 --> 55:22.700
 to the greatness of Russia,

55:22.700 --> 55:25.420
 which in unsentimental fashion,

55:25.420 --> 55:27.380
 they're all sentimental to the max.

55:27.380 --> 55:30.300
 That's why their eyes are moistening.

55:30.300 --> 55:34.260
 But they imagine unsentimentally that any sacrifice is okay,

55:34.260 --> 55:36.900
 a sacrifice of other people's lives,

55:36.900 --> 55:40.420
 a sacrifice of their conscripts in the military,

55:40.420 --> 55:44.780
 a sacrifice of Ukrainian women and children and elderly.

55:44.780 --> 55:48.860
 That's a small price to pay for those moist eyes

55:48.860 --> 55:52.340
 about Russian greatness and Russia's position in the world.

55:52.340 --> 55:54.940
 Well, that human thing, that sentimentality,

55:54.940 --> 55:56.180
 is the thing that can get us in trouble

55:56.180 --> 55:58.020
 in the United States as well,

55:58.020 --> 56:01.460
 and lead us to wars, the illegal wars and so on.

56:01.460 --> 56:02.620
 But the United States,

56:02.620 --> 56:07.140
 there's repercussions for breaking the law.

56:07.140 --> 56:09.900
 You're going to pay for illegal wars in the end.

56:09.900 --> 56:13.420
 You're saying that in authoritarian regimes,

56:13.420 --> 56:15.980
 the sentimentality can really get out of hand,

56:15.980 --> 56:17.860
 and you can, by charismatic leaders,

56:17.860 --> 56:21.660
 they can take that to manipulate the populace to make,

56:21.660 --> 56:25.340
 that in the span of history led to atrocities,

56:25.340 --> 56:30.100
 and in today's world, lead to humanitarian crises.

56:30.100 --> 56:33.260
 It's not just the kleptocracy, it's a belief system.

56:33.260 --> 56:35.900
 It's passion, it's conviction.

56:35.900 --> 56:39.380
 It's, you can call them illusions,

56:39.380 --> 56:41.500
 you can call them fantasies,

56:41.500 --> 56:44.140
 whatever you want to call them, they're real.

56:44.140 --> 56:45.860
 They're real for those people.

56:45.860 --> 56:48.960
 And so yes, they're looting that very state

56:48.960 --> 56:50.180
 that they're trying to make

56:50.180 --> 56:52.340
 one of the great powers in the world.

56:52.340 --> 56:55.860
 And they resent the fact that the West

56:55.860 --> 56:58.360
 doesn't acknowledge them as one of those great powers.

56:58.360 --> 57:01.200
 And they resent that the West is more powerful.

57:01.200 --> 57:05.900
 People talk about how Putin doesn't understand the world

57:05.900 --> 57:08.380
 and that he gets really bad information.

57:08.380 --> 57:10.740
 Lex, if you're sitting there in that Kremlin,

57:11.820 --> 57:14.260
 and you're trying to conduct business in the world,

57:14.260 --> 57:16.940
 and you're getting reports from your finance minister

57:16.940 --> 57:18.700
 or your central bank governor,

57:19.620 --> 57:21.900
 your whole economy, everything that matters,

57:21.900 --> 57:25.980
 somehow all your trade is denominated in dollars and euros.

57:27.860 --> 57:29.260
 Do you have any illusions

57:29.260 --> 57:32.740
 about who controls the international financial system?

57:32.740 --> 57:34.920
 I don't think so, Lex.

57:34.920 --> 57:39.520
 You're looking over your industrial plan for the next year,

57:39.520 --> 57:42.340
 and you're looking over how many tanks you're gonna get,

57:42.340 --> 57:44.580
 and how many cruise missiles you're gonna get,

57:44.580 --> 57:46.580
 and how many submarines you're gonna get,

57:46.580 --> 57:49.620
 and fill in the blank.

57:49.620 --> 57:51.180
 And you know what?

57:51.180 --> 57:53.060
 It says right there in the paperwork

57:53.060 --> 57:54.940
 where the component parts come from,

57:54.940 --> 57:56.860
 where the software comes from,

57:56.860 --> 57:59.020
 comes from the West, Lex.

57:59.020 --> 58:01.220
 Your whole military industrial complex

58:01.220 --> 58:04.160
 is dependent on high end Western technology.

58:05.060 --> 58:08.620
 And let's say you're in Beijing, not just in Moscow,

58:08.620 --> 58:11.580
 and you go to a meeting in your own neighborhood.

58:11.580 --> 58:13.420
 You're the leader of China.

58:13.420 --> 58:16.860
 You go to a meeting with other Asian leaders.

58:16.860 --> 58:19.900
 Do they all speak in Chinese with you?

58:19.900 --> 58:22.800
 No, Lex, they don't speak Chinese.

58:22.800 --> 58:25.420
 You go to an international meeting as the leader of China,

58:25.420 --> 58:29.080
 and guess what language is the main language of intercourse?

58:29.080 --> 58:31.960
 Yes, the same one you and I are speaking right now.

58:32.980 --> 58:34.740
 And so you live in that world.

58:34.740 --> 58:36.220
 You live in the Western world,

58:36.220 --> 58:38.580
 and it's very hard to have illusions

58:38.580 --> 58:40.580
 about what world you live in.

58:40.580 --> 58:44.260
 When you're under that, you need those Western banks.

58:44.260 --> 58:46.780
 You need that foreign currency, right?

58:46.780 --> 58:48.960
 You need that high end Western technology,

58:48.960 --> 58:51.020
 that technology transfer.

58:51.020 --> 58:53.220
 You're speaking, or you're forced to speak,

58:53.220 --> 58:54.920
 or your minions are forced to speak

58:54.920 --> 58:57.380
 at international gatherings in English.

58:57.380 --> 58:58.600
 And I could go on.

58:58.600 --> 59:01.200
 All the indicators that you live in.

59:01.200 --> 59:02.940
 And so Putin lives in that world.

59:02.940 --> 59:04.460
 He's no fool.

59:04.460 --> 59:07.340
 Well, to push back, isn't it possible that,

59:07.340 --> 59:11.020
 as you said, the minions operate in that world?

59:11.020 --> 59:14.020
 But can't you, if you're the leader of Russia,

59:14.020 --> 59:15.180
 or the leader of China,

59:15.180 --> 59:20.180
 or the leader of these different nations, still put up walls

59:20.700 --> 59:24.620
 where actually when you think in the privacy of your mind,

59:24.620 --> 59:27.540
 you exist not in the international world,

59:27.540 --> 59:30.260
 but in a world where there's this great Russian empire,

59:30.260 --> 59:32.500
 or this great Chinese empire,

59:32.500 --> 59:34.360
 and then you forget that there's English,

59:34.360 --> 59:36.900
 you forget that there's technology and iPhones,

59:36.900 --> 59:41.820
 you forget that there's all this US keeps popping up

59:41.820 --> 59:43.520
 on all different paperwork.

59:43.520 --> 59:46.620
 That just becomes the blurry details that dissipate,

59:46.620 --> 59:51.260
 because what matters is the greatness of this dream empire

59:51.260 --> 59:54.180
 that I have in my mind as a dictator.

59:54.180 --> 59:56.620
 I would put it this way, Lex.

59:56.620 --> 1:00:01.500
 After you absorb all of that from your minions,

1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:06.500
 and it impresses upon your consciousness where you live,

1:00:06.660 --> 1:00:09.500
 you live in a Western dominated world,

1:00:09.500 --> 1:00:12.660
 that the multipolar world doesn't exist.

1:00:12.660 --> 1:00:16.260
 Your goal is to make that multipolar world exist.

1:00:16.260 --> 1:00:19.140
 Your goal is to bring down the West.

1:00:19.140 --> 1:00:21.940
 Your goal is for the West to weaken.

1:00:21.940 --> 1:00:25.980
 Your goal is a currency other than the dollar and the euro.

1:00:25.980 --> 1:00:28.860
 Your goal is an international financial system

1:00:28.860 --> 1:00:30.220
 that you dominate.

1:00:30.220 --> 1:00:34.140
 Your goal is technological self sufficiency

1:00:34.140 --> 1:00:36.820
 made in China 2035, right?

1:00:36.820 --> 1:00:40.220
 Your goal is a world that you dominate,

1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:42.340
 not that the West dominates.

1:00:42.340 --> 1:00:45.080
 And you're gonna do everything you can

1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:47.660
 to try to attain that world,

1:00:47.660 --> 1:00:49.940
 which is a Russian centric world,

1:00:49.940 --> 1:00:52.180
 or a Chinese centric world,

1:00:52.180 --> 1:00:56.140
 or what we could call a Eurasian centric world.

1:00:56.140 --> 1:00:58.340
 And it's not gonna be easy, Lex,

1:00:58.340 --> 1:01:02.340
 just for the reasons that we enumerated before.

1:01:02.340 --> 1:01:04.780
 But maybe you're gonna get a helping hand.

1:01:04.780 --> 1:01:06.480
 Maybe the West is gonna transfer

1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:07.980
 their best technology to you.

1:01:07.980 --> 1:01:10.700
 They're gonna sell you their best stuff.

1:01:10.700 --> 1:01:13.700
 And then you're gonna absorb it,

1:01:13.700 --> 1:01:16.820
 and maybe copy it, and reverse engineer it.

1:01:16.820 --> 1:01:18.060
 And if they won't sell it to you,

1:01:18.060 --> 1:01:19.760
 maybe you'll just have to steal it.

1:01:21.020 --> 1:01:23.700
 Maybe the West is gonna allow you to bank,

1:01:23.700 --> 1:01:27.740
 even though you violate many laws

1:01:27.740 --> 1:01:29.100
 that would prohibit the West

1:01:29.100 --> 1:01:31.600
 from extending those banking services to you.

1:01:32.540 --> 1:01:35.500
 Maybe the West is gonna buy your energy,

1:01:35.500 --> 1:01:38.240
 and your palladium, and your titanium,

1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:40.460
 and your rare metals like lithium,

1:01:40.460 --> 1:01:44.560
 because you're willing to have your poor people

1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:48.660
 mine that stuff and die of disease at an early age.

1:01:48.660 --> 1:01:51.780
 But Western governments, they don't wanna do that.

1:01:51.780 --> 1:01:53.680
 They don't wanna do that dirty mining

1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:56.460
 of those very important rare earths.

1:01:56.460 --> 1:01:57.580
 But you're willing to do that

1:01:57.580 --> 1:02:00.100
 because it's just people whose lives you don't care about

1:02:00.100 --> 1:02:01.500
 as an autocratic regime, right?

1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:03.460
 So that's the world you live in

1:02:03.460 --> 1:02:07.040
 where you're trying to get to this other world.

1:02:07.040 --> 1:02:09.820
 You're at the center of the other world.

1:02:09.820 --> 1:02:11.200
 You dominate the other world.

1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:13.700
 But the only way to get there, Lex,

1:02:13.700 --> 1:02:18.420
 is the West has to weaken, divide itself,

1:02:18.420 --> 1:02:20.660
 maybe even collapse.

1:02:20.660 --> 1:02:25.120
 And so you're encouraging, to the extent possible,

1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:28.640
 Western divisions, Western disunity,

1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:33.540
 a Western lack of resolve, Western mistakes,

1:02:33.540 --> 1:02:36.660
 and Western invasion of the wrong country,

1:02:36.660 --> 1:02:39.780
 and Western destruction of its credibility

1:02:39.780 --> 1:02:41.980
 through international financial crises,

1:02:41.980 --> 1:02:44.140
 and one could go on.

1:02:44.140 --> 1:02:47.980
 So if the West weakens itself through its mistakes

1:02:47.980 --> 1:02:51.160
 and its own corruption, you're gonna survive

1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:54.380
 and maybe even come out into that world

1:02:54.380 --> 1:02:55.940
 where you're the center.

1:02:55.940 --> 1:02:58.620
 And so Russia's entire grand strategy,

1:02:58.620 --> 1:03:00.500
 just like China's grand strategy,

1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:03.060
 Iran, it's hard to say they have a grand strategy

1:03:03.060 --> 1:03:06.660
 because they're so profoundly weak.

1:03:06.660 --> 1:03:11.660
 But Russia's grand strategy is, we're a mess.

1:03:11.700 --> 1:03:14.120
 We don't invest in our human capital.

1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:17.860
 Our human capital flees, or we actually drive it out.

1:03:17.860 --> 1:03:21.060
 It goes to MIT, like you did,

1:03:21.060 --> 1:03:23.680
 or it goes to fill in the blank, right?

1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:25.720
 We can't invest in our people.

1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:27.420
 Our healthcare is terrible.

1:03:27.420 --> 1:03:30.560
 Our education system is in decline.

1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:33.300
 We don't build infrastructure, Lex.

1:03:33.300 --> 1:03:35.960
 We don't improve our governance.

1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:39.580
 We don't invest in those attributes of modern power

1:03:39.580 --> 1:03:41.180
 that make the West powerful.

1:03:42.020 --> 1:03:46.140
 We can't because when we try, the money is stolen.

1:03:46.140 --> 1:03:50.300
 We try these grandiose projects of national projects,

1:03:50.300 --> 1:03:51.140
 they're called.

1:03:51.140 --> 1:03:52.340
 We're gonna invest in higher ed.

1:03:52.340 --> 1:03:54.520
 We're gonna invest in high tech.

1:03:54.520 --> 1:03:57.780
 We're gonna build our own Silicon Valley

1:03:57.780 --> 1:03:58.780
 known as Skolkovo.

1:03:58.780 --> 1:04:01.460
 We're gonna do all those things, and what happens?

1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:02.980
 They can't even build an airport

1:04:02.980 --> 1:04:04.740
 without the money disappearing.

1:04:04.740 --> 1:04:06.640
 The Sochi Olympics, Lex,

1:04:08.260 --> 1:04:11.060
 officially cost them $50 billion.

1:04:11.060 --> 1:04:14.220
 You look around at the infrastructure that endured

1:04:14.220 --> 1:04:18.500
 from that $50 billion expense, and you're thinking,

1:04:18.500 --> 1:04:20.940
 that's like the Second Avenue subway.

1:04:20.940 --> 1:04:22.840
 You get almost nothing for your money.

1:04:23.700 --> 1:04:25.860
 And so, yeah, it's corruption, Lex,

1:04:25.860 --> 1:04:28.660
 but it's also because they don't wanna do that.

1:04:28.660 --> 1:04:31.280
 They don't wanna invest in their people.

1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:33.480
 They couldn't do it if they wanted to,

1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:36.260
 and when they try, it doesn't work.

1:04:36.260 --> 1:04:38.320
 But why invest in your own people?

1:04:39.180 --> 1:04:43.360
 Invest in your hardware, your military hardware, right?

1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:47.400
 Invest in your cyber capabilities.

1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:51.400
 Invest in all your spoilation techniques and your hard power,

1:04:52.260 --> 1:04:57.260
 and invest in further corrupting, and further weakening,

1:04:57.820 --> 1:05:01.300
 and further dividing the West, because as I said,

1:05:01.300 --> 1:05:05.120
 if the West is weak, divided, lacking resolve,

1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:06.800
 you don't invest in your people,

1:05:06.800 --> 1:05:08.260
 you don't build infrastructure,

1:05:08.260 --> 1:05:09.700
 you don't improve your governance,

1:05:09.700 --> 1:05:11.580
 but you'll muddle through.

1:05:11.580 --> 1:05:13.540
 That's Russian grand strategy.

1:05:13.540 --> 1:05:18.100
 So invest in the hard power, weaken the West.

1:05:18.100 --> 1:05:21.340
 Those combined together means you're going to be

1:05:21.340 --> 1:05:24.500
 heavily incentivized to escalate

1:05:24.500 --> 1:05:28.540
 any military aggressive conflicts that are around you,

1:05:28.540 --> 1:05:30.140
 or create new ones, or just.

1:05:30.140 --> 1:05:32.620
 If you can get away with murder.

1:05:32.620 --> 1:05:34.500
 But what happens, Lex,

1:05:34.500 --> 1:05:37.780
 if it's a Harry Truman like response?

1:05:37.780 --> 1:05:39.500
 What happens if somebody says,

1:05:39.500 --> 1:05:42.060
 you know, we're gonna stand up to this?

1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:45.420
 We're not gonna allow this to happen.

1:05:45.420 --> 1:05:47.760
 We're not gonna launder your money anymore.

1:05:49.060 --> 1:05:52.000
 We're not gonna be dependent on you for energy

1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.880
 in the long term, we're gonna make a transition.

1:05:56.100 --> 1:05:59.380
 We're gonna punish you for that kind of behavior instead.

1:05:59.380 --> 1:06:02.860
 And the West is now switched to that

1:06:02.860 --> 1:06:07.860
 only because of the courage

1:06:07.980 --> 1:06:10.820
 and ingenuity of the Ukrainian people.

1:06:10.820 --> 1:06:15.060
 The Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression

1:06:15.940 --> 1:06:20.020
 was one of the greatest gifts the West has ever received.

1:06:20.020 --> 1:06:23.660
 The sacrifices that the Ukrainians are making,

1:06:23.660 --> 1:06:25.360
 right now as we speak,

1:06:25.360 --> 1:06:30.360
 meaning they're fighting a war by themselves

1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:34.780
 against a major military power, their neighbor Russia.

1:06:36.100 --> 1:06:37.840
 Nobody's fighting it with them.

1:06:37.840 --> 1:06:41.260
 Yes, we are giving them weapons

1:06:41.260 --> 1:06:43.220
 so they can conduct self defense,

1:06:43.220 --> 1:06:45.760
 which by the way is legal under international law.

1:06:46.660 --> 1:06:48.060
 Unlike the Russian invasion,

1:06:48.060 --> 1:06:50.960
 which is illegal under international law,

1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:54.180
 Western supply of weapons, including heavy weapons,

1:06:54.180 --> 1:06:56.940
 including offensive weapons to Ukraine

1:06:56.940 --> 1:06:59.860
 for its self defense in the invasion by Russia

1:06:59.860 --> 1:07:01.320
 is actually legal under,

1:07:01.320 --> 1:07:06.320
 and so thank God the Ukrainians surprised everybody.

1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:11.120
 They surprised me, they surprised Putin and the Kremlin,

1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:13.120
 they surprised the Biden administration,

1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:15.840
 they surprised the European Union,

1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:18.840
 not with the fact that they would resist.

1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:20.400
 We knew that.

1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:23.400
 We had the Orange Revolution in 2004,

1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:26.840
 we had Maidan in 2013, 14,

1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:31.320
 where they rose up against a domestic tyrant

1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:33.480
 and they were willing to die

1:07:33.480 --> 1:07:35.360
 on behalf of their country then,

1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:37.600
 let alone against a foreign tyrant

1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:39.560
 invading their country, right?

1:07:39.560 --> 1:07:40.840
 So we knew they would resist.

1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:43.000
 We didn't know just how successful,

1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:44.480
 certainly I didn't know,

1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:46.040
 they would be on the battlefield.

1:07:46.040 --> 1:07:48.240
 It's been breathtaking to watch.

1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:52.400
 That sacrifice, that gift enabled the West

1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:55.800
 to rediscover itself, to rediscover its power,

1:07:55.800 --> 1:07:59.900
 to revive itself, to say to hell with this energy dependence

1:07:59.900 --> 1:08:00.740
 in the long term,

1:08:00.740 --> 1:08:04.180
 to hell with this money laundering and reputation laundering,

1:08:04.180 --> 1:08:07.240
 to hell with this running back and forth to Moscow

1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:09.160
 to try to see what Putin needs

1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:11.600
 in order for him to feel respected,

1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:13.120
 what appeasement he needs, right?

1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:16.920
 So we'll see if it endures,

1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:20.960
 but this shift comes from the Ukrainians.

1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:23.640
 And so it's no longer getting away with murder, Lex,

1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:25.640
 and we thank the Ukrainians for that.

1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:27.680
 The people and the leadership

1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:32.680
 and the separate factions that make up Ukraine uniting,

1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:37.080
 it's the unification, the uniting against the common enemy

1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:40.320
 and standing up before anyone knew

1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:43.140
 that they would be backed by all of these other nations,

1:08:43.140 --> 1:08:45.180
 by this money and all this kind of stuff,

1:08:45.180 --> 1:08:49.160
 standing there, especially with the president Zelensky,

1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:54.160
 where it makes total sense to flee, he stood his ground.

1:08:54.340 --> 1:08:55.180
 And...

1:08:55.180 --> 1:08:56.920
 Let's take that point that you just raised,

1:08:56.920 --> 1:08:58.720
 which is a deep and fundamental point,

1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:00.640
 and I thank you for that.

1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:01.920
 Do you guys hear that?

1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:03.040
 I think that was a compliment.

1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:03.880
 There we go.

1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:05.080
 Let's go.

1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:05.920
 Lex.

1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:07.120
 Zelensky or unification, what do you say?

1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:08.660
 I'm sitting here in front of you.

1:09:08.660 --> 1:09:09.500
 Thank you.

1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:10.340
 It's an honor.

1:09:10.340 --> 1:09:11.760
 And it's a mutual honor.

1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:17.020
 So, Ukraine before the war

1:09:17.020 --> 1:09:20.640
 is run by a TV production company, right?

1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:24.480
 You're one guy running this fantastic, incredible podcast.

1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:28.640
 There's 20 guys or so running a country the size of Ukraine.

1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:32.320
 And one's a producer and one's like a makeup person

1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:35.040
 and one's a video editor.

1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:38.680
 And they're fantastically talented people

1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:42.120
 if your country is a TV production.

1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:47.120
 So before the war, Zelensky had what, 25% approval rating

1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:50.320
 and he couldn't get much done and it wasn't working.

1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:53.320
 He got elected with 73%, as you know,

1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:56.600
 and then he was down to 20, that's a pretty big drop.

1:09:56.600 --> 1:10:00.060
 And so you're thinking maybe having a major,

1:10:00.060 --> 1:10:05.000
 large size, 40 million plus population European country

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:09.800
 run by a TV production company is not the best choice.

1:10:09.800 --> 1:10:11.560
 And then what do we see?

1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:16.400
 We see President Zelensky decides to risk his life

1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:18.720
 on behalf of his country, Ukraine.

1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:21.720
 He decides to stay in the capital.

1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:25.620
 He's not gonna flee, they're gonna stay and fight.

1:10:25.620 --> 1:10:27.800
 And he could be killed, he can die.

1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:30.320
 It's a decision where he put his life on the line.

1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:35.820
 Obviously, he's Jewish descent,

1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:40.880
 Russian speaking childhood and upbringing,

1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:44.520
 Russian speaking Jewish descent puts his life on the line

1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:46.520
 for the country of Ukraine.

1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:49.660
 It's a pretty big message, don't you think?

1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:51.400
 And it's crucial.

1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:54.520
 And it turns out not only that, Lex,

1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:56.760
 but they're good at TV.

1:10:56.760 --> 1:10:59.000
 They're good at information war.

1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:02.740
 And in a war, it's a TV production company

1:11:02.740 --> 1:11:06.240
 and a TV personality, that's exactly what you want

1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:09.600
 running a country because they're crushing

1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:11.320
 in the information war.

1:11:11.320 --> 1:11:15.440
 And he's spectacular, European Parliament,

1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:18.900
 US Congress, Israeli Parliament.

1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:22.960
 There's no room on Zoom, let alone in person

1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:26.360
 that he can't win over, he's just so effective.

1:11:26.360 --> 1:11:29.680
 You know, this is the first time reality TV

1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:33.360
 has been about reality instead of fake.

1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:37.080
 Reality TV is just this completely fake nonsense.

1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:41.040
 But Zelensky, this is real reality TV.

1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:45.760
 And he means it and the nation is behind him

1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:48.800
 and they're just as courageous and just as ingenious

1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:52.420
 in many ways and it's spectacular.

1:11:52.420 --> 1:11:55.640
 And so, yeah, who saw that coming?

1:11:55.640 --> 1:11:57.720
 I didn't see that coming, Lex.

1:11:57.720 --> 1:12:01.220
 In fact, the Biden, we talk about Putin's miscalculation.

1:12:01.220 --> 1:12:04.040
 The Biden administration, as you alluded to,

1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:06.720
 offered him an exit from the country.

1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:09.280
 They didn't say, you know, you wanna stand and fight,

1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:10.600
 we'll back you.

1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:14.080
 They said, we'll get you out, you wanna come now?

1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:16.840
 And famously, you know that quote, right?

1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:20.680
 What he said about how he doesn't need a ride.

1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:22.720
 Remember that moment?

1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:25.560
 The Biden administration was poised

1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:28.760
 to do another Afghanistan moment.

1:12:28.760 --> 1:12:32.360
 That ignominious exit from Afghanistan

1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:35.000
 was almost what happened in Ukraine

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:38.320
 when Biden administration offered him

1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:39.880
 that ride out of there.

1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:43.080
 And fortunately, he declined and helped rally

1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:45.640
 and the people from below also rallied

1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:48.640
 to stop the invader without the presidency

1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:50.880
 and without the government in Ukraine,

1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:53.000
 saving the Biden administration

1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.240
 and the European leaders who latched on.

1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:58.640
 Fortunately, they had the presence of mind

1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:00.400
 to latch onto this gift,

1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:04.480
 this bravery and ingeniousness of Zelensky

1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:07.400
 and the rest of the Ukrainians and flipped

1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:11.040
 and decided to support Ukraine's resistance,

1:13:11.040 --> 1:13:13.800
 you know, first with 5,000 helmets only

1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:16.720
 as the Germans initially promised

1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:19.600
 and now with really heavy weapons.

1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:22.880
 And so that's something that wasn't foreseen.

1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:24.680
 I certainly didn't foresee that.

1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:28.960
 I foresaw the Ukrainian society being courageous

1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:31.920
 and resisting, but I didn't foresee

1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:35.560
 a television production company being exactly

1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:38.520
 what you want to run a country in a war,

1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:42.840
 a president Zelensky willing to sacrifice,

1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:45.400
 lay down his life and rallying others

1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:47.240
 in the country to do that.

1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:50.160
 And then the country being so effective,

1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:55.160
 not just at a courage, but at battlefield resistance

1:13:55.360 --> 1:13:56.920
 to the Russian invasion.

1:13:56.920 --> 1:13:59.320
 So I stand corrected by the Ukrainians

1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:03.280
 and I'm ecstatic that I was wrong,

1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:04.480
 that I was proven wrong.

1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:07.320
 And like I said, there's clear factions

1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:09.120
 of the West and the East of Ukraine

1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:11.400
 and here's a person that, like you said,

1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:16.240
 was in the high 20s, low 30s percentage approval

1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:17.720
 in the country before the war

1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:22.160
 and now was able to use in the 90s.

1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:24.800
 He's in the 90% approval rating.

1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:29.800
 I mean, I think they stopped doing the polling.

1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:33.600
 Once he hit 91% or whatever it was in the previous poll,

1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:35.720
 I think they all understood that for now

1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:38.080
 they didn't need any more polling,

1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:39.640
 that it's pretty clear the nation.

1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:43.320
 So 25% to 90 something percent.

1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:47.120
 And just like the 25% was deserved,

1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:50.600
 the 90 something percent is also deserved, fully deserved.

1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:55.080
 And the question is how that all stabilizes, it feels

1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:58.800
 like this set of events,

1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:02.400
 I may be paying attention to Twitter too much,

1:15:02.400 --> 1:15:07.400
 which is a concern of mine, whether the change I see

1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:11.400
 is just surface level or deep level.

1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:13.760
 But it seems like we're in a new world,

1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:15.720
 that something dramatic has shifted.

1:15:15.720 --> 1:15:20.720
 That this power that's rooted,

1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:25.560
 I mean, in your study of the 20th century,

1:15:25.560 --> 1:15:27.160
 it's so deeply rooted in history,

1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:29.560
 there's this power center of the world

1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:33.560
 is now going to, has been shaken by this event.

1:15:33.560 --> 1:15:37.880
 And how that changes the world is unclear.

1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:40.840
 It's unclear what lesson China learns from watching this,

1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:43.120
 what lesson India learns from watching this.

1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:45.520
 Both nations, as far as you can get polls

1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:49.280
 about Chinese population, but both nations

1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:51.800
 are largely in support of Putin.

1:15:51.800 --> 1:15:55.080
 So Russia, India, and China are still

1:15:55.080 --> 1:15:57.440
 supporting of Putin quietly.

1:15:57.440 --> 1:16:02.440
 I would maybe elaborate a little bit on that point, Lex.

1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:06.680
 I think you're right, the feeling that we're

1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:10.560
 in an inflection moment, an inflection point,

1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:12.520
 I think that's widespread.

1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:16.440
 And I think it's widespread for good reason, we might be.

1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:21.440
 But I also share your, let's say, modesty

1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:27.320
 about where it's going and how hard it is

1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:29.560
 to predict where this might go.

1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:33.880
 It's only an inflection point if the trends continue,

1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:36.120
 right, if the trends endure.

1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:38.920
 There are plenty of non inflection points.

1:16:38.920 --> 1:16:41.320
 After 9 11, the whole world rallied

1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:44.880
 around the United States after it was attacked,

1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:48.520
 after the bombing of the towers here in New York City

1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:53.200
 and the hitting of the Pentagon, and that didn't last.

1:16:53.200 --> 1:16:56.600
 It was not really an inflection point, was it?

1:16:56.600 --> 1:16:59.640
 It felt like it might be, but it wasn't.

1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:01.800
 And so this is not a comparable moment

1:17:01.800 --> 1:17:06.560
 in terms of what happened, but it has the feeling

1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:08.120
 that it might be a watershed.

1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:12.400
 And maybe we'll squander it the way we squandered

1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:16.800
 the post 9 11, rallying around the United States.

1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:21.280
 Maybe we'll actually consolidate it and it'll endure,

1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:24.000
 or maybe it'll endure despite ourselves.

1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:26.760
 And we can't tell and we can't know yet.

1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:30.520
 And it depends in part on what we do and what we don't do.

1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:33.280
 But here's a few things that we understand already.

1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:38.280
 One, the idea that the West was in decline

1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:43.000
 and that the rest of the world had risen

1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.040
 and was more powerful and that we lived

1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:47.800
 in a multipolar world, that turns out

1:17:47.800 --> 1:17:49.440
 to be empirically false.

1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:52.440
 It's not true.

1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:54.240
 I mean, it's just factually not true.

1:17:55.240 --> 1:17:59.920
 There are no major important multinational institutions,

1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:04.400
 organizations that are run on behalf of,

1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:09.400
 or led by a South African, a Nigerian, person from India.

1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:14.880
 Even the Chinese don't run these institutions.

1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:18.000
 They would like to and they're trying, but they don't.

1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:23.560
 And so whatever you pick, the IMF, the World Bank,

1:18:25.080 --> 1:18:27.320
 the Federal Reserve, which is the most powerful

1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:30.080
 multinational institution, which is actually

1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:33.080
 only a domestic institution and doesn't have

1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:37.440
 a legal mandate to act multilaterally, but does.

1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:41.040
 It's got the most power of any institution in the world.

1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:45.720
 NATO, the bilateral alliances that the US has

1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:50.720
 up and down Asia, what organizations

1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:54.800
 that have tremendous leverage on the international system,

1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:57.480
 on the international order, are non Western.

1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:04.360
 The UN is the most encompassing.

1:19:04.360 --> 1:19:07.440
 And of course we know that it has five members

1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:10.160
 of the Security Council with a veto,

1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:12.480
 one of which is Russia, one of which is China,

1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:16.000
 and the others are the US, Britain, and France,

1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:21.000
 not India, not South Africa, not Indonesia,

1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:23.840
 Indonesia, not all of these other countries

1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:25.920
 where the people live, right?

1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:28.400
 The bulk of the population of the world

1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:30.160
 and where the population is growing

1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:32.240
 like on the African continent.

1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:34.560
 So it's not a multipolar world.

1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:38.040
 We talked already about the international financial system.

1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:40.320
 That's the Western, not multipolar.

1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:42.760
 We talked about the US military and NATO,

1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:45.080
 or we could talk about the Japanese military,

1:19:45.080 --> 1:19:50.040
 which is just very formidable, enormous number of platforms.

1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:51.680
 Even the Australian military

1:19:51.680 --> 1:19:54.160
 we could talk about, Lex, right?

1:19:54.160 --> 1:19:57.680
 And so it's a Western dominated world.

1:19:57.680 --> 1:20:01.440
 And the West, remember, is not a geographic concept.

1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:05.720
 It is an institutional and values club.

1:20:06.560 --> 1:20:10.000
 The Japanese are not European, but they're Western.

1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:14.160
 Just like Russia is European, but not Western.

1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:16.800
 Because European is a cultural category

1:20:16.800 --> 1:20:19.600
 and Western is an institutional category

1:20:19.600 --> 1:20:22.600
 where you have rule of law and separation of powers

1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:24.160
 and free and open public sphere

1:20:24.160 --> 1:20:28.240
 and dynamic open market economy, okay.

1:20:28.240 --> 1:20:31.360
 And then we have another thing which is pretty clear.

1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:34.960
 The West is powerfully resented,

1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:39.480
 powerfully envied and admired simultaneously.

1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:43.160
 P.J. O Rourke, the comedian who died this year,

1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:48.400
 fantastic, it was a big loss for the culture.

1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:49.920
 He said, there are two things

1:20:49.920 --> 1:20:51.760
 that are always characteristic

1:20:51.760 --> 1:20:53.920
 of any American embassy abroad.

1:20:54.840 --> 1:20:58.480
 One is a political protest outside

1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:03.520
 and the other is the longest line you've ever seen for visas.

1:21:05.360 --> 1:21:08.640
 And those things are true simultaneously.

1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:10.400
 And that's the world we live in,

1:21:10.400 --> 1:21:12.920
 meaning that non Western countries

1:21:14.440 --> 1:21:17.440
 envy and admire the West,

1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:20.760
 but they also resent the power of the West.

1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:23.000
 Western hypocrisy, right?

1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:26.920
 The West invades countries when it wants,

1:21:26.920 --> 1:21:30.440
 but when others do that, it's illegal, right?

1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:35.440
 The West arrests you for money laundering,

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.960
 but it's Western money laundering

1:21:37.960 --> 1:21:41.760
 that is where you go when you need to launder money, right?

1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:44.400
 So they see the hypocrisy,

1:21:44.400 --> 1:21:48.520
 they see the excessive power that the West has

1:21:48.520 --> 1:21:50.560
 and they resent it.

1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:55.200
 And they say, who elected you to run the world?

1:21:56.120 --> 1:21:58.480
 We have a billion plus people

1:21:58.480 --> 1:22:02.520
 or we have a 200 plus million people

1:22:02.520 --> 1:22:04.920
 and we don't have a say.

1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:08.480
 You're the self appointed guardians of our world,

1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:09.480
 who did that?

1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:11.560
 And so it's incumbent on the West

1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:15.400
 not only to remember the power that it has,

1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:20.800
 but also to exercise that power legally and with restraint

1:22:21.680 --> 1:22:26.680
 and also to think about how we can expand institutions

1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:29.440
 to be more encompassing

1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:31.280
 so that other parts of the world

1:22:31.280 --> 1:22:36.040
 are not on the outside being dictated to,

1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:39.440
 but instead are on the inside.

1:22:39.440 --> 1:22:44.440
 Too often, right, Western power is not consultative

1:22:47.320 --> 1:22:49.760
 in a decision making fashion.

1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:52.640
 It's consultative after the fact.

1:22:52.640 --> 1:22:54.880
 Okay, you know, we got together in the EU

1:22:54.880 --> 1:22:57.240
 or we got together in NATO

1:22:57.240 --> 1:22:59.560
 or we got together at the Federal Reserve

1:22:59.560 --> 1:23:02.720
 and here's our decision and we're announcing it today.

1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:06.320
 And so your economy gets destroyed

1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:08.000
 because the Federal Reserve decides

1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:09.680
 it has to raise interest rates

1:23:10.680 --> 1:23:14.400
 or you now go into default.

1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:15.600
 You can't pay your debt

1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:18.280
 because Western banks lent you money

1:23:18.280 --> 1:23:21.600
 and now the West has changed interest rates

1:23:21.600 --> 1:23:26.600
 or other considerations and you're in big trouble now.

1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:32.160
 And so this is something which we fail to address.

1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:33.440
 It's very hard to address.

1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:36.920
 It's very hard to reform international institutions.

1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:39.800
 It's very hard to share power.

1:23:39.800 --> 1:23:43.120
 It's very hard to acknowledge that you have too much power

1:23:44.120 --> 1:23:47.800
 and that maybe having too much power is not good,

1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:51.160
 not only for the rest of the world, but for yourself.

1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:53.680
 And so it's great to rediscover the West

1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:55.440
 and rediscover its values

1:23:55.440 --> 1:24:00.440
 and rediscover its authority and credibility and power,

1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:02.920
 but that's not sufficient.

1:24:02.920 --> 1:24:04.600
 So we know this now.

1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:07.240
 We know that the rest of the world

1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:11.280
 is not necessarily jumping on the Western bandwagon

1:24:12.240 --> 1:24:14.880
 to condemn Russia for its actions

1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:17.960
 because the West can do things like

1:24:17.960 --> 1:24:22.560
 sanction your central bank, take away your reserves,

1:24:22.560 --> 1:24:24.520
 deny you technology.

1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:27.080
 It pretty much can do whatever it wants

1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:28.680
 and it can say that it's legal

1:24:28.680 --> 1:24:30.720
 and it can go through various mechanisms

1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:33.800
 and it can freeze your property.

1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:34.840
 And you say to yourself,

1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:37.280
 should anybody have that much power?

1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:40.360
 And when do they come after me?

1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:42.480
 Now there's a caveat here.

1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:47.240
 And the caveat, Lex, is they don't like the West

1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:49.160
 having all of that power

1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:53.920
 and they didn't join in the condemnation of Russia,

1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:57.320
 but they also didn't join in Russia's aggression.

1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:02.320
 So Russia's domestic civilian aerospace,

1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:07.960
 aircraft industry, civilian aircraft industry

1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:09.240
 is in big trouble now

1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:14.240
 because of the export controls on spare parts and software.

1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:20.920
 Brazil is a major power in aircraft manufacturing.

1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:23.320
 Did they rush in and say,

1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:28.320
 you know, Vladimir Putin, we didn't condemn necessarily

1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:31.920
 your actions in Ukraine, okay, that's one thing.

1:25:31.920 --> 1:25:36.200
 And how about we give you all of our aircraft technology

1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:40.280
 and we help you rebuild your domestic aircraft industry.

1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:42.520
 And you can have the aviation at the West,

1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:44.160
 did that happen, Lex?

1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:46.080
 Didn't happen.

1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:48.640
 And you can look at India and you can look at China

1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:50.040
 and you can look at South Africa

1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:52.480
 and you can look at what they've done in practice

1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:54.920
 and what they've done in practical terms.

1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:58.600
 Yes, they haven't always joined

1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:00.480
 in a full throated condemnation.

1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:01.920
 Maybe they've been neutral

1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:05.000
 or maybe they've been playing both sides of the fence

1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:06.640
 like Turkey, for example.

1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:12.240
 But are they rushing in to join Russia,

1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:15.000
 to join Russia's aggression, to supply?

1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:16.720
 And the answer is no.

1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:19.680
 And the answer is no for two reasons.

1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:22.760
 One, they actually don't wanna be party to that.

1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:26.200
 And two, they understand that Western power.

1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:29.320
 And they don't wanna be on the receiving end

1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:33.000
 by crossing the West and then getting caught up

1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.640
 in a sanctions regime or worse.

1:26:35.640 --> 1:26:37.760
 Can we go to the mind of Vladimir Putin

1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:42.400
 because what you just said, China, India,

1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:45.680
 they seem to sit back and say,

1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:47.760
 we're not going to condemn the actions

1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:49.880
 of Vladimir Putin in Russia,

1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:52.600
 but we would really like for this war to be over.

1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:55.480
 So there's that kind of energy

1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:58.120
 of we don't just stop this

1:26:58.120 --> 1:27:00.560
 because you're putting us in a very, very bad position.

1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:05.120
 And yet Vladimir Putin is continuing the aggression.

1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:06.480
 What is he thinking?

1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:08.600
 What information is he getting?

1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:10.760
 Is it the system that you've described

1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:13.120
 of authoritarian regimes that corrupts

1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:14.760
 your flow of information,

1:27:14.760 --> 1:27:17.960
 your ability to make clearheaded decisions

1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:21.640
 just as a human being when you go to sleep at night?

1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:24.080
 Is he not able to see the world clearly

1:27:24.080 --> 1:27:27.520
 or is this all deliberate systematic action

1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:31.240
 that does have some reason behind it?

1:27:31.240 --> 1:27:33.280
 We gotta talk a little bit about China too,

1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:36.240
 but let's answer your Putin question directly.

1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:41.000
 So on Twitter, you've lost the war.

1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:45.080
 Or as they say, there are these two Russian soldiers

1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:46.920
 having a smoke in Warsaw,

1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:51.000
 and they're taking a break, having a smoke,

1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:53.480
 and they're sitting there in Warsaw on top of their tank

1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:55.040
 and one says to the other,

1:27:55.040 --> 1:27:57.360
 yeah, we lost the information war.

1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:00.840
 And there they are sitting in Warsaw

1:28:00.840 --> 1:28:02.200
 having that smoke, right?

1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:07.040
 So yeah, on Twitter, Russia has completely lost the war.

1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:09.520
 In reality, they failed to take Kiev.

1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:11.640
 They failed to capture Kiev.

1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:15.800
 And they failed in phase two, as they called it,

1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:20.800
 or plan B, which is to capture the entirety of the Donbass.

1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:23.440
 We're three months into the war.

1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:25.800
 If you had made a judgment about, let's say,

1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:27.840
 the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union,

1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:30.440
 a definitive judgment after three months,

1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:32.840
 you might've got the outcome wrong there.

1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:34.680
 If you had judged the Winter War,

1:28:34.680 --> 1:28:39.680
 the 1939, 40 Soviet invasion of Finland after three months,

1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:41.520
 you would've got that wrong too

1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:43.040
 of what the outcome was gonna be.

1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:45.480
 So we're early in the game here,

1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:49.840
 and we have to be careful about any definitive judgments.

1:28:49.840 --> 1:28:54.120
 But it is the case that so far, they failed to take Kiev

1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:57.560
 and they failed to capture the entirety of the Donbass,

1:28:57.560 --> 1:29:01.960
 Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, Eastern Ukraine,

1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:04.560
 a part of Eastern Ukraine.

1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:08.960
 And they've been driven out of Kharkiv

1:29:08.960 --> 1:29:12.520
 and the area immediately surrounding Kharkiv.

1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:15.600
 They never captured Kharkiv, but they came close,

1:29:15.600 --> 1:29:19.480
 but now the Ukrainians drove them back to the Russian border

1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:22.000
 in that very large and important region.

1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:25.280
 So those look like battlefield losses

1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:28.760
 that are impossible to explain away

1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:30.240
 if you're the regime in Russia,

1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:32.480
 except by suppression of information.

1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:36.080
 And as you know from Russian history, Lex,

1:29:37.840 --> 1:29:40.720
 leaders in Russia have an easier time

1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:44.360
 with the state of siege and deprivation

1:29:44.360 --> 1:29:46.640
 than they do with explaining a lost war.

1:29:49.280 --> 1:29:52.960
 But let's look at some other facts

1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:55.040
 that are important to take into account.

1:29:56.200 --> 1:30:00.160
 One, the Russian army has penetrated farther

1:30:00.160 --> 1:30:04.280
 into Ukrainian territory since February, 2022,

1:30:05.360 --> 1:30:08.320
 including in Kherson region,

1:30:09.920 --> 1:30:12.960
 the famous Mariupol siege that just ended.

1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:18.880
 They have built a large presence

1:30:20.120 --> 1:30:25.120
 in areas north of Crimea on the Sea of Azov,

1:30:25.960 --> 1:30:28.560
 the Black Sea littoral ultimately

1:30:28.560 --> 1:30:30.400
 that they didn't previously hold.

1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:35.160
 They're still fighting in Luhansk for full control

1:30:35.160 --> 1:30:38.480
 over at least half of the Donbass

1:30:38.480 --> 1:30:41.360
 and Ukrainians are resisting fiercely.

1:30:41.360 --> 1:30:46.360
 But nonetheless, you can say that they've been driven out

1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:50.320
 on the contrary, farther penetration than the beginning.

1:30:51.440 --> 1:30:53.560
 Ukraine doesn't have an economy anymore.

1:30:54.640 --> 1:30:58.320
 They have somewhere between 33 and 50% unemployment.

1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:02.560
 It's hard to measure unemployment in a war economy,

1:31:02.560 --> 1:31:04.160
 but their metallurgical industry,

1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:09.160
 that Azov style steel plant in Mariupol is a ruin now.

1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:14.000
 And a lot of farmers are not planting the fields

1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:16.080
 because the harvest from the previous year

1:31:16.080 --> 1:31:19.400
 still hasn't been sent, sold abroad

1:31:19.400 --> 1:31:22.400
 because the ports are blockaded or destroyed.

1:31:24.320 --> 1:31:26.080
 And so you don't have an economy

1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:28.760
 and you need 5 billion or 7 billion

1:31:28.760 --> 1:31:33.280
 or $8 billion a month to meet your payroll,

1:31:34.760 --> 1:31:37.760
 to feed your people, to keep your army in the field.

1:31:38.920 --> 1:31:42.960
 That's a lot of money per month and that's indefinite.

1:31:42.960 --> 1:31:45.960
 That's as long as this blockade lasts.

1:31:45.960 --> 1:31:49.200
 And so you don't have an economy anymore, you're indigent.

1:31:49.200 --> 1:31:51.960
 And even if you take the lower number, 5 billion,

1:31:51.960 --> 1:31:55.600
 as opposed to Zelensky's ask for 7 billion,

1:31:55.600 --> 1:31:57.880
 5 billion is 60 billion a year.

1:31:57.880 --> 1:32:01.680
 That's 60 billion this year, that's 60 billion next year.

1:32:01.680 --> 1:32:03.520
 And so who's got that kind of money?

1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:06.320
 Which Western taxpayers are ready?

1:32:06.320 --> 1:32:08.080
 And if you use the 7 or 8 billion,

1:32:08.080 --> 1:32:10.440
 you get up to 100 billion a year.

1:32:10.440 --> 1:32:15.440
 The Biden just signed, President Joe Biden just signed

1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:22.200
 the bill making it law, $40 billion in aid to Ukraine.

1:32:22.200 --> 1:32:25.320
 It's just an enormous sum.

1:32:25.320 --> 1:32:28.280
 The economic piece of that is a month and a half,

1:32:28.280 --> 1:32:33.280
 two months of Ukrainians covering Ukrainian expenditures.

1:32:35.200 --> 1:32:36.240
 That's it.

1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:37.920
 And they're asking the G7,

1:32:37.920 --> 1:32:39.760
 they're asking everybody for this.

1:32:39.760 --> 1:32:43.920
 So you have no economy and no prospect of an economy

1:32:43.920 --> 1:32:46.480
 until you evict the Russians from your territory.

1:32:46.480 --> 1:32:51.480
 And then you have a Western unity, Western resolve,

1:32:51.680 --> 1:32:55.160
 it lasts or it doesn't last, Lex.

1:32:55.160 --> 1:32:57.120
 So you're President Putin,

1:32:57.120 --> 1:33:00.480
 and you've got more territory than before,

1:33:01.360 --> 1:33:04.640
 and you've got a stranglehold over the Ukrainian economy,

1:33:05.960 --> 1:33:09.080
 and you've got a lot of the world neutral,

1:33:09.080 --> 1:33:12.200
 and you've got the Chinese propaganda

1:33:12.200 --> 1:33:16.640
 supporting you to the hilt with those Oliver Stone

1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:20.960
 and Mearsheimer lines about how this is really NATO's fault.

1:33:22.440 --> 1:33:26.960
 And you've got Hungary dragging its feet

1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:29.280
 on the oil embargo against Russia,

1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:31.360
 and you've got Turkey dragging its feet

1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:35.160
 on the recent applications of Sweden and Finland

1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:37.760
 for NATO expansion, and you're saying to yourself,

1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:39.520
 Lex, maybe I can ride this out.

1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:41.480
 I got a lot of problems of my own,

1:33:41.480 --> 1:33:42.760
 and we can go into the details

1:33:42.760 --> 1:33:45.000
 on the Russian side's challenges,

1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:50.880
 but he's on Ukrainian territory unless he's evicted,

1:33:51.640 --> 1:33:54.320
 and he's got a stranglehold on their economy,

1:33:54.320 --> 1:33:58.400
 and he's got the possibility that the West

1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:02.240
 doesn't stay resolved and doesn't continue to pay

1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:06.200
 for Ukraine's economy or supply those heavy weapons.

1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:09.880
 And so you could argue that maybe he's deluded

1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:13.200
 about all of this, and maybe he should go on Twitter.

1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:15.040
 You know, I'm not on Twitter, but maybe Putin,

1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:16.760
 who famously doesn't use the internet,

1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:19.600
 should go on Twitter and see he's losing the war.

1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:23.280
 Or you can argue that maybe he's calculating here

1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:25.440
 that he's got a chance to still prevail.

1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:31.880
 Wow, that is darkly insightful.

1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:36.560
 If I could go to Henry Kissinger for a brief moment,

1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:39.760
 and people should read this op ed he wrote

1:34:39.760 --> 1:34:43.240
 in the Washington Post in March 5th, 2014,

1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:48.040
 after the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine,

1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:50.480
 but before Crimea was annexed.

1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:54.040
 There's a lot of interesting historical description

1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:56.280
 about the division within Ukraine,

1:34:56.280 --> 1:34:59.640
 the corruption within Ukraine that will,

1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:03.320
 if people read this article, will give context

1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:06.840
 to how incredible it is, what Zelensky was able

1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:08.440
 to accomplish in uniting the country.

1:35:08.440 --> 1:35:12.040
 But I just want to comment because Henry Kissinger

1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:14.920
 is an interesting figure in American history.

1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:17.800
 He opens the article with, in my life,

1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:21.240
 I have seen four wars begun with great enthusiasm

1:35:21.240 --> 1:35:24.360
 and public support, all of which we did not know

1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:27.000
 how to end, and from three of which

1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:29.760
 we withdrew unilaterally.

1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:34.760
 The test of policy is how it ends, not how it begins.

1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:38.480
 So he's giving this cold, hard truth

1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:43.480
 that we go into wars excited, are able to send $40 billion,

1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:50.000
 financial aid, military aid, our own men and women,

1:35:50.440 --> 1:35:55.440
 but the excitement fades, Twitter outrage fades,

1:35:55.440 --> 1:36:00.440
 and then a country that's willing to wait patiently

1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:04.360
 is willing to pay the cost of siege

1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:07.440
 versus the cost of explaining to its own people

1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:12.440
 that the war is lost, that country just might win, outlast.

1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:17.480
 Let's hope not because the Ukrainians,

1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:21.320
 resistance deserves to prevail here.

1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:23.480
 Russia deserves to lose.

1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:26.240
 No war of aggression like they've committed here

1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:28.760
 against Ukraine should prevail

1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:30.760
 if we can do anything about it.

1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:35.760
 I support 1,000% the continued supply of heavy weapons,

1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:40.640
 including offensive weapons, to the Ukrainians

1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:44.480
 as long as they're willing to resist, and it's their choice.

1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:46.720
 It's their choice when to negotiate.

1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:48.680
 It's their choice how much to resist.

1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:51.440
 It's their choice what kind of sacrifices to make,

1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:56.440
 and it's our responsibility to meet their requests

1:36:56.800 --> 1:37:00.760
 more quickly than we have so far and at greater scale.

1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:05.200
 But ultimately, wars only have political ends.

1:37:05.200 --> 1:37:07.640
 They never have military ends.

1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:10.320
 You need a political solution here.

1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:14.280
 So if the Ukrainians are able to conduct

1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:17.880
 a successful counteroffensive at scale

1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:22.880
 in July or August, whenever they launch,

1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:26.520
 right now the heavy weapons are coming in

1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:28.800
 and they're being moved to the battlefield

1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:31.560
 and more are coming, you know, the dynamic.

1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:35.720
 Russia bombs a school, Russia bombs a hospital.

1:37:35.720 --> 1:37:37.800
 Americans and Europeans decide

1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:40.560
 to send even more heavy weapons to Ukraine, right?

1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:43.880
 That's the self defeating dynamic from the Russian side.

1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:48.360
 They commit the atrocities, we send more heavy weapons.

1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:51.800
 Once those heavy weapons are on the battle lines,

1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:55.000
 we'll see if Ukrainians cannot just defend,

1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.160
 which they've proven they're able to do

1:37:57.160 --> 1:38:02.160
 in breathtaking fashion, not just conduct counterattacks

1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:04.720
 where the enemy moves forward

1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:07.760
 and you cut behind the enemy's lines

1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:11.400
 and you counterattack and push the enemy back a little bit,

1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:15.800
 but whether you can evict the Russians

1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:20.400
 from your territory with a combined arms operation

1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:22.880
 where you have a massive superiority

1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:25.400
 in infantry and heavy weapons,

1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:29.360
 but more importantly, you coordinate your air power,

1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:33.840
 your tanks, your drones, your infantry at scale,

1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:36.400
 which is something the Ukrainians have not done yet.

1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:39.360
 It's something the Russians failed at in Ukraine

1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:42.880
 and they come from the same place, the Soviet military.

1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:46.000
 We hope this Ukrainian counter offensive at scale,

1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:50.320
 this combined arms operation succeeds.

1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:51.640
 And if it does succeed,

1:38:51.640 --> 1:38:55.160
 there's the possibility of a battlefield victory.

1:38:55.160 --> 1:38:57.400
 Whether that also includes Crimea,

1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:02.720
 which as you know is not hostile on the contrary

1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:06.920
 to the Russian military remains to be seen.

1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:11.640
 But however much they regain territorially

1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:15.520
 back towards the 1991 borders,

1:39:15.520 --> 1:39:18.000
 which is their goal, their stated goal,

1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:22.360
 and which we support them properly in trying to achieve,

1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:24.120
 however much they achieve of that

1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:27.320
 in this counter offensive that we're anticipating,

1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:31.000
 that will set the stage for the next phase.

1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:35.560
 And either Russia, which is to say one person,

1:39:35.560 --> 1:39:40.560
 Vladimir Putin, will acknowledge that he's lost the war

1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:44.320
 because the Ukrainians won it on the battlefield,

1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:49.320
 or he'll try to announce a full scale mobilization,

1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:53.400
 conscript the whole country, go back,

1:39:53.400 --> 1:39:55.440
 and instead of acknowledging defeat,

1:39:55.440 --> 1:39:57.040
 try to win with a different plan,

1:39:57.040 --> 1:40:00.320
 recalibrate, remains to be seen.

1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:03.920
 Will the Ukrainians negotiate any territory away

1:40:03.920 --> 1:40:07.440
 or must they capture also Crimea,

1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:12.440
 which puts a very high bar on the summer counter offensive

1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:15.360
 that we're gonna see, which could last through the fall

1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:17.520
 and into the winter as a result.

1:40:17.520 --> 1:40:18.880
 We don't know the answers to that,

1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:20.960
 nobody knows the answers to that.

1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:23.760
 People are guessing, some people are better informed

1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:26.360
 because they have inside intelligence.

1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:32.600
 People are also worried about Russian escalation

1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:34.880
 to nuclear weapons or chemical weapons

1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:38.320
 if they begin to lose on the battlefield to Ukraine.

1:40:38.320 --> 1:40:40.680
 Are you worried about nuclear war,

1:40:40.680 --> 1:40:43.760
 the possibility of nuclear war?

1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:49.000
 I think it's necessary to pay attention to that possibility.

1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:54.000
 That possibility existed before the February 2022

1:40:54.840 --> 1:40:57.240
 full blown invasion of Ukraine.

1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:00.320
 The doomsday arsenal that Russia possesses

1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:03.480
 is enough to destroy the world many times over,

1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:06.440
 and that's been the case every year

1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:10.240
 since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:13.920
 And so, of course, we're concerned about that.

1:41:13.920 --> 1:41:15.720
 We do know, however, Lex,

1:41:15.720 --> 1:41:18.480
 that they have a system known as dual key,

1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:22.440
 dual key for their strategic nuclear weapons.

1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:28.400
 Strategic nuclear weapons means the ones fired from silos,

1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:32.320
 the missiles, the ones delivered from bombers,

1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:34.440
 or the ones fired from submarines, right?

1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:35.840
 And they're ready to go.

1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:37.720
 They're intercontinental.

1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:40.480
 We watch that very, very closely.

1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:44.440
 We watch all the movement of that and the alerts, et cetera.

1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:47.160
 We have tremendously, let's say,

1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:51.120
 tremendous inside intelligence on that.

1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:53.800
 But dual key means that President Putin alone

1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:55.400
 cannot fire them.

1:41:55.400 --> 1:41:57.840
 He has one key, which he must insert,

1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:02.840
 he must then insert the codes for a command to launch.

1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:07.600
 That then goes to the head of the general staff,

1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:11.560
 who must, he has his own key and separate codes,

1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:12.720
 and must do the same,

1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:15.360
 insert that key and codes for them to launch.

1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:21.080
 And so will the general staff chief go along

1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:22.960
 with the destruction of the world

1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:25.160
 over a battlefield loss in Ukraine?

1:42:25.160 --> 1:42:26.720
 I don't know the answer to that,

1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:29.080
 and I don't know if anybody knows the answer to that.

1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:32.160
 Will those people flying those bombers,

1:42:32.160 --> 1:42:33.640
 if they get the order from,

1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:36.760
 if the dual key system goes into action

1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:41.760
 and both keys are used and all the codes are implemented,

1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:45.520
 will those young guys flying those bombers

1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:47.280
 let those bombs go?

1:42:47.280 --> 1:42:52.280
 Will those at the missile silos decide to engage and fire?

1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:55.280
 We don't know, but you can see that it's more than one man

1:42:55.280 --> 1:42:57.120
 making the decision here

1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:00.200
 in a system of strategic nuclear weapons.

1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:03.640
 As far as the tactical, the so called low yield

1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:06.440
 or battlefield nuclear weapons,

1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:10.120
 we're not sure the system that they have in Russia these days

1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:12.200
 for their implement, for their use

1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:14.680
 of such tactical nuclear weapons.

1:43:15.560 --> 1:43:20.560
 It could well be that Putin and just himself,

1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:25.560
 himself, he alone can fire them or order them be fired.

1:43:27.760 --> 1:43:31.120
 What you know, Lex, there's no tactical nuclear weapon

1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:35.280
 fired at Ukraine that's not also fired simultaneously

1:43:35.280 --> 1:43:36.120
 at Russia.

1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:42.000
 If the Kremlin is 600 miles from Ukraine

1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:46.080
 and if the wind changes direction

1:43:46.080 --> 1:43:51.000
 or the wind happens to be blowing east, northeast,

1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:54.480
 the fallout hits your Kremlin, not just Ukraine.

1:43:55.440 --> 1:43:58.000
 Moreover, you have all those border regions

1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:01.720
 which are staging regions for the Russian offensive

1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:04.160
 and they're a lot closer than 600 miles.

1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:06.280
 They're actually right there.

1:44:06.280 --> 1:44:09.560
 And so you fire that weapon on Ukrainian territory

1:44:09.560 --> 1:44:11.880
 and you can get the fallout

1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:16.200
 just like the Chernobyl fallout spread to Sweden

1:44:16.200 --> 1:44:20.480
 which is how we got the Kremlin to finally,

1:44:20.480 --> 1:44:22.040
 first they denied this at all.

1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:25.280
 We don't know why there's a big nuclear cloud over Sweden.

1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:26.960
 We don't know where that came from

1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:28.600
 but eventually they admitted it.

1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:33.400
 So Russia can actually use a nuclear weapon

1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:35.880
 tactical battlefield one in Ukraine

1:44:35.880 --> 1:44:38.960
 without also firing it at itself.

1:44:38.960 --> 1:44:41.120
 And in addition, it's that same dynamic

1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:42.960
 I alluded to earlier

1:44:42.960 --> 1:44:46.520
 which is to say you bomb a hospital,

1:44:46.520 --> 1:44:50.560
 you bomb a school, there's more heavy weapons

1:44:50.560 --> 1:44:52.600
 going to Ukraine from the west.

1:44:52.600 --> 1:44:55.080
 You can't get away with any of the,

1:44:55.080 --> 1:44:56.520
 there's always going to be a response

1:44:56.520 --> 1:44:59.160
 that's either proportional or greater than proportional.

1:44:59.160 --> 1:45:02.880
 You could well have Europe signing on

1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:05.200
 to NATO direct engagement,

1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:09.080
 both Washington and Brussels direct engagement

1:45:09.080 --> 1:45:13.160
 of the Russian army on the territory of Ukraine.

1:45:13.160 --> 1:45:15.040
 You think that's possible to do that

1:45:15.040 --> 1:45:19.320
 without dramatic escalation from the Russian side?

1:45:19.320 --> 1:45:21.080
 Yes, I do think it's possible

1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:24.240
 but it's very worrisome just like you're saying.

1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:28.240
 But if Putin were to escalate like that,

1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:31.240
 he's firing that weapon at himself

1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:34.560
 and he's potentially provoking a direct clash

1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:36.400
 with NATO's military,

1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:39.240
 not just with the Ukrainian military.

1:45:39.240 --> 1:45:40.800
 If you're sitting in the Kremlin

1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:45.400
 looking at those charts, Lex, of NATO capabilities

1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:48.520
 and you can't conquer Ukraine

1:45:48.520 --> 1:45:50.400
 which didn't really have heavy weapons

1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:54.280
 before February 2022 at scale

1:45:55.240 --> 1:45:58.080
 and you're thinking, okay, now I'm gonna take on NATO,

1:45:59.640 --> 1:46:03.960
 that would be a bold step on the part of a Russian leader.

1:46:03.960 --> 1:46:06.240
 And let's also remember, Lex,

1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:07.920
 that there's another variable here.

1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:13.960
 You're a despot as long as everyone implements your orders.

1:46:16.040 --> 1:46:20.440
 And so if people start to say quietly,

1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:24.880
 not necessarily publicly, I may not implement that order

1:46:24.880 --> 1:46:27.320
 because that's maybe a criminal order

1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:32.320
 or my grandma is Ukrainian or my wife is Ukrainian

1:46:32.320 --> 1:46:35.560
 or I don't wanna go to the hog.

1:46:36.520 --> 1:46:38.640
 I don't wanna spend the rest of my life in the hog

1:46:38.640 --> 1:46:40.320
 or whatever it might be.

1:46:40.320 --> 1:46:43.280
 At any point along the chain of command

1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:46.920
 from the general staff all the way down, right,

1:46:46.920 --> 1:46:49.680
 to the platoon, you're a despot

1:46:49.680 --> 1:46:52.760
 provided they implement your orders.

1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:57.760
 But who's to say that somewhere along the chain of command

1:46:57.760 --> 1:47:02.760
 people start to say, I'm gonna ignore that order

1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:05.800
 or I'm gonna sabotage that order

1:47:05.800 --> 1:47:09.000
 or I'm gonna flee the battlefield

1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:12.960
 or I'm gonna injure myself so that I don't have to fight

1:47:12.960 --> 1:47:16.520
 or I'm gonna join the Ukrainian side.

1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:19.520
 And so it could be that's what's left

1:47:19.520 --> 1:47:24.440
 of the Russian army in the field begins to disintegrate.

1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:27.920
 Even if the Ukrainians are not able to mount that

1:47:27.920 --> 1:47:31.680
 counter offensive at scale, that combined arms operation,

1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:34.840
 the Russian military in the field,

1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:36.800
 which has taken horrendous casualties

1:47:36.800 --> 1:47:39.320
 as far as we understand, something like a third

1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:44.320
 of the original force, so you're talking about 50 to 60,000

1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:49.000
 that includes both dead and wounded to the point

1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.800
 of being unable to return to the battlefield.

1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:53.680
 Those are big numbers.

1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:57.600
 Those were a lot of families, a lot of families affected.

1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:02.480
 Their sons or their husbands or their fathers

1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:05.720
 are either missing in action or the regime won't tell them

1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:08.560
 that they're dead, as you know from the sinking

1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:13.560
 of that flagship, Moskva, right, by the Ukrainians.

1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:18.440
 And so a disintegration of the Russian military

1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:21.800
 because there are orders that they either can't implement

1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:26.800
 or don't wanna implement is also not excluded.

1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:29.200
 And so you have these two big variables,

1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:32.000
 the Ukrainian army in the field and its ability

1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:35.280
 to move from defense to offense at scale,

1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:37.320
 and we're gonna test that soon.

1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:41.280
 And then the Russian ability in the field to hold together

1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:44.920
 in a war of conquest and aggression

1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:49.640
 where they're conscripts or they're fed dog food

1:48:49.640 --> 1:48:53.040
 or they don't have any weapons anymore

1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:55.800
 because there's no resupply,

1:48:55.800 --> 1:48:59.160
 so the disintegration of the army can't be excluded.

1:48:59.160 --> 1:49:02.800
 And then, of course, all bets are off on the Putin regime.

1:49:02.800 --> 1:49:07.800
 More long term, there are these technology export controls.

1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:10.720
 We were talking about how the military industrial complex

1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:15.160
 in Russia is dependent on foreign component parts

1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:19.400
 and software, and so if you have export controls

1:49:19.400 --> 1:49:21.320
 and you have firms voluntarily,

1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:24.200
 even when they don't fall under export controls,

1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:27.320
 leaving Russian business, refusing to do business

1:49:27.320 --> 1:49:31.640
 with Russia, and we see this not just in the civilian sector

1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:35.320
 like with McDonald's or many other companies,

1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:40.320
 we see this in the key areas like the oil industry

1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:42.040
 with the executives fleeing,

1:49:43.280 --> 1:49:45.480
 that is the Western executives fleeing,

1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:47.800
 giving up their positions.

1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:51.640
 So Russia's ability to resupply its tanks,

1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:56.640
 resupply its missiles, resupply its uniforms,

1:49:58.040 --> 1:50:01.840
 resupply its food to its soldiers in the field

1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:05.880
 and in their boots, we see a lot of stuff

1:50:05.880 --> 1:50:08.960
 under tremendous stress, and in the long term,

1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:12.680
 there's no obvious way they can rebuild

1:50:12.680 --> 1:50:17.680
 the military industrial complex to produce those weapons

1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:20.000
 because they're reliant on foreign parts

1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:21.240
 that they can't get anymore,

1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:23.840
 and there are no domestic substitutes

1:50:23.840 --> 1:50:26.120
 on the immediate horizon.

1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:30.600
 That's at the earliest a two year proposition

1:50:30.600 --> 1:50:32.280
 to have domestic substitutes,

1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:35.360
 and for some things like microelectronics,

1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:37.320
 they've never had domestic substitutes

1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:40.680
 going back to the Soviet times as you know well.

1:50:40.680 --> 1:50:43.920
 And so there's that pressure on Russia

1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:46.760
 from the technology export controls,

1:50:46.760 --> 1:50:49.760
 which if you're in the security ministry

1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:51.080
 or the defense ministry,

1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:54.360
 if you're in that side of the regime,

1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:56.960
 you're feeling that pain as we speak,

1:50:56.960 --> 1:50:59.040
 and you're wondering about the strategy.

1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:06.480
 Let me ask you about, again, the echoes of history,

1:51:06.480 --> 1:51:08.200
 and it frustrates me in part

1:51:08.200 --> 1:51:10.440
 when people draw these parallels,

1:51:10.440 --> 1:51:14.160
 but maybe there is some deep insight about those parallels.

1:51:14.160 --> 1:51:18.800
 So there's a song that goes,

1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:21.280
 Dvata Teroviy Uniya Rovnovshchitya Chisa

1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:24.640
 Kiev by Bitya Nama Bitya Shtanochilai Svaina.

1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:29.640
 So Operation Barbarossa, the bombing of Kiev by Hitler,

1:51:31.960 --> 1:51:34.320
 there is sort of an eerie parallel,

1:51:34.320 --> 1:51:37.320
 and you have to be extremely careful

1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:42.000
 drawing such parallels and such connections

1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:47.000
 to this unexplainable war that is World War II.

1:51:50.400 --> 1:51:55.400
 But is there elements of this that do echo

1:51:56.520 --> 1:51:58.800
 in the actions of Vladimir Putin?

1:51:58.800 --> 1:52:03.720
 And more specifically, do you think that Vladimir Putin

1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:04.880
 is a war criminal?

1:52:06.280 --> 1:52:09.520
 Can that label be assigned to the actions of this man?

1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:14.560
 A war criminal is a legal determination,

1:52:14.560 --> 1:52:17.840
 and it requires evidence and due process

1:52:17.840 --> 1:52:20.200
 and the ability to defend oneself.

1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:24.880
 We don't just decide in the Twittersphere

1:52:24.880 --> 1:52:27.640
 or on a podcast that somebody is a war criminal.

1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:31.680
 They can be a suspected war criminal,

1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:36.000
 and we can gather evidence to try to prosecute that case.

1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:39.000
 And then the issue for us, Alexis,

1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:40.680
 which court does it go to?

1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:44.120
 What's the appropriate place?

1:52:44.120 --> 1:52:46.680
 Does it happen in Ukraine because they're the victims?

1:52:46.680 --> 1:52:47.920
 Does it happen in the Hague

1:52:47.920 --> 1:52:51.160
 because there's an international criminal court there?

1:52:51.160 --> 1:52:52.920
 Does it happen inside Russia

1:52:52.920 --> 1:52:56.000
 because there's regime change at some point?

1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:59.280
 And some of these people become,

1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:02.760
 let's say they get arrested by their own people

1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:03.680
 inside Russia.

1:53:05.080 --> 1:53:07.080
 So those are all important questions

1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:09.480
 that have to be pursued with resources

1:53:09.480 --> 1:53:13.720
 and with determination and by skilled people

1:53:13.720 --> 1:53:17.000
 who are excellent at gathering that evidence.

1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:18.880
 And that process is underway.

1:53:18.880 --> 1:53:22.040
 And Ukraine has a trial underway now

1:53:22.040 --> 1:53:26.560
 of one alleged war criminal who's pleaded guilty.

1:53:26.560 --> 1:53:29.400
 And we'll see what the outcome of that trial

1:53:29.400 --> 1:53:31.920
 inside Ukraine is of a lower level official,

1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:34.800
 not obviously Vladimir Putin,

1:53:34.800 --> 1:53:36.680
 but the commander of a tank group.

1:53:38.760 --> 1:53:43.760
 So, yes, the names are eerily familiar.

1:53:46.320 --> 1:53:51.320
 Izium, Kharkiv, Kiev, right?

1:53:51.320 --> 1:53:55.760
 Those are the names we know from the Nazi invasion

1:53:55.760 --> 1:53:58.560
 and the Nazi occupation of Ukraine.

1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:03.080
 And it's very deeply troubling

1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:05.080
 to think that this could happen again.

1:54:06.200 --> 1:54:10.560
 And there's a bizarre sense that the Russians

1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:14.760
 claiming as Putin says to deNazify Ukraine

1:54:14.760 --> 1:54:19.280
 have invaded the same places that the Nazis invaded

1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:21.920
 back in 1941.

1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:24.560
 As somebody who's working on volume three

1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:30.480
 of your work on Stalin going through this period,

1:54:30.480 --> 1:54:32.200
 is it eerie to you?

1:54:32.200 --> 1:54:33.520
 Yes, it is, Lex.

1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:34.640
 That you're.

1:54:34.640 --> 1:54:37.560
 I've written the chapters of volume three.

1:54:37.560 --> 1:54:39.720
 I've drafted the chapters on the war.

1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:43.680
 And as I said, the place names

1:54:43.680 --> 1:54:45.920
 are very evocative, unfortunately.

1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:50.840
 But, you know, the Nazis failed ultimately.

1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:57.200
 They captured Ukraine for a time,

1:54:57.200 --> 1:55:00.400
 but they were evicted from Ukraine.

1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:05.400
 There was massive partisan or guerrilla warfare resistance

1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:07.800
 behind Nazi lines the whole time

1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:13.000
 that they were allegedly in control of Ukraine.

1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.200
 If you look at the maps on cable TV,

1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:17.200
 they show you the sign of,

1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:19.840
 they show you the coloring, Russian control.

1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:22.360
 And they draw a line and then it's colored in.

1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:24.640
 But the word control is misplaced.

1:55:25.640 --> 1:55:27.080
 They don't actually control it.

1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:30.360
 It's Russian claimed or extent

1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:34.600
 of farthest Russian troop advancement.

1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:37.480
 Because behind the Russian lines in Ukraine,

1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:40.960
 Crimea accepted, you have insurgencies.

1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:43.320
 You have the armed insurgency.

1:55:43.320 --> 1:55:45.520
 In Melitopol, for example,

1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:49.200
 which is a place that you know in Southeastern Ukraine,

1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:53.440
 there is a guerrilla war now underway

1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:57.800
 to hurt the Russians who are in occupation

1:55:57.800 --> 1:55:59.240
 of that city and region.

1:56:00.240 --> 1:56:02.680
 And we're gonna see that continue

1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:06.560
 even if the war becomes a stalemate,

1:56:07.440 --> 1:56:09.720
 even if it stalemates more or less

1:56:09.720 --> 1:56:11.880
 at the lines we're at now,

1:56:11.880 --> 1:56:15.160
 which would mean that anticipated

1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:19.440
 Ukrainian counteroffensive at scale proves unsuccessful.

1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:21.880
 The Russian army doesn't disintegrate.

1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:25.720
 And you end up with a stalemate

1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:28.400
 where there could be a ceasefire or not a ceasefire,

1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:30.560
 but neither side is attempting an offensive

1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:32.440
 for the time being.

1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:36.320
 There will be resistance behind those Russian lines

1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:38.680
 and it will be fierce resistance.

1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:42.200
 The kind of resistance we saw to the Nazi occupation.

1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:46.320
 Ultimately, it took the Red Army

1:56:46.320 --> 1:56:50.480
 reinvading the territory of Ukraine

1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:55.480
 and succeeding at combined arms operations at scale.

1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:57.880
 A massive counteroffensive,

1:56:57.880 --> 1:57:01.160
 much larger than anything we're talking about today.

1:57:01.160 --> 1:57:02.760
 Ultimately, it required that

1:57:02.760 --> 1:57:05.520
 to evict the Nazis from Ukraine.

1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:08.800
 But in the meantime, they did not have an easy occupation

1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:09.720
 regime there.

1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:16.680
 Ukrainian partisans, Soviet partisans

1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:22.040
 killed Nazi officials, Wehrmacht soldiers, Wehrmacht officers

1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:27.560
 blew up the infrastructure they were using,

1:57:28.480 --> 1:57:30.880
 made them pay a price for their occupation.

1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:34.880
 We could well see if unfortunately

1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:38.160
 this ends in a stalemate for the time being,

1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:41.400
 we could well see that type of insurgency

1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:43.880
 gain momentum behind Russian lines

1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:48.040
 and try to evict the Russians that way

1:57:49.280 --> 1:57:52.600
 and then remount the counteroffensive at scale

1:57:52.600 --> 1:57:57.520
 later on in the future if the first one doesn't succeed.

1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:01.000
 So that would be further echoes

1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:03.040
 of the World War II experience.

1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:05.840
 The scale once again is much smaller.

1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:08.120
 The size of the armies here,

1:58:08.120 --> 1:58:13.120
 they're not in the many 800,000, 700,000,

1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:15.360
 a million two, a million four.

1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:18.040
 That's not what we're talking about today.

1:58:18.040 --> 1:58:23.040
 But the weapons, the cruise missiles, artillery fire.

1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:27.320
 Artillery fire used to be very inaccurate

1:58:27.320 --> 1:58:29.400
 and it was like saturation.

1:58:29.400 --> 1:58:31.880
 You would just fire towards the enemy lines

1:58:31.880 --> 1:58:33.520
 and if you hit something, you hit something

1:58:33.520 --> 1:58:36.000
 and if you didn't, you just kept firing.

1:58:36.880 --> 1:58:39.520
 Now you have drones, Lex.

1:58:39.520 --> 1:58:43.000
 And so artillery fire is now sniper fire

1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:46.000
 because you can coordinate the direction

1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:49.520
 of the artillery fire with the drones.

1:58:49.520 --> 1:58:52.240
 The drones can take a picture and show you

1:58:52.240 --> 1:58:55.400
 where the enemy is precisely located

1:58:55.400 --> 1:58:58.840
 and you can align that artillery to hit them

1:58:58.840 --> 1:59:02.200
 instead of just indiscriminately bombing an area,

1:59:02.200 --> 1:59:03.920
 a territory.

1:59:03.920 --> 1:59:08.320
 And the NATO supplied artillery goes really far

1:59:08.320 --> 1:59:11.520
 and you can fire into Russian positions

1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:15.200
 and yourself not be exposed to Russian fire

1:59:15.200 --> 1:59:20.200
 because your artillery fires farther than theirs.

1:59:20.560 --> 1:59:24.640
 So that's coming and we're gonna see that in action.

1:59:24.640 --> 1:59:27.520
 And so the scale is not the same,

1:59:27.520 --> 1:59:30.520
 but the weapons, the precision of some of the weapons

1:59:30.520 --> 1:59:31.640
 and some of the NATO.

1:59:31.640 --> 1:59:34.000
 We're not sending all of our stuff,

1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:37.480
 but as I said, the dynamic is Russia commits atrocities,

1:59:37.480 --> 1:59:40.240
 Russia bombs schools, Russia bombs hospitals,

1:59:40.240 --> 1:59:44.840
 Russia kills civilians and more and heavier

1:59:44.840 --> 1:59:48.960
 and more lethal Western weapons go to Ukraine.

1:59:48.960 --> 1:59:53.560
 Their willingness to risk their lives is really so impressive

1:59:53.560 --> 1:59:58.160
 and the reason that it's our duty,

1:59:58.160 --> 2:00:00.720
 we're obliged to supply those weapons.

2:00:00.720 --> 2:00:03.560
 And so the Russians don't have that resupply

2:00:03.560 --> 2:00:05.000
 and the Ukrainians do.

2:00:06.040 --> 2:00:09.280
 And so the Russians are now digging in Lex.

2:00:09.280 --> 2:00:12.040
 They're digging in deeply in the areas

2:00:12.040 --> 2:00:14.280
 that they've penetrated

2:00:14.280 --> 2:00:17.280
 and they're trying to build unassailable positions

2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:21.960
 for when the Ukrainians transition

2:00:21.960 --> 2:00:26.440
 from mostly defense to full scale offense.

2:00:26.440 --> 2:00:28.320
 And we'll see if that now,

2:00:28.320 --> 2:00:31.360
 I mean, they're digging everywhere,

2:00:31.360 --> 2:00:34.720
 as they say, Kapayut, Kapayut, right?

2:00:34.720 --> 2:00:36.400
 They're digging everywhere behind.

2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:37.680
 Your Russian is beautiful.

2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:41.200
 Digging in, I wish Lex, like yours.

2:00:41.200 --> 2:00:44.720
 But so there are these things that we can't predict,

2:00:44.720 --> 2:00:46.320
 but there are these things we're watching

2:00:46.320 --> 2:00:47.620
 and watching closely.

2:00:47.620 --> 2:00:52.620
 And on top of that, something that's not in World War II

2:00:53.380 --> 2:00:56.260
 or for the most part is cyber attacks and cyber warfare,

2:00:56.260 --> 2:01:01.260
 which is much less perhaps convertible into human words

2:01:05.300 --> 2:01:08.300
 because it happens so quickly, it's such large scales,

2:01:08.300 --> 2:01:10.440
 so difficult to trace and all those kinds of things.

2:01:10.440 --> 2:01:14.540
 It's not bullets, it's electrical signals and that.

2:01:14.540 --> 2:01:18.460
 Yeah, but those Ukrainian people, they're like you, Lex.

2:01:18.460 --> 2:01:23.060
 They're young and they're technically really proficient.

2:01:23.060 --> 2:01:25.020
 And they've been amazing.

2:01:25.020 --> 2:01:28.500
 You know, they spent those teenage years in the basement

2:01:28.500 --> 2:01:30.580
 playing video games.

2:01:30.580 --> 2:01:31.420
 Nothing.

2:01:31.420 --> 2:01:32.780
 Turns out it's useful after all.

2:01:32.780 --> 2:01:34.980
 It turns out it's more than useful.

2:01:34.980 --> 2:01:37.600
 You can save your country that way.

2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:41.180
 And so they're not alone, they're getting support

2:01:41.180 --> 2:01:43.420
 and that support is important,

2:01:43.420 --> 2:01:46.300
 but really predominantly it's Ukrainians

2:01:46.300 --> 2:01:48.300
 on the cyber battlefield.

2:01:48.300 --> 2:01:50.380
 And their skills have been very impressive

2:01:50.380 --> 2:01:53.340
 and they've been preparing for this for a number of years.

2:01:53.340 --> 2:01:58.340
 And they have a whole army of young people on the cyber side.

2:01:58.580 --> 2:02:00.360
 It's their civilian population.

2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:02.780
 These are not people conscripted into the military

2:02:02.780 --> 2:02:05.940
 or volunteering wearing the uniform.

2:02:05.940 --> 2:02:07.980
 And so even in cyber warfare,

2:02:07.980 --> 2:02:11.460
 the Ukrainians have been extremely impressive.

2:02:11.460 --> 2:02:16.460
 And so let's remember that all of these aspects of warfare,

2:02:18.580 --> 2:02:22.860
 whether it's how far your cruise missiles go

2:02:22.860 --> 2:02:24.820
 and how accurate they are,

2:02:24.820 --> 2:02:28.180
 what size your cyber capabilities are.

2:02:29.260 --> 2:02:31.900
 It's really ultimately about the people.

2:02:31.900 --> 2:02:34.460
 It's about the human capital, right?

2:02:34.460 --> 2:02:39.460
 It's about their willingness, their skill level,

2:02:39.460 --> 2:02:41.540
 but also their willingness to fight

2:02:41.540 --> 2:02:43.540
 and to put their lives on the line.

2:02:43.540 --> 2:02:45.780
 And there's no substitute for that.

2:02:45.780 --> 2:02:50.660
 And so what's called morale or courage or bravery or valor,

2:02:51.620 --> 2:02:54.220
 that's really the ultimately decisive

2:02:54.220 --> 2:02:59.220
 provided you have enough sufficient arms, right?

2:02:59.540 --> 2:03:01.140
 To conduct the fight.

2:03:01.140 --> 2:03:04.580
 And if you don't, you use a Molotov cocktail, right?

2:03:04.580 --> 2:03:08.540
 Grandma calls in the coordinates of the Russian tank

2:03:08.540 --> 2:03:13.540
 on her iPhone and you have a Molotov cocktail

2:03:13.860 --> 2:03:18.740
 that the people who used to work in the cafeteria

2:03:18.740 --> 2:03:22.140
 are now stuffing flammable liquid into bottles

2:03:22.140 --> 2:03:23.900
 and you carry one right up to the tank

2:03:23.900 --> 2:03:25.460
 and you smash it against the tank

2:03:25.460 --> 2:03:29.440
 or you drop it in one of the hatches in the tank, right?

2:03:30.700 --> 2:03:33.100
 There's no substitute for that kind of stuff,

2:03:33.100 --> 2:03:38.100
 that level of resolve, willingness to die for your country.

2:03:38.100 --> 2:03:40.260
 That's a really big lesson

2:03:40.260 --> 2:03:43.620
 that we need to absorb in our own country.

2:03:43.620 --> 2:03:48.180
 We've been going to war more frequently than we should.

2:03:48.180 --> 2:03:51.420
 And like you said, without the justification all the time,

2:03:51.420 --> 2:03:53.820
 and then like Henry Kissinger said,

2:03:53.820 --> 2:03:56.980
 without understanding how this was gonna end.

2:03:56.980 --> 2:03:58.940
 It's easy to start a war,

2:03:58.940 --> 2:04:01.900
 it's very difficult to win a war, prevail in a war

2:04:01.900 --> 2:04:05.180
 or end a war on terms that meet

2:04:05.180 --> 2:04:08.580
 your original expectations, right?

2:04:08.580 --> 2:04:09.860
 We've been fighting wars,

2:04:09.860 --> 2:04:13.620
 but we haven't been fighting wars as societies.

2:04:13.620 --> 2:04:18.340
 We've been fighting wars as a small sliver of our population.

2:04:18.340 --> 2:04:20.900
 Something like 1% of our population

2:04:20.900 --> 2:04:22.340
 is involved with the military

2:04:22.340 --> 2:04:24.780
 because we have an all volunteer force.

2:04:25.700 --> 2:04:28.900
 And that means that it's easier for our politicians

2:04:28.900 --> 2:04:33.900
 to go to war because they don't face conscription,

2:04:33.900 --> 2:04:36.460
 they don't have the draft,

2:04:36.460 --> 2:04:39.580
 which affects every family in the country.

2:04:39.580 --> 2:04:44.580
 And because the number of people in the volunteer force

2:04:45.580 --> 2:04:49.500
 is such a narrow stratum of the population.

2:04:49.500 --> 2:04:51.940
 And so they've been getting away with this

2:04:51.940 --> 2:04:53.660
 because the professional army

2:04:53.660 --> 2:04:56.100
 is much better than the conscript army.

2:04:56.100 --> 2:04:58.940
 And an all volunteer force is much preferable

2:04:58.940 --> 2:05:01.220
 from a military point of view.

2:05:01.220 --> 2:05:05.540
 But from a societal point of view, it enables you

2:05:05.540 --> 2:05:09.300
 to go to war too easily as a politician.

2:05:09.300 --> 2:05:12.340
 And it doesn't engage the society the same way

2:05:12.340 --> 2:05:16.380
 that the Ukrainian society is completely engaged

2:05:16.380 --> 2:05:18.940
 from those young hackers all the way up

2:05:18.940 --> 2:05:20.780
 to those grandmothers.

2:05:20.780 --> 2:05:23.340
 Let me ask you, you're a scholar of history,

2:05:23.340 --> 2:05:28.340
 a scholar of geopolitics, and you're also a human being.

2:05:28.340 --> 2:05:30.140
 You're also a human being.

2:05:30.140 --> 2:05:31.780
 That's kind of you, Lex.

2:05:31.780 --> 2:05:32.620
 I'll take that.

2:05:33.820 --> 2:05:36.620
 What's the value, what's the hope,

2:05:36.620 --> 2:05:39.660
 what's the power of conversation here?

2:05:39.660 --> 2:05:41.860
 If you could sit down with Vladimir Putin

2:05:41.860 --> 2:05:46.860
 and have a conversation versus bullets,

2:05:47.060 --> 2:05:51.140
 human exchange words, is there hope for those?

2:05:51.140 --> 2:05:53.100
 And if so, what would you talk about?

2:05:53.100 --> 2:05:54.300
 What would you ask him?

2:05:55.660 --> 2:05:57.460
 Well, Henry Kissinger,

2:05:57.460 --> 2:05:58.820
 you alluded to his op ed,

2:05:58.820 --> 2:06:01.620
 he's had many private meetings with President Putin

2:06:03.260 --> 2:06:06.140
 over a long time.

2:06:06.140 --> 2:06:10.140
 And President Biden,

2:06:11.140 --> 2:06:14.980
 the previous presidents, secretaries of state,

2:06:16.300 --> 2:06:18.980
 officials below secretary of state,

2:06:18.980 --> 2:06:20.860
 the head of the CIA,

2:06:20.860 --> 2:06:24.580
 evidently met with President Putin in the fall

2:06:24.580 --> 2:06:27.900
 when he was massing the troops on the border

2:06:27.900 --> 2:06:29.220
 before he invaded.

2:06:30.100 --> 2:06:34.020
 And we sent the head of the CIA and Putin received him,

2:06:34.860 --> 2:06:36.980
 somebody he evidently respects

2:06:36.980 --> 2:06:39.220
 or was at least willing to meet,

2:06:39.220 --> 2:06:41.380
 unlike other members of the administration.

2:06:42.620 --> 2:06:45.060
 So a lot of people are talking to him

2:06:45.060 --> 2:06:48.700
 in some form or another for the 22 years

2:06:48.700 --> 2:06:49.820
 he's been in power.

2:06:49.820 --> 2:06:53.900
 And I'm not sure it's had

2:06:53.900 --> 2:06:57.420
 what I would call their desired effect.

2:06:57.420 --> 2:07:00.020
 Well, the nature of the conversation is interesting too.

2:07:00.020 --> 2:07:03.660
 And also the timing, which is post February 22nd,

2:07:03.660 --> 2:07:05.340
 is a different time.

2:07:05.340 --> 2:07:07.460
 And also another aspect,

2:07:09.740 --> 2:07:12.660
 which Oliver Stone mentioned interestingly,

2:07:12.660 --> 2:07:15.940
 that there's something about COVID and the pandemic

2:07:15.940 --> 2:07:18.540
 that creates isolation, the distancing.

2:07:18.540 --> 2:07:21.660
 It's such a silly little nuance thing,

2:07:21.660 --> 2:07:25.740
 but maybe it's actually has a profound impact

2:07:25.740 --> 2:07:29.180
 on the human being, the human mind of Vladimir Putin,

2:07:29.180 --> 2:07:32.140
 that there is something about an in person meeting

2:07:32.140 --> 2:07:35.540
 and not across a table that's far too large,

2:07:35.540 --> 2:07:38.860
 but sort of the intimacy of one human to human

2:07:38.860 --> 2:07:40.460
 in person conversation,

2:07:40.460 --> 2:07:43.820
 that there's something distinctly powerful

2:07:43.820 --> 2:07:48.100
 about that reminder that as Putin says

2:07:48.100 --> 2:07:50.020
 in the narrative and the propaganda

2:07:50.020 --> 2:07:53.980
 that we're all one people, there is truth to that,

2:07:53.980 --> 2:07:57.220
 that this entirety of humanity is one people.

2:07:57.220 --> 2:07:59.580
 And you're kind of reminded by that

2:07:59.580 --> 2:08:01.100
 when you're sitting together.

2:08:02.140 --> 2:08:06.420
 People who have sat across the table from him,

2:08:06.420 --> 2:08:10.340
 whether at 30 yards or at three,

2:08:11.820 --> 2:08:15.660
 have remarked upon this feeling of isolation

2:08:15.660 --> 2:08:18.860
 that has affected him, the pandemic.

2:08:18.860 --> 2:08:21.140
 I think there must be something to that

2:08:21.140 --> 2:08:25.020
 if several people who've been in the room with him

2:08:25.020 --> 2:08:26.180
 are remarking on it.

2:08:27.820 --> 2:08:31.140
 Everybody that I know and I've been able to talk to

2:08:31.140 --> 2:08:34.140
 who's had a meeting with him in the past 10 years,

2:08:35.660 --> 2:08:39.460
 including Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State,

2:08:39.460 --> 2:08:44.460
 has said that Putin spends a lot of time

2:08:45.900 --> 2:08:47.900
 enumerating his grievances.

2:08:49.060 --> 2:08:52.900
 He goes through a monologue of his grievances

2:08:52.900 --> 2:08:54.580
 and then the West did this,

2:08:54.580 --> 2:08:57.420
 and then the West lied to us about that,

2:08:57.420 --> 2:09:00.860
 and then the West cheated us on this.

2:09:00.860 --> 2:09:03.580
 And so it's not the conversation

2:09:03.580 --> 2:09:06.780
 that you're encouraging of common humanity.

2:09:06.780 --> 2:09:10.740
 It's that roiling resentment volcano

2:09:10.740 --> 2:09:13.020
 that's just exploding and exploding.

2:09:13.020 --> 2:09:14.300
 The resentment.

2:09:14.300 --> 2:09:19.300
 And by the time he gets through the monologue

2:09:19.300 --> 2:09:22.460
 of the grievances, the time of the meeting

2:09:22.460 --> 2:09:25.300
 is expired or over time.

2:09:25.300 --> 2:09:26.740
 That's a brilliant statement,

2:09:26.740 --> 2:09:29.460
 but that's where the skill of conversation comes in.

2:09:29.460 --> 2:09:32.780
 Like when you're facing a bull with a red cloth,

2:09:32.780 --> 2:09:35.380
 you have to learn how to avoid the long list of grievances

2:09:35.380 --> 2:09:37.260
 and get to the humanity.

2:09:37.260 --> 2:09:39.540
 That's a really important skill.

2:09:39.540 --> 2:09:40.820
 For sure it's a skill,

2:09:40.820 --> 2:09:44.020
 and it's the highest level skill of a diplomat

2:09:44.020 --> 2:09:47.660
 to be able to reach some type of common understanding

2:09:47.660 --> 2:09:51.500
 when interests and worldviews clash so much.

2:09:51.500 --> 2:09:53.500
 But here's your challenge, Lex.

2:09:54.740 --> 2:09:59.740
 Your challenge is Russia wants to impose

2:09:59.740 --> 2:10:04.740
 a closed sphere of influence on its neighbors.

2:10:05.420 --> 2:10:10.420
 It wants to dictate what its neighbors can and can't do.

2:10:10.420 --> 2:10:12.820
 It wants to exert influence,

2:10:12.820 --> 2:10:15.100
 not by the power of its example,

2:10:15.980 --> 2:10:18.300
 not by the freedom of its people,

2:10:18.300 --> 2:10:22.340
 not by the dynamism of its diversified economy,

2:10:22.340 --> 2:10:24.660
 but it wants to exert influence

2:10:24.660 --> 2:10:27.260
 just because it deserves that,

2:10:27.260 --> 2:10:30.140
 just because it's a great power,

2:10:30.140 --> 2:10:33.260
 just because, and on and on and on.

2:10:33.260 --> 2:10:36.060
 It's a civilization unto itself.

2:10:36.060 --> 2:10:38.980
 And it wants that, and we can't give that.

2:10:40.580 --> 2:10:44.580
 The reason that Russia was not integrated into the West

2:10:44.580 --> 2:10:46.020
 was not for lack of trying.

2:10:47.260 --> 2:10:51.820
 It was because Russia ultimately spurned the integration

2:10:51.820 --> 2:10:54.140
 because it was about what terms

2:10:54.140 --> 2:10:56.460
 the integration would come on.

2:10:56.460 --> 2:11:00.060
 Would you come into the West and observe Western rules

2:11:01.020 --> 2:11:06.020
 and be another country, meaning just another country?

2:11:06.300 --> 2:11:10.580
 There's Poland, and there's Austria,

2:11:10.580 --> 2:11:15.580
 and there's little tiny Monaco, and there's Russia.

2:11:16.620 --> 2:11:19.460
 And you're just one of those countries.

2:11:19.460 --> 2:11:21.900
 And Russia's answer to that was no,

2:11:21.900 --> 2:11:24.380
 we're not just one of those countries.

2:11:24.380 --> 2:11:26.620
 We need special rules.

2:11:26.620 --> 2:11:29.340
 We need special conditions.

2:11:29.340 --> 2:11:33.380
 We'll integrate, but only as a special country,

2:11:33.380 --> 2:11:38.380
 meaning like at the UN, where all countries are sovereign,

2:11:38.540 --> 2:11:40.340
 all countries are members,

2:11:40.340 --> 2:11:44.780
 but Russia has a veto on what countries can and can't do.

2:11:44.780 --> 2:11:48.820
 Those were the terms on which they were willing to integrate.

2:11:48.820 --> 2:11:52.220
 And those were the terms that no leader of a Western country

2:11:52.220 --> 2:11:56.740
 or the United States or the G7 or fill in the blank

2:11:56.740 --> 2:11:58.060
 can grant to Russia.

2:12:00.060 --> 2:12:03.780
 It's very well known that Vladimir Putin

2:12:03.780 --> 2:12:06.460
 was one of the first, maybe the first person,

2:12:06.460 --> 2:12:10.380
 first leader, foreign leader to call President Bush

2:12:10.380 --> 2:12:13.380
 after the 9 11 tragedy.

2:12:13.380 --> 2:12:15.420
 They didn't connect right away.

2:12:15.420 --> 2:12:17.820
 President Bush was not in Washington,

2:12:17.820 --> 2:12:20.260
 but eventually they did speak.

2:12:20.260 --> 2:12:22.020
 He condemned the terrorist attack.

2:12:22.020 --> 2:12:26.420
 He offered Russian support, which he delivered on

2:12:26.420 --> 2:12:28.580
 the use of some Russian logistics

2:12:28.580 --> 2:12:32.220
 for our Afghanistan operations.

2:12:33.300 --> 2:12:35.420
 And a lot of people point to that and they say,

2:12:35.420 --> 2:12:36.500
 there it is.

2:12:36.500 --> 2:12:41.500
 Russia wanted to cooperate and did cooperate

2:12:41.500 --> 2:12:45.780
 and we spurned them or we failed to appreciate

2:12:45.780 --> 2:12:47.580
 Russia's cooperation.

2:12:47.580 --> 2:12:51.380
 And so therefore Russia was cheated or Russia was lied to

2:12:51.380 --> 2:12:53.540
 or Russia's grievances are legitimate.

2:12:54.500 --> 2:12:56.980
 But here's the problem with that argument, Lex.

2:12:58.020 --> 2:13:03.020
 In exchange for that support, Vladimir Putin asked

2:13:03.100 --> 2:13:07.260
 in return from President Bush for a free hand

2:13:07.260 --> 2:13:09.260
 in the former Soviet space,

2:13:09.260 --> 2:13:13.260
 that closed hierarchical sphere of influence

2:13:13.260 --> 2:13:17.420
 where Russia would exert influence coercively

2:13:17.420 --> 2:13:19.180
 over countries that were sovereign.

2:13:19.180 --> 2:13:23.460
 And no American president could grant that.

2:13:23.460 --> 2:13:24.940
 And President Bush was right.

2:13:24.940 --> 2:13:25.900
 He said no.

2:13:26.820 --> 2:13:30.820
 And so the attempted cooperation blew up.

2:13:31.860 --> 2:13:33.260
 But who's at fault there?

2:13:35.700 --> 2:13:40.660
 Should there be a nonvoluntary sphere of influence?

2:13:40.660 --> 2:13:45.340
 Should that be granted or should you face up

2:13:45.340 --> 2:13:47.460
 to attempts to do that?

2:13:47.460 --> 2:13:51.020
 You know, let's take a little detour here

2:13:51.020 --> 2:13:52.460
 into China for a second.

2:13:54.340 --> 2:13:56.660
 China had this brilliant grand strategy,

2:13:57.900 --> 2:14:01.780
 which was sure, America is hostile

2:14:01.780 --> 2:14:03.580
 because America is hegemonic.

2:14:03.580 --> 2:14:05.780
 America wants to control the world.

2:14:05.780 --> 2:14:07.860
 America will never let China rise.

2:14:07.860 --> 2:14:11.420
 America will do everything it can to hold China down.

2:14:11.420 --> 2:14:14.940
 So we're gonna have hostility from America.

2:14:14.940 --> 2:14:17.780
 We don't wanna decouple because we need

2:14:17.780 --> 2:14:20.500
 that high end technology transfer.

2:14:20.500 --> 2:14:22.300
 Either we buy it or we steal it

2:14:22.300 --> 2:14:24.140
 because America and the rest of the West

2:14:24.140 --> 2:14:26.660
 has all the technology that we need.

2:14:26.660 --> 2:14:29.140
 We have some of it domestically,

2:14:29.140 --> 2:14:31.140
 more than before by a lot,

2:14:31.140 --> 2:14:33.980
 but we're still dependent so we can't decouple.

2:14:33.980 --> 2:14:35.660
 So we'll have the hostility,

2:14:35.660 --> 2:14:37.460
 but there'll be a line we don't cross

2:14:37.460 --> 2:14:40.180
 just so that we don't lose the technology transfer.

2:14:40.180 --> 2:14:45.180
 Till Made in China 2035 is accomplished

2:14:45.620 --> 2:14:48.380
 and we're self sufficient domestically

2:14:48.380 --> 2:14:50.940
 in AI and every other area that's critical.

2:14:52.340 --> 2:14:53.900
 But hostility from America.

2:14:53.900 --> 2:14:55.860
 But we have an ace in the hole.

2:14:55.860 --> 2:14:58.060
 Our ace in the hole is Europe.

2:14:58.060 --> 2:15:00.100
 Europe hates conflict.

2:15:00.100 --> 2:15:01.540
 They're all about trade.

2:15:02.420 --> 2:15:04.700
 Doesn't matter how evil you are.

2:15:04.700 --> 2:15:09.100
 They love to trade because Wandel durch Handel,

2:15:09.100 --> 2:15:10.580
 change through trade.

2:15:10.580 --> 2:15:11.660
 They have this illusion

2:15:11.660 --> 2:15:14.300
 that you're gonna become a better country

2:15:14.300 --> 2:15:15.500
 if they trade with you

2:15:15.500 --> 2:15:18.020
 and you won't have conflict, war and hostilities

2:15:18.020 --> 2:15:19.460
 if you trade.

2:15:19.460 --> 2:15:22.460
 And so we have this European ace in the hole.

2:15:22.460 --> 2:15:24.260
 We're hostile with the Americans.

2:15:24.260 --> 2:15:27.820
 We're still buying or stealing their technology.

2:15:27.820 --> 2:15:29.620
 And better than that even,

2:15:29.620 --> 2:15:32.660
 the Europeans are not hostile to us at all.

2:15:32.660 --> 2:15:33.780
 They love to trade with us

2:15:33.780 --> 2:15:35.100
 and they wanna trade more

2:15:35.100 --> 2:15:38.180
 and they're our biggest trading partner already.

2:15:38.180 --> 2:15:39.180
 And lo and behold,

2:15:39.180 --> 2:15:41.740
 Xi Jinping sides with Vladimir Putin

2:15:42.620 --> 2:15:45.100
 in the aggression in Ukraine.

2:15:45.100 --> 2:15:49.300
 He doesn't side with him providing military equipment.

2:15:49.300 --> 2:15:51.860
 He doesn't provide technology transfer

2:15:52.940 --> 2:15:55.620
 but he provides public support

2:15:55.620 --> 2:15:58.060
 and massive pro Russian propaganda

2:15:58.060 --> 2:15:59.940
 to the whole Chinese population.

2:16:01.900 --> 2:16:04.300
 And the Europeans say, wait a minute,

2:16:04.300 --> 2:16:07.620
 this is an invasion of a sovereign country in Europe.

2:16:07.620 --> 2:16:08.620
 What do you mean?

2:16:09.580 --> 2:16:12.940
 You're not condemning Vladimir Putin's invasion.

2:16:12.940 --> 2:16:15.700
 And so that wedge that the Chinese had,

2:16:15.700 --> 2:16:18.340
 that was the basis of their grand strategy,

2:16:18.340 --> 2:16:21.060
 that wedge between the US and Europe

2:16:21.060 --> 2:16:23.060
 when it came to China policy,

2:16:23.060 --> 2:16:24.820
 that wedge is gone now.

2:16:24.820 --> 2:16:27.100
 Xi Jinping destroyed it.

2:16:27.100 --> 2:16:29.180
 And the Europeans and the Americans

2:16:29.180 --> 2:16:31.340
 are coming close together

2:16:31.340 --> 2:16:34.700
 on Ukraine and Russia policy for sure,

2:16:34.700 --> 2:16:38.420
 but also more and more on China policy.

2:16:38.420 --> 2:16:40.740
 And so that was a pretty big sacrifice

2:16:40.740 --> 2:16:42.740
 for the Chinese leader to make.

2:16:42.740 --> 2:16:44.260
 And what did he get in return?

2:16:45.420 --> 2:16:49.980
 He gets hydrocarbons from Russia at reduced prices.

2:16:49.980 --> 2:16:53.620
 And the Chinese get hydrocarbons from a lot of countries.

2:16:54.540 --> 2:16:58.660
 They have a completely diverse supply chain

2:16:58.660 --> 2:16:59.620
 for their energy.

2:16:59.620 --> 2:17:02.140
 So what do you think Xi Jinping is thinking now?

2:17:02.140 --> 2:17:04.500
 Was it a mistake or?

2:17:04.500 --> 2:17:06.140
 I'd like to know, Lex.

2:17:06.140 --> 2:17:08.580
 I'd like you to be able to sit down with him

2:17:08.580 --> 2:17:11.460
 across from this table here on your podcast

2:17:11.460 --> 2:17:13.380
 and pose that same question to him

2:17:13.380 --> 2:17:14.780
 because we have no idea.

2:17:14.780 --> 2:17:16.740
 There's a language barrier that's fascinating.

2:17:16.740 --> 2:17:20.140
 By the way, you as a scholar of Stalin,

2:17:20.140 --> 2:17:21.580
 do you think we'll ever break through

2:17:21.580 --> 2:17:24.100
 the language barrier to China?

2:17:24.100 --> 2:17:27.180
 Not ever, I apologize, in the next few years

2:17:27.180 --> 2:17:30.860
 because there is a gigantic cultural and language barrier

2:17:30.860 --> 2:17:32.380
 between the West and the Chinese.

2:17:32.380 --> 2:17:34.300
 China's a great civilization.

2:17:34.300 --> 2:17:39.300
 China predates the United States by millennia.

2:17:39.740 --> 2:17:42.540
 China's accomplishments are breathtaking.

2:17:42.540 --> 2:17:46.220
 But China's also led by, let's be honest,

2:17:46.220 --> 2:17:48.460
 a Communist Party monopoly

2:17:49.740 --> 2:17:52.940
 which engages in a lot of criminal behavior.

2:17:52.940 --> 2:17:56.180
 Lex, Tibet is Ukraine.

2:17:57.260 --> 2:17:59.740
 Xinjiang is Ukraine.

2:17:59.740 --> 2:18:03.300
 Hong Kong is Ukraine,

2:18:04.980 --> 2:18:07.260
 let alone support for Putin, Ukraine.

2:18:07.260 --> 2:18:09.540
 This is before we've even discussed Taiwan.

2:18:10.420 --> 2:18:13.220
 And so now the Europeans are coming to see this

2:18:13.220 --> 2:18:16.340
 and the Americans are coming to understand this,

2:18:16.340 --> 2:18:20.100
 that maybe trading with a regime like that,

2:18:22.060 --> 2:18:25.500
 morally, politically, criminally,

2:18:25.500 --> 2:18:28.660
 Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong,

2:18:28.660 --> 2:18:31.900
 how is that different from what Putin is doing in Ukraine?

2:18:31.900 --> 2:18:35.700
 I'd be hard pressed to differentiate that ultimately,

2:18:35.700 --> 2:18:38.660
 even though the analogies are not exact.

2:18:38.660 --> 2:18:43.660
 And so the Chinese, it's like that guy Leonov,

2:18:43.860 --> 2:18:46.140
 the author of Licheletia,

2:18:46.140 --> 2:18:50.860
 the great memoir of the late Soviet period,

2:18:50.860 --> 2:18:52.700
 the end of the Soviet Union.

2:18:52.700 --> 2:18:55.140
 You know that they spend all this time

2:18:55.140 --> 2:18:58.180
 and all these resources blackening our image,

2:18:58.180 --> 2:19:00.500
 but we supply them with endless material

2:19:00.500 --> 2:19:02.340
 to blacken our image.

2:19:02.340 --> 2:19:05.700
 That's where Xi Jinping's regime is right now, Lex.

2:19:05.700 --> 2:19:09.580
 And so they have a big dilemma on their side.

2:19:09.580 --> 2:19:11.700
 It's a Western world

2:19:11.700 --> 2:19:14.300
 and they've united the Western world

2:19:14.300 --> 2:19:19.300
 and reawoken the Western world

2:19:19.340 --> 2:19:23.620
 to the fact that China is a threat

2:19:23.620 --> 2:19:27.660
 to the values, the institutions and values of the West.

2:19:27.660 --> 2:19:31.100
 And that trade is not transforming China quite the opposite.

2:19:32.020 --> 2:19:34.100
 We'll see if this endures.

2:19:34.100 --> 2:19:35.420
 Maybe it doesn't endure.

2:19:35.420 --> 2:19:36.940
 Maybe it's a fleeting moment.

2:19:36.940 --> 2:19:39.580
 Maybe this is not an inflection point.

2:19:39.580 --> 2:19:43.820
 Maybe the war in Ukraine ends more quickly than we think.

2:19:43.820 --> 2:19:45.660
 And maybe like you said,

2:19:45.660 --> 2:19:48.220
 the Chinese and the Indians and the rest of them,

2:19:48.220 --> 2:19:50.780
 the leaders there, they get their wish that it ends

2:19:50.780 --> 2:19:54.460
 and the world moves on and forgets

2:19:54.460 --> 2:19:59.460
 or says, let's try again to resume

2:19:59.940 --> 2:20:01.740
 our mutual understanding,

2:20:01.740 --> 2:20:04.860
 our mutually beneficial trade and everything else.

2:20:04.860 --> 2:20:06.420
 Maybe it's a passing phase.

2:20:06.420 --> 2:20:07.420
 We can't exclude that.

2:20:07.420 --> 2:20:09.700
 I'm very poor at predicting the future.

2:20:10.540 --> 2:20:14.820
 But the moment is not a good one for the Chinese regime,

2:20:14.820 --> 2:20:18.540
 let alone the fact that he's trying to impose

2:20:19.740 --> 2:20:23.740
 an unprecedented in the modern era third term

2:20:23.740 --> 2:20:26.140
 for himself as president in the fall

2:20:26.140 --> 2:20:28.420
 at the next party Congress,

2:20:28.420 --> 2:20:33.420
 becoming president for life de facto, a Mao like figure.

2:20:35.420 --> 2:20:40.420
 And he's now got to do that within this environment

2:20:41.020 --> 2:20:45.140
 where he has damaged Chinese grand strategy

2:20:45.140 --> 2:20:47.700
 and damaged the reputation of China

2:20:47.700 --> 2:20:51.020
 and its relationships across the world.

2:20:51.020 --> 2:20:53.780
 Maybe not permanently, but significantly,

2:20:54.700 --> 2:20:57.140
 in addition to the problems they have at home,

2:20:57.140 --> 2:21:02.140
 demography, as you know, a middle income trap,

2:21:02.260 --> 2:21:07.260
 and then the regulatory insanity of Chinese communist rule

2:21:07.780 --> 2:21:10.740
 that we've seen with the tech companies that you know well,

2:21:10.740 --> 2:21:12.860
 where they've destroyed all of that value

2:21:14.100 --> 2:21:17.140
 with the blow up of their property sector

2:21:17.140 --> 2:21:19.660
 because it was a massive bubble

2:21:19.660 --> 2:21:21.940
 and that's still playing out.

2:21:21.940 --> 2:21:24.180
 And this time it's the same,

2:21:24.180 --> 2:21:27.060
 meaning this time it's not different.

2:21:27.060 --> 2:21:29.060
 When it comes to a property blowout,

2:21:29.060 --> 2:21:33.220
 it has enormous effects on middle class balance sheets

2:21:33.220 --> 2:21:37.580
 and their ability to remain consumers

2:21:37.580 --> 2:21:38.820
 and drive the economy,

2:21:38.820 --> 2:21:40.940
 which is the model that they have to share.

2:21:40.940 --> 2:21:45.940
 So he's got a litany of challenges independent even

2:21:45.940 --> 2:21:50.940
 of the fact that he sided with his pal Vladimir Putin

2:21:51.580 --> 2:21:54.220
 and their bromance is costing China

2:21:54.220 --> 2:21:55.940
 very, very significantly.

2:21:55.940 --> 2:21:58.660
 If you close your eyes.

2:21:58.660 --> 2:21:59.940
 Yes.

2:21:59.940 --> 2:22:03.540
 And a hundred years ago in 1922

2:22:03.540 --> 2:22:05.860
 and you think about the future,

2:22:05.860 --> 2:22:08.300
 I wonder if you can hear the drums of war

2:22:09.980 --> 2:22:11.780
 predicting the 30s,

2:22:11.780 --> 2:22:16.700
 predicting the great depression and the resentment

2:22:16.700 --> 2:22:20.180
 that builds the economic resentment,

2:22:20.180 --> 2:22:22.700
 the cultural resentment, the geopolitical resentment

2:22:22.700 --> 2:22:24.900
 that builds and leads to World War II.

2:22:26.540 --> 2:22:28.780
 At least to me, when I close my eyes,

2:22:28.780 --> 2:22:33.220
 I can hear the drums of war that are still ahead of us.

2:22:33.220 --> 2:22:36.220
 And it's possible that 2022 will materialize

2:22:36.220 --> 2:22:41.220
 in a similar way as did 1922.

2:22:45.180 --> 2:22:46.980
 I have my eyes closed, Lex.

2:22:46.980 --> 2:22:48.060
 Do you hear anything?

2:22:48.060 --> 2:22:51.860
 And I sure hope that that's not what happens.

2:22:51.860 --> 2:22:56.740
 But I'm looking in 1922, it's an epoch I know well

2:22:56.740 --> 2:23:00.180
 and I don't see the future that unfolds.

2:23:00.180 --> 2:23:02.980
 I would not have predicted it had I been alive then.

2:23:02.980 --> 2:23:06.640
 I see the war behind us.

2:23:06.640 --> 2:23:10.040
 I see a prosperity on the horizon.

2:23:10.040 --> 2:23:11.960
 Yes, inflation in Germany

2:23:11.960 --> 2:23:15.840
 and some many other difficult issues,

2:23:15.840 --> 2:23:18.400
 but there are more democracies now

2:23:18.400 --> 2:23:19.800
 than there were before the war

2:23:19.800 --> 2:23:22.200
 and the old empires are gone.

2:23:22.200 --> 2:23:24.400
 And there's a cultural efflorescence

2:23:24.400 --> 2:23:26.480
 and there's modernism in the arts

2:23:26.480 --> 2:23:29.480
 and there's women entering the public sphere

2:23:29.480 --> 2:23:31.680
 and there's all this fantastic new technology

2:23:31.680 --> 2:23:33.800
 like automobiles.

2:23:33.800 --> 2:23:38.360
 And I'm looking at the future from 1922

2:23:38.360 --> 2:23:40.680
 and I'm not seeing the Great Depression

2:23:40.680 --> 2:23:42.280
 and I'm not seeing World War II

2:23:42.280 --> 2:23:44.600
 and I'm not seeing the Holocaust

2:23:44.600 --> 2:23:48.000
 because I don't predict the future

2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:51.140
 and nobody in 1922 could see that future,

2:23:51.140 --> 2:23:54.200
 although I guess there were some clairvoyants

2:23:54.200 --> 2:23:56.260
 who predicted it, but.

2:23:56.260 --> 2:23:57.640
 But you're not one of them.

2:23:57.640 --> 2:23:59.560
 I'm not one of them.

2:23:59.560 --> 2:24:03.360
 But this is what I know, Lex, from studying history.

2:24:03.360 --> 2:24:05.480
 What I know is stuff happens.

2:24:05.480 --> 2:24:10.480
 In other words, in other words, Lex,

2:24:10.820 --> 2:24:13.660
 we're watching Ukraine war right now

2:24:13.660 --> 2:24:16.060
 and all of our attention is focused on that.

2:24:16.960 --> 2:24:19.560
 And it's like the economists say in their textbooks

2:24:19.560 --> 2:24:24.040
 when their powerful models are employed

2:24:24.040 --> 2:24:26.120
 and there's this line that says

2:24:26.120 --> 2:24:30.280
 all other factors held constant, comma,

2:24:31.200 --> 2:24:33.400
 and then the model works.

2:24:33.400 --> 2:24:35.160
 And you get this really great result.

2:24:35.160 --> 2:24:39.640
 It's very powerful predictor and analysis, the model.

2:24:40.780 --> 2:24:44.300
 And the whole game is all other factors held constant.

2:24:45.420 --> 2:24:48.240
 So the Russia, Ukraine war that we've been discussing

2:24:48.240 --> 2:24:50.640
 and this could happen and that could happen,

2:24:50.640 --> 2:24:53.080
 but you know what stuff could happen, Lex.

2:24:53.080 --> 2:24:56.200
 For example, the Israeli government

2:24:56.200 --> 2:25:00.240
 could decide this summer that it's gonna bomb Iran

2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:03.480
 because no Israeli government will tolerate Iran

2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:05.840
 acquiring a nuclear weapon.

2:25:05.840 --> 2:25:08.720
 And since President Trump exited,

2:25:08.720 --> 2:25:13.720
 unilaterally exited from the multipower nuclear agreement,

2:25:14.540 --> 2:25:17.120
 Iran is now much closer to the bomb than they were

2:25:18.300 --> 2:25:19.140
 when they were still in,

2:25:19.140 --> 2:25:22.080
 when the United States was still in that agreement.

2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:24.260
 And you tell me the Israeli government that says,

2:25:24.260 --> 2:25:26.900
 sure, it's fine, it's okay, Iran can get the bomb.

2:25:28.120 --> 2:25:29.800
 And so maybe that happens.

2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:31.840
 And maybe that happens as early as this summer

2:25:31.840 --> 2:25:35.760
 as Iran gets closer and closer and closer to the bomb.

2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:40.760
 Maybe that guy in North Korea decides it's his time

2:25:40.760 --> 2:25:45.640
 just like his grandfather, right, in 1950 decided,

2:25:45.640 --> 2:25:48.280
 you know, it's time, we're gonna quote reunify,

2:25:48.280 --> 2:25:53.280
 unquote, the Korean peninsula, maybe, I don't know, Lex,

2:25:54.760 --> 2:25:57.400
 fill in the blank, something's gonna happen.

2:25:57.400 --> 2:25:59.240
 It's not gonna be what I predict.

2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:01.880
 It's not gonna be what I'm watching.

2:26:01.880 --> 2:26:05.600
 It's gonna be obvious only after it happens, not before.

2:26:06.520 --> 2:26:08.720
 And then it's gonna upend the table.

2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:12.080
 And all of a sudden.

2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:12.920
 Everything changes.

2:26:12.920 --> 2:26:14.680
 We're gonna be in a different environment,

2:26:14.680 --> 2:26:18.520
 different circumstances, and is Ukraine still

2:26:18.520 --> 2:26:23.200
 as central at that point as it seems to be right now?

2:26:23.200 --> 2:26:24.880
 I don't know the answer to that question.

2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:28.060
 Let me ask two rapid fire questions.

2:26:28.060 --> 2:26:29.600
 You're only allowed to have one minute

2:26:29.600 --> 2:26:32.160
 and it's about predicting the future.

2:26:32.160 --> 2:26:36.400
 Okay, question one, Vladimir Putin,

2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:39.760
 when will he no longer be in office?

2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:44.760
 And will he step down or be overthrown?

2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:48.320
 What's your prediction and a brief explanation

2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:49.400
 of that prediction?

2:26:49.400 --> 2:26:52.000
 Now, nobody can predict the future,

2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:53.560
 but what's your sense now?

2:26:53.560 --> 2:26:56.880
 Some people are saying the pressure is building.

2:26:56.880 --> 2:26:59.560
 He's going to be overthrown or step down

2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:01.080
 at the end of this year.

2:27:01.080 --> 2:27:06.080
 And some people say surely he's going to last,

2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:09.200
 outlast Stalin's rule of 30 plus years.

2:27:09.200 --> 2:27:14.200
 No evidence of a coup yet, none whatsoever, yet.

2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:22.380
 He's pretty much at life expectancy for a Russian male.

2:27:23.940 --> 2:27:25.560
 Those are bad numbers.

2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:29.260
 He's 69, gonna be 70.

2:27:29.260 --> 2:27:32.620
 So he's lived the life of a Russian male already,

2:27:32.620 --> 2:27:36.120
 but he's got better doctors than the majority

2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:41.120
 of the Russian males in that, let's say comparison set.

2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:46.320
 So he could live a very long time with good doctors.

2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:49.680
 So there could be a coup at some point,

2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:54.360
 but there's none today in evidence.

2:27:54.360 --> 2:27:58.360
 He could go because he's reached the life expectancy

2:27:58.360 --> 2:28:00.960
 or he could stay for a long time.

2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:04.120
 The thing to watch about this

2:28:04.120 --> 2:28:08.520
 is an organization that nobody pays attention to.

2:28:08.520 --> 2:28:12.720
 The FSO, the Federalnaya Sluzhba Akhrani,

2:28:12.720 --> 2:28:15.080
 which is the Praetorian Guard,

2:28:15.080 --> 2:28:18.640
 the self standing bodyguard directorate,

2:28:18.640 --> 2:28:21.860
 the only one, the only organization in Russia

2:28:21.860 --> 2:28:24.240
 that has any access to him.

2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:28.640
 We've seen no disloyalty, no breaking of ranks,

2:28:28.640 --> 2:28:33.520
 no defections, nothing in the public realm and open sources

2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:37.840
 about any divisions or problems in the FSO,

2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:39.840
 in the Praetorian Guard.

2:28:39.840 --> 2:28:44.840
 So if you can't break that, change that illicit defections

2:28:47.640 --> 2:28:50.120
 there, you can't overturn him.

2:28:50.120 --> 2:28:52.840
 Authoritarian regimes, Lex, they're terrible.

2:28:52.840 --> 2:28:54.680
 They fail at everything.

2:28:54.680 --> 2:28:57.480
 They can't feed their people.

2:28:57.480 --> 2:29:00.720
 They have trouble achieving any goals.

2:29:00.720 --> 2:29:04.200
 They only have to be good, however, at one thing.

2:29:04.200 --> 2:29:05.320
 They only have to be good

2:29:05.320 --> 2:29:08.960
 at the complete suppression of political alternatives.

2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:12.400
 If you can suppress political alternatives,

2:29:12.400 --> 2:29:14.520
 you can fail at everything else,

2:29:14.520 --> 2:29:17.640
 but you can survive as an authoritarian regime.

2:29:17.640 --> 2:29:19.520
 So you watch Navalny.

2:29:19.520 --> 2:29:21.760
 He's still alive.

2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:23.920
 Okay, Lex, you go for it.

2:29:23.920 --> 2:29:26.760
 That's my second rapid fire question

2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:28.400
 is what happens to Navalny?

2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:31.440
 What are the possible conclusions of what you said

2:29:31.440 --> 2:29:33.840
 quite possibly the second most influential,

2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:36.240
 powerful figure in Russia?

2:29:38.280 --> 2:29:41.000
 Is he going to die in jail?

2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:44.040
 Will he become the next president of Russia?

2:29:44.040 --> 2:29:45.840
 Well, what are the possible?

2:29:45.840 --> 2:29:47.480
 I wish I knew, Lex.

2:29:47.480 --> 2:29:50.520
 I've been surprised that he's still alive.

2:29:50.520 --> 2:29:54.760
 I've been worried that he will be killed in prison

2:29:54.760 --> 2:29:59.760
 in a staged fight, some security officer,

2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:03.360
 prison guard puts on a prison outfit,

2:30:03.360 --> 2:30:05.320
 takes a lead pipe, goes into the cell.

2:30:05.320 --> 2:30:08.640
 They have a quote fight and Navalny is killed.

2:30:08.640 --> 2:30:11.600
 I've been afraid of that, but he's still alive

2:30:11.600 --> 2:30:14.480
 even though he's serving a long sentence.

2:30:14.480 --> 2:30:19.080
 So that leads me to guess that people inside

2:30:19.080 --> 2:30:22.000
 the Putin regime and maybe President Putin himself

2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:27.000
 understand that Navalny is their ticket to lift sanctions.

2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:33.680
 That Navalny is even more popular outside of Russia

2:30:33.680 --> 2:30:35.280
 than he is inside of Russia.

2:30:35.280 --> 2:30:39.360
 He's the leader in many ways of the political opposition

2:30:39.360 --> 2:30:42.720
 in the country, even while still in prison,

2:30:42.720 --> 2:30:45.440
 his organization's been destroyed,

2:30:45.440 --> 2:30:48.680
 but he doesn't have majority support in the population

2:30:48.680 --> 2:30:50.320
 by any stretch of the imagination,

2:30:50.320 --> 2:30:52.720
 but he's a big figure in the West,

2:30:52.720 --> 2:30:54.960
 including here in the US.

2:30:54.960 --> 2:30:57.440
 And so Navalny could be their ticket.

2:30:57.440 --> 2:31:00.000
 They're kind of get out of jail card,

2:31:00.000 --> 2:31:02.560
 meaning they release him from prison.

2:31:02.560 --> 2:31:03.960
 He gets appointed, I don't know,

2:31:03.960 --> 2:31:06.520
 prime minister even by the Putin regime

2:31:06.520 --> 2:31:09.440
 if he were willing to accept such a position.

2:31:09.440 --> 2:31:11.600
 And I have my doubts about that.

2:31:11.600 --> 2:31:14.440
 And then that's how they lobby

2:31:14.440 --> 2:31:17.200
 to remove the sanctions against them.

2:31:17.200 --> 2:31:20.400
 So he's a card that President Putin could play.

2:31:21.640 --> 2:31:24.840
 And so maybe that's the reason he's still alive,

2:31:24.840 --> 2:31:28.520
 or maybe there are other reasons that we don't know.

2:31:28.520 --> 2:31:33.520
 And so some alternative to Putin is more likely to arise

2:31:34.320 --> 2:31:39.320
 inside his gang, Putin's Shika, as they say, right?

2:31:39.640 --> 2:31:44.640
 Inside his gang, where they tire of his mistakes,

2:31:44.640 --> 2:31:48.320
 they tire of his self defeating actions.

2:31:48.320 --> 2:31:51.320
 And they say, patriotically for Russia,

2:31:52.200 --> 2:31:56.000
 we need to do something against, move against this guy

2:31:56.000 --> 2:31:58.880
 because he's hurting our country

2:31:58.880 --> 2:32:01.360
 and also because I could do better.

2:32:01.360 --> 2:32:04.760
 I'm ambitious as well as patriotic.

2:32:04.760 --> 2:32:06.880
 But once again, the problem there, Lex,

2:32:06.880 --> 2:32:11.880
 is Putin is surrounded by this cocoon known as the FSO.

2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:15.880
 He meets on Zoom, predominantly with the rest

2:32:15.880 --> 2:32:17.880
 of the government, including with the defense

2:32:17.880 --> 2:32:20.560
 and security officials.

2:32:20.560 --> 2:32:24.400
 They don't have frequent access to his person.

2:32:24.400 --> 2:32:27.880
 And as you were alluding earlier to the pandemic,

2:32:27.880 --> 2:32:29.960
 they have to quarantine for two weeks

2:32:29.960 --> 2:32:31.880
 before every meeting with him.

2:32:31.880 --> 2:32:36.320
 And moreover, you know, Lex, they don't know where he is.

2:32:36.320 --> 2:32:38.720
 You see, when they're on Zoom with him,

2:32:38.720 --> 2:32:43.720
 and the room, it's the Valdai.

2:32:44.240 --> 2:32:48.240
 His office in the Valdai region looks the same

2:32:48.240 --> 2:32:51.720
 as his office in Sochi,

2:32:51.720 --> 2:32:54.920
 or his office outside of Moscow in Novogorod.

2:32:54.920 --> 2:32:57.280
 They're made up to look very similar on Zoom.

2:32:58.960 --> 2:33:02.360
 And sure, some signs they're looking, where is it?

2:33:02.360 --> 2:33:05.040
 But maybe they don't know.

2:33:05.040 --> 2:33:06.760
 And so they're not sure.

2:33:06.760 --> 2:33:10.920
 Maybe they don't know, and so you're gonna move on him,

2:33:10.920 --> 2:33:13.640
 and you're gonna jump him in his Kremlin,

2:33:13.640 --> 2:33:17.240
 his dacha outside Moscow.

2:33:17.240 --> 2:33:20.080
 And it turns out he's in Sochi, or vice versa.

2:33:20.080 --> 2:33:23.280
 And it turns out the FSO is loyal to him

2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:24.920
 and won't let you anyway.

2:33:24.920 --> 2:33:29.920
 So Lex, we don't know, but we watch this FSO really closely,

2:33:30.640 --> 2:33:34.160
 and we think that the elites, if not Putin,

2:33:34.160 --> 2:33:37.240
 but maybe Putin too, understand Navalny

2:33:37.240 --> 2:33:40.400
 as a really big potential political card

2:33:40.400 --> 2:33:41.960
 that they could play.

2:33:41.960 --> 2:33:46.040
 And one last question, the biggest question.

2:33:46.040 --> 2:33:49.320
 You studied some of the darkest aspects

2:33:49.320 --> 2:33:52.200
 of human history, human nature.

2:33:52.200 --> 2:33:54.600
 Let me ask the why question.

2:33:54.600 --> 2:33:56.360
 What are we doing here?

2:33:57.240 --> 2:33:59.840
 What's the meaning of our existence,

2:33:59.840 --> 2:34:01.840
 our life here on Earth?

2:34:01.840 --> 2:34:04.600
 What are we humans trying to get at here?

2:34:04.600 --> 2:34:07.120
 I can't answer that question either,

2:34:07.120 --> 2:34:11.320
 but I can say that having a purposeful life

2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:14.320
 is actually not that hard.

2:34:15.640 --> 2:34:18.840
 You can't, you're not Gandhi, right?

2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:21.480
 You're not President Roosevelt.

2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:25.240
 You're not gonna transform a country or a civilization

2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:30.120
 or become immortal because of your courage

2:34:30.120 --> 2:34:33.880
 and your insight and your genius at critical moments.

2:34:35.320 --> 2:34:37.360
 But you live in an environment,

2:34:37.360 --> 2:34:41.200
 you're in a school, you're in a workplace,

2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:44.760
 you're somewhere where you can affect other people

2:34:44.760 --> 2:34:46.680
 in a positive way.

2:34:46.680 --> 2:34:48.680
 It can be not just about yourself,

2:34:48.680 --> 2:34:50.160
 but it can be about them.

2:34:51.040 --> 2:34:55.560
 And you can have a positive impact on other people's lives

2:34:55.560 --> 2:34:57.320
 through the work that you do,

2:34:57.320 --> 2:35:00.080
 whether that's your employment or your charity

2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:03.200
 or your spare time or your work time.

2:35:03.200 --> 2:35:07.200
 It can be by modeling proper behavior, right?

2:35:07.200 --> 2:35:12.200
 Admitting your mistakes, hard to do, but necessary.

2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:14.640
 Remembering that you don't know everything,

2:35:14.640 --> 2:35:16.040
 you can't predict the future,

2:35:16.040 --> 2:35:17.480
 but you don't even know everything

2:35:17.480 --> 2:35:20.200
 in your areas of expertise.

2:35:20.200 --> 2:35:23.640
 Painfully reminded of that humility at times,

2:35:23.640 --> 2:35:25.960
 but remind yourself too.

2:35:25.960 --> 2:35:30.960
 So you can lead a life that can show others

2:35:31.760 --> 2:35:34.040
 what good values are,

2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:37.520
 and you can lead a life that dedicates yourself

2:35:37.520 --> 2:35:40.880
 not only to your own material wellbeing,

2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:42.440
 but to the wellbeing

2:35:42.440 --> 2:35:44.400
 and to the development of others around you.

2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:47.280
 And it can be on a humble scale.

2:35:47.280 --> 2:35:50.320
 It can be in a small classroom or a small workplace,

2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:54.680
 a small work team, but it can be done.

2:35:54.680 --> 2:35:58.680
 And you can be reminded that having a positive impact

2:35:58.680 --> 2:36:00.920
 even on one other person

2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:04.240
 gives far greater meaning to your own life.

2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:06.520
 And it's profoundly satisfying,

2:36:06.520 --> 2:36:10.840
 much more satisfying than the attention you might get,

2:36:10.840 --> 2:36:15.280
 let's say on social media or awards you might receive.

2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:17.720
 There's nothing wrong with pursuing those.

2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:21.160
 People pursue them and it's a free society.

2:36:21.160 --> 2:36:26.160
 But leading a purposeful life intentionally is possible.

2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:30.560
 Even just one person, I love the expression,

2:36:30.560 --> 2:36:33.400
 save one life, save the world.

2:36:33.400 --> 2:36:36.520
 Just focusing on the local,

2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:39.080
 on the tiny little difference you can make in the world

2:36:39.080 --> 2:36:40.680
 can somehow ripple.

2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:42.040
 Every day.

2:36:42.040 --> 2:36:44.520
 If you think about that every single day,

2:36:44.520 --> 2:36:47.680
 you're a better person.

2:36:47.680 --> 2:36:49.520
 We're a better society.

2:36:49.520 --> 2:36:52.920
 And maybe you get to add a bit of love to the world

2:36:52.920 --> 2:36:53.800
 after all.

2:36:55.400 --> 2:36:59.200
 Steven, this is a huge honor for many reasons,

2:36:59.200 --> 2:37:01.720
 one of which is I can just tell

2:37:01.720 --> 2:37:04.240
 how much care you put into this conversation

2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:08.360
 and how much, I use the word love a lot,

2:37:08.360 --> 2:37:12.720
 but I just feel the love that,

2:37:12.720 --> 2:37:14.600
 just even the respect you give me,

2:37:14.600 --> 2:37:17.760
 which I can't tell you how energizing that is,

2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:19.880
 how much that gives me strength

2:37:19.880 --> 2:37:22.560
 for my own silly little pursuits.

2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:24.840
 Thank you so much for doing that.

2:37:24.840 --> 2:37:26.360
 Thank you for not just talking today,

2:37:26.360 --> 2:37:29.200
 but giving me so much respect

2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:30.680
 just with everything you're doing.

2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:32.160
 I really appreciate that.

2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:33.800
 It makes me feel special.

2:37:33.800 --> 2:37:36.000
 So thank you so much for sitting down and talking today.

2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.520
 Mutual, Lex, thank you as well

2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:41.600
 and thank you for the respect that you've shown me.

2:37:41.600 --> 2:37:43.400
 These are really difficult issues

2:37:43.400 --> 2:37:45.680
 that don't have simple answers.

2:37:45.680 --> 2:37:48.320
 But that doesn't mean we give up.

2:37:48.320 --> 2:37:52.920
 We have to keep thinking and learning and trying

2:37:52.920 --> 2:37:56.040
 and finding solutions in everything we do,

2:37:56.040 --> 2:37:59.360
 including on these big global tragedies

2:37:59.360 --> 2:38:01.040
 that we live through.

2:38:01.040 --> 2:38:04.560
 And it's heartbreaking what's going on.

2:38:04.560 --> 2:38:06.600
 It just breaks my heart every day.

2:38:06.600 --> 2:38:08.080
 A person who studies this,

2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:10.760
 I've been studying this for decades,

2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:12.080
 and it keeps happening.

2:38:12.080 --> 2:38:15.440
 And you think, again, and yes, it is again,

2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:18.120
 but we still have to keep trying

2:38:18.120 --> 2:38:20.120
 and we have to be inspired

2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:23.160
 by those people who are more courageous than we are

2:38:23.160 --> 2:38:26.160
 and sacrifice more than we sacrifice.

2:38:26.160 --> 2:38:29.520
 For me, the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

2:38:29.520 --> 2:38:34.520
 the war in Ukraine is experienced in my study at home

2:38:34.840 --> 2:38:36.640
 and in my office at Princeton

2:38:36.640 --> 2:38:39.000
 or my coming office at Stanford

2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:41.840
 when I moved full time to Stanford in September.

2:38:41.840 --> 2:38:46.840
 Or it's experienced far away in safety and in comfort.

2:38:48.640 --> 2:38:50.840
 And we have to remember that too

2:38:50.840 --> 2:38:52.400
 when we talk about these things,

2:38:52.400 --> 2:38:55.040
 when we answer your questions, right?

2:38:55.040 --> 2:38:58.120
 That as we speak and as we comment

2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:00.360
 and think we're experts on these things

2:39:00.360 --> 2:39:02.480
 from the comfort of our existence,

2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:07.280
 that there are people in those tragedies right now.

2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:09.120
 With no power, with no food,

2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:12.560
 with no, with full uncertainty about the future

2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:14.280
 of the health of their children.

2:39:14.280 --> 2:39:15.400
 That's it.

2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:19.920
 And I've also seen, because I have family in both places,

2:39:19.920 --> 2:39:24.200
 homes that were home for,

2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:28.360
 buildings that were homes for generations now in rubble.

2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:30.440
 So.

2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:33.080
 Yes, Lex, it just, it hurts.

2:39:33.080 --> 2:39:36.200
 And it's, let's, it's Syria,

2:39:36.200 --> 2:39:41.160
 where 350,000 at least by UN estimates died

2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:43.880
 and Russia participated in that.

2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:45.800
 And it's Yemen.

2:39:45.800 --> 2:39:47.840
 And it's so many other places

2:39:47.840 --> 2:39:50.560
 that don't have the same degree of attention

2:39:50.560 --> 2:39:53.200
 that a European country like Ukraine has.

2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:57.880
 But yeah, we have to remember also

2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:00.480
 that in addition to Ukraine,

2:40:00.480 --> 2:40:04.560
 and then there's things right home here in New York City

2:40:04.560 --> 2:40:07.160
 where children are without food.

2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:10.960
 Which is just inexcusable in a country this rich.

2:40:10.960 --> 2:40:13.520
 So we shouldn't forget in our study of leaders

2:40:13.520 --> 2:40:15.000
 and our study of geopolitics

2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:16.720
 that ultimately it's about the humanity.

2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:18.160
 It's about the human beings and.

2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:19.680
 That's it.

2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:20.680
 Okay, Lex.

2:40:20.680 --> 2:40:21.640
 Human suffering.

2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:22.480
 Thank you so much, Stephen.

2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:23.320
 Thank you.

2:40:23.320 --> 2:40:24.720
 This is an amazing conversation.

2:40:24.720 --> 2:40:25.880
 Talk to you again soon.

2:40:25.880 --> 2:40:26.720
 My pleasure.

2:40:27.680 --> 2:40:29.240
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:40:29.240 --> 2:40:31.040
 with Stephen Kotkin.

2:40:31.040 --> 2:40:32.400
 To support this podcast,

2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:35.440
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:38.360
 And now let me leave you with some words

2:40:38.360 --> 2:40:39.720
 from Mahatma Gandhi.

2:40:40.680 --> 2:40:44.800
 When I despair, I remember that all through history,

2:40:44.800 --> 2:40:47.200
 the way of truth and love have always won.

2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:50.800
 There have been tyrants and murderers

2:40:50.800 --> 2:40:54.040
 and for a time they can seem invincible,

2:40:54.040 --> 2:40:56.600
 but in the end, they always fall.

2:40:56.600 --> 2:41:01.600
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
