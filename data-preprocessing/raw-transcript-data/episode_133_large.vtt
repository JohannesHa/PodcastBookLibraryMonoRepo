00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
 The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis, his third time on the podcast.

00:05.640 --> 00:11.380
 He is a professor at MIT and head of the MIT Computational Biology Group.

00:11.380 --> 00:17.160
 This time we went deep on the science, biology, and genetics.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.920
 So this is a bit of an experiment.

00:19.920 --> 00:25.120
 Manolis went back and forth between the basics of biology to the latest state of the art

00:25.120 --> 00:26.120
 in the research.

00:26.120 --> 00:31.240
 He's a master at this, so I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.

00:31.240 --> 00:37.400
 This conversation happened at 7am, so it's yet another podcast episode after an all nighter

00:37.400 --> 00:38.400
 for me.

00:38.400 --> 00:44.040
 And once again, since the universe has a sense of humor, this one was a tough one for my

00:44.040 --> 00:50.480
 brain to keep up, but I did my best and I never shy away from a good challenge.

00:50.480 --> 00:55.960
 Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

00:55.960 --> 01:02.160
 First is SEMrush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool I've ever come across.

01:02.160 --> 01:08.920
 I don't like looking at numbers, but someone probably should, it helps you make good decisions.

01:08.920 --> 01:13.920
 Second is Pessimist Archive, they're back, one of my favorite history podcasts on why

01:13.920 --> 01:20.840
 people resist new things from recorded music to umbrellas to cars, chess, coffee, and the

01:20.840 --> 01:22.460
 elevator.

01:22.460 --> 01:28.320
 Third is 8sleep, a mattress that cools itself, measures heart rate variability, has an app,

01:28.320 --> 01:33.160
 and has given me yet another reason to look forward to sleep, including the all important

01:33.160 --> 01:34.840
 power nap.

01:34.840 --> 01:40.080
 And finally, BetterHelp, online therapy when you want to face your demons with a licensed

01:40.080 --> 01:45.440
 professional, not just by doing the David Goggins like physical challenges like I seem

01:45.440 --> 01:47.960
 to do on occasion.

01:54.200 --> 01:59.280
 As a side note, let me say that biology in the brain and in the various systems of the

01:59.280 --> 02:05.800
 body fill me with awe every time I think about how such a chaotic mess coming from its humble

02:05.800 --> 02:11.940
 origins in the ocean was able to achieve such incredibly complex and robust mechanisms of

02:11.940 --> 02:17.920
 life that survived despite all the forces of nature that want to destroy it.

02:17.920 --> 02:22.920
 It is so unlike the computing systems we humans have engineered that it makes me feel that

02:22.920 --> 02:28.420
 in order to create artificial general intelligence and artificial consciousness, we may have

02:28.420 --> 02:33.560
 to completely rethink how we engineer computational systems.

02:44.880 --> 02:49.760
 And now, here's my conversation with Manolis Callas.

02:49.760 --> 02:54.880
 So your group at MIT is trying to understand the molecular basis of human disease.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.720
 What are some of the biggest challenges in your view?

02:57.720 --> 02:58.720
 Don't get me started.

02:58.720 --> 03:06.240
 I mean, understanding human disease is the most complex challenge in modern science.

03:06.240 --> 03:13.340
 So because human disease is as complex as the human genome, it is as complex as the

03:13.340 --> 03:20.680
 human brain, and it is in many ways, even more complex because the more we understand

03:20.680 --> 03:27.000
 disease complexity, the more we start understanding genome complexity and epigenome complexity

03:27.000 --> 03:31.200
 and brain circuitry complexity and immune system complexity and cancer complexity and

03:31.200 --> 03:32.280
 so on and so forth.

03:32.280 --> 03:39.400
 So traditionally, human disease was following basic biology.

03:39.400 --> 03:44.360
 You would basically understand basic biology in model organisms like, you know, mouse and

03:44.360 --> 03:46.040
 fly and yeast.

03:46.040 --> 03:53.400
 You would understand sort of mammalian biology and animal biology and eukaryotic biology

03:53.400 --> 03:59.920
 in sort of progressive layers of complexity, getting closer to human phylogenetically.

03:59.920 --> 04:06.640
 And you would do perturbation experiments in those species to see if I knock out a gene,

04:06.640 --> 04:07.960
 what happens?

04:07.960 --> 04:12.720
 And based on the knocking out of these genes, you would basically then have a way to drive

04:12.720 --> 04:16.880
 human biology because you would sort of understand the functions of these genes.

04:16.880 --> 04:23.660
 And then if you find that a human gene locus, something that you've mapped from human genetics

04:23.660 --> 04:28.760
 to that gene is related to a particular human disease, you'd say, aha, now I know the function

04:28.760 --> 04:31.440
 of the gene from the model organisms.

04:31.440 --> 04:37.120
 I can now go and understand the function of that gene in human.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.320
 But this is all changing.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.440
 This is dramatically changed.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.760
 So that was the old way of doing basic biology.

04:41.760 --> 04:46.280
 You would start with the animal models, the eukaryotic models, the mammalian models, and

04:46.280 --> 04:48.680
 then you would go to human.

04:48.680 --> 04:55.320
 Human genetics has been so transformed in the last decade or two that human genetics

04:55.320 --> 04:58.420
 is now actually driving the basic biology.

04:58.420 --> 05:04.300
 There is more genetic mutation information in the human genome than there will ever be

05:04.300 --> 05:06.240
 in any other species.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.440
 What do you mean by mutation information?

05:08.440 --> 05:11.380
 So perturbations is how you understand systems.

05:11.380 --> 05:16.120
 So an engineer builds systems and then they know how they work from the inside out.

05:16.120 --> 05:20.360
 A scientist studies systems through perturbations.

05:20.360 --> 05:23.040
 You basically say, if I poke that balloon, what's going to happen?

05:23.040 --> 05:26.480
 And I'm going to film it in super high resolution, understand, I don't know, aerodynamics or

05:26.480 --> 05:28.840
 fluid dynamics if it's filled with water, et cetera.

05:28.840 --> 05:33.960
 So you can then make experimentation by perturbation and then the scientific process is sort of

05:33.960 --> 05:41.120
 building models that best fit the data, designing new experiments that best test your models

05:41.120 --> 05:43.320
 and challenge your models and so on and so forth.

05:43.320 --> 05:44.800
 This is the same thing with science.

05:44.800 --> 05:49.440
 Basically if you're trying to understand biological science, you basically want to do perturbations

05:49.440 --> 05:54.600
 that then drive the models.

05:54.600 --> 05:58.320
 So how do these perturbations allow you to understand disease?

05:58.320 --> 06:04.120
 So if you know that a gene is related to disease, you don't want to just know that it's related

06:04.120 --> 06:05.120
 to the disease.

06:05.120 --> 06:09.960
 You want to know what is the disease mechanism because you want to go and intervene.

06:09.960 --> 06:17.240
 So the way that I like to describe it is that traditionally epidemiology, which is basically

06:17.240 --> 06:23.000
 the study of disease, you know, sort of the observational study of disease has been about

06:23.000 --> 06:25.760
 correlating one thing with another thing.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.880
 So if you have a lot of people with liver disease who are also alcoholics, you might

06:29.880 --> 06:34.360
 say, well, maybe the alcoholism is driving the liver disease or maybe those who have

06:34.360 --> 06:36.780
 liver disease self medicate with alcohol.

06:36.780 --> 06:40.120
 So the connection could be either way.

06:40.120 --> 06:47.640
 With genetic epidemiology, it's about correlating changes in genome with phenotypic differences

06:47.640 --> 06:50.120
 and then you know the direction of causality.

06:50.120 --> 06:58.120
 So if you know that a particular gene is related to the disease, you can basically say, okay,

06:58.120 --> 07:03.860
 perturbing that gene in mouse causes the mice to have X phenotype.

07:03.860 --> 07:08.240
 So perturbing that gene in human causes the humans to have the disease.

07:08.240 --> 07:14.680
 So I can now figure out what are the detailed molecular phenotypes in the human that are

07:14.680 --> 07:18.820
 related to that organismal phenotype in the disease.

07:18.820 --> 07:22.960
 So it's all about understanding disease mechanism, understanding what are the pathways, what

07:22.960 --> 07:27.560
 are the tissues, what are the processes that are associated with the disease so that we

07:27.560 --> 07:29.000
 know how to intervene.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.360
 You can then prescribe particular medications that also alter these processes.

07:33.360 --> 07:37.920
 You can prescribe lifestyle changes that also affect these processes and so on and so forth.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.040
 That's such a beautiful puzzle to try to solve.

07:41.040 --> 07:45.480
 Like what kind of perturbations eventually have this ripple effect that leads to disease

07:45.480 --> 07:46.480
 across the population.

07:46.480 --> 07:51.880
 And then you study that for animals or mice first and then see how that might possibly

07:51.880 --> 07:54.680
 connect to humans.

07:54.680 --> 08:01.340
 How hard is that puzzle of trying to figure out how little perturbations might lead to,

08:01.340 --> 08:04.200
 in a stable way, to a disease?

08:04.200 --> 08:11.040
 In animals, we make the puzzle simpler because we perturb one gene at a time.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.500
 That's the beauty of this, the power of animal models.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.800
 You can basically decouple the perturbations.

08:15.800 --> 08:21.240
 You only do one perturbation and you only do strong perturbations at a time.

08:21.240 --> 08:28.600
 In human, the puzzle is incredibly complex because obviously you don't do human experimentation.

08:28.600 --> 08:34.720
 You wait for natural selection and natural genetic variation to basically do its own

08:34.720 --> 08:40.560
 experiments, which it has been doing for hundreds and thousands of years in the human population

08:40.560 --> 08:49.320
 and for hundreds of thousands of years across the history leading to the human population.

08:49.320 --> 08:54.440
 So you basically take this natural genetic variation that we all carry within us.

08:54.440 --> 08:58.280
 Every one of us carries 6 million perturbations.

08:58.280 --> 09:02.920
 So I've done 6 million experiments on you, 6 million experiments on me, 6 million experiments

09:02.920 --> 09:06.400
 on every one of 7 billion people on the planet.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.600
 What's the 6 million correspond to?

09:08.600 --> 09:14.840
 6 million unique genetic variants that are segregating in the human population.

09:14.840 --> 09:22.880
 Every one of us carries millions of polymorphic sites, poly, many, morph, forms.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.080
 Polymorphic means many forms, variants.

09:25.080 --> 09:29.560
 That basically means that every one of us has single nucleotide alterations that we

09:29.560 --> 09:34.680
 have inherited from mom and from dad that basically can be thought of as tiny little

09:34.680 --> 09:36.320
 perturbations.

09:36.320 --> 09:42.480
 Most of them don't do anything, but some of them lead to all of the phenotypic differences

09:42.480 --> 09:43.920
 that we see between us.

09:43.920 --> 09:48.960
 The reason why two twins are identical is because these variants completely determine

09:48.960 --> 09:52.520
 the way that I'm going to look at exactly 93 years of age.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.720
 How happy are you with this kind of data set?

09:54.720 --> 09:59.240
 Is it large enough of the human population of Earth?

09:59.240 --> 10:01.680
 Is that too big, too small?

10:01.680 --> 10:07.360
 Yeah, so is it large enough is a power analysis question.

10:07.360 --> 10:11.440
 In every one of our grants, we do a power analysis based on what is the effect size

10:11.440 --> 10:19.200
 that I would like to detect and what is the natural variation in the two forms.

10:19.200 --> 10:25.240
 Every time you do a perturbation, you're asking, I'm changing form A into form B. Form A has

10:25.240 --> 10:30.160
 some natural phenotypic variation around it and form B has some natural phenotypic variation

10:30.160 --> 10:31.240
 around it.

10:31.240 --> 10:36.200
 If those variances are large and the differences between the mean of A and the mean of B are

10:36.200 --> 10:38.920
 small, then you have very little power.

10:38.920 --> 10:44.600
 The further the means go apart, that's the effect size, the more power you have, and

10:44.600 --> 10:48.760
 the smaller the standard deviation, the more power you have.

10:48.760 --> 10:54.440
 So basically when you're asking, is that sufficiently large, certainly not for everything, but we

10:54.440 --> 11:01.240
 already have enough power for many of the stronger effects in the more tight distributions.

11:01.240 --> 11:09.840
 So that's the hopeful message that there exists parts of the genome that have a strong effect

11:09.840 --> 11:13.200
 that has a small variance.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.200
 That's exactly right.

11:14.200 --> 11:18.400
 Unfortunately, those perturbations are the basis of disease in many cases.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.800
 So it's not a hopeful message.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.720
 Sometimes it's a terrible message.

11:22.720 --> 11:27.880
 It's basically, well, some people are sick, but if we can figure out what are these contributors

11:27.880 --> 11:32.760
 to sickness, we can then help make them better and help many other people better who don't

11:32.760 --> 11:38.960
 carry that exact mutation, but who carry mutations on the same pathways.

11:38.960 --> 11:42.800
 And that's what we like to call the allelic series of a gene.

11:42.800 --> 11:49.580
 You basically have many perturbations of the same gene in different people, each with a

11:49.580 --> 11:55.200
 different frequency in the human population and each with a different effect on the individual

11:55.200 --> 11:56.200
 that carries them.

11:56.200 --> 12:03.000
 So you said in the past there would be these small experiments on perturbations and animal

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
 models.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.400
 What does this puzzle solving process look like today?

12:08.400 --> 12:13.180
 So we basically have something like 7 billion people in the planet and every one of them

12:13.180 --> 12:16.760
 carries something like 6 million mutations.

12:16.760 --> 12:25.000
 You basically have an enormous matrix of genotype by phenotype by systematically measuring the

12:25.000 --> 12:27.960
 phenotype of these individuals.

12:27.960 --> 12:32.640
 And the traditional way of measuring this phenotype has been to look at one trait at

12:32.640 --> 12:33.700
 a time.

12:33.700 --> 12:40.160
 You would gather families and you would sort of paint the pedigrees of a strong effect,

12:40.160 --> 12:47.320
 what we like to call Mendelian mutation, so a mutation that gets transmitted in a dominant

12:47.320 --> 12:53.240
 or a recessive, but strong effect form where basically one locus plays a very big role

12:53.240 --> 12:54.240
 in that disease.

12:54.240 --> 12:59.560
 And you could then look at carriers versus non carriers in one family, carriers versus

12:59.560 --> 13:04.480
 non carriers in another family and do that for hundreds, sometimes thousands of families

13:04.480 --> 13:08.360
 and then trace these inheritance patterns and then figure out what is the gene that

13:08.360 --> 13:09.500
 plays that role.

13:09.500 --> 13:14.420
 Is this the matrix that you're showing in talks or lectures?

13:14.420 --> 13:21.000
 So that matrix is the input to those stuff that I show in talks.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.980
 So basically that matrix has traditionally been strong effect genes.

13:24.980 --> 13:29.880
 What the matrix looks like now is instead of pedigrees, instead of families, you basically

13:29.880 --> 13:36.720
 have thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands of unrelated individuals, each with all of

13:36.720 --> 13:43.520
 their genetic variants and each with their phenotype, for example, height or lipids or,

13:43.520 --> 13:48.080
 you know, whether they're sick or not for a particular trait.

13:48.080 --> 13:53.080
 That has been the modern view instead of going to families, going to unrelated individuals

13:53.080 --> 13:55.760
 with one phenotype at a time.

13:55.760 --> 14:00.960
 And what we're doing now as we're maturing in all of these sciences is that we're doing

14:00.960 --> 14:07.960
 this in the context of large medical systems or enormous cohorts that are very well phenotyped

14:07.960 --> 14:13.720
 across hundreds of phenotypes, sometimes with our complete electronic health record.

14:13.720 --> 14:19.640
 So you can now start relating not just one gene segregating one family, not just thousands

14:19.640 --> 14:25.080
 of variants segregating with one phenotype, but now you can do millions of variants versus

14:25.080 --> 14:27.120
 hundreds of phenotypes.

14:27.120 --> 14:33.880
 And as a computer scientist, I mean, deconvolving that matrix, partitioning it into the layers

14:33.880 --> 14:40.160
 of biology that are associated with every one of these elements is a dream come true.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.840
 It's like the world's greatest puzzle.

14:42.840 --> 14:50.120
 And you can now solve that puzzle by throwing in more and more knowledge about the function

14:50.120 --> 14:56.520
 of different genomic regions and how these functions are changed across tissues and in

14:56.520 --> 14:58.100
 the context of disease.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.720
 And that's what my group and many other groups are doing.

15:00.720 --> 15:05.760
 We're trying to systematically relate this genetic variation with molecular variation

15:05.760 --> 15:12.700
 at the expression level of the genes, at the epigenomic level of the gene regulatory circuitry,

15:12.700 --> 15:17.020
 and at the cellular level of what are the functions that are happening in those cells,

15:17.020 --> 15:22.340
 at the single cell level using single cell profiling, and then relate all that vast amount

15:22.340 --> 15:29.160
 of knowledge computationally with the thousands of traits that each of these of thousands

15:29.160 --> 15:30.800
 of variants are perturbing.

15:30.800 --> 15:34.280
 I mean, this is something we talked about, I think last time.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.480
 So there's these effects at different levels that happen.

15:36.480 --> 15:42.800
 You said at a single cell level, you're trying to see things that happen due to certain perturbations.

15:42.800 --> 15:49.560
 And then it's not just like a puzzle of perturbation and disease.

15:49.560 --> 15:57.660
 It's perturbation then effect at a cellular level, then at an organ level, a body, like,

15:57.660 --> 16:02.760
 how do you disassemble this into like what your group is working on?

16:02.760 --> 16:06.560
 You're basically taking a bunch of the hard problems in the space.

16:06.560 --> 16:13.520
 How do you break apart a difficult disease and break it apart into problems that you,

16:13.520 --> 16:15.520
 into puzzles that you can now start solving?

16:15.520 --> 16:17.380
 So there's a struggle here.

16:17.380 --> 16:22.120
 Super scientists love hard puzzles and they're like, oh, I want to build a method that just

16:22.120 --> 16:24.920
 deconvolves the whole thing computationally.

16:24.920 --> 16:31.640
 And that's very tempting and it's very appealing, but biologists just like to decouple that

16:31.640 --> 16:36.080
 complexity experimentally, to just like peel off layers of complexity experimentally.

16:36.080 --> 16:40.380
 And that's what many of these modern tools that my group and others have both developed

16:40.380 --> 16:41.600
 and used.

16:41.600 --> 16:46.760
 The fact that we can now figure out tricks for peeling off these layers of complexity

16:46.760 --> 16:53.080
 by testing one cell type at a time or by testing one cell at a time.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.380
 And you could basically say, what is the effect of these genetic variants associated with

16:56.380 --> 16:59.360
 Alzheimer's on human brain?

16:59.360 --> 17:04.320
 Human brain sounds like, oh, it's an organ, of course, just go one organ at a time.

17:04.320 --> 17:09.500
 But human brain has of course, dozens of different brain regions and within each of these brain

17:09.500 --> 17:15.080
 regions, dozens of different cell types and every single type of neuron, every single

17:15.080 --> 17:24.160
 type of glial cell between astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, between all of the neural cells

17:24.160 --> 17:29.880
 and the vascular cells and the immune cells that are co inhabiting the brain between the

17:29.880 --> 17:34.440
 different types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are sort of interacting with

17:34.440 --> 17:39.300
 each other between different layers of neurons in the cortical layers.

17:39.300 --> 17:47.920
 Every single one of these has a different type of function to play in cognition, in

17:47.920 --> 17:55.280
 interaction with the environment, in maintenance of the brain, in energetic needs, in feeding

17:55.280 --> 18:01.680
 the brain with blood, with oxygen, in clearing out the debris that are resulting from the

18:01.680 --> 18:06.940
 super high energy production of cognition in humans.

18:06.940 --> 18:17.040
 So all of these things are basically potentially deconvolvable computationally, but experimentally,

18:17.040 --> 18:21.640
 you can just do single cell profiling of dozens of regions of the brain across hundreds of

18:21.640 --> 18:24.640
 individuals across millions of cells.

18:24.640 --> 18:31.440
 And then now you have pieces of the puzzle that you can then put back together to understand

18:31.440 --> 18:32.440
 that complexity.

18:32.440 --> 18:39.400
 I mean, first of all, the cells in the human brain are the most, maybe I'm romanticizing

18:39.400 --> 18:42.520
 it, but cognition seems to be very complicated.

18:42.520 --> 18:53.520
 So separating into the function, breaking Alzheimer's down to the cellular level seems

18:53.520 --> 18:56.340
 very challenging.

18:56.340 --> 19:05.200
 Is that basically you're trying to find a way that some perturbation in the genome results

19:05.200 --> 19:11.920
 in some obvious major dysfunction in the cell.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.400
 You're trying to find something like that.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.400
 Exactly.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.120
 So what does human genetics do?

19:17.120 --> 19:21.640
 Human genetics basically looks at the whole path from genetic variation all the way to

19:21.640 --> 19:22.640
 disease.

19:22.640 --> 19:31.640
 So human genetics has basically taken thousands of Alzheimer's cases and thousands of controls

19:31.640 --> 19:38.440
 matched for age, for sex, for environmental backgrounds and so on and so forth.

19:38.440 --> 19:44.500
 And then looked at that map where you're asking, what are the individual genetic perturbations

19:44.500 --> 19:48.520
 and how are they related to all the way to Alzheimer's disease?

19:48.520 --> 19:51.280
 And that has actually been quite successful.

19:51.280 --> 19:57.680
 So we now have more than 27 different loci, these are genomic regions that are associated

19:57.680 --> 20:02.420
 with Alzheimer's at these end to end level.

20:02.420 --> 20:07.400
 But the moment you sort of break up that very long path into smaller levels, you can basically

20:07.400 --> 20:13.480
 say from genetics, what are the epigenomic alterations at the level of gene regulatory

20:13.480 --> 20:19.160
 elements where that genetic variant perturbs the control region nearby.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.840
 That effect is much larger.

20:21.840 --> 20:25.480
 You mean much larger in terms of this down the line impact or?

20:25.480 --> 20:31.120
 It's much larger in terms of the measurable effect, this A versus B variance is actually

20:31.120 --> 20:35.800
 so much cleanly defined when you go to the shorter branches.

20:35.800 --> 20:40.760
 Because for one genetic variant to affect Alzheimer's, that's a very long path.

20:40.760 --> 20:43.940
 That basically means that in the context of millions of these 6 million variants that

20:43.940 --> 20:51.040
 every one of us carries, that one single nucleotide has a detectable effect all the way to the

20:51.040 --> 20:52.040
 end.

20:52.040 --> 20:57.700
 I mean, it's just mind boggling that that's even possible, but indeed there are such effects.

20:57.700 --> 21:03.000
 So the hope is, or the most scientifically speaking, the most effective place where to

21:03.000 --> 21:10.640
 detect the alteration that results in disease is earlier on in the pipeline, as early as

21:10.640 --> 21:11.640
 possible.

21:11.640 --> 21:12.680
 It's a trade off.

21:12.680 --> 21:17.800
 If you go very early on in the pipeline, now each of these epigenomic alterations, for

21:17.800 --> 21:25.500
 example, this enhancer control region is active maybe 50% less, which is a dramatic effect.

21:25.500 --> 21:29.680
 Now you can ask, well, how much does changing one regulatory region in the genome in one

21:29.680 --> 21:31.280
 cell type change disease?

21:31.280 --> 21:33.920
 Well, that path is now long.

21:33.920 --> 21:39.680
 So if you instead look at expression, the path between genetic variation and the expression

21:39.680 --> 21:44.560
 of one gene goes through many enhancer regions, and therefore it's a subtler effect at the

21:44.560 --> 21:45.560
 gene level.

21:45.560 --> 21:51.360
 But then now you're closer because one gene is acting in the context of only 20,000 other

21:51.360 --> 21:57.200
 genes as opposed to one enhancer acting in the context of 2 million other enhancers.

21:57.200 --> 22:04.040
 So you basically now have genetic, epigenomic, the circuitry, transcriptomic, the gene expression

22:04.040 --> 22:09.600
 control, and then cellular, where you can basically say, I can measure various properties

22:09.600 --> 22:11.160
 of those cells.

22:11.160 --> 22:17.560
 What is the calcium influx rate when I have this genetic variation?

22:17.560 --> 22:19.760
 What is the synaptic density?

22:19.760 --> 22:24.500
 What is the electric impulse conductivity and so on and so forth?

22:24.500 --> 22:32.660
 So you can measure things along this path to disease, and you can also measure endophenotypes.

22:32.660 --> 22:37.460
 You can basically measure your brain activity.

22:37.460 --> 22:39.680
 You can do imaging in the brain.

22:39.680 --> 22:44.440
 You can basically measure, I don't know, the heart rate, the pulse, the lipids, the amount

22:44.440 --> 22:46.700
 of blood secreted and so on and so forth.

22:46.700 --> 22:52.760
 And then through all of that, you can basically get at the path to causality, the path to

22:52.760 --> 22:55.320
 disease.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.680
 And is there something beyond cellular?

22:57.680 --> 23:05.480
 So you mentioned lifestyle interventions or changes as a way to, or like be able to prescribe

23:05.480 --> 23:07.840
 changes in lifestyle.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.360
 Like what about organs?

23:09.360 --> 23:13.200
 What about like the function of the body as a whole?

23:13.200 --> 23:14.200
 Yeah, absolutely.

23:14.200 --> 23:18.200
 So basically when you go to your doctor, they always measure, you know, your pulse.

23:18.200 --> 23:19.200
 They always measure your height.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.240
 They always measure your weight, you know, your BMI.

23:21.240 --> 23:24.180
 So basically these are just very basic variables.

23:24.180 --> 23:27.960
 But with digital devices nowadays, you can start measuring hundreds of variables for

23:27.960 --> 23:29.600
 every individual.

23:29.600 --> 23:37.300
 You can basically also phenotype cognitively through tests, Alzheimer's patients.

23:37.300 --> 23:43.720
 There are cognitive tests that you can measure, that you typically do for cognitive decline,

23:43.720 --> 23:48.500
 these mini mental observations that you have specific questions to.

23:48.500 --> 23:51.980
 You can think of sort of enlarging the set of cognitive tests.

23:51.980 --> 23:55.760
 So in the mouse, for example, you do experiments for how do they get out of mazes?

23:55.760 --> 23:57.280
 How do they find food?

23:57.280 --> 24:02.440
 Whether they recall a fear, whether they shake in a new environment and so on and so forth.

24:02.440 --> 24:06.560
 In the human, you can have much, much richer phenotypes where you can basically say not

24:06.560 --> 24:13.920
 just imaging at the organ level and all kinds of other activities at the organ level, but

24:13.920 --> 24:19.480
 you can also do at the organism level, you can do behavioral tests.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.120
 And how did they do on empathy?

24:21.120 --> 24:22.920
 How did they do on memory?

24:22.920 --> 24:26.160
 How did they do on longterm memory versus short term memory?

24:26.160 --> 24:27.160
 And so on and so forth.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.760
 I love how you're calling that phenotype.

24:28.760 --> 24:29.760
 I guess it is.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.040
 It is.

24:31.040 --> 24:37.880
 But like your behavior patterns that might change over a period of a life, your ability

24:37.880 --> 24:44.560
 to remember things, your ability to be empathetic or emotionally, your intelligence perhaps

24:44.560 --> 24:45.560
 even.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.160
 Yeah, but intelligence has hundreds of variables.

24:47.160 --> 24:50.720
 You can be your math intelligence, your literary intelligence, your puzzle solving intelligence,

24:50.720 --> 24:51.720
 your logic.

24:51.720 --> 24:52.880
 It could be like hundreds of things.

24:52.880 --> 24:57.440
 And all of that, we're able to measure that better and better and all that could be connected

24:57.440 --> 24:58.920
 to the entire pipeline somehow.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.840
 We used to think of each of these as a single variable like intelligence.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.380
 I mean, that's ridiculous.

25:03.380 --> 25:10.880
 It's basically dozens of different genes that are controlling every single variable.

25:10.880 --> 25:16.040
 You can basically think of, imagine us in a video game where every one of us has measures

25:16.040 --> 25:20.960
 of strength, stamina, energy left and so on and so forth.

25:20.960 --> 25:24.440
 But you could click on each of those five bars that are just the main bars and each

25:24.440 --> 25:28.560
 of those will just give you then hundreds of bars and can basically say, okay, great

25:28.560 --> 25:36.200
 for my machine learning task, I want someone who, a human who has these particular forms

25:36.200 --> 25:37.200
 of intelligence.

25:37.200 --> 25:40.620
 I require now these 20 different things.

25:40.620 --> 25:45.000
 And then you can combine those things and then relate them to of course performance

25:45.000 --> 25:50.820
 in a particular task, but you can also relate them to genetic variation that might be affecting

25:50.820 --> 25:52.800
 different parts of the brain.

25:52.800 --> 25:56.600
 For example, your frontal cortex versus your temporal cortex versus your visual cortex

25:56.600 --> 25:58.040
 and so on and so forth.

25:58.040 --> 26:02.520
 So genetic variation that affects expression of genes in different parts of your brain

26:02.520 --> 26:08.920
 can basically affect your music ability, your auditory ability, your smell, just dozens

26:08.920 --> 26:15.980
 of different phenotypes can be broken down into hundreds of cognitive variables and then

26:15.980 --> 26:20.520
 relate each of those to thousands of genes that are associated with them.

26:20.520 --> 26:28.440
 So somebody who loves RPGs or playing games, there's too few variables that we can control.

26:28.440 --> 26:32.680
 So I'm excited if we're in fact living in a simulation and this is a video game, I'm

26:32.680 --> 26:37.240
 excited by the quality of the video game.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.760
 The game designer did a hell of a good job.

26:39.760 --> 26:40.760
 So we're impressed.

26:40.760 --> 26:41.760
 Oh, I don't know.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.800
 The sunset last night was a little unrealistic.

26:43.800 --> 26:44.800
 Yeah.

26:44.800 --> 26:45.800
 Yeah.

26:45.800 --> 26:46.800
 The graphics.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.800
 Exactly.

26:47.800 --> 26:48.800
 Come on, NVIDIA.

26:48.800 --> 26:54.480
 To zoom back out, we've been talking about the genetic origins of diseases, but I think

26:54.480 --> 27:01.080
 it's fascinating to talk about what are the most important diseases to understand and

27:01.080 --> 27:05.320
 especially as it connects to the things that you're working on.

27:05.320 --> 27:08.840
 So it's very difficult to think about important diseases to understand.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.500
 There's many metrics of importance.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.360
 One is lifestyle impact.

27:12.360 --> 27:16.440
 I mean, if you look at COVID, the impact on lifestyle has been enormous.

27:16.440 --> 27:23.080
 So understanding COVID is important because it has impacted the wellbeing in terms of

27:23.080 --> 27:27.280
 ability to have a job, ability to have an apartment, ability to go to work, ability

27:27.280 --> 27:34.480
 to have a mental circle of support and all of that for millions of Americans, like huge,

27:34.480 --> 27:35.520
 huge impact.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.000
 So that's one aspect of importance.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.480
 So basically mental disorders, Alzheimer's has a huge importance in the wellbeing of

27:42.480 --> 27:44.040
 Americans.

27:44.040 --> 27:48.220
 Whether or not it kills someone for many, many years, it has a huge impact.

27:48.220 --> 27:52.360
 So the first measure of importance is just wellbeing.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.780
 Impact on the quality of life.

27:53.780 --> 27:55.860
 Impact on the quality of life, absolutely.

27:55.860 --> 28:00.160
 The second metric, which is much easier to quantify is deaths.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.920
 What is the number one killer?

28:01.920 --> 28:04.760
 The number one killer is actually heart disease.

28:04.760 --> 28:10.700
 It is actually killing 650,000 Americans per year.

28:10.700 --> 28:14.280
 Number two is cancer with 600,000 Americans.

28:14.280 --> 28:19.600
 Number three, far, far down the list is accidents, every single accident combined.

28:19.600 --> 28:24.720
 So basically you read the news, accidents, like there was a huge car crash all over the

28:24.720 --> 28:25.800
 news.

28:25.800 --> 28:31.320
 But the number of deaths, number three by far, 167,000.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.800
 Core respiratory disease.

28:32.800 --> 28:39.160
 So that's asthma, not being able to breathe and so on and so forth, 160,000 Alzheimer's

28:39.160 --> 28:45.040
 number five with 120,000 and then stroke, brain aneurysms and so on and so forth, that's

28:45.040 --> 28:49.720
 147,000 diabetes and metabolic disorders, et cetera.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.140
 That's 85,000.

28:51.140 --> 28:58.960
 The flu is 60,000, suicide, 50,000 and then overdose, et cetera, you know, goes further

28:58.960 --> 29:00.120
 down the list.

29:00.120 --> 29:06.620
 So of course COVID has creeped up to be the number three killer this year with, you know,

29:06.620 --> 29:11.360
 more than 100,000 Americans and counting.

29:11.360 --> 29:16.560
 And you know, but if you think about sort of what do we use, what are the most important

29:16.560 --> 29:22.720
 diseases, you have to understand both the quality of life and the sheer number of deaths

29:22.720 --> 29:25.560
 and just numbers of years lost if you wish.

29:25.560 --> 29:30.960
 And each of these diseases you can think of as, and also including terrorist attacks and

29:30.960 --> 29:39.200
 school shootings, for example, things which lead to fatalities, you can look at as problems

29:39.200 --> 29:41.480
 that could be solved.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.080
 And some problems are harder to solve than others.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.860
 I mean, that's part of the equation.

29:46.860 --> 29:52.960
 So maybe if you look at these diseases, if you look at heart disease or cancer or Alzheimer's

29:52.960 --> 29:59.800
 or just like schizophrenia and obesity, Debbie, like not necessarily things that kill you,

29:59.800 --> 30:05.480
 but affect the quality of life, which problems are solvable, which aren't, which are harder

30:05.480 --> 30:07.280
 to solve, which aren't.

30:07.280 --> 30:13.720
 I love your question because he puts it in the context of a global effort rather than

30:13.720 --> 30:15.120
 just the local effort.

30:15.120 --> 30:22.560
 So basically if you look at the global aspect, exercise and nutrition are two interventions

30:22.560 --> 30:27.040
 that we can as a society make a much better job at.

30:27.040 --> 30:33.080
 So if you think about sort of the availability of cheap food, it's extremely high in calories.

30:33.080 --> 30:36.960
 It's extremely detrimental for you, like a lot of processed food, et cetera.

30:36.960 --> 30:43.120
 So if we change that equation and as a society, we made availability of healthy food much,

30:43.120 --> 30:52.520
 much easier and charged a burger at McDonald's, the price that it costs on the health system,

30:52.520 --> 30:56.360
 then people would actually start buying more healthy foods.

30:56.360 --> 30:59.600
 So basically that's sort of a societal intervention, if you wish.

30:59.600 --> 31:06.580
 In the same way, increasing empathy, increasing education, increasing the social framework

31:06.580 --> 31:10.040
 and support would basically lead to fewer suicides.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.880
 It would lead to fewer murders.

31:11.880 --> 31:15.880
 It would lead to fewer deaths overall.

31:15.880 --> 31:19.100
 So that's something that we as a society can do.

31:19.100 --> 31:21.940
 You can also think about external factors versus internal factors.

31:21.940 --> 31:27.440
 So the external factors are basically communicable diseases like COVID, like the flu, et cetera.

31:27.440 --> 31:33.200
 And the internal factors are basically things like cancer and Alzheimer's where basically

31:33.200 --> 31:38.560
 your genetics will eventually drive you there.

31:38.560 --> 31:43.520
 And then of course, with all of these factors, every single disease has both the genetic

31:43.520 --> 31:46.200
 component and environmental component.

31:46.200 --> 31:55.700
 So heart disease, huge genetic contribution, Alzheimer's, it's like 60% plus genetic.

31:55.700 --> 31:59.040
 So I think it's like 79% heritability.

31:59.040 --> 32:06.400
 So that basically means that genetics alone explains 79% of Alzheimer's incidents.

32:06.400 --> 32:14.040
 And yes, there's a 21% environmental component where you could basically enrich your cognitive

32:14.040 --> 32:21.040
 environment, enrich your social interactions, read more books, learn a foreign language,

32:21.040 --> 32:24.800
 go running, you know, sort of have a more fulfilling life.

32:24.800 --> 32:29.320
 All of that will actually decrease Alzheimer's, but there's a limit to how much that can impact

32:29.320 --> 32:31.240
 because of the huge genetic footprint.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.240
 So this is fascinating.

32:32.240 --> 32:38.860
 So each one of these problems have a genetic component and an environment component.

32:38.860 --> 32:43.520
 And so like when there's a genetic component, what can we do about some of these diseases?

32:43.520 --> 32:48.520
 And have you worked on what can you say that's in terms of problems that are solvable here

32:48.520 --> 32:50.520
 or understandable?

32:50.520 --> 32:55.740
 So my group works on the genetic component, but I would argue that understanding the genetic

32:55.740 --> 32:59.700
 component can have a huge impact even on the environmental component.

32:59.700 --> 33:00.800
 Why is that?

33:00.800 --> 33:03.560
 Because genetics gives us access to mechanism.

33:03.560 --> 33:09.580
 And if we can alter the mechanism, if we can impact the mechanism, we can perhaps counteract

33:09.580 --> 33:12.080
 some of the environmental components.

33:12.080 --> 33:18.240
 So understanding the biological mechanisms leading to disease is extremely important

33:18.240 --> 33:20.820
 in being able to intervene.

33:20.820 --> 33:26.040
 But when you can intervene and what, you know, the analogy that I like to give is for example,

33:26.040 --> 33:29.880
 for obesity, you know, think of it as a giant bathtub of fat.

33:29.880 --> 33:35.800
 There's basically fat coming in from your diet and there's fat coming out from your

33:35.800 --> 33:36.800
 exercise.

33:36.800 --> 33:37.800
 Okay.

33:37.800 --> 33:42.240
 So that's an in out equation and that's the equation that everybody's focusing on.

33:42.240 --> 33:47.740
 But your metabolism impacts that, you know, bathtub.

33:47.740 --> 33:53.080
 Basically your metabolism controls the rate at which you're burning energy.

33:53.080 --> 33:56.640
 It controls the rate at which you're storing energy.

33:56.640 --> 34:02.800
 And it also teaches you about the various valves that control the input and the output

34:02.800 --> 34:04.020
 equation.

34:04.020 --> 34:11.320
 So if we can learn from the genetics, the valves, we can then manipulate those valves.

34:11.320 --> 34:16.060
 And even if the environment is feeding you a lot of fat and getting a little that out,

34:16.060 --> 34:19.840
 you can just poke another hole at the bathtub and just get a lot of the fat out.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.160
 Yeah, that's fascinating.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.160
 Yeah.

34:22.160 --> 34:25.840
 So we're not just passive observers of our genetics.

34:25.840 --> 34:29.640
 The more we understand, the more we can come up with actual treatments.

34:29.640 --> 34:35.680
 And I think that's an important aspect to realize when people are thinking about strong

34:35.680 --> 34:38.080
 effect versus weak effect variants.

34:38.080 --> 34:39.580
 So some variants have strong effects.

34:39.580 --> 34:43.400
 We talked about these Mendelian disorders where a single gene has a sufficiently large

34:43.400 --> 34:49.420
 effect, penetrance, expressivity, and so on and so forth, that basically you can trace

34:49.420 --> 34:55.320
 it in families with cases and not cases, cases, not cases, and so on and so forth.

34:55.320 --> 35:02.840
 But so these are the genes that everybody says, oh, that's the genes we should go after

35:02.840 --> 35:04.880
 because that's a strong effect gene.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.860
 I like to think about it slightly differently.

35:06.860 --> 35:15.440
 These are the genes where genetic impacts that have a strong effect were tolerated because

35:15.440 --> 35:20.200
 every single time we have a genetic association with disease, it depends on two things.

35:20.200 --> 35:24.680
 Number one, the obvious one, whether the gene has an impact on the disease.

35:24.680 --> 35:32.180
 Number two, the more subtle one is whether there is genetic variation standing and circulating

35:32.180 --> 35:37.680
 and segregating in the human population that impacts that gene.

35:37.680 --> 35:44.480
 Some genes are so darn important that if you mess with them, even a tiny little amount,

35:44.480 --> 35:46.440
 that person's dead.

35:46.440 --> 35:49.020
 So those genes don't have variation.

35:49.020 --> 35:53.040
 You're not going to find a genetic association if you don't have variation.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.400
 That doesn't mean that the gene has no role.

35:55.400 --> 35:59.120
 It simply means that the gene tolerates no mutations.

35:59.120 --> 36:01.480
 So that's actually a strong signal when there's no variation.

36:01.480 --> 36:02.480
 That's so fascinating.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.480
 Exactly.

36:03.480 --> 36:06.780
 Genes that have very little variation are hugely important.

36:06.780 --> 36:10.840
 You can actually rank the importance of genes based on how little variation they have.

36:10.840 --> 36:16.920
 And those genes that have very little variation but no association with disease, that's a

36:16.920 --> 36:20.440
 very good metric to say, oh, that's probably a developmental gene because we're not good

36:20.440 --> 36:22.840
 at measuring those phenotypes.

36:22.840 --> 36:29.040
 So it's genes that you can tell evolution has excluded mutations from, but yet we can't

36:29.040 --> 36:32.120
 see them associated with anything that we can measure nowadays.

36:32.120 --> 36:34.840
 It's probably early embryonic lethal.

36:34.840 --> 36:36.200
 What are all the words you just said?

36:36.200 --> 36:37.760
 Early embryonic what?

36:37.760 --> 36:38.760
 Lethal.

36:38.760 --> 36:39.760
 Meaning?

36:39.760 --> 36:40.760
 Meaning that that embryo will die.

36:40.760 --> 36:41.760
 Okay.

36:41.760 --> 36:49.160
 There's a bunch of stuff that is required for a stable functional organism across the

36:49.160 --> 36:53.880
 board for an entire species, I guess.

36:53.880 --> 36:58.680
 If you look at sperm, it expresses thousands of proteins.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.240
 Does sperm actually need thousands of proteins?

37:01.240 --> 37:05.320
 No, but it's probably just testing them.

37:05.320 --> 37:11.960
 So my speculation is that misfolding of these proteins is an early test for failure.

37:11.960 --> 37:18.440
 So that out of the millions of sperm that are possible, you select the subset that are

37:18.440 --> 37:21.920
 just not grossly misfolding thousands of proteins.

37:21.920 --> 37:25.720
 So it's kind of an assert that this is folded correctly.

37:25.720 --> 37:26.720
 Correct.

37:26.720 --> 37:27.720
 Yeah.

37:27.720 --> 37:32.560
 This just because if this little thing about the folding of a protein isn't correct, that

37:32.560 --> 37:35.720
 probably means somewhere down the line, there's a bigger issue.

37:35.720 --> 37:36.720
 That's exactly right.

37:36.720 --> 37:37.720
 So fail fast.

37:37.720 --> 37:45.100
 So basically if you look at the mammalian investment in a newborn, that investment is

37:45.100 --> 37:47.720
 enormous in terms of resources.

37:47.720 --> 37:52.840
 So mammals have basically evolved mechanisms for fail fast.

37:52.840 --> 37:58.880
 Where basically in those early months of development, I mean it's horrendous of course at the personal

37:58.880 --> 38:08.680
 level when you lose your future child, but in some ways there's so little hope for that

38:08.680 --> 38:12.880
 child to develop and sort of make it through the remaining months that sort of fail fast

38:12.880 --> 38:19.560
 is probably a good evolutionary principle for mammals.

38:19.560 --> 38:24.920
 And of course humans have a lot of medical resources that you can sort of give those

38:24.920 --> 38:33.120
 children a chance and we have so much more success in sort of giving folks who have these

38:33.120 --> 38:37.040
 strong carrier mutations a chance, but if they're not even making it through the first

38:37.040 --> 38:39.860
 three months, we're not going to see them.

38:39.860 --> 38:45.080
 So that's why when we say what are the most important genes to focus on, the ones that

38:45.080 --> 38:50.040
 have a strong effect mutation or the ones that have a weak effect mutation, well the

38:50.040 --> 38:57.080
 jury might be out because the ones that have a strong effect mutation are basically not

38:57.080 --> 38:58.720
 mattering as much.

38:58.720 --> 39:04.960
 The ones that only have weak effect mutations by understanding through genetics that they

39:04.960 --> 39:10.200
 have a weak effect mutation and understanding that they have a causal role on the disease,

39:10.200 --> 39:15.720
 we can then say, okay, great, evolution has only tolerated a 2% change in that gene.

39:15.720 --> 39:22.560
 Pharmaceutically I can go in and induce a 70% change in that gene and maybe I will poke

39:22.560 --> 39:33.220
 another hole at the bathtub that was not easy to control in many of the other sort of strong

39:33.220 --> 39:35.160
 effect genetic variants.

39:35.160 --> 39:41.800
 So there's this beautiful map of across the population of things that you're saying strong

39:41.800 --> 39:48.200
 and weak effects, so stuff with a lot of mutations and stuff with little mutations with no mutations

39:48.200 --> 39:51.360
 and you have this map and it lays out the puzzle.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.360
 Yeah.

39:52.360 --> 39:56.120
 So when I say strong effect, I mean at the level of individual mutations.

39:56.120 --> 40:03.640
 So basically genes where, so you have to think of first the effect of the gene on the disease.

40:03.640 --> 40:10.240
 Remember how I was sort of painting that map earlier from genetics all the way to phenotype.

40:10.240 --> 40:15.960
 That gene can have a strong effect on the disease, but the genetic variant might have

40:15.960 --> 40:18.880
 a weak effect on the gene.

40:18.880 --> 40:24.960
 So basically when you ask what is the effect of that genetic variant on the disease, it

40:24.960 --> 40:29.560
 could be that that genetic variant impacts the gene by a lot and then the gene impacts

40:29.560 --> 40:33.240
 the disease by a little, or it could be that the genetic variants impacts the gene by a

40:33.240 --> 40:35.880
 little and then the gene impacts the disease by a lot.

40:35.880 --> 40:41.720
 So what we care about is genes that impact the disease a lot, but genetics gives us the

40:41.720 --> 40:51.920
 full equation and what I would argue is if we couple the genetics with expression variation

40:51.920 --> 41:00.400
 to basically ask what genes change by a lot and which genes correlate with disease by

41:00.400 --> 41:06.200
 a lot, even if the genetic variants change them by a little, then those are the best

41:06.200 --> 41:07.200
 places to intervene.

41:07.200 --> 41:13.200
 Those are the best places where pharmaceutical, if I have even a modest effect, I will have

41:13.200 --> 41:17.120
 a strong effect on the disease, whereas those genetic variants that have a huge effect on

41:17.120 --> 41:21.120
 the disease, I might not be able to change that gene by this much without affecting all

41:21.120 --> 41:22.360
 kinds of other things.

41:22.360 --> 41:23.360
 Interesting.

41:23.360 --> 41:26.040
 So that's what we're looking at.

41:26.040 --> 41:31.800
 What have we been able to find in terms of which disease could be helped?

41:31.800 --> 41:37.280
 Again, don't get me started.

41:37.280 --> 41:38.960
 We have found so much.

41:38.960 --> 41:46.000
 Our understanding of disease has changed so dramatically with genetics.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
 I mean places that we had no idea would be involved.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.920
 So one of the worst things about my genome is that I have a genetic predisposition to

41:53.920 --> 41:56.520
 age related macular degeneration, AMD.

41:56.520 --> 42:02.260
 So it's a form of blindness that causes you to lose the central part of your vision progressively

42:02.260 --> 42:04.400
 as you grow older.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.240
 My increased risk is fairly small.

42:06.240 --> 42:07.680
 I have an 8% chance.

42:07.680 --> 42:10.080
 You only have a 6% chance.

42:10.080 --> 42:11.080
 I'm an average.

42:11.080 --> 42:14.560
 By the way, when you say my, you mean literally yours.

42:14.560 --> 42:15.880
 You know this about you.

42:15.880 --> 42:18.000
 I know this about me.

42:18.000 --> 42:26.500
 Which is kind of, I mean philosophically speaking is a pretty powerful thing to live with.

42:26.500 --> 42:31.680
 Maybe that's, so we agreed to talk again by the way for the listeners to where we're going

42:31.680 --> 42:36.080
 to try to focus on science today and a little bit of philosophy next time.

42:36.080 --> 42:42.880
 But it's interesting to think about the more you're able to know about yourself from the

42:42.880 --> 42:49.360
 genetic information in terms of the diseases, how that changes your own view of life.

42:49.360 --> 42:56.000
 So there's a lot of impact there and there's something called genetics exceptionalism,

42:56.000 --> 43:01.040
 which basically thinks of genetics as something very, very different than everything else

43:01.040 --> 43:04.200
 as a type of determinism.

43:04.200 --> 43:07.320
 And you know, let's talk about that next time.

43:07.320 --> 43:08.320
 So basically.

43:08.320 --> 43:09.320
 That's a good preview.

43:09.320 --> 43:10.320
 Yeah.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.680
 So let's go back to AMD.

43:11.680 --> 43:16.920
 So basically with AMD, we have no idea what causes AMD.

43:16.920 --> 43:23.700
 You know, it was, it was a mystery until the genetics were worked out.

43:23.700 --> 43:28.640
 And now the fact that I know that I have a predisposition allows me to sort of make some

43:28.640 --> 43:34.720
 life choices, number one, but number two, the genes that lead to that predisposition

43:34.720 --> 43:38.520
 give us insights as to how does it actually work.

43:38.520 --> 43:42.960
 And that's a place where genetics gave us something totally unexpected.

43:42.960 --> 43:52.000
 So there's a complement pathway, which is an immune function pathway that was in, you

43:52.000 --> 43:55.940
 know, most of the loci associated with AMD.

43:55.940 --> 44:02.600
 And that basically told us that, wow, there's an immune basis to this eye disorder that

44:02.600 --> 44:05.180
 people had just not expected before.

44:05.180 --> 44:11.160
 If you look at complement, it was recently also implicated in schizophrenia.

44:11.160 --> 44:17.280
 And there's a type of microglia that is involved in synaptic pruning.

44:17.280 --> 44:20.560
 So synapses are the connections between neurons.

44:20.560 --> 44:27.160
 And in this whole use it or lose it view of mental cognition and other capabilities, you

44:27.160 --> 44:32.960
 basically have microglia, which are immune cells that are sort of constantly traversing

44:32.960 --> 44:38.640
 your brain and then pruning neuronal connections, pruning synaptic connections that are not

44:38.640 --> 44:40.260
 utilized.

44:40.260 --> 44:47.960
 So in schizophrenia, there's thought to be a change in the pruning that basically if

44:47.960 --> 44:53.280
 you don't prune your synapses the right way, you will actually have an increased role of

44:53.280 --> 44:54.280
 schizophrenia.

44:54.280 --> 44:57.160
 This is something that was completely unexpected for schizophrenia.

44:57.160 --> 45:01.560
 Of course, we knew it has to do with neurons, but the role of the complement complex, which

45:01.560 --> 45:06.520
 is also implicated in AMD, which is now also implicated in schizophrenia, was a huge surprise.

45:06.520 --> 45:08.040
 What's the complement complex?

45:08.040 --> 45:13.960
 So it's basically a set of genes, the complement genes that are basically having various immune

45:13.960 --> 45:15.460
 roles.

45:15.460 --> 45:19.940
 And as I was saying earlier, our immune system has been coopted for many different roles

45:19.940 --> 45:21.220
 across the body.

45:21.220 --> 45:23.440
 So they actually play many diverse roles.

45:23.440 --> 45:29.600
 And somehow the immune system is connected to the synaptic pruning process, the process.

45:29.600 --> 45:30.600
 Exactly.

45:30.600 --> 45:33.080
 So the prune cells were coopted to prune synapses.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.720
 How did you figure this out?

45:35.720 --> 45:41.920
 How does one go about figuring this intricate connection, like pipeline of connections out?

45:41.920 --> 45:42.920
 Yeah.

45:42.920 --> 45:44.280
 Let me give you another example.

45:44.280 --> 45:48.920
 So Alzheimer's disease, the first place that you would expect it to act is obviously the

45:48.920 --> 45:49.920
 brain.

45:49.920 --> 45:57.000
 So we had basically this roadmap epigenomics consortium view of the human epigenome, the

45:57.000 --> 46:04.440
 largest map of the human epigenome that has ever been built across 127 different tissues

46:04.440 --> 46:10.560
 and samples with dozens of epigenomic marks measured in hundreds of donors.

46:10.560 --> 46:16.600
 So what we've basically learned through that is that you basically can map what are the

46:16.600 --> 46:20.280
 active gene regulatory elements for every one of the tissues in the body.

46:20.280 --> 46:27.400
 And then we connected these gene regulatory active maps of basically what regions of the

46:27.400 --> 46:32.000
 human genome are turning on in every one of different tissues.

46:32.000 --> 46:38.600
 We then can go back and say, where are all of the genetic loci that are associated with

46:38.600 --> 46:39.600
 disease?

46:39.600 --> 46:46.400
 This is something that my group, I think was the first to do back in 2010 in this Ernst

46:46.400 --> 46:52.040
 Nature Biotech paper, but basically we were for the first time able to show that specific

46:52.040 --> 46:58.560
 chromatin states, specific epigenomic states, in that case enhancers, were in fact enriched

46:58.560 --> 47:00.720
 in disease associated variants.

47:00.720 --> 47:05.640
 We pushed that further in the Ernst Nature paper a year later.

47:05.640 --> 47:12.680
 And then in this roadmap epigenomics paper a few years after that, but basically that

47:12.680 --> 47:18.160
 matrix that you mentioned earlier was in fact the first time that we could see what genetic

47:18.160 --> 47:26.360
 traits have genetic variants that are enriched in what tissues in the body.

47:26.360 --> 47:28.800
 And a lot of that map made complete sense.

47:28.800 --> 47:33.800
 If you looked at a diversity of immune traits like allergies and type one diabetes and so

47:33.800 --> 47:38.920
 on and so forth, you basically could see that they were enriching, that the genetic variants

47:38.920 --> 47:44.680
 associated with those traits were enriched in enhancers in these gene regulatory elements

47:44.680 --> 47:49.280
 active in T cells and B cells and hematopoietic stem cells and so on and so forth.

47:49.280 --> 47:56.960
 So that basically gave us a confirmation in many ways that those immune traits were indeed

47:56.960 --> 48:00.360
 enriching immune cells.

48:00.360 --> 48:06.080
 If you looked at type two diabetes, you basically saw an enrichment in only one type of sample

48:06.080 --> 48:08.960
 and it was pancreatic islets.

48:08.960 --> 48:14.960
 And we know that type two diabetes sort of stems from the dysregulation of insulin in

48:14.960 --> 48:17.440
 the beta cells of pancreatic islets.

48:17.440 --> 48:21.200
 And that sort of was spot on, super precise.

48:21.200 --> 48:25.880
 If you looked at blood pressure, where would you expect blood pressure to occur?

48:25.880 --> 48:29.880
 You know, I don't know, maybe in your metabolism and ways that you process coffee or something

48:29.880 --> 48:30.880
 like that.

48:30.880 --> 48:33.880
 Maybe in your brain, the way that you stress out and increases your blood pressure, et

48:33.880 --> 48:34.880
 cetera.

48:34.880 --> 48:40.360
 So the blood pressure localized specifically in the left ventricle of the heart.

48:40.360 --> 48:44.100
 So the enhancers of the left ventricle in the heart contained a lot of genetic variants

48:44.100 --> 48:46.760
 associated with blood pressure.

48:46.760 --> 48:53.280
 If you look at height, we found an enrichment specifically in embryonic stem cell enhancers.

48:53.280 --> 48:57.480
 So the genetic variants predisposing you to be taller or shorter are in fact acting in

48:57.480 --> 49:01.380
 developmental stem cells, makes complete sense.

49:01.380 --> 49:05.920
 If you looked at inflammatory bowel disease, you basically found inflammatory, which is

49:05.920 --> 49:09.880
 immune, and also bowel disease, which is digestive.

49:09.880 --> 49:15.800
 And indeed we saw a double enrichment both in the immune cells and in the digestive cells.

49:15.800 --> 49:19.040
 So that basically told us that this is acting in both components.

49:19.040 --> 49:23.460
 There's an immune component to inflammatory bowel disease and there's a digestive component.

49:23.460 --> 49:25.960
 And the big surprise was for Alzheimer's.

49:25.960 --> 49:29.160
 We had seven different brain samples.

49:29.160 --> 49:36.240
 We found zero enrichment in the brain samples for genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.020
 And this is mind boggling.

49:38.020 --> 49:40.040
 Our brains were literally hurting.

49:40.040 --> 49:42.000
 What is going on?

49:42.000 --> 49:49.080
 And what is going on is that the brain samples are primarily neurons, oligodendrocytes, and

49:49.080 --> 49:54.120
 astrocytes in terms of the cell types that make them up.

49:54.120 --> 49:59.400
 So that basically indicated that genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's were probably

49:59.400 --> 50:04.560
 not acting in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, or neurons.

50:04.560 --> 50:05.960
 So what could they be acting in?

50:05.960 --> 50:10.200
 Well, the fourth major cell type is actually microglia.

50:10.200 --> 50:13.720
 Microglia are resident immune cells in your brain.

50:13.720 --> 50:15.880
 Oh, nice.

50:15.880 --> 50:16.880
 They immune.

50:16.880 --> 50:17.880
 Oh, wow.

50:17.880 --> 50:24.160
 They are CD14 plus, which is this sort of cell surface markers of those cells.

50:24.160 --> 50:30.200
 So they're CD14 plus cells, just like macrophages that are circulating in your blood.

50:30.200 --> 50:35.640
 The microglia are resident monocytes that are basically sitting in your brain.

50:35.640 --> 50:38.400
 They're tissue specific monocytes.

50:38.400 --> 50:42.840
 And every one of your tissues, like your fat, for example, has a lot of macrophages that

50:42.840 --> 50:43.920
 are resident.

50:43.920 --> 50:49.560
 And the M1 versus M2 macrophage ratio has a huge role to play in obesity.

50:49.560 --> 50:53.440
 And so basically, again, these immune cells are everywhere, but basically what we found

50:53.440 --> 50:59.080
 through this completely unbiased view of what are the tissues that likely underlie different

50:59.080 --> 51:08.080
 disorders, we found that Alzheimer's was humongously enriched in microglia, but not at all in the

51:08.080 --> 51:09.080
 other cell types.

51:09.080 --> 51:15.480
 So what are we supposed to make that if you look at the tissues involved, is that simply

51:15.480 --> 51:24.640
 useful for indication of propensity for disease, or does it give us somehow a pathway of treatment?

51:24.640 --> 51:26.120
 It's very much the second.

51:26.120 --> 51:33.900
 If you look at the way to therapeutics, you have to start somewhere.

51:33.900 --> 51:34.900
 What are you going to do?

51:34.900 --> 51:42.040
 You're going to basically make assays that manipulate those genes and those pathways

51:42.040 --> 51:43.780
 in those cell types.

51:43.780 --> 51:49.200
 So before we know the tissue of action, we don't even know where to start.

51:49.200 --> 51:51.040
 We basically are at a loss.

51:51.040 --> 51:54.720
 But if you know the tissue of action, and even better, if you know the pathway of action,

51:54.720 --> 52:00.280
 then you can basically screen your small molecules, not for the gene, you can screen them directly

52:00.280 --> 52:02.640
 for the pathway in that cell type.

52:02.640 --> 52:10.480
 So you can basically develop a high throughput multiplexed robotic system for testing the

52:10.480 --> 52:16.240
 impact of your favorite molecules that you know are safe, efficacious, and sort of hit

52:16.240 --> 52:18.940
 that particular gene and so on and so forth.

52:18.940 --> 52:25.720
 You can basically screen those molecules against either a set of genes that act in that pathway

52:25.720 --> 52:29.820
 or on the pathway directly by having a cellular assay.

52:29.820 --> 52:33.400
 And then you can basically go into mice and do experiments and basically sort of figure

52:33.400 --> 52:38.800
 out ways to manipulate these processes that allow you to then go back to humans and do

52:38.800 --> 52:43.200
 a clinical trial that basically says, okay, I was able indeed to reverse these processes

52:43.200 --> 52:44.200
 in mice.

52:44.200 --> 52:46.240
 Can I do the same thing in humans?

52:46.240 --> 52:51.820
 So the knowledge of the tissues gives you the pathway to treatment, but that's not the

52:51.820 --> 52:52.820
 only part.

52:52.820 --> 52:57.280
 There are many additional steps to figuring out the mechanism of disease.

52:57.280 --> 52:59.080
 So that's really promising.

52:59.080 --> 53:04.360
 Maybe to take a small step back, you've mentioned all these puzzles that were figured out with

53:04.360 --> 53:13.960
 the Nature paper for, I mean, you've mentioned a ton of diseases from obesity to Alzheimer's,

53:13.960 --> 53:17.720
 even schizophrenia, I think you mentioned.

53:17.720 --> 53:20.720
 What is the actual methodology of figuring this out?

53:20.720 --> 53:26.040
 So indeed, I mentioned a lot of diseases and my lab works on a lot of different disorders.

53:26.040 --> 53:39.500
 And the reason for that is that if you look at biology, it used to be zoology departments

53:39.500 --> 53:43.680
 and botanology departments and virology departments and so on and so forth.

53:43.680 --> 53:47.680
 And MIT was one of the first schools to basically create a biology department, like, oh, we're

53:47.680 --> 53:49.640
 going to study all of life suddenly.

53:49.640 --> 53:51.720
 Why was that even a case?

53:51.720 --> 53:58.480
 Because the advent of DNA and the genome and the central dogma of DNA makes RNA makes protein

53:58.480 --> 54:01.600
 in many ways, unified biology.

54:01.600 --> 54:07.480
 You could suddenly study the process of transcription in viruses or in bacteria and have a huge

54:07.480 --> 54:15.040
 impact on yeast and fly and maybe even mammals because of this realization of these common

54:15.040 --> 54:17.760
 underlying processes.

54:17.760 --> 54:27.180
 And in the same way that DNA unified biology, genetics is unifying disease studies.

54:27.180 --> 54:39.440
 So you used to have, I don't know, cardiovascular disease department and neurological disease

54:39.440 --> 54:47.640
 department and neurodegeneration department and basically immune and cancer and so on

54:47.640 --> 54:48.640
 and so forth.

54:48.640 --> 54:53.600
 And all of these were studied in different labs because it made sense, because basically

54:53.600 --> 54:57.560
 the first step was understanding how the tissue functions and we kind of knew the tissues

54:57.560 --> 55:00.680
 involved in cardiovascular disease and so on and so forth.

55:00.680 --> 55:05.760
 But what's happening with human genetics is that all of these walls and edifices that

55:05.760 --> 55:08.480
 we had built are crumbling.

55:08.480 --> 55:16.560
 And the reason for that is that genetics is in many ways revealing unexpected connections.

55:16.560 --> 55:21.480
 So suddenly we now have to bring the immunologists to work on Alzheimer's.

55:21.480 --> 55:22.680
 They were never in the room.

55:22.680 --> 55:25.920
 They were in another building altogether.

55:25.920 --> 55:31.600
 The same way for schizophrenia, we now have to sort of worry about all these interconnected

55:31.600 --> 55:33.200
 aspects.

55:33.200 --> 55:37.500
 For metabolic disorders, we're finding contributions from brain.

55:37.500 --> 55:41.340
 So suddenly we have to call the neurologist from the other building and so on and so forth.

55:41.340 --> 55:49.200
 So in my view, it makes no sense anymore to basically say, oh, I'm a geneticist studying

55:49.200 --> 55:50.200
 immune disorders.

55:50.200 --> 55:55.360
 I mean, that's ridiculous because, I mean, of course in many ways you still need to sort

55:55.360 --> 55:56.480
 of focus.

55:56.480 --> 56:01.080
 But what we're doing is that we're basically saying we'll go wherever the genetics takes

56:01.080 --> 56:02.440
 us.

56:02.440 --> 56:10.440
 And by building these massive resources, by working on our latest map is now 833 tissues,

56:10.440 --> 56:15.560
 sort of the next generation of the epigenomics roadmap, which we're now called epimap, is

56:15.560 --> 56:18.120
 833 different tissues.

56:18.120 --> 56:24.620
 And using those, we've basically found enrichments in 540 different disorders.

56:24.620 --> 56:29.340
 Those enrichments are not like, oh great, you guys work on that and we'll work on this.

56:29.340 --> 56:31.980
 They're intertwined amazingly.

56:31.980 --> 56:36.120
 So of course there's a lot of modularity, but there's these enhancers that are sort

56:36.120 --> 56:39.040
 of broadly active and these disorders that are broadly active.

56:39.040 --> 56:43.480
 So basically some enhancers are active in all tissues and some disorders are enriching

56:43.480 --> 56:44.480
 in all tissues.

56:44.480 --> 56:49.160
 So basically there's these multifactorial and this other class, which I like to call

56:49.160 --> 56:54.560
 polyfactorial diseases, which are basically lighting up everywhere.

56:54.560 --> 57:00.000
 And in many ways it's, you know, sort of cutting across these walls that were previously built

57:00.000 --> 57:01.760
 across these departments.

57:01.760 --> 57:07.040
 And the polyfactorial ones were probably the previous structural departments wasn't equipped

57:07.040 --> 57:08.040
 to deal with those.

57:08.040 --> 57:14.680
 I mean, again, maybe it's a romanticized question, but you know, there's in physics, there's

57:14.680 --> 57:16.920
 a theory of everything.

57:16.920 --> 57:22.400
 Do you think it's possible to move towards an almost theory of everything of disease

57:22.400 --> 57:24.100
 from a genetic perspective?

57:24.100 --> 57:29.640
 So if this unification continues, is it possible that, like, do you think in those terms, like

57:29.640 --> 57:35.720
 trying to arrive at a fundamental understanding of how disease emerges, period?

57:35.720 --> 57:41.680
 That unification is not just foreseeable, it's inevitable.

57:41.680 --> 57:43.600
 I see it as inevitable.

57:43.600 --> 57:45.240
 We have to go there.

57:45.240 --> 57:48.340
 You cannot be a specialist anymore.

57:48.340 --> 57:53.840
 If you're a genomicist, you have to be a specialist in every single disorder.

57:53.840 --> 57:59.960
 And the reason for that is that the fundamental understanding of the circuitry of the human

57:59.960 --> 58:07.960
 genome that you need to solve schizophrenia, that fundamental circuitry is hugely important

58:07.960 --> 58:09.600
 to solve Alzheimer's.

58:09.600 --> 58:13.100
 And that same circuitry is hugely important to solve metabolic disorders.

58:13.100 --> 58:20.040
 And that same exact circuitry is hugely important for solving immune disorders and cancer and,

58:20.040 --> 58:22.260
 you know, every single disease.

58:22.260 --> 58:26.680
 So all of them have the same sub task.

58:26.680 --> 58:29.880
 And I teach dynamic programming in my class.

58:29.880 --> 58:34.400
 Dynamic programming is all about sort of not redoing the work.

58:34.400 --> 58:37.280
 It's reusing the work that you do once.

58:37.280 --> 58:42.240
 So basically for us to say, oh, great, you know, you guys in the immune building go solve

58:42.240 --> 58:44.240
 the fundamental circuitry of everything.

58:44.240 --> 58:47.680
 And then you guys in the schizophrenia building go solve the fundamental circuitry of everything

58:47.680 --> 58:50.080
 separately, is crazy.

58:50.080 --> 58:56.080
 So what we need to do is come together and sort of have a circuitry group, the circuitry

58:56.080 --> 58:59.520
 building that sort of tries to solve the circuitry of everything.

58:59.520 --> 59:05.920
 And then the immune folks who will apply this knowledge to all of the disorders that are

59:05.920 --> 59:12.460
 associated with immune dysfunction and the schizophrenia folks will basically interacting

59:12.460 --> 59:15.560
 with both the immune folks and with the neuronal folks.

59:15.560 --> 59:19.000
 And all of them will be interacting with the circuitry folks and so on and so forth.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.320
 So that's sort of the current structure of my group, if you wish.

59:22.320 --> 59:27.200
 So basically what we're doing is focusing on the fundamental circuitry.

59:27.200 --> 59:34.020
 But at the same time, we're the users of our own tools by collaborating with many other

59:34.020 --> 59:37.480
 labs in every one of these disorders that we mentioned.

59:37.480 --> 59:42.880
 We basically have a heart focus on cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, heart failure

59:42.880 --> 59:44.280
 and so on and so forth.

59:44.280 --> 59:48.900
 We have an immune focus on several immune disorders.

59:48.900 --> 59:55.580
 We have a cancer focus on metastatic melanoma and immunotherapy response.

59:55.580 --> 1:00:04.120
 We have a psychiatric disease focus on schizophrenia, autism, PTSD, and other psychiatric disorders.

1:00:04.120 --> 1:00:10.280
 We have an Alzheimer's and neurodegeneration focus on Huntington's disease, ALS and, you

1:00:10.280 --> 1:00:14.460
 know, AD related disorders like frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body dementia.

1:00:14.460 --> 1:00:16.740
 And of course, a huge focus on Alzheimer's.

1:00:16.740 --> 1:00:23.320
 We have a metabolic focus on the role of exercise and diets and sort of how they're impacting

1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:29.120
 metabolic organs across the body and across many different tissues.

1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:34.100
 And all of them are interfacing with the circuitry.

1:00:34.100 --> 1:00:42.180
 And the reason for that is another computer science principle of eat your own dog food.

1:00:42.180 --> 1:00:47.760
 If everybody ate their own dog food, dog food would taste a lot better.

1:00:47.760 --> 1:00:55.080
 The reason why Microsoft Excel and Word and PowerPoint was so important and so successful

1:00:55.080 --> 1:01:00.000
 is because the employees that were working on them, were using them for their day to

1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:01.500
 day tasks.

1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:06.120
 You can't just simply build a circuitry and say, here it is guys, take the circuitry,

1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:11.440
 we're done without being the users of that circuitry because you then go back.

1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:16.740
 And because we span the whole spectrum from profiling the epigenome, using comparative

1:01:16.740 --> 1:01:21.220
 genomics, finding the important nucleotides in the genome, building the basic functional

1:01:21.220 --> 1:01:26.800
 map of what are the genes in the human genome, what are the gene regulatory elements of the

1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:27.800
 human genome.

1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:31.720
 I mean, over the years we've written a series of papers on how do you find human genes in

1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:34.080
 the first place using comparative genomics?

1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:38.840
 How do you find the motifs that are the building blocks of gene regulation using comparative

1:01:38.840 --> 1:01:39.840
 genomics?

1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:44.800
 And how do you then find how these motifs come together and act in specific tissues

1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:46.280
 using epigenomics?

1:01:46.280 --> 1:01:53.860
 How do you link regulators to enhancers and enhancers to their target genes using epigenomics

1:01:53.860 --> 1:01:55.260
 and regulatory genomics?

1:01:55.260 --> 1:02:00.320
 So through the years we've basically built all this infrastructure for understanding

1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:06.900
 what I like to say, every single nucleotide of the human genome and how it acts in every

1:02:06.900 --> 1:02:10.320
 one of the major cell types and tissues of the human body.

1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:12.040
 I mean, this is no small task.

1:02:12.040 --> 1:02:15.540
 This is an enormous task that takes the entire field.

1:02:15.540 --> 1:02:20.720
 And that's something that my group has taken on along with many other groups.

1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:25.340
 And we have also, and that sort of a thing sets my group perhaps apart, we have also

1:02:25.340 --> 1:02:30.640
 worked with specialists in every one of these disorders to basically further our understanding

1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:35.280
 all the way down to disease and in some cases collaborating with pharma to go all the way

1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:42.480
 down to therapeutics because of our deep, deep understanding of that basic circuitry

1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:47.600
 and how it allows us to now improve the circuitry.

1:02:47.600 --> 1:02:51.880
 Not just treat it as a black box, but basically go and say, okay, we need a better cell type

1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:56.480
 specific wiring that we now have at the tissue specific level.

1:02:56.480 --> 1:03:01.560
 So we're focusing on that because we're understanding the needs from the disease front.

1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:08.040
 So you have a sense of the entire pipeline, I mean, one, maybe you can indulge me.

1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:14.700
 One nice question to ask would be, how do you, from the scientific perspective, go from

1:03:14.700 --> 1:03:22.040
 knowing nothing about the disease to going, you said, to go into the entire pipeline and

1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:26.840
 actually have a drug or a treatment that cures that disease?

1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:32.840
 So that's an enormously long path and an enormously great challenge.

1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:39.560
 And what I'm trying to argue is that it progresses in stages of understanding rather than one

1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:40.960
 gene at a time.

1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:45.200
 The traditional view of biology was you have one postdoc working on this gene and another

1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:50.260
 postdoc working on that gene, and they'll just figure out everything about that gene

1:03:50.260 --> 1:03:52.120
 and that's their job.

1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:57.840
 But we've realized how polygenic the diseases are, so we can't have one postdoc per gene

1:03:57.840 --> 1:03:58.840
 anymore.

1:03:58.840 --> 1:04:04.360
 We now have to have these cross cutting needs.

1:04:04.360 --> 1:04:10.480
 And I'm going to describe the path to circuitry along those needs.

1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:15.600
 And every single one of these paths, we are now doing in parallel across thousands of

1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:17.000
 genes.

1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:23.160
 So the first step is you have a genetic association, and we talked a little bit about sort of the

1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:27.760
 Mendelian path and the polygenic path to that association.

1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:33.320
 So the Mendelian path was looking through families to basically find gene regions and

1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:36.860
 ultimately genes that are underlying particular disorders.

1:04:36.860 --> 1:04:43.240
 The polygenic path is basically looking at unrelated individuals in this giant matrix

1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:49.200
 of genotype by phenotype, and then finding hits where a particular variant impacts disease

1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:51.520
 all the way to the end.

1:04:51.520 --> 1:04:57.960
 And then we now have a connection, not between a gene and a disease, but between a genetic

1:04:57.960 --> 1:05:00.200
 region and a disease.

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:03.520
 And that distinction is not understood by most people.

1:05:03.520 --> 1:05:06.640
 So I'm going to explain it a little bit more.

1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:11.240
 Why do we not have a connection between a gene and a disease, but we have a connection

1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:13.480
 between a genetic region and a disease?

1:05:13.480 --> 1:05:21.840
 The reason for that is that 93% of genetic variants that are associated with disease

1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:27.180
 don't impact the protein at all.

1:05:27.180 --> 1:05:33.340
 So if you look at the human genome, there's 20,000 genes, there's 3.2 billion nucleotides.

1:05:33.340 --> 1:05:40.120
 Only 1.5% of the genome codes for proteins.

1:05:40.120 --> 1:05:46.160
 The other 98.5% does not code for proteins.

1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:54.440
 If you now look at where are the disease variants located, 93% of them fall in that outside

1:05:54.440 --> 1:05:55.720
 the genes portion.

1:05:55.720 --> 1:06:00.600
 Of course, genes are enriched, but they're only enriched by a factor of three.

1:06:00.600 --> 1:06:06.880
 That means that still 93% of genetic variants fall outside the proteins.

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:08.200
 Why is that difficult?

1:06:08.200 --> 1:06:09.480
 Why is that a problem?

1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:15.900
 The problem is that when a variant falls outside the gene, you don't know what gene is impacted

1:06:15.900 --> 1:06:16.900
 by that variant.

1:06:16.900 --> 1:06:21.160
 You can't just say, oh, it's near this gene, let's just connect that variant to the gene.

1:06:21.160 --> 1:06:27.880
 And the reason for that is that the genome circuitry is very often long range.

1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:34.880
 So you basically have that genetic variant that could sit in the intron of one gene.

1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:38.120
 An intron is sort of the place between the exons that code for proteins.

1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:43.560
 So proteins are split up into exons and introns and every exon codes for a particular subset

1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:49.220
 of amino acids and together they're spliced together and then make the final protein.

1:06:49.220 --> 1:06:51.900
 So that genetic variant might be sitting in an intron of a gene.

1:06:51.900 --> 1:06:56.320
 It's transcribed with the gene, it's processed and then excised, but it might not impact

1:06:56.320 --> 1:06:57.320
 this gene at all.

1:06:57.320 --> 1:07:01.080
 It might actually impact another gene that's a million nucleotides away.

1:07:01.080 --> 1:07:05.840
 So it's just riding along even though it has nothing to do with this nearby neighborhood.

1:07:05.840 --> 1:07:06.840
 That's exactly right.

1:07:06.840 --> 1:07:09.600
 Let me give you an example.

1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:16.520
 The strongest genetic association with obesity was discovered in this FTO gene, fat and obesity

1:07:16.520 --> 1:07:18.400
 associated gene.

1:07:18.400 --> 1:07:23.780
 So this FTO gene was studied ad nauseum.

1:07:23.780 --> 1:07:26.740
 People did tons of experiments on it.

1:07:26.740 --> 1:07:33.000
 They figured out that FTO is in fact RNA methylation transferase.

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:38.880
 It basically impacts something that we call the epitranscriptome.

1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:43.520
 Just like the genome can be modified, the transcriptome, the transcript of the genes

1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:44.900
 can be modified.

1:07:44.900 --> 1:07:49.320
 And we basically said, oh great, that means that epitranscriptomics is hugely involved

1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:56.880
 in obesity because that gene FTO is clearly where the genetic locus is at.

1:07:56.880 --> 1:08:04.400
 My group studied FTO in collaboration with a wonderful team led by Melina Klausnitzer.

1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:11.800
 And what we found is that this FTO locus, even though it is as associated with obesity,

1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:16.680
 does not implicate the FTO gene.

1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:22.840
 The genetic variance, it's in the first intron of the FTO gene, but it controls two genes

1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:32.120
 IRX3 and IRX5 that are sitting 1.2 million nucleotides away, several genes away.

1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:33.120
 Oh boy.

1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:38.880
 What am I supposed to feel about that because isn't that like super complicated then?

1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:43.640
 So the way that I was introduced at a conference a few years ago was, and here's Manolis Kellis

1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:48.720
 who wrote the most depressing paper of 2015.

1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:52.080
 And the reason for that is that the entire pharmaceutical industry was so comfortable

1:08:52.080 --> 1:08:56.120
 that there was a single gene in that locus.

1:08:56.120 --> 1:08:59.580
 Because in some loci, you basically have three dozen genes that are all sitting in the same

1:08:59.580 --> 1:09:04.060
 region of association and you're like, oh gosh, which ones of those is it?

1:09:04.060 --> 1:09:08.120
 But even that question of which ones of those is it is making the assumption that it is

1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:13.680
 one of those as opposed to some random gene just far, far away, which is what our paper

1:09:13.680 --> 1:09:14.680
 showed.

1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:19.040
 So basically what our paper showed is that you can't ignore the circuitry.

1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:23.460
 You have to first figure out the circuitry, all of those long range interactions, how

1:09:23.460 --> 1:09:28.820
 every genetic variant impacts the expression of every gene in every tissue imaginable across

1:09:28.820 --> 1:09:30.960
 hundreds of individuals.

1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:35.560
 And then you now have one of the building blocks, not even all of the building blocks

1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:41.440
 for then going and understanding disease.

1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:44.920
 So embrace the wholeness of the circuitry.

1:09:44.920 --> 1:09:45.920
 Correct.

1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:51.760
 So back to the question of starting knowing nothing to the disease and going to the treatment.

1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:53.520
 So what are the next steps?

1:09:53.520 --> 1:09:57.240
 So you basically have to first figure out the tissue and then describe how you figure

1:09:57.240 --> 1:09:58.240
 out the tissue.

1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:01.740
 You figure out the tissue by taking all of these non coding variants that are sitting

1:10:01.740 --> 1:10:06.840
 outside proteins and then figuring out what are the epigenomic enrichments.

1:10:06.840 --> 1:10:13.860
 And the reason for that, you know, thankfully is that there is convergence, that the same

1:10:13.860 --> 1:10:19.440
 processes are impacted in different ways by different loci.

1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:23.080
 And that's a saving grace for our field.

1:10:23.080 --> 1:10:27.800
 The fact that if I look at hundreds of genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's, they

1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:31.920
 localize in a small number of processes.

1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:34.640
 Can you clarify why that's hopeful?

1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:40.080
 So like they show up in the same exact way in the, in the specific set of processes.

1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:41.080
 Yeah.

1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:45.380
 So basically there's a small number of biological processes that underlie, or at least that

1:10:45.380 --> 1:10:48.580
 play the biggest role in every disorder.

1:10:48.580 --> 1:10:54.040
 So in Alzheimer's you basically have, you know, maybe 10 different types of processes.

1:10:54.040 --> 1:10:56.360
 One of them is lipid metabolism.

1:10:56.360 --> 1:10:58.920
 One of them is immune cell function.

1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:02.400
 One of them is neuronal energetics.

1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:07.760
 So these are just a small number of processes, but you have multiple lesions, multiple genetic

1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:10.980
 perturbations that are associated with those processes.

1:11:10.980 --> 1:11:15.800
 So if you look at schizophrenia, it's excitatory neuron function, it's inhibitory neuron function,

1:11:15.800 --> 1:11:18.940
 it's synaptic pruning, it's calcium signaling and so on and so forth.

1:11:18.940 --> 1:11:24.840
 So when you look at disease genetics, you have one hit here and one hit there and one

1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:28.200
 hit there and one hit there, completely different parts of the genome.

1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:31.640
 But it turns out all of those hits are calcium signaling proteins.

1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:32.640
 Oh, cool.

1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:34.600
 You're like, aha.

1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:37.420
 That means that calcium signaling is important.

1:11:37.420 --> 1:11:42.640
 So those people who are focusing on one doctor at a time cannot possibly see that picture.

1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:44.560
 You have to become a genomicist.

1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:51.400
 You have to look at the omics, the om, the holistic picture to understand these enrichments.

1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:54.080
 But you mentioned the convergence thing.

1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:58.400
 The whatever the thing associated with the disease shows up.

1:11:58.400 --> 1:12:00.200
 So let me explain convergence.

1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:03.580
 Convergence is such a beautiful concept.

1:12:03.580 --> 1:12:12.480
 So you basically have these four genes that are converging on calcium signaling.

1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:18.040
 So that basically means that they are acting each in their own way, but together in the

1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:19.820
 same process.

1:12:19.820 --> 1:12:27.600
 But now in every one of these loci, you have many enhancers controlling each of those genes.

1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:33.280
 That's another type of convergence where dysregulation of seven different enhancers might all converge

1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:39.280
 on dysregulation of that one gene, which then converges on calcium signaling.

1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:44.160
 And in each one of those enhancers, you might have multiple genetic variants distributed

1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:46.960
 across many different people.

1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:49.840
 Everyone has their own different mutation.

1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:52.880
 But all of these mutations are impacting that enhancer.

1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:55.160
 And all of these enhancers are impacting that gene.

1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:57.560
 And all of these genes are impacting this pathway.

1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:00.020
 And all these pathways are acting in the same tissue.

1:13:00.020 --> 1:13:05.280
 And all of these tissues are converging together on the same biological process of schizophrenia.

1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:09.960
 And you're saying the saving grace is that that conversion seems to happen for a lot

1:13:09.960 --> 1:13:11.120
 of these diseases.

1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:12.180
 For all of them.

1:13:12.180 --> 1:13:17.200
 Basically that for every single disease that we've looked at, we have found an epigenomic

1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:18.500
 enrichment.

1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:19.500
 How do you do that?

1:13:19.500 --> 1:13:24.040
 You basically have all of the genetic variants associated with the disorder.

1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:28.080
 And then you're asking for all of the enhancers active in a particular tissue.

1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:33.760
 For 540 disorders, we've basically found that indeed there is an enrichment.

1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:37.060
 That basically means that there is commonality.

1:13:37.060 --> 1:13:40.600
 And from the commonality, we can just get insights.

1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:47.120
 So to explain in mathematical terms, we're basically building an empirical prior.

1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:52.600
 We're using a Bayesian approach to basically say, great, all of these variants are equally

1:13:52.600 --> 1:13:57.200
 likely in a particular locus to be important.

1:13:57.200 --> 1:14:02.800
 So in a genetic locus, you basically have a dozen variants that are coinherited.

1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:07.960
 Because the way that inheritance works in the human genome is through all of these recombination

1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:16.120
 events during meiosis, you basically have, you know, you inherit maybe three, chromosome

1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:20.240
 three, for example, in your body is inherited from four different parts.

1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:23.840
 One part comes from your dad, another part comes from your mom, another part comes from

1:14:23.840 --> 1:14:25.860
 your dad, another part comes from your mom.

1:14:25.860 --> 1:14:30.200
 So basically, the way that it, sorry, from your mom's mom.

1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:33.800
 So you basically have one copy that comes from your dad and one copy that comes from

1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:34.800
 your mom.

1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:39.600
 But that copy that you got from your mom is a mixture of her maternal and her paternal

1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:41.000
 chromosome.

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:44.680
 And the copy that you got from your dad is a mixture of his maternal and his paternal

1:14:44.680 --> 1:14:45.680
 chromosome.

1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:53.480
 So these breakpoints that happen when chromosomes are lining up are basically ensuring through

1:14:53.480 --> 1:15:02.520
 these crossover events, they're ensuring that every child cell during the process of meiosis,

1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:08.560
 where you basically have, you know, one spermatozoid that basically couples with one ovule to basically

1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:12.240
 create one egg to basically create the zygote.

1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:16.440
 You basically have half of your genome that comes from dad and half your genome that comes

1:15:16.440 --> 1:15:17.440
 from mom.

1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:21.040
 But in order to line them up, you basically have these crossover events.

1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:27.880
 These crossover events are basically leading to coinheritance of that entire block coming

1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:33.920
 from your maternal grandmother and that entire block coming from your maternal grandfather.

1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:38.800
 Over many generations, these crossover events don't happen randomly.

1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:45.720
 There's a protein called PRDM9 that basically guides the double stranded breaks and then

1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:48.320
 leads to these crossovers.

1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:54.240
 And that protein has a particular preference to only a small number of hotspots of recombination,

1:15:54.240 --> 1:15:59.880
 which then lead to a small number of breaks between these coinheritance patterns.

1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:06.720
 So even though there are 6 million variants, there are 6 million loci, this variation is

1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:12.600
 inherited in blocks and every one of these blocks has like two dozen genetic variants

1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:13.600
 that are all associated.

1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:19.840
 So in the case of FTO, it wasn't just one variant, it was 89 common variants that were

1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:24.320
 all humongously associated with obesity.

1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:26.640
 Which one of those is the important one?

1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:29.640
 Well, if you look at only one locus, you have no idea.

1:16:29.640 --> 1:16:36.880
 But if you look at many loci, you basically say, aha, all of them are enriching in the

1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:40.080
 same epigenomic map.

1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:44.160
 In that particular case, it was mesenchymal stem cells.

1:16:44.160 --> 1:16:50.560
 So these are the progenitor cells that give rise to your brown fat and your white fat.

1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:54.020
 Progenitor is like the early on developmental stem cells?

1:16:54.020 --> 1:16:58.120
 So you start from one zygote and that's a totipotent cell type.

1:16:58.120 --> 1:17:00.000
 It can do anything.

1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:08.280
 You then, you know, that cell divides, divides, divides, and then every cell division is leading

1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:14.880
 to specialization where you now have a mesodermal lineage and ectodermal lineage and endodermal

1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:19.320
 lineage that basically leads to different parts of your body.

1:17:19.320 --> 1:17:25.840
 The ectoderm will basically give rise to your skin, ecto means outside, derm is skin.

1:17:25.840 --> 1:17:29.640
 So ectoderm, but it also gives rise to your neurons and your whole brain.

1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:31.600
 So that's a lot of ectoderm.

1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:36.880
 Mesoderm gives rise to your internal organs, including the vasculature and you know, your

1:17:36.880 --> 1:17:38.440
 muscle and stuff like that.

1:17:38.440 --> 1:17:45.080
 So you basically have this progressive differentiation and then if you look further, further down

1:17:45.080 --> 1:17:49.700
 that lineage, you basically have one lineage that will give rise to both your muscle and

1:17:49.700 --> 1:17:52.880
 your bone, but also your fat.

1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:57.720
 And if you go further down the lineage of your fat, you basically have your white fat

1:17:57.720 --> 1:17:59.040
 cells.

1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:01.640
 These are the cells that store energy.

1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:06.640
 So when you eat a lot, but you don't exercise too much, there's an excess set of calories,

1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:07.640
 excess energy.

1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:08.640
 What do you do with those?

1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:13.520
 You basically create, you spend a lot of that energy to create these high energy molecules,

1:18:13.520 --> 1:18:19.840
 lipids, which you can then burn when you need them on a rainy day.

1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:26.320
 So that leads to obesity if you don't exercise and if you overeat because your body's like,

1:18:26.320 --> 1:18:27.680
 oh great, I have all these calories.

1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:28.680
 I'm going to store them.

1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:29.680
 Ooh, more calories.

1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:30.680
 I'm going to store them too.

1:18:30.680 --> 1:18:31.680
 Ooh, more calories.

1:18:31.680 --> 1:18:40.280
 So basically the 42% of European chromosomes have a predisposition to storing fat, which

1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:48.880
 was selected probably in the food scarcity periods, like basically as we were exiting

1:18:48.880 --> 1:18:54.240
 Africa before and during the ice ages, there was probably a selection to those individuals

1:18:54.240 --> 1:19:00.880
 who made it North to basically be able to store energy, a lot more energy.

1:19:00.880 --> 1:19:07.160
 So you basically now have this lineage that is deciding whether you want to store energy

1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:11.160
 in your white fat or burn energy in your beige fat.

1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:18.680
 It turns out that your fat is, you know, like we have such a bad view of fat.

1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:20.160
 Fat is your best friend.

1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:24.500
 Fat can both store all these excess lipids that would be otherwise circulating through

1:19:24.500 --> 1:19:29.900
 your body and causing damage, but it can also burn calories directly.

1:19:29.900 --> 1:19:35.760
 If you have too much energy, you can just choose to just burn some of that as heat.

1:19:35.760 --> 1:19:41.200
 So basically when you're cold, you're burning energy to basically warm your body up and

1:19:41.200 --> 1:19:44.540
 you're burning all these lipids and you're burning all these calories.

1:19:44.540 --> 1:19:50.000
 So what we basically found is that across the board, genetic variants associated with

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:56.520
 obesity across many of these regions were all enriched repeatedly in mesenchymal stem

1:19:56.520 --> 1:19:58.360
 cell enhancers.

1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:05.120
 So that gave us a hint as to which of these genetic variants was likely driving this whole

1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:06.120
 association.

1:20:06.120 --> 1:20:14.440
 And we ended up with this one genetic variant called RS1421085.

1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:20.040
 And that genetic variant out of the 89 was the one that we predicted to be causal for

1:20:20.040 --> 1:20:21.040
 the disease.

1:20:21.040 --> 1:20:22.040
 Wow.

1:20:22.040 --> 1:20:26.240
 So going back to those steps, first step is figure out the relevant tissue based on the

1:20:26.240 --> 1:20:27.960
 global enrichment.

1:20:27.960 --> 1:20:34.840
 Second step is figure out the causal variant among many variants in this linkage disequilibrium

1:20:34.840 --> 1:20:41.160
 in this coinherited block between these recombination hotspots, these boundaries of these inherited

1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:42.640
 blocks.

1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:43.920
 That's the second step.

1:20:43.920 --> 1:20:49.920
 The third step is once you know that causal variant, try to figure out what is the motif

1:20:49.920 --> 1:20:52.720
 that is disrupted by that causal variant.

1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:54.400
 Basically how does it act?

1:20:54.400 --> 1:20:59.520
 Variants don't just disrupt elements, they disrupt the binding of specific regulators.

1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:04.440
 So basically the third step there was how do you find the motif that is responsible

1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:10.240
 like the gene regulatory word, the building block of gene regulation that is responsible

1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:12.480
 for that dysregulatory event.

1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:18.280
 And the fourth step is finding out what regulator normally binds that motif and is now no longer

1:21:18.280 --> 1:21:19.280
 able to bind.

1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:24.920
 And then once you have the regulator, can you then try to figure out how to, what after

1:21:24.920 --> 1:21:27.200
 it developed, how to fix it?

1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:28.200
 That's exactly right.

1:21:28.200 --> 1:21:30.260
 You now know how to intervene.

1:21:30.260 --> 1:21:34.520
 You have basically a regulator, you have a gene that you can then perturb and you say,

1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:38.640
 well, maybe that regulator has a global role in obesity.

1:21:38.640 --> 1:21:40.360
 I can perturb the regulator.

1:21:40.360 --> 1:21:46.760
 Just to clarify, when we say perturb, like on the scale of a human life, can a human

1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:49.000
 being be helped?

1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:50.000
 Of course.

1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:51.000
 Yeah.

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.480
 I guess understanding is the first step.

1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:57.480
 No, no, but perturbed basically means you now develop therapeutics, pharmaceutical therapeutics

1:21:57.480 --> 1:21:59.340
 against that.

1:21:59.340 --> 1:22:03.800
 Or you develop other types of intervention that affect the expression of that gene.

1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:11.040
 What do pharmaceutical therapeutics look like when your understanding is on a genetic level?

1:22:11.040 --> 1:22:12.040
 Yeah.

1:22:12.040 --> 1:22:13.040
 Sorry if it's a dumb question.

1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:14.040
 No, no, no.

1:22:14.040 --> 1:22:16.440
 It's a brilliant question, but I want to save it for a little bit later when we start talking

1:22:16.440 --> 1:22:17.440
 about therapeutics.

1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:18.440
 Perfect.

1:22:18.440 --> 1:22:20.280
 So let's talk about the first four steps.

1:22:20.280 --> 1:22:21.600
 There's two more.

1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:25.600
 So basically the first step is figure out, I mean, the zero step, the starting point

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:26.760
 is the genetics.

1:22:26.760 --> 1:22:31.100
 The first step after that is figure out the tissue of action.

1:22:31.100 --> 1:22:36.920
 The second step is figuring out the nucleotide that is responsible or set of nucleotides.

1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:40.960
 The third step is figuring out the motif and the upstream regulator, number four.

1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:44.320
 Number five and six is what are the targets?

1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:45.800
 So number five is great.

1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:47.200
 Now I know the regulator.

1:22:47.200 --> 1:22:48.200
 I know the motif.

1:22:48.200 --> 1:22:51.460
 I know the tissue and I know the variant.

1:22:51.460 --> 1:22:53.400
 What does it actually do?

1:22:53.400 --> 1:22:59.240
 So you have to now trace it to the biological process and the genes that mediate that biological

1:22:59.240 --> 1:23:00.480
 process.

1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:05.400
 So knowing all of this can now allow you to find the target genes.

1:23:05.400 --> 1:23:06.400
 How?

1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:13.200
 By basically doing perturbation experiments or by looking at the folding of the epigenome

1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:19.440
 or by looking at the genetic impact of that genetic variant on the expression of genes.

1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:21.580
 And we use all three.

1:23:21.580 --> 1:23:22.800
 So let me go through them.

1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:26.360
 Basically one of them is physical links.

1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:29.920
 This is the folding of the genome onto itself.

1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:32.200
 How do you even figure out the folding?

1:23:32.200 --> 1:23:36.760
 It's a little bit of a tangent, but it's a super awesome technology.

1:23:36.760 --> 1:23:41.960
 Think of the genome as again, this massive packaging that we talked about of taking two

1:23:41.960 --> 1:23:48.960
 meters worth of DNA and putting it in something that's a million times smaller than two meters

1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:49.960
 worth of DNA.

1:23:49.960 --> 1:23:51.760
 That's a single cell.

1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:56.160
 You basically have this massive packaging and this packaging basically leads to the

1:23:56.160 --> 1:24:02.600
 chromosome being wrapped around in sort of tight, tight ways in ways, however, that are

1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:07.080
 functionally capable of being reopened and reclosed.

1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:15.000
 So I can then go in and figure out that folding by sort of chopping up the spaghetti soup,

1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:21.000
 putting glue and ligating the segments that were chopped up but nearby each other, and

1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:26.020
 then sequencing through these ligation events to figure out that this region of this chromosome,

1:24:26.020 --> 1:24:28.360
 that region of the chromosome were near each other.

1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:33.560
 That means they were interacting even though they were far away on the genome itself.

1:24:33.560 --> 1:24:42.500
 So that chopping up, sequencing and reglueing is basically giving you folds of the genome

1:24:42.500 --> 1:24:43.500
 that we call.

1:24:43.500 --> 1:24:44.500
 Sorry, can you backtrack?

1:24:44.500 --> 1:24:45.500
 Of course.

1:24:45.500 --> 1:24:50.600
 How does cutting it help you figure out which ones were close in the original folding?

1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:53.440
 So you have a bowl of noodles.

1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:54.760
 Go on.

1:24:54.760 --> 1:24:59.480
 And in that bowl of noodles, some noodles are near each other.

1:24:59.480 --> 1:25:00.480
 Yes.

1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:06.520
 So you throw in a bunch of glue, you basically freeze the noodles in place, throw in a cutter

1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:10.860
 that chops up the noodles into little pieces.

1:25:10.860 --> 1:25:18.040
 Now throw in some ligation enzyme that lets those pieces that were free religate near

1:25:18.040 --> 1:25:19.080
 each other.

1:25:19.080 --> 1:25:24.240
 In some cases, they religate what you had just cut, but that's very rare.

1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:30.320
 Most of the time they will religate in whatever was proximal.

1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:36.760
 You now have glued the red noodle that was crossing the blue noodle to each other.

1:25:36.760 --> 1:25:43.020
 You then reverse the glue, the glue goes away and you just sequence the heck out of it.

1:25:43.020 --> 1:25:48.640
 Most of the time you'll find red segment with, you know, red segment, but you can specifically

1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:52.640
 select for ligation events that have happened that were not from the same segment by sort

1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:57.360
 of marking them in a particular way and then selecting those and then you sequence and

1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:03.400
 you look for red with blue matches of sort of things that were glued that were not immediate

1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:05.520
 proximal to each other.

1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:08.640
 And that reveals the linking of the blue noodle and the red noodle.

1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:09.640
 You're with me so far?

1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:10.640
 Yeah.

1:26:10.640 --> 1:26:11.640
 Good.

1:26:11.640 --> 1:26:12.640
 So we've done these experiments.

1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:13.640
 That's the physical.

1:26:13.640 --> 1:26:14.640
 That's the physical.

1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:15.820
 That's step one of the physical.

1:26:15.820 --> 1:26:20.000
 And what the physical revealed is topologically associated domains, basically big blocks of

1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:25.040
 the genome that are topologically connected together.

1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:26.300
 That's the physical.

1:26:26.300 --> 1:26:30.060
 The second one is the genetic links.

1:26:30.060 --> 1:26:37.220
 It basically says across individuals that have different genetic variants, how are their

1:26:37.220 --> 1:26:39.400
 genes expressed differently?

1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:43.080
 Remember before I was saying that the path between genetics and disease is enormous,

1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:47.520
 but we can break it up to look at the path between genetics and gene expression.

1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:54.480
 So instead of using Alzheimer's as a phenotype, I can now use expression of IRX3 as the phenotype,

1:26:54.480 --> 1:27:01.160
 expression of gene A. And I can look at all of the humans who contain a G at that location

1:27:01.160 --> 1:27:05.360
 and all the humans that contain a T at that location and basically say, wow, it turns

1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:09.480
 out that the expression of each gene is higher for the T humans than for the G humans at

1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:10.660
 that location.

1:27:10.660 --> 1:27:16.560
 So that basically gives me a genetic link between a genetic variant, a locus, a region,

1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:19.960
 and the expression of nearby genes.

1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:20.960
 Good on the genetic link?

1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:21.960
 I think so.

1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:22.960
 Awesome.

1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:25.480
 The third genetic link is the activity link.

1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:26.480
 What's an activity link?

1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:34.320
 It basically says if I look across 833 different epigenomes, whenever this enhancer is active,

1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:36.040
 this gene is active.

1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:42.340
 That gives me an activity link between this region of the DNA and that gene.

1:27:42.340 --> 1:27:47.140
 And then the fourth one is perturbations where I can go in and blow up that region and see

1:27:47.140 --> 1:27:51.900
 what are the genes that change in expression, or I can go in and over activate that region

1:27:51.900 --> 1:27:55.120
 and see what genes change in expression.

1:27:55.120 --> 1:27:57.240
 So I guess that's similar to activity?

1:27:57.240 --> 1:27:58.240
 Yeah.

1:27:58.240 --> 1:27:59.240
 Yeah.

1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:00.240
 So that's basically similar to activity.

1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:02.760
 I agree, but it's causal rather than correlational.

1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:04.960
 Again, I'm a little weird.

1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:07.160
 No, no, you're 100% on.

1:28:07.160 --> 1:28:11.440
 It's exactly the same as the perturbation where I go in and intervene.

1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:13.800
 I basically take a bunch of cells.

1:28:13.800 --> 1:28:16.160
 So you know CRISPR, right?

1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:21.500
 CRISPR is this genome guidance and cutting mechanism.

1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:24.680
 That's what George Church likes to call genome vandalism.

1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:32.720
 So you basically are able to, you can basically take a guide RNA that you put into the CRISPR

1:28:32.720 --> 1:28:38.200
 system, and the CRISPR system will basically use this guide RNA, scan the genome, find

1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:42.560
 wherever there's a match, and then cut the genome.

1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:48.000
 So I digress, but it's a bacterial immune defense system.

1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:54.280
 So basically bacteria are constantly attacked by viruses, but sometimes they win against

1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:56.960
 the viruses and they chop up these viruses.

1:28:56.960 --> 1:29:02.800
 And remember as a trophy inside their genome, they have these loci, these CRISPR loci that

1:29:02.800 --> 1:29:06.400
 basically stands for clustered repeats, interspersed, et cetera.

1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:11.900
 So basically it's an interspersed repeats structure where basically you have a set of

1:29:11.900 --> 1:29:17.400
 repetitive regions and then interspersed where these variable segments that were basically

1:29:17.400 --> 1:29:19.600
 matching viruses.

1:29:19.600 --> 1:29:24.240
 So when this was first discovered, it was basically hypothesized that this is probably

1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:30.360
 a bacterial immune system that remembers the trophies of the viruses that managed to kill.

1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:34.720
 And then the bacteria pass on, you know, they sort of do lateral transfer of DNA and they

1:29:34.720 --> 1:29:39.120
 pass on these memories so that the next bacterium says, Ooh, you killed that guy.

1:29:39.120 --> 1:29:41.700
 When that guy shows up again, I will recognize him.

1:29:41.700 --> 1:29:47.320
 And the CRISPR system was basically evolved as a bacterial adaptive immune response to

1:29:47.320 --> 1:29:52.560
 sense foreigners that should not belong and to just go and cut their genome.

1:29:52.560 --> 1:30:00.280
 So it's an RNA guided RNA cutting enzyme or an RNA guided DNA cutting enzyme.

1:30:00.280 --> 1:30:02.240
 So there's different systems.

1:30:02.240 --> 1:30:08.620
 Some of them cut DNA, some of them cut RNA, but all of them remember this sort of viral

1:30:08.620 --> 1:30:10.660
 attack.

1:30:10.660 --> 1:30:15.920
 So what we have done now as a field is, you know, through the work of, you know, Jennifer

1:30:15.920 --> 1:30:23.240
 Donne, Manuel Carpentier, Feng Zhang and many others is coopted that system of bacterial

1:30:23.240 --> 1:30:26.520
 immune defense as a way to cut genomes.

1:30:26.520 --> 1:30:35.280
 You basically have this guiding system that allows you to use an RNA guide to bring enzymes

1:30:35.280 --> 1:30:37.760
 to cut DNA at a particular locus.

1:30:37.760 --> 1:30:39.240
 That's so fascinating.

1:30:39.240 --> 1:30:45.600
 So this is like already a natural mechanism, a natural tool for cutting those useful as

1:30:45.600 --> 1:30:46.600
 particular context.

1:30:46.600 --> 1:30:51.160
 And we're like, well, we can use that thing to actually, it's a nice tool that's already

1:30:51.160 --> 1:30:52.160
 in the body.

1:30:52.160 --> 1:30:53.160
 Yeah.

1:30:53.160 --> 1:30:54.160
 Yeah.

1:30:54.160 --> 1:30:55.160
 It's not in our body.

1:30:55.160 --> 1:30:56.160
 It's in the bacterial body.

1:30:56.160 --> 1:30:59.320
 It was discovered by the yogurt industry.

1:30:59.320 --> 1:31:03.640
 They were trying to make better yogurts and they were trying to make their bacteria in

1:31:03.640 --> 1:31:08.400
 their yogurt cultures more resilient to viruses.

1:31:08.400 --> 1:31:12.480
 And they were studying bacteria and they found that, wow, this CRISPR system is awesome.

1:31:12.480 --> 1:31:14.820
 It allows you to defend against that.

1:31:14.820 --> 1:31:20.600
 And then it was coopted in mammalian systems that don't use anything like that as a targeting

1:31:20.600 --> 1:31:25.800
 way to basically bring these DNA cutting enzymes to any locus in the genome.

1:31:25.800 --> 1:31:29.620
 Why would you want to cut DNA to do anything?

1:31:29.620 --> 1:31:35.040
 The reason is that our DNA has a DNA repair mechanism where if a region of the genome

1:31:35.040 --> 1:31:40.520
 gets randomly cut, you will basically scan the genome for anything that matches and sort

1:31:40.520 --> 1:31:43.480
 of use it by homology.

1:31:43.480 --> 1:31:47.240
 So the reason why we're deployed is because we now have a spare copy.

1:31:47.240 --> 1:31:50.640
 As soon as my mom's copy is deactivated, I can use my dad's copy.

1:31:50.640 --> 1:31:55.240
 And somewhere else, if my dad's copy is deactivated, I can use my mom's copy to repair it.

1:31:55.240 --> 1:31:59.720
 So this is called homologous based repair.

1:31:59.720 --> 1:32:04.080
 So all you have to do is the cutting and you don't have to do the fixing.

1:32:04.080 --> 1:32:05.080
 That's exactly right.

1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:06.080
 You don't have to do the fixing.

1:32:06.080 --> 1:32:07.320
 Because it's already built in.

1:32:07.320 --> 1:32:08.560
 That's exactly right.

1:32:08.560 --> 1:32:14.720
 But the fixing can be coopted by throwing in a bunch of homologous segments that instead

1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:19.960
 of having your dad's version, have whatever other version you'd like to use.

1:32:19.960 --> 1:32:24.040
 So you then control the fixing by throwing in a bunch of other stuff.

1:32:24.040 --> 1:32:25.040
 That's exactly right.

1:32:25.040 --> 1:32:26.440
 And that's how you do genome editing.

1:32:26.440 --> 1:32:27.880
 So that's what CRISPR is.

1:32:27.880 --> 1:32:28.880
 That's what CRISPR is.

1:32:28.880 --> 1:32:30.840
 In popular culture, people use the term.

1:32:30.840 --> 1:32:32.640
 I've never, wow, that's brilliant.

1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:39.080
 So CRISPR is genome vandalism followed by a bunch of band aids that have the sequence

1:32:39.080 --> 1:32:40.080
 that you'd like.

1:32:40.080 --> 1:32:43.000
 And you could control the choices of band aids.

1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:44.000
 Correct.

1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:46.360
 And of course there's new generations of CRISPR.

1:32:46.360 --> 1:32:50.880
 There's something that's called prime editing that was sort of very, very much in the press

1:32:50.880 --> 1:32:55.360
 recently that basically instead of sort of making a double stranded break, which again

1:32:55.360 --> 1:33:00.820
 is genome vandalism, you basically make a single stranded break.

1:33:00.820 --> 1:33:06.640
 You basically just nick one of the two strands, enabling you to sort of peel off without sort

1:33:06.640 --> 1:33:13.280
 of completely breaking it up and then repair it locally using a guide that is coupled to

1:33:13.280 --> 1:33:18.600
 your initial RNA that took you to that location.

1:33:18.600 --> 1:33:24.000
 Dumb question, but is CRISPR as awesome and cool as it sounds?

1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:31.820
 I mean, technically speaking, in terms of like as a tool for manipulating our genetics

1:33:31.820 --> 1:33:39.040
 in the positive meaning of the word manipulating, or is there downsides, drawbacks in this whole

1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:42.920
 context of therapeutics that we're talking about or understanding and so on?

1:33:42.920 --> 1:33:50.040
 So when I teach my students about CRISPR, I show them articles with the headline, genome

1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:53.120
 editing tool revolutionizes biology.

1:33:53.120 --> 1:33:58.360
 And then I show them the date of these articles and they're 2004, like five years before CRISPR

1:33:58.360 --> 1:33:59.760
 was invented.

1:33:59.760 --> 1:34:02.360
 And the reason is that they're not talking about CRISPR.

1:34:02.360 --> 1:34:07.520
 They're talking about zinc finger enzymes that are another way to bring these cutters

1:34:07.520 --> 1:34:09.040
 to the genome.

1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:13.880
 It's a very difficult way of sort of designing the right set of zinc finger proteins, the

1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:20.280
 right set of amino acids that will now target a particular long stretch of DNA because for

1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:25.760
 every location that you want to target, you need to design a particular regulator, a particular

1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:28.800
 protein that will match that region well.

1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:35.240
 There's another technology called talons, which are basically just a different way of

1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:41.440
 using proteins to sort of guide these cutters to a particular location of the genome.

1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:46.520
 These require a massive team of engineers, of biological engineers to basically design

1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:51.480
 a set of amino acids that will target a particular sequence of your genome.

1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:57.080
 The reason why CRISPR is amazingly, awesomely revolutionary is because instead of having

1:34:57.080 --> 1:35:02.200
 this team of engineers design a new set of proteins for every locus that you want to

1:35:02.200 --> 1:35:07.680
 target, you just type it in your computer and you just synthesize an RNA guide.

1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:11.100
 The beauty of CRISPR is not the cutting, it's not the fixing.

1:35:11.100 --> 1:35:12.880
 All of that was there before.

1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:17.880
 It's the guiding, and the only thing that changes is that it makes the guiding easier

1:35:17.880 --> 1:35:23.940
 by sort of just typing in the RNA sequence, which then allows the system to sort of scan

1:35:23.940 --> 1:35:25.880
 the DNA to find that.

1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:32.280
 So the coding, the engineering of the cutter is easier in terms of SP.

1:35:32.280 --> 1:35:37.200
 That's kind of similar to the story of deep learning versus old school machine learning.

1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:41.080
 Some of the challenging parts are automated.

1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:47.180
 But CRISPR is just one cutting technology, and then that's part of the challenges and

1:35:47.180 --> 1:35:53.020
 exciting opportunities of the field is to design different cutting technologies.

1:35:53.020 --> 1:36:00.840
 So now this was a big parenthesis on CRISPR, but now when we were talking about perturbations,

1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:04.720
 you basically now have the ability to not just look at correlation between enhancers

1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:10.760
 and genes, but actually go and either destroy that enhancer and see if the gene changes

1:36:10.760 --> 1:36:20.000
 in expression, or you can use the CRISPR targeting system to bring in not vandalism and cutting,

1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:26.720
 but you can couple the CRISPR system with, and the CRISPR system is called usually CRISPR

1:36:26.720 --> 1:36:30.920
 Cas9 because Cas9 is the protein that will then come and cut.

1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:36.760
 But there's a version of that protein called dead Cas9 where the cutting part is deactivated.

1:36:36.760 --> 1:36:45.040
 So you basically use the dead Cas9 to bring in an activator or to bring in a repressor.

1:36:45.040 --> 1:36:51.920
 So you can now ask, is this enhancer changing that gene by taking this modified CRISPR,

1:36:51.920 --> 1:36:55.560
 which is already modified from the bacteria to be used in humans, that you can now modify

1:36:55.560 --> 1:37:01.120
 the Cas9 to be dead Cas9, and you can now further modify to bring in a regulator, and

1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:05.000
 you can basically turn on or turn off that enhancer and then see what is the impact on

1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:06.620
 that gene.

1:37:06.620 --> 1:37:11.840
 So these are the four ways of linking the locus to the target gene, and that's step

1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:14.240
 number five.

1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:17.960
 Step number five is find the target gene, and step number six is what the heck does

1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:19.560
 that gene do?

1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:25.840
 You basically now go and manipulate that gene to basically see what are the processes that

1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:32.400
 change, and you can basically ask, well, in this particular case, in the FTO locus, we

1:37:32.400 --> 1:37:38.160
 found mesenchymal stem cells that are the progenitors of white fat and brown fat or

1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:39.580
 beige fat.

1:37:39.580 --> 1:37:44.880
 We found the RS1421085 nucleotide variant as the causal variant.

1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:49.720
 We found this large enhancer, this master regulator.

1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:55.720
 I like to call it OB1 for obesity one, like the strongest enhancer associated with it,

1:37:55.720 --> 1:37:57.120
 and OB1 was kind of chubby as the actor.

1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:01.120
 I don't know if you remember him.

1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:07.320
 So you basically are using this Jedi mind trick to basically find out the location of

1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:14.120
 the genome that is responsible, the enhancer that harbors it, the motif, the upstream regulator,

1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:18.200
 which is ARID5B for AT rich interacting domain 5B.

1:38:18.200 --> 1:38:21.040
 That's a protein that sort of comes and binds normally.

1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:23.220
 That protein is normally a repressor.

1:38:23.220 --> 1:38:28.520
 It represses this super enhancer, this massive 12,000 nucleotide master regulatory control

1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:36.120
 gene, and it turns off IRX3, which is a gene that's 600,000 nucleotides away, and IRX5,

1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:38.480
 which is 1.2 million nucleotides away.

1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:39.480
 So those things.

1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:40.760
 And what's the effect of turning them off?

1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:42.320
 That's exactly the next question.

1:38:42.320 --> 1:38:45.520
 So step six is what do these genes actually do?

1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:48.640
 So we then ask, what does RX3 and RX5 do?

1:38:48.640 --> 1:38:52.940
 The first thing we did is look across individuals for individuals that had higher expression

1:38:52.940 --> 1:38:55.520
 of RX3 or lower expression RX3.

1:38:55.520 --> 1:38:58.960
 And then we looked at the expression of all of the other genes in the genome.

1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:01.580
 And we looked for simply correlation.

1:39:01.580 --> 1:39:09.820
 And we found that RX3 and RX5 were both correlated positively with lipid metabolism and negatively

1:39:09.820 --> 1:39:11.800
 with mitochondrial biogenesis.

1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:16.400
 You're like, what the heck does that mean?

1:39:16.400 --> 1:39:18.120
 Does this sound related to obesity?

1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:25.500
 Not at all superficially, but lipid metabolism should, because lipids is these high and

1:39:25.500 --> 1:39:28.560
 energy molecules that basically store fat.

1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:33.760
 So RX3 and RX5 are negatively correlated with lipid metabolism.

1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:39.000
 So that basically means that when they turn on, positively, when they turn on, they turn

1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.280
 on lipid metabolism.

1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:45.920
 And they're negatively correlated with mitochondrial biogenesis.

1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:49.160
 What do mitochondria do in this whole process?

1:39:49.160 --> 1:39:53.280
 Again, small parenthesis, what are mitochondria?

1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:56.360
 Mitochondria are little organelles.

1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:01.120
 They arose, they only are found in eukaryotes.

1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:04.000
 U means good, karyote means nucleus.

1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:05.920
 So truly like a true nucleus.

1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:07.880
 So eukaryotes have a nucleus.

1:40:07.880 --> 1:40:09.960
 Prokaryotes are before the nucleus.

1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:11.280
 They don't have a nucleus.

1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:16.840
 So eukaryotes have a nucleus, compartmentalization.

1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:19.680
 Eukaryotes have also organelles.

1:40:19.680 --> 1:40:22.800
 Some eukaryotes have chloroplasts.

1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:26.480
 These are the plants, they photosynthesize.

1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:33.480
 Some other eukaryotes like us have another type of organelle called mitochondria.

1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:40.360
 These arose from an ancient species that we engulfed.

1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:44.360
 This is an endosymbiosis event.

1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:47.320
 Symbiosis bio means life, sim means together.

1:40:47.320 --> 1:40:50.800
 So symbiotes are things that live together.

1:40:50.800 --> 1:40:54.240
 Symbiosis endo means inside, so endosymbiosis means you live together holding the other

1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:56.120
 one inside you.

1:40:56.120 --> 1:41:07.240
 So the pre eukaryotes engulfed an organism that was very good at energy production and

1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:14.200
 that organism eventually shed most of its genome to now have only 13 genes in the mitochondrial

1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:22.400
 genome and those 13 genes are all involved in energy production, the electron transport

1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:23.400
 chain.

1:41:23.400 --> 1:41:28.560
 So basically electrons are these massive super energy rich molecules.

1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:35.760
 We basically have these organelles that produce energy and when your muscle exercises, you

1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:37.800
 basically multiply your mitochondria.

1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:42.960
 You basically sort of, you know, use more and more mitochondria and that's how you get

1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:43.960
 beefed up.

1:41:43.960 --> 1:41:47.840
 So basically the muscle sort of learns how to generate more energy.

1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:51.680
 So basically every single time your muscles will, you know, overnight regenerate and sort

1:41:51.680 --> 1:41:55.240
 of become stronger and amplify their mitochondria and so forth.

1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:56.480
 So what does mitochondria do?

1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:02.200
 The mitochondria use energy to sort of do any kind of task.

1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:05.000
 When you're thinking, you're using energy.

1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:06.960
 This energy comes from mitochondria.

1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:10.040
 Your neurons have mitochondria all over the place.

1:42:10.040 --> 1:42:13.340
 Basically this mitochondria can multiply as organelles and they can be spread along the

1:42:13.340 --> 1:42:15.040
 body of your muscle.

1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:18.840
 Some of your muscle cells have actually multiple nuclei, they're polynucleated, but they also

1:42:18.840 --> 1:42:24.380
 have multiple mitochondria to basically deal with the fact that your muscle is enormous.

1:42:24.380 --> 1:42:28.040
 You can sort of span these super, super long length and you need energy throughout the

1:42:28.040 --> 1:42:29.360
 length of your muscle.

1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:32.340
 So that's why you have mitochondria throughout the length and you also need transcription

1:42:32.340 --> 1:42:35.080
 through the length so you have multiple nuclei as well.

1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:42.060
 So these two processes, lipids store energy, what do mitochondria do?

1:42:42.060 --> 1:42:46.040
 So there's a process known as thermogenesis.

1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:48.520
 Thermal heat, genesis generation.

1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:50.600
 Thermogenesis is the generation of heat.

1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:55.160
 Remember that bathtub with the in and out?

1:42:55.160 --> 1:42:57.160
 That's the equation that everybody's focused on.

1:42:57.160 --> 1:42:58.860
 So how much energy do you consume?

1:42:58.860 --> 1:43:01.000
 How much energy do you burn?

1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:06.060
 But in every thermodynamic system, there's three parts to the equation.

1:43:06.060 --> 1:43:10.900
 There's energy in, energy out, and energy lost.

1:43:10.900 --> 1:43:14.680
 Any machine has loss of energy.

1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:15.720
 How do you lose energy?

1:43:15.720 --> 1:43:17.600
 You emanate heat.

1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:20.000
 So heat is energy loss.

1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:24.760
 So there's...

1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:26.600
 Which is where the thermogenesis comes in.

1:43:26.600 --> 1:43:32.240
 Thermogenesis is actually a regulatory process that modulates the third component of the

1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:34.060
 thermodynamic equation.

1:43:34.060 --> 1:43:37.240
 You can basically control thermogenesis explicitly.

1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:39.080
 You can turn on and turn off thermogenesis.

1:43:39.080 --> 1:43:41.400
 And that's where the mitochondria comes into play.

1:43:41.400 --> 1:43:42.400
 Exactly.

1:43:42.400 --> 1:43:49.600
 So Irix3 and RX5 turn out to be the master regulators of a process of thermogenesis versus

1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:52.360
 lipogenesis generation of fat.

1:43:52.360 --> 1:43:58.720
 So Irix3 and RX5 in most people burn heat, burn calories as heat.

1:43:58.720 --> 1:44:02.720
 So when you eat too much, just burn it off in your fat cells.

1:44:02.720 --> 1:44:11.140
 So that bathtub has basically a sort of dissipation knob that most people are able to turn on.

1:44:11.140 --> 1:44:17.720
 I am unable to turn that on because I am a homozygous carrier for the mutation that changes

1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:24.560
 a T into a C in the RS1421085 allele and locus, a SNP.

1:44:24.560 --> 1:44:28.320
 I have the risk allele twice from my mom and from my dad.

1:44:28.320 --> 1:44:31.880
 So I'm unable to thermogenize.

1:44:31.880 --> 1:44:37.320
 I'm unable to turn on thermogenesis through Irix3 and RX5 because the regulator that normally

1:44:37.320 --> 1:44:42.720
 binds here, Irix5b, can no longer bind because it's an AT rich interacting domain.

1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:46.440
 And as soon as I change the T into a C, it can no longer bind because it's no longer

1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:47.440
 AT rich.

1:44:47.440 --> 1:44:52.280
 But doesn't that mean that you're able to use the energy more efficiently?

1:44:52.280 --> 1:44:54.120
 You're not generating heat or is that?

1:44:54.120 --> 1:44:56.920
 That means I can eat less and get around just fine.

1:44:56.920 --> 1:44:57.920
 Yes.

1:44:57.920 --> 1:44:58.920
 Yeah.

1:44:58.920 --> 1:44:59.920
 So that's a feature actually.

1:44:59.920 --> 1:45:02.040
 It's a feature in a food scarce environment.

1:45:02.040 --> 1:45:03.040
 Yeah.

1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:05.160
 But if we're all starving, I'm doing great.

1:45:05.160 --> 1:45:09.360
 If we all have access to massive amounts of food, I'm obese basically.

1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:14.920
 That's taken us to the entire process of then understanding that why mitochondria and then

1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:18.600
 the lipids are both, even though distant, are somehow involved.

1:45:18.600 --> 1:45:20.760
 Different sides of the same coin.

1:45:20.760 --> 1:45:24.000
 And you basically choose to store energy or you can choose to burn energy.

1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:27.800
 And then all of that is involved in the puzzle of obesity.

1:45:27.800 --> 1:45:29.760
 And that's what's fascinating, right?

1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:35.360
 Here we are in 2007, discovering the strongest genetic association with obesity and knowing

1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:39.460
 nothing about how it works for almost 10 years.

1:45:39.460 --> 1:45:43.840
 For 10 years, everybody focused on this FTO gene and they were like, oh, it must have

1:45:43.840 --> 1:45:46.240
 to do something with RNA modification.

1:45:46.240 --> 1:45:50.760
 And it's like, no, it has nothing to do with the function of FTO.

1:45:50.760 --> 1:45:53.880
 It has everything to do with all of these other processes.

1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:58.680
 And suddenly the moment you solve that puzzle, which is a multiyear effort by the way, a

1:45:58.680 --> 1:46:01.880
 tremendous effort by Melina and many, many others.

1:46:01.880 --> 1:46:07.160
 So this tremendous effort basically led us to recognize this circuitry.

1:46:07.160 --> 1:46:12.500
 You went from having some 89 common variants associated in that region of the DNA sitting

1:46:12.500 --> 1:46:17.840
 on top of this gene to knowing the whole circuitry.

1:46:17.840 --> 1:46:21.160
 When you know the circuitry, you can now go crazy.

1:46:21.160 --> 1:46:24.480
 You can now start intervening at every level.

1:46:24.480 --> 1:46:27.240
 You can start intervening at the arid 5B level.

1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:31.280
 You can start intervening with CRISPR Cas9 at the single SNP level.

1:46:31.280 --> 1:46:34.860
 You can start intervening at iRx3 and iRx5 directly there.

1:46:34.860 --> 1:46:38.400
 You can start intervening at the thermogenesis level because you know the pathway.

1:46:38.400 --> 1:46:45.280
 You can start intervening at the differentiation level where the decision to make either white

1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:51.500
 fat or beige fat, the energy burning beige fat is made developmentally in the first three

1:46:51.500 --> 1:46:54.040
 days of differentiation of your adipocytes.

1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:57.720
 So as they're differentiating, you basically can choose to make fat burning machines or

1:46:57.720 --> 1:46:59.320
 fat storing machines.

1:46:59.320 --> 1:47:02.320
 And sort of that's how you populate your fat.

1:47:02.320 --> 1:47:05.880
 You basically can now go in pharmaceutical and do all of that.

1:47:05.880 --> 1:47:09.400
 And in our paper, we actually did all of that.

1:47:09.400 --> 1:47:12.320
 We went in and manipulated every single aspect.

1:47:12.320 --> 1:47:18.200
 At the nucleotide level, we use CRISPR Cas9 genome editing to basically take primary adipocytes

1:47:18.200 --> 1:47:24.080
 from risk and non risk individuals and show that by editing that one nucleotide out of

1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:29.600
 3.2 billion nucleotides in the human genome, you could then flip between an obese phenotype

1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:31.500
 and a lean phenotype like a switch.

1:47:31.500 --> 1:47:36.240
 You can basically take my cells that are non thermogenizing and just flip into thermogenizing

1:47:36.240 --> 1:47:38.640
 cells by changing one nucleotide.

1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:40.080
 It's mind boggling.

1:47:40.080 --> 1:47:44.880
 It's so inspiring that this puzzle could be solved in this way and it feels within reach

1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:50.560
 to then be able to crack the problem of some of these diseases.

1:47:50.560 --> 1:48:00.480
 What are the technologies, the tools that came along that made this possible?

1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:01.980
 What are you excited about?

1:48:01.980 --> 1:48:08.080
 Maybe if we just look at the buffet of things that you've kind of mentioned, what's involved?

1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:09.520
 What should we be excited about?

1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:11.460
 What are you excited about?

1:48:11.460 --> 1:48:14.040
 I love that question because there's so much ahead of us.

1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:18.600
 There's so, so much.

1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:24.000
 So basically solving that one locus required massive amounts of knowledge that we have

1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:28.220
 been building across the years through the epigenome, through the comparative genomics

1:48:28.220 --> 1:48:35.400
 to find out the causal variant and the controller regulatory motif through the conserved circuitry.

1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:38.580
 It required knowing these regulatory genomic wiring.

1:48:38.580 --> 1:48:42.980
 It required high C of these sort of topologically associated domains to basically find these

1:48:42.980 --> 1:48:44.600
 long range interaction.

1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:51.160
 It required EQTLs of these sort of genetic perturbation of these intermediate gene phenotypes.

1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:55.640
 It required all of the arsenal of tools that I've been describing was put together for

1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:57.240
 one locus.

1:48:57.240 --> 1:49:05.840
 And this was a massive team effort, huge investment in time, energy, money, effort, intellectual,

1:49:05.840 --> 1:49:06.840
 everything.

1:49:06.840 --> 1:49:09.640
 You're referring to, I'm sorry, just for the obesity one.

1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:10.640
 Yeah, this one paper.

1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:11.640
 This one single paper.

1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:12.640
 This one single locus.

1:49:12.640 --> 1:49:16.640
 I would like to say that this is a paper about one nucleotide in the human genome, about

1:49:16.640 --> 1:49:20.560
 one bit of information, C versus T in the human genome.

1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:25.320
 That's one bit of information and we have 3.2 billion nucleotides to go through.

1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:29.240
 So how do you do that systematically?

1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:35.000
 I am so excited about the next phase of research because the technologies that my group and

1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:40.080
 many other groups have developed allows us to now do this systematically, not just one

1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:45.120
 locus at a time, but thousands of loci at a time.

1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:48.000
 So let me describe some of these technologies.

1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:52.420
 The first one is automation and robotics.

1:49:52.420 --> 1:49:58.240
 So basically, you know, we talked about how you can take all of these molecules and see

1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:02.200
 which of these molecules are targeting each of these genes and what do they do?

1:50:02.200 --> 1:50:07.700
 So you can basically now screen through millions of molecules through thousands and thousands

1:50:07.700 --> 1:50:12.880
 and thousands of plates, each of which has thousands and thousands and thousands of molecules,

1:50:12.880 --> 1:50:20.560
 every single time testing, you know, all of these genes and asking which of these molecules

1:50:20.560 --> 1:50:22.000
 perturb these genes.

1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:25.880
 So that's technology number one, automation and robotics.

1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:29.280
 Technology number two is parallel readouts.

1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:35.880
 So instead of perturbing one locus and then asking if I use CRISPR Cas9 on this enhancer

1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:41.280
 to basically use dCas9 to turn on or turn off the enhancer, or if I use CRISPR Cas9

1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:46.620
 on the SNP to basically change that one SNP at a time, then what happens?

1:50:46.620 --> 1:50:52.760
 But we have 120,000 disease associated SNPs that we want to test.

1:50:52.760 --> 1:50:57.220
 We don't want to spend 120,000 years doing it.

1:50:57.220 --> 1:50:58.920
 So what do we do?

1:50:58.920 --> 1:51:07.240
 We've basically developed this technology for massively parallel reporter assays, MPRA.

1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:11.240
 So in collaboration with Tarsha Mikkelsen, Eric Lander, I mean, Jason Durie's group has

1:51:11.240 --> 1:51:12.240
 done a lot of that.

1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:19.380
 So there's a lot of groups that basically have developed technologies for testing 10,000

1:51:19.380 --> 1:51:21.420
 genetic variants at a time.

1:51:21.420 --> 1:51:23.000
 How do you do that?

1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:28.880
 You know, we talked about microarray technology, the ability to synthesize these huge microarrays

1:51:28.880 --> 1:51:33.880
 that allow you to do all kinds of things like measure gene expression by hybridization,

1:51:33.880 --> 1:51:38.100
 by measuring the genotype of a person, by looking at hybridization with one version

1:51:38.100 --> 1:51:43.400
 with a T versus the other version with a C, and then sort of figuring out that I am a

1:51:43.400 --> 1:51:49.820
 risk carrier for obesity based on these differential hybridization in my genome that says, oh,

1:51:49.820 --> 1:51:53.320
 you seem to only have this allele or you seem to have that allele.

1:51:53.320 --> 1:51:59.400
 These can also be used to systematically synthesize small fragments of DNA.

1:51:59.400 --> 1:52:07.800
 So you can basically synthesize these 150 nucleotide long fragments across 450,000 spots

1:52:07.800 --> 1:52:10.240
 at a time.

1:52:10.240 --> 1:52:15.820
 You can now take the result of that synthesis, which basically works through all of these

1:52:15.820 --> 1:52:18.760
 sort of layers of adding one nucleotide at a time.

1:52:18.760 --> 1:52:24.000
 You can basically just type it into your computer and order it, and you can basically order

1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:30.740
 10,000 or 100,000 of these small DNA segments at a time.

1:52:30.740 --> 1:52:33.360
 And that's where awesome molecular biology comes in.

1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:38.840
 You can basically take all these segments, have a common start and end barcode or sort

1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:42.120
 of like Gator, just like pieces of a puzzle.

1:52:42.120 --> 1:52:48.000
 You can make the same end piece and the same start piece for all of them.

1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:57.960
 And you can now use plasmids, which are these extra chromosomal small DNA circular segments

1:52:57.960 --> 1:53:00.560
 that are basically inhabiting all our, all our genomes.

1:53:00.560 --> 1:53:05.200
 We basically have, you know, plasmids from floating around and bacteria use plasmids

1:53:05.200 --> 1:53:07.060
 for transferring DNA.

1:53:07.060 --> 1:53:10.720
 And that's where they put a lot of antibiotic resistance genes.

1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:14.200
 So they can easily transfer them from one bacterium to the other.

1:53:14.200 --> 1:53:20.280
 After one bacterium evolves a gene to be resistant to a particular antibiotic, it basically says

1:53:20.280 --> 1:53:24.760
 to all its friends, Hey, here's that sort of DNA piece.

1:53:24.760 --> 1:53:28.440
 We can now coopt these plasmids into human cells.

1:53:28.440 --> 1:53:34.000
 You can basically make a human cell culture and add plasmids to that human cell culture

1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:38.120
 that contain the things that you want to test.

1:53:38.120 --> 1:53:41.320
 You now have this library of 450,000 elements.

1:53:41.320 --> 1:53:47.880
 You can insert them each into the common plasmid and then test them in millions of cells in

1:53:47.880 --> 1:53:48.880
 parallel.

1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:51.160
 And the common plasmid is all the same before you add it.

1:53:51.160 --> 1:53:52.160
 Exactly.

1:53:52.160 --> 1:53:53.300
 The rest of the plasmid is the same.

1:53:53.300 --> 1:53:57.640
 So it's, it's called an epizomal reporter assay.

1:53:57.640 --> 1:53:59.720
 Epizome means not inside the genome.

1:53:59.720 --> 1:54:01.560
 It's sort of outside the chromosomes.

1:54:01.560 --> 1:54:06.200
 So it's an epizomal assay that allows you to have a variable region where you basically

1:54:06.200 --> 1:54:11.720
 test 10,000 different enhancers and you have a common region which basically has the same

1:54:11.720 --> 1:54:13.720
 reporter gene.

1:54:13.720 --> 1:54:16.600
 You now can do some very cool molecular biology.

1:54:16.600 --> 1:54:21.960
 You can basically take the 450,000 elements that you've generated and you have a piece

1:54:21.960 --> 1:54:24.440
 of the puzzle here, piece of the puzzle here, which is identical.

1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:27.060
 So they're compatible with that plasmid.

1:54:27.060 --> 1:54:32.840
 You can chop them up in the middle to separate a barcode reporter from the enhancer and in

1:54:32.840 --> 1:54:36.920
 the middle put the same gene again using the same piece of the puzzle.

1:54:36.920 --> 1:54:42.960
 You now can have a barcode readout of what is the impact of 10,000 different versions

1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:46.600
 of an enhancer on gene expression.

1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:50.680
 So we're not doing one experiment, we're doing 10,000 experiments.

1:54:50.680 --> 1:54:58.580
 And those 10,000 can be 5,000 of different loci and each of them in two versions, risk

1:54:58.580 --> 1:55:00.260
 or non risk.

1:55:00.260 --> 1:55:01.920
 I can now test tens of thousands.

1:55:01.920 --> 1:55:02.920
 Just a little hypothesis.

1:55:02.920 --> 1:55:03.920
 Exactly.

1:55:03.920 --> 1:55:08.880
 And then you can do 10,000 and we can test 10,000 hypothesis at once.

1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:11.360
 How hard is it to generate those 10,000?

1:55:11.360 --> 1:55:12.360
 Trivial.

1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:13.360
 Trivial.

1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:14.360
 But it's biology.

1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:15.360
 No, no.

1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:20.740
 Generating the 10,000 is trivial because you basically add, it's biotechnology.

1:55:20.740 --> 1:55:26.560
 You basically have these arrays that add one nucleotide at a time at every spot.

1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:30.680
 So it's printing and so you're able to, you're able to control.

1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:31.680
 Yeah.

1:55:31.680 --> 1:55:32.800
 Is it super costly?

1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:33.800
 Is it?

1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:34.800
 10,000 bucks.

1:55:34.800 --> 1:55:35.800
 So this isn't millions.

1:55:35.800 --> 1:55:39.200
 10,000 bucks for 10,000 experiments sounds like the right, you know.

1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:44.100
 I mean, so that's super, that's exciting because you don't have to do one thing at a time.

1:55:44.100 --> 1:55:49.280
 You can now use that technology, these massively parallel reporter assays to test 10,000 locations

1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:51.440
 at a time.

1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:55.160
 We've made multiple modifications to that technology.

1:55:55.160 --> 1:56:04.080
 One was sharper MPRA, which stands for, you know, basically getting a higher resolution

1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:14.800
 view by tiling these, these elements so you can see where along the region of control

1:56:14.800 --> 1:56:16.140
 are they acting.

1:56:16.140 --> 1:56:23.240
 And we made another modification called Hydra for high, you know, definition regulatory

1:56:23.240 --> 1:56:30.080
 annotation or something like that, which basically allows you to test 7 million of these at a

1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:32.960
 time by sort of cutting them directly from the DNA.

1:56:32.960 --> 1:56:37.420
 So instead of synthesizing, which basically has the limit of 450,000 that you can synthesize

1:56:37.420 --> 1:56:42.600
 at a time, we basically said, Hey, if we want to test all accessible regions of the genome,

1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:45.620
 let's just do an experiment that cuts accessible regions.

1:56:45.620 --> 1:56:51.520
 Let's take those accessible regions, put them all with the same end joints of the puzzles,

1:56:51.520 --> 1:56:59.680
 and then now use those to create a much, much larger array of things that you can test.

1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:04.160
 And then tiling all of these regions, you can then pinpoint what are the driver nucleotides,

1:57:04.160 --> 1:57:07.520
 what are the elements, how are they acting across 7 million experiments at a time.

1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:12.580
 So basically this is all the same family of technology where you're basically using these

1:57:12.580 --> 1:57:15.900
 parallel readouts of the barcodes.

1:57:15.900 --> 1:57:23.240
 And then to do this, we used a technology called StarSeq for self transcribing reporter

1:57:23.240 --> 1:57:30.140
 assays, a technology developed by Alex Stark, my former postdoc, who's now API over in Vienna.

1:57:30.140 --> 1:57:37.240
 So we basically coupled the StarSeq, the self transcribing reporters where the enhancer

1:57:37.240 --> 1:57:39.040
 can be part of the gene itself.

1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:43.600
 So instead of having a separate barcode, that enhancer basically acts to turn on the gene

1:57:43.600 --> 1:57:46.080
 and it's transcribed as part of the gene.

1:57:46.080 --> 1:57:47.640
 So you don't have to have the two separate parts.

1:57:47.640 --> 1:57:48.640
 Exactly.

1:57:48.640 --> 1:57:49.640
 So you can just read them directly.

1:57:49.640 --> 1:57:52.680
 So there's a constant improvements in this whole process.

1:57:52.680 --> 1:57:57.160
 By the way, generating all these options, is it basically brute force?

1:57:57.160 --> 1:57:58.680
 How much human intuition is?

1:57:58.680 --> 1:58:04.040
 Oh gosh, of course it's human intuition and human creativity and incorporating all of

1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:06.040
 the input data sets.

1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:08.440
 Because again, the genome is enormous.

1:58:08.440 --> 1:58:11.040
 3.2 billion, you don't want to test that.

1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:14.280
 You basically use all of these tools that I've talked about already.

1:58:14.280 --> 1:58:19.920
 You generate your top favorite 10,000 hypothesis, and then you go and test all 10,000.

1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:24.080
 And then from what comes out, you can then go to the next step.

1:58:24.080 --> 1:58:25.920
 So that's technology number two.

1:58:25.920 --> 1:58:30.440
 So technology number one is robotics, automation, where you have thousands of wells and you

1:58:30.440 --> 1:58:32.140
 constantly test them.

1:58:32.140 --> 1:58:37.320
 The second technology is instead of having wells, you have these massively parallel readouts

1:58:37.320 --> 1:58:40.000
 in sort of these pooled assays.

1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:51.260
 The third technology is coupling CRISPR perturbations with these single cell RNA readouts.

1:58:51.260 --> 1:58:57.880
 So let me make another parenthesis here to describe now single cell RNA sequencing.

1:58:57.880 --> 1:58:59.720
 So what does single cell RNA sequencing mean?

1:58:59.720 --> 1:59:07.760
 So RNA sequencing is what has been traditionally used, well, traditionally the last 20 years,

1:59:07.760 --> 1:59:10.200
 ever since the advent of next generation sequencing.

1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:14.620
 So basically before RNA expression profiling was based on these microarrays.

1:59:14.620 --> 1:59:17.500
 The next technology after that was based on sequencing.

1:59:17.500 --> 1:59:22.840
 So you chop up your RNA and you just sequence small molecules, just like you would sequence

1:59:22.840 --> 1:59:28.040
 a genome, basically reverse transcribe the small RNAs into DNA, and you sequence that

1:59:28.040 --> 1:59:35.600
 DNA in order to get the number of sequencing reads corresponding to the expression level

1:59:35.600 --> 1:59:37.480
 of every gene in the genome.

1:59:37.480 --> 1:59:39.680
 You now have RNA sequencing.

1:59:39.680 --> 1:59:42.520
 How do you go to single cell RNA sequencing?

1:59:42.520 --> 1:59:45.880
 That technology also went through stages of evolution.

1:59:45.880 --> 1:59:48.120
 The first was microfluidics.

1:59:48.120 --> 1:59:52.940
 You basically had these, or even chambers, you basically had these ways of isolating

1:59:52.940 --> 1:59:57.320
 individual cells, putting them into a well for every one of these cells.

1:59:57.320 --> 2:00:03.280
 So you have 384 well plates and you now do 384 parallel reactions to measure the expression

2:00:03.280 --> 2:00:05.660
 of 384 cells.

2:00:05.660 --> 2:00:11.320
 That sounds amazing and it was amazing, but we want to do a million cells.

2:00:11.320 --> 2:00:14.120
 How do you go from these wells to a million cells?

2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:15.640
 You can't.

2:00:15.640 --> 2:00:21.660
 So what the next technology was after that is instead of using a well for every reaction,

2:00:21.660 --> 2:00:26.280
 you now use a lipid droplet for every reaction.

2:00:26.280 --> 2:00:33.660
 So you use micro droplets as reaction chambers to basically amplify RNA.

2:00:33.660 --> 2:00:34.660
 So here's the idea.

2:00:34.660 --> 2:00:39.280
 You basically have microfluidics where you basically have every single cell coming down

2:00:39.280 --> 2:00:44.040
 one tube in your microfluidics and you have little bubbles getting created in the other

2:00:44.040 --> 2:00:49.360
 way with specific primers that mark every cell with its own barcode.

2:00:49.360 --> 2:00:55.040
 You basically couple the two and you end up with little bubbles that have a cell and tons

2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:57.400
 of markers for that cell.

2:00:57.400 --> 2:01:03.880
 You now mark up all of the RNA for that one cell with the same exact barcode and you then

2:01:03.880 --> 2:01:09.360
 lyse all of the droplets and you sequence the heck out of that and you have for every

2:01:09.360 --> 2:01:12.880
 RNA molecule, a unique identifier that tells you what cell was it on.

2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:20.840
 That is such good engineering, microfluidics and using some kind of primer to put a label

2:01:20.840 --> 2:01:21.840
 on the thing.

2:01:21.840 --> 2:01:24.080
 I mean, you're making it sound easy.

2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:27.400
 I assume it's beautiful, but it's gorgeous.

2:01:27.400 --> 2:01:29.560
 So there's the next generation.

2:01:29.560 --> 2:01:31.120
 So that's the second generation.

2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:34.000
 Next generation is forget the microfluidics altogether.

2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:35.000
 Just use big bottles.

2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:37.960
 How can you possibly do that with big bottles?

2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:39.400
 So here's the idea.

2:01:39.400 --> 2:01:43.680
 You dissociate all of your cells or all of your nuclei from complex cells like brain

2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:48.240
 cells that are very long and sticky so you can't do that.

2:01:48.240 --> 2:01:52.520
 If you have blood cells or if you have neuronal nuclei or brain nuclei, you can basically

2:01:52.520 --> 2:01:56.160
 dissociate let's say a million cells.

2:01:56.160 --> 2:02:01.720
 You now want to add a unique barcode, a unique barcode in each one of a million cells using

2:02:01.720 --> 2:02:02.720
 only big bottles.

2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:04.440
 How can you possibly do that?

2:02:04.440 --> 2:02:07.320
 Sounds crazy, but here's the idea.

2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:13.880
 You use a hundred of these bottles, you randomly shuffle all your million cells and you throw

2:02:13.880 --> 2:02:17.180
 them into those hundred bottles randomly, completely randomly.

2:02:17.180 --> 2:02:21.560
 You add one barcode out of a hundred to every one of the cells.

2:02:21.560 --> 2:02:23.560
 You then you now take them all out.

2:02:23.560 --> 2:02:28.440
 You shuffle them again and you throw them again into the same hundred bottles.

2:02:28.440 --> 2:02:33.960
 But now in a different randomization and you add a second barcode.

2:02:33.960 --> 2:02:36.880
 So every cell now has two barcodes.

2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:40.280
 You take them out again, you shuffle them and you throw them back in.

2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:47.480
 Another third barcode is adding randomly from the same hundred barcodes.

2:02:47.480 --> 2:02:53.920
 You've now labeled every cell probabilistically based on the unique path that he took of which

2:02:53.920 --> 2:02:56.880
 of a hundred bottles did he go for the first time, which of a hundred bottles the second

2:02:56.880 --> 2:03:00.160
 time and which of a hundred bottles the third time.

2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:05.240
 A hundred times a hundred times a hundred is a million unique barcodes in every single

2:03:05.240 --> 2:03:09.480
 one of these cells without ever using microfluidics.

2:03:09.480 --> 2:03:10.480
 Very clever.

2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:11.480
 It's beautiful, right?

2:03:11.480 --> 2:03:12.880
 From a computer science perspective, that's very clever.

2:03:12.880 --> 2:03:13.880
 Yeah.

2:03:13.880 --> 2:03:16.160
 So you now have the single cell sequence technology.

2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:22.040
 You can use the wells, you can use the bubbles or you can use the bottles and you have way

2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:23.680
 The bubbles still sound pretty damn cool.

2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:24.680
 The bubbles are awesome.

2:03:24.680 --> 2:03:26.640
 And that's basically the main technology that we're using.

2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:29.680
 So the bubbles is the main technology.

2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:34.360
 So there are kits now that companies just sell to basically carry out single cell RNA

2:03:34.360 --> 2:03:40.240
 sequencing that you can basically for $2,000, you can basically get 10,000 cells from one

2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:42.560
 sample.

2:03:42.560 --> 2:03:49.680
 And for every one of those cells, you basically have the transcription of thousands of genes.

2:03:49.680 --> 2:03:54.360
 And you know, of course the data for any one cell is noisy, but being computer scientists,

2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:58.640
 we can aggregate the data from all of the cells together across thousands of individuals

2:03:58.640 --> 2:04:02.120
 together to basically make very robust inferences.

2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:03.120
 Okay.

2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:07.160
 So the third technology is basically single cell RNA sequencing that allows you to now

2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:14.400
 start asking not just what is the brain expression level difference of that genetic variant,

2:04:14.400 --> 2:04:20.000
 but what is the expression difference of that one genetic variant across every single subtype

2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:21.720
 of brain cell?

2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:24.460
 How is the variance changing?

2:04:24.460 --> 2:04:29.260
 You can't just, you know, with a brain sample, you can just ask about the mean, what is the

2:04:29.260 --> 2:04:30.840
 average expression?

2:04:30.840 --> 2:04:38.280
 If I instead have 3000 cells that are neurons, I can ask not just what is the neuronal expression.

2:04:38.280 --> 2:04:44.240
 I can say for layer five excitatory neurons of which I have, I don't know, 300 cells,

2:04:44.240 --> 2:04:48.240
 what is the variance that this genetic variant has?

2:04:48.240 --> 2:04:51.000
 So suddenly it's amazingly more powerful.

2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:55.240
 I can basically start asking about this middle layer of gene expression at unprecedented

2:04:55.240 --> 2:04:56.240
 levels.

2:04:56.240 --> 2:05:01.600
 So when you look at the average, it washes out some potentially important signal that

2:05:01.600 --> 2:05:04.160
 corresponds to ultimately the disease.

2:05:04.160 --> 2:05:05.160
 Completely.

2:05:05.160 --> 2:05:06.160
 Yeah.

2:05:06.160 --> 2:05:10.200
 So that, I can do that at the RNA level, but I can also do that at the DNA level for the

2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:11.200
 epigenome.

2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:14.760
 So remember how before I was telling you about all this technology that we're using to probe

2:05:14.760 --> 2:05:18.160
 the epigenome, one of them is DNA accessibility.

2:05:18.160 --> 2:05:23.200
 So what we're doing in my lab is that from the same dissociation of say a brain sample

2:05:23.200 --> 2:05:27.480
 where you now have all these tens of thousands of cells floating around, you basically take

2:05:27.480 --> 2:05:32.360
 half of them to do RNA profiling and the other half to do epigenome profiling, both at the

2:05:32.360 --> 2:05:34.140
 single cell level.

2:05:34.140 --> 2:05:40.340
 So that allows you to now figure out what are the millions of DNA enhancers that are

2:05:40.340 --> 2:05:45.000
 accessible in every one of tens of thousands of cells.

2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:50.600
 And computationally, we can now take the RNA and the DNA readouts and group them together

2:05:50.600 --> 2:05:57.600
 to basically figure out how is every enhancer related to every gene.

2:05:57.600 --> 2:06:01.720
 And remember these sort of enhancer gene linking that we were doing across 833 samples?

2:06:01.720 --> 2:06:08.240
 833 is awesome, don't get me wrong, but 10 million is way more awesome.

2:06:08.240 --> 2:06:14.600
 So we can now look at correlated activity across 2.3 million enhancers and 20,000 genes

2:06:14.600 --> 2:06:19.860
 in each of millions of cells to basically start piecing together the regulatory circuitry

2:06:19.860 --> 2:06:25.440
 of every single type of neuron, every single type of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglial

2:06:25.440 --> 2:06:32.880
 cell inside the brains of 1,500 individuals that we sample across multiple different brain

2:06:32.880 --> 2:06:36.240
 regions across both DNA and RNA.

2:06:36.240 --> 2:06:39.600
 So that's the data set that my team generated last year alone.

2:06:39.600 --> 2:06:46.560
 So in one year, we basically generated 10 million cells from human brain across a dozen

2:06:46.560 --> 2:06:51.200
 different disorders, across schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy

2:06:51.200 --> 2:07:01.000
 body dementia, ALS, Huntington's disease, post traumatic stress disorder, autism, bipolar

2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:04.400
 disorder, healthy aging, et cetera.

2:07:04.400 --> 2:07:13.120
 So it's possible that even just within that data set lie a lot of keys to understanding

2:07:13.120 --> 2:07:18.320
 these diseases and then be able to like directly leads to then treatment.

2:07:18.320 --> 2:07:19.320
 Correct.

2:07:19.320 --> 2:07:20.320
 Correct.

2:07:20.320 --> 2:07:21.880
 So basically we are now motivating.

2:07:21.880 --> 2:07:22.880
 Yeah.

2:07:22.880 --> 2:07:25.680
 So our computational team is in heaven right now and we're looking for people.

2:07:25.680 --> 2:07:29.700
 I mean, if you have super smart.

2:07:29.700 --> 2:07:33.080
 So this is a very interesting kind of side question.

2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:34.680
 How much of this is biology?

2:07:34.680 --> 2:07:36.280
 How much of this is computation?

2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:44.080
 So you're the head of the computational biology group, but how much of, should you be comfortable

2:07:44.080 --> 2:07:48.600
 with biology to be able to solve some of these problems?

2:07:48.600 --> 2:07:54.120
 If you just find, if you put several of the hats you were on fundamentally, are you thinking

2:07:54.120 --> 2:07:56.460
 like a computer scientist here?

2:07:56.460 --> 2:07:57.460
 You have to.

2:07:57.460 --> 2:07:59.760
 This is the only way.

2:07:59.760 --> 2:08:02.720
 As I said, we are the descendants of the first digital computer.

2:08:02.720 --> 2:08:05.000
 We're trying to understand the digital computer.

2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:11.240
 We're trying to understand the circuitry, the logic of this digital core computer and

2:08:11.240 --> 2:08:14.200
 all of these analog layers surrounding it.

2:08:14.200 --> 2:08:19.840
 So the case that I've been making is that you cannot think one gene at a time.

2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:22.080
 The traditional biology is dead.

2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:24.960
 There's no way you cannot solve disease with traditional biology.

2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:27.240
 You need it as a component.

2:08:27.240 --> 2:08:31.840
 Once you figured out RX3 and RX5, you now can then say, Hey, have you guys worked on

2:08:31.840 --> 2:08:33.880
 those genes with your single gene approach?

2:08:33.880 --> 2:08:35.560
 We'd love to know everything you know.

2:08:35.560 --> 2:08:38.960
 And if you haven't, we now know how important these genes are.

2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:43.520
 Let's now launch a single gene program to dissect them and understand them.

2:08:43.520 --> 2:08:46.680
 But you cannot use that as a way to dissect disease.

2:08:46.680 --> 2:08:48.580
 You have to think genomically.

2:08:48.580 --> 2:08:53.380
 You have to think from the global perspective and you have to build these circuits systematically.

2:08:53.380 --> 2:08:59.220
 So we need numbers of computer scientists who are interested and willing to dive into

2:08:59.220 --> 2:09:04.960
 these data fully, fully in and extract meaning.

2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:11.960
 We need computer science people who can understand machine learning and inference and decouple

2:09:11.960 --> 2:09:16.360
 these matrices, come up with super smart ways of dissecting them.

2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:22.880
 But we also need computer scientists who understand biology, who are able to design the next generation

2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:24.660
 of experiments.

2:09:24.660 --> 2:09:28.760
 Because many of these experiments, no one in their right mind would design them without

2:09:28.760 --> 2:09:33.020
 thinking of the analytical approach that you would use to deconvolve the data afterwards.

2:09:33.020 --> 2:09:36.640
 Because it's massive amounts of ridiculously noisy data.

2:09:36.640 --> 2:09:42.700
 And if you don't have the computational pipeline in your head before you even design the experiment,

2:09:42.700 --> 2:09:44.760
 you would never design the experiment that way.

2:09:44.760 --> 2:09:45.760
 That's brilliant.

2:09:45.760 --> 2:09:50.160
 So in designing the experiment, you have to see the entirety of the computational pipeline.

2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:52.600
 That drives the design.

2:09:52.600 --> 2:09:55.560
 That even drives the necessity for that design.

2:09:55.560 --> 2:10:00.320
 Basically, you know, if you didn't have a computer scientist way of thinking, you would

2:10:00.320 --> 2:10:07.360
 never design these hugely combinatorial, massively parallel experiments.

2:10:07.360 --> 2:10:10.680
 So that's why you need interdisciplinary teams, you need teams.

2:10:10.680 --> 2:10:15.200
 And I want to sort of clarify that what do we mean by computational biology group?

2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:18.880
 The focus is not on computational, the focus is on the biology.

2:10:18.880 --> 2:10:20.920
 So we are a biology group.

2:10:20.920 --> 2:10:22.680
 What type of biology?

2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:23.680
 Computational biology.

2:10:23.680 --> 2:10:27.760
 That's the type of biology that uses the whole genome.

2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:33.040
 That's the type of biology that designs experiments, genomic experiments, that can only be interpreted

2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:34.600
 in the context of the whole genome.

2:10:34.600 --> 2:10:35.600
 Right.

2:10:35.600 --> 2:10:39.800
 So it's philosophically looking at biology as a computer.

2:10:39.800 --> 2:10:40.800
 Correct.

2:10:40.800 --> 2:10:41.800
 Correct.

2:10:41.800 --> 2:10:46.280
 So which is in the context of the history of biology is a big transformation.

2:10:46.280 --> 2:10:47.280
 Yeah.

2:10:47.280 --> 2:10:48.280
 Yeah.

2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:50.200
 You can think of the name as what do we do?

2:10:50.200 --> 2:10:51.240
 Only computation.

2:10:51.240 --> 2:10:52.240
 That's not true.

2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:53.880
 How do we study it?

2:10:53.880 --> 2:10:54.880
 Only computationally.

2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:56.520
 That is true.

2:10:56.520 --> 2:11:00.480
 So all of these single cell sequencing can now be coupled with the technology that we

2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:02.920
 talked about earlier for perturbation.

2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:04.560
 So here's the crazy thing.

2:11:04.560 --> 2:11:10.720
 Instead of using these wells and these robotic systems for doing one drug at a time or for

2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:16.880
 perturbing one gene at a time in thousands of wells, you can now do this using a pool

2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:20.120
 of cells and single cell RNA sequencing.

2:11:20.120 --> 2:11:21.120
 How?

2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:27.960
 You basically can take these perturbations using CRISPR and instead of using a single

2:11:27.960 --> 2:11:32.920
 guide RNA, you can use a library of guide RNAs generated exactly the same way using

2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:34.480
 this array technology.

2:11:34.480 --> 2:11:38.500
 So you synthesize a thousand different guide RNAs.

2:11:38.500 --> 2:11:45.720
 You now take each of these guide RNAs and you insert them in a pool of cells where every

2:11:45.720 --> 2:11:48.220
 cell gets one perturbation.

2:11:48.220 --> 2:11:56.720
 And you use CRISPR editing or CRISPR, so with either CRISPR Cas9 to edit a genome with these

2:11:56.720 --> 2:12:01.400
 thousand perturbations or with the activation or with the repression.

2:12:01.400 --> 2:12:07.600
 And you now can have a single cell readout where every single cell has received one of

2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:09.600
 these modifications.

2:12:09.600 --> 2:12:17.080
 And you can now in massively parallel ways, couple the perturbation and the readout in

2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:18.480
 a single experiment.

2:12:18.480 --> 2:12:21.600
 How are you tracking which perturbations each cell received?

2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:27.320
 So there's ways of doing that, but basically one way is to make that perturbation an expressible

2:12:27.320 --> 2:12:33.160
 vector so that part of your RNA reading is actually that perturbation itself.

2:12:33.160 --> 2:12:37.740
 So you can basically put it in an expressible part so you can self drive it.

2:12:37.740 --> 2:12:42.120
 So the point that I want to get across is that the sky's the limit.

2:12:42.120 --> 2:12:46.480
 You basically have these tools, these building blocks of molecular biology.

2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:50.280
 We have these massive data sets of computational biology.

2:12:50.280 --> 2:12:56.160
 We have this huge ability to sort of use machine learning and statistical methods and, you

2:12:56.160 --> 2:13:01.880
 know, linear algebra to sort of reduce the dimensionality of all these massive data sets.

2:13:01.880 --> 2:13:10.960
 And then you end up with a series of actionable targets that you can then couple with pharma

2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:13.380
 and just go after systematically.

2:13:13.380 --> 2:13:19.760
 So the ability to sort of bring genetics to the epigenomics, to the transcriptomics, to

2:13:19.760 --> 2:13:24.280
 the cellular readouts using these sort of high throughput perturbation technologies

2:13:24.280 --> 2:13:30.040
 that I'm talking about and ultimately to the organismal through the electronic health record

2:13:30.040 --> 2:13:36.520
 endophenotypes and ultimately the disease battery of assays at the cognitive level,

2:13:36.520 --> 2:13:42.000
 at the physiological level and, you know, every other level.

2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:46.760
 There is no better or more exciting field, in my view, to be a computer scientist then

2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:48.640
 or to be a scientist in period.

2:13:48.640 --> 2:13:54.280
 Basically this confluence of technologies, of computation, of data, of insight and of

2:13:54.280 --> 2:13:58.860
 tools for manipulation is unprecedented in human history.

2:13:58.860 --> 2:14:04.620
 And I think this is what's shaping the next century to really be a transformative century

2:14:04.620 --> 2:14:09.440
 for our species and for our planet.

2:14:09.440 --> 2:14:17.200
 Do you think the 21st century will be remembered for the big leaps in understanding and alleviation

2:14:17.200 --> 2:14:18.800
 of biology?

2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:23.720
 If you look at the path between discovery and therapeutics, it's been on the order of

2:14:23.720 --> 2:14:29.660
 50 years, it's been shortened to 40, 30, 20, and now it's on the order of 10 years.

2:14:29.660 --> 2:14:36.400
 But the huge number of technologies that are going on right now for discovery will result

2:14:36.400 --> 2:14:42.600
 undoubtedly in the most dramatic manipulation of human biology that we've ever seen in the

2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:45.240
 history of humanity in the next few years.

2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:48.920
 Do you think we might be able to cure some of the diseases we started this conversation

2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:49.920
 with?

2:14:49.920 --> 2:14:50.920
 Absolutely.

2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:51.920
 Absolutely.

2:14:51.920 --> 2:14:54.320
 It's only a matter of time.

2:14:54.320 --> 2:14:58.480
 Basically the complexity is enormous and I don't want to underestimate the complexity

2:14:58.480 --> 2:15:03.800
 but the number of insights is unprecedented and the ability to manipulate is unprecedented

2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:11.040
 and the ability to deliver these small molecules and other non traditional medicine perturbations,

2:15:11.040 --> 2:15:17.440
 there's a new generation of perturbations that you can use at the DNA level, at the

2:15:17.440 --> 2:15:24.440
 RNA level, at the micro RNA level, at the epigenomic level, there's a battery of new

2:15:24.440 --> 2:15:26.560
 generations of perturbations.

2:15:26.560 --> 2:15:32.120
 If you couple that with cell type identifiers that can basically sense when you are in the

2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:36.840
 right cell based on the specific combination and then turn on that intervention for that

2:15:36.840 --> 2:15:42.560
 cell, you can now think of combinatorial interventions where you can basically sort of feed a synthetic

2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:47.680
 biology construct to someone that will basically do different things in different cells.

2:15:47.680 --> 2:15:51.500
 So basically for cancer, this is one of the therapeutics that our collaborator Ron Weiss

2:15:51.500 --> 2:15:56.240
 is using to basically start sort of engineering the circuits that will use micro RNA sensors

2:15:56.240 --> 2:15:59.840
 of the environment to sort of know if you're in a tumor cell or if you're in an immune

2:15:59.840 --> 2:16:04.180
 cell or if you're in a stromal cell and so forth and basically turn on particular interventions

2:16:04.180 --> 2:16:05.180
 there.

2:16:05.180 --> 2:16:11.080
 You can sort of create constructs that are tuned to only the liver cells or only the

2:16:11.080 --> 2:16:18.640
 heart cells or only the brain cells and then have these new generations of therapeutics

2:16:18.640 --> 2:16:24.000
 coupled with this immense amount of knowledge on the sort of which targets to choose and

2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:27.680
 what biological processes to measure and how to intervene.

2:16:27.680 --> 2:16:36.400
 My view is that disease is going to be fundamentally altered and alleviated as we go forward.

2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:40.960
 Next time we talk, we'll talk about the philosophical implications of that and the effect of life,

2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:44.200
 but let's stick to biology for just a little longer.

2:16:44.200 --> 2:16:45.200
 We did pretty good today.

2:16:45.200 --> 2:16:49.520
 We stuck to the science.

2:16:49.520 --> 2:16:56.000
 What are you excited in terms of the future of this field, the technologies in your own

2:16:56.000 --> 2:17:02.560
 group, in your own mind, you're leading the world at MIT in the science and the engineering

2:17:02.560 --> 2:17:04.480
 of this work.

2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:06.440
 So what are you excited about here?

2:17:06.440 --> 2:17:08.920
 I could not be more excited.

2:17:08.920 --> 2:17:12.720
 We are one of many, many teams who are working on this.

2:17:12.720 --> 2:17:17.000
 In my team, the most exciting parts are, you know, many folds.

2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:20.360
 So basically we've now assembled these battery of technologies.

2:17:20.360 --> 2:17:24.960
 We've assembled these massive, massive data sets and now we're really sort of in the stage

2:17:24.960 --> 2:17:30.460
 of our team's path of generating disease insights.

2:17:30.460 --> 2:17:36.480
 So we are simultaneously working on a paper on schizophrenia right now that is basically

2:17:36.480 --> 2:17:40.880
 using the single cell profiling technologies, using this editing and manipulation technologies

2:17:40.880 --> 2:17:47.840
 to basically show how the master regulators underlying changes in the brain that are sort

2:17:47.840 --> 2:17:53.320
 of found in schizophrenia are in fact affecting excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons

2:17:53.320 --> 2:17:59.280
 in pathways that are active both in synaptic pruning, but also in early development.

2:17:59.280 --> 2:18:03.220
 We've basically found this set of four regulators that are connecting these two processes that

2:18:03.220 --> 2:18:10.200
 were previously separate in schizophrenia in sort of having a sort of more unified view

2:18:10.200 --> 2:18:12.720
 across those two sides.

2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:15.520
 The second one is in the area of metabolism.

2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:19.280
 We basically now have a beautiful collaboration with the Goodyear lab that's basically looking

2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:29.160
 at multi tissue perturbations in six or seven different tissues across the body in the context

2:18:29.160 --> 2:18:35.920
 of exercise and in the context of nutritional interventions using both mouse and human,

2:18:35.920 --> 2:18:41.680
 where we can basically see what are the cell to cell communications that are changing across

2:18:41.680 --> 2:18:42.680
 them.

2:18:42.680 --> 2:18:47.840
 And what we're finding is this immense role of both immune cells as well as adipocyte

2:18:47.840 --> 2:18:53.080
 stem cells in sort of reshaping that circuitry of all of these different tissues and that's

2:18:53.080 --> 2:18:56.920
 sort of painting to a new path for therapeutical intervention there.

2:18:56.920 --> 2:19:02.540
 In Alzheimer's, it's this huge focus on microglia and now we're discovering different classes

2:19:02.540 --> 2:19:10.360
 of microglial cells that are basically either synaptic or immune.

2:19:10.360 --> 2:19:16.120
 And these are playing vastly different roles in Alzheimer's versus in schizophrenia.

2:19:16.120 --> 2:19:22.400
 And what we're finding is this immense complexity as you go further and further down of how

2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:28.400
 in fact there's 10 different types of microglia, each with their own sort of expression programs.

2:19:28.400 --> 2:19:32.480
 We used to think of them as, oh yeah, they're microglia, but in fact now we're realizing

2:19:32.480 --> 2:19:37.960
 just even in that sort of least abundant of cell types, there's this incredible diversity

2:19:37.960 --> 2:19:39.620
 there.

2:19:39.620 --> 2:19:44.280
 The differences between brain regions is another sort of major, major insight.

2:19:44.280 --> 2:19:48.800
 Often one would think that, oh, astrocytes are astrocytes no matter where they are.

2:19:48.800 --> 2:19:54.240
 But no, there's incredible region specific differences in the expression patterns of

2:19:54.240 --> 2:19:57.480
 all of the major brain cell types across different brain regions.

2:19:57.480 --> 2:20:01.080
 So basically there's the neocortical regions that are sort of the recent innovation that

2:20:01.080 --> 2:20:03.620
 makes us so different from all other species.

2:20:03.620 --> 2:20:10.080
 There's the sort of reptilian brain sort of regions that are sort of much more very extremely

2:20:10.080 --> 2:20:11.080
 distinct.

2:20:11.080 --> 2:20:12.080
 There's the cerebellum.

2:20:12.080 --> 2:20:17.520
 Each of those basically is associated in a different way with disease.

2:20:17.520 --> 2:20:23.680
 And what we're doing now is looking into pseudo temporal models for how disease progresses

2:20:23.680 --> 2:20:25.820
 across different regions of the brain.

2:20:25.820 --> 2:20:30.000
 If you look at Alzheimer's, it basically starts in this small region called the entorhinal

2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:38.440
 cortex and then it spreads through the brain and through the hippocampus and ultimately

2:20:38.440 --> 2:20:39.520
 affecting the neocortex.

2:20:39.520 --> 2:20:46.080
 And with every brain region that it hits, it basically has a different impact on the

2:20:46.080 --> 2:20:52.920
 cognitive and memory aspects, orientation, short term memory, long term memory, et cetera,

2:20:52.920 --> 2:20:58.320
 which is dramatically affecting the cognitive path that the individuals go through.

2:20:58.320 --> 2:21:04.600
 So what we're doing now is creating these computational models for ordering the cells

2:21:04.600 --> 2:21:10.560
 and the regions and the individuals according to their ability to predict Alzheimer's disease.

2:21:10.560 --> 2:21:17.820
 So we can have a cell level predictor of pathology that allows us to now create a temporal time

2:21:17.820 --> 2:21:22.860
 course that tells us when every gene turns on along this pathology progression and then

2:21:22.860 --> 2:21:28.040
 trace that across regions and pathological measures that are region specific, but also

2:21:28.040 --> 2:21:30.380
 cognitive measures and so on and so forth.

2:21:30.380 --> 2:21:35.540
 So that allows us to now sort of for the first time, look at can we actually do early intervention

2:21:35.540 --> 2:21:40.920
 for Alzheimer's where we know that the disease starts manifesting for 10 years before you

2:21:40.920 --> 2:21:44.280
 actually have your first cognitive loss.

2:21:44.280 --> 2:21:50.360
 Can we start seeing that path to build new diagnostics, new prognostics, new biomarkers

2:21:50.360 --> 2:21:54.420
 for this sort of early intervention in Alzheimer's?

2:21:54.420 --> 2:21:57.080
 The other aspect that we're looking at is mosaicism.

2:21:57.080 --> 2:22:01.120
 We talked about the common variants and the rare variants, but in addition to those rare

2:22:01.120 --> 2:22:08.520
 variants as your initial cell that forms the zygote divides and divides and divides, with

2:22:08.520 --> 2:22:12.480
 every cell division there are additional mutations that are happening.

2:22:12.480 --> 2:22:18.000
 So what you end up with is your brain being a mosaic of multiple different types of genetic

2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:19.320
 underpinnings.

2:22:19.320 --> 2:22:23.380
 Some cells contain a mutation that other cells don't have.

2:22:23.380 --> 2:22:31.200
 So every human has the common variants that all of us carry to some degree, the rare variants

2:22:31.200 --> 2:22:37.360
 that your immediate tree of the human species carries, and then there's the somatic variant,

2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:44.280
 which is the tree that happened after the zygote that sort of forms your own body.

2:22:44.280 --> 2:22:50.840
 So these somatic alterations is something that has been previously inaccessible to study

2:22:50.840 --> 2:22:53.240
 in human postmortem samples.

2:22:53.240 --> 2:22:58.240
 But right now with the advent of single cell RNA sequencing, in this particular case, we're

2:22:58.240 --> 2:23:01.920
 using the well based sequencing, which is much more expensive, but gives you a lot richer

2:23:01.920 --> 2:23:04.560
 information about each of those transcripts.

2:23:04.560 --> 2:23:10.200
 So we're using now that richer information to infer mutations that have happened in each

2:23:10.200 --> 2:23:16.640
 of the thousands of genes that sort of are active in these cells, and then understand

2:23:16.640 --> 2:23:25.320
 how the genome relates to the function, this genotype phenotype relationship that we usually

2:23:25.320 --> 2:23:31.400
 build in GWAS between in genome wide association studies between genetic variation and disease.

2:23:31.400 --> 2:23:36.400
 We're now building that at the cell level, where for every cell, we can relate the unique

2:23:36.400 --> 2:23:42.920
 specific genome of that cell with the expression patterns of that cell, and the predicted function

2:23:42.920 --> 2:23:47.480
 using these predictive models that I mentioned before on this regulation for cognition for

2:23:47.480 --> 2:23:51.000
 pathology in Alzheimer's at the cell level.

2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:54.960
 And what we're finding is that the genes that are altered and the genetic regions that are

2:23:54.960 --> 2:23:59.640
 altered in common variants versus rare variants versus somatic variants are actually very

2:23:59.640 --> 2:24:01.280
 different from each other.

2:24:01.280 --> 2:24:08.860
 The somatic variants are pointing to neuronal energetics and oligodendrocyte functions that

2:24:08.860 --> 2:24:13.000
 are not visible in the genetic legions that you find for the common variants, probably

2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:17.480
 because they have too strong of an effect that evolution is just not tolerating them

2:24:17.480 --> 2:24:20.960
 on the common side of the allele frequency spectrum.

2:24:20.960 --> 2:24:26.360
 So the somatic one, that's the variation that happens after the zygote, after you individual.

2:24:26.360 --> 2:24:31.600
 I mean, this is a dumb question, but there's mutation and variation, I guess that happens

2:24:31.600 --> 2:24:32.600
 there.

2:24:32.600 --> 2:24:37.200
 And you're saying that they're through this, if we focus in on individual cells, we're

2:24:37.200 --> 2:24:42.640
 able to detect the story that's interesting there, and that might be a very unique kind

2:24:42.640 --> 2:24:49.320
 of important variability that arises for, you said neuronal or something that would

2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:50.320
 sound...

2:24:50.320 --> 2:24:51.320
 Energetics.

2:24:51.320 --> 2:24:52.320
 Energetics, sounds like a cool term.

2:24:52.320 --> 2:24:59.520
 So, I mean, the metabolism of humans is dramatically altered from that of nearby species.

2:24:59.520 --> 2:25:04.500
 We talked about that last time that basically we are able to consume meat that is incredibly

2:25:04.500 --> 2:25:13.240
 energy rich, and that allows us to sort of have functions that are meeting this humongous

2:25:13.240 --> 2:25:14.240
 brain that we have.

2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:18.280
 So basically on one hand, every one of our brain cells is much more energy efficient

2:25:18.280 --> 2:25:20.560
 than our neighbors, than our relatives.

2:25:20.560 --> 2:25:23.360
 Number two, we have way more of these cells.

2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:30.260
 And number three, we have this new diet that allows us to now feed all these needs.

2:25:30.260 --> 2:25:36.540
 That basically creates a massive amount of damage, oxidative damage from this huge super

2:25:36.540 --> 2:25:42.360
 powered factory of ideas and thoughts that we carry in our skull.

2:25:42.360 --> 2:25:47.540
 And that factory has energetic needs, and there's a lot of sort of biological processes

2:25:47.540 --> 2:25:52.960
 underlying that, that we are finding are altered in the context of Alzheimer's disease.

2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:53.960
 That's fascinating.

2:25:53.960 --> 2:25:59.680
 So you have to consider all of these systems if you want to understand even something like

2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:04.440
 diseases that you would maybe traditionally associate with just the particular cells of

2:26:04.440 --> 2:26:07.440
 the brain.

2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:11.240
 The immune system, the metabolic system, the metabolic system.

2:26:11.240 --> 2:26:13.440
 And these are all the things that makes us uniquely human.

2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:17.120
 So our immune system is dramatically different from that of our neighbors.

2:26:17.120 --> 2:26:19.600
 Our societies are so much more clustered.

2:26:19.600 --> 2:26:24.840
 The history of infection that have plagued the human population is dramatically different

2:26:24.840 --> 2:26:27.080
 from every other species.

2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:31.320
 The way that our society and our population has sort of exploded has basically put unique

2:26:31.320 --> 2:26:33.360
 pressures on our immune system.

2:26:33.360 --> 2:26:37.480
 And our immune system has both coped with that density and also been shaped by, as I

2:26:37.480 --> 2:26:42.200
 mentioned, the vast amount of death that has happened in the Black Plague and other sort

2:26:42.200 --> 2:26:47.180
 of selective events in human history, famines, ice ages, and so forth.

2:26:47.180 --> 2:26:49.940
 So that's number one on the sort of immune side.

2:26:49.940 --> 2:26:55.560
 On the metabolic side, again, we are able to sort of run marathons.

2:26:55.560 --> 2:26:59.040
 I don't know if you remember the sort of human versus horse experiment where the horse actually

2:26:59.040 --> 2:27:03.480
 tires out faster than the human and the human actually wins.

2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:05.940
 So on the metabolic side, we're dramatically different.

2:27:05.940 --> 2:27:07.560
 On the immune side, we're dramatically different.

2:27:07.560 --> 2:27:12.400
 On the brain side, again, you know, no need to sort of, you know, it's a no brainer of

2:27:12.400 --> 2:27:16.880
 how our brain is like just enormously more capable.

2:27:16.880 --> 2:27:21.740
 And then, you know, in the side of cancer, so basically the cancers that humans are having,

2:27:21.740 --> 2:27:25.940
 the exposures, the environmental exposures is again, dramatically different.

2:27:25.940 --> 2:27:32.880
 And the lifespan, the expansion of human lifespan is unseen in any other species in, you know,

2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:35.720
 recent evolutionary history.

2:27:35.720 --> 2:27:42.360
 And that now leads to a lot of new disorders that are starting to, you know, manifest late

2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:43.920
 in life.

2:27:43.920 --> 2:27:48.200
 So you know, Alzheimer's is one example where basically, you know, these vast energetic

2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:54.800
 needs over a lifetime of thinking can basically lead to all of these debris and eventually

2:27:54.800 --> 2:28:00.840
 saturate the system and lead to, you know, Alzheimer's in the late life.

2:28:00.840 --> 2:28:07.440
 But there's, you know, there's just such a dramatic set of frontiers when it comes to

2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:14.360
 aging research that, you know, so what I often like to say is that if you want to engineer

2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:18.240
 a car to go from 70 miles an hour to 120 miles an hour, that's fine.

2:28:18.240 --> 2:28:20.480
 You can basically, you know, fix a few components.

2:28:20.480 --> 2:28:24.240
 If you wanted to now go at 400 miles an hour, you have to completely redesign the entire

2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:31.220
 car because the system has just not evolved to go that far.

2:28:31.220 --> 2:28:36.480
 Basically our human body has only evolved to live to, I don't know, 120, maybe we can

2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:39.280
 get to 150 with minor changes.

2:28:39.280 --> 2:28:45.240
 But if, you know, as we start pushing these frontiers for not just living, but well living,

2:28:45.240 --> 2:28:48.240
 the Fzine that we talked about last time.

2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:53.200
 So to basically push Fzine into the 80s and 90s and a hundreds and, you know, much further

2:28:53.200 --> 2:29:00.400
 than that, we will face new challenges that have, you know, never been faced before in

2:29:00.400 --> 2:29:04.200
 terms of cancer, the number of divisions, in terms of Alzheimer's and brain related

2:29:04.200 --> 2:29:08.880
 disorders, in terms of metabolic disorders, in terms of regeneration, there's just so

2:29:08.880 --> 2:29:10.920
 many different frontiers ahead of us.

2:29:10.920 --> 2:29:14.040
 So I am thrilled about where we're heading.

2:29:14.040 --> 2:29:20.600
 So basically I see this confluence in my lab and many other labs of AI, of, you know, sort

2:29:20.600 --> 2:29:22.920
 of, you know, the next frontier of AI for drug design.

2:29:22.920 --> 2:29:30.520
 So basically these sort of graph neural networks on specific chemical designs that allow you

2:29:30.520 --> 2:29:34.840
 to create new generations of therapeutics.

2:29:34.840 --> 2:29:42.400
 These molecular biology tricks for intervening at the system at every level, these personalized

2:29:42.400 --> 2:29:49.960
 medicine prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis using the electronic health records and using

2:29:49.960 --> 2:29:56.640
 these polygenic risk scores weighted by the burden, the number of mutations that are accumulating

2:29:56.640 --> 2:30:03.340
 across common rare and somatic variants, the burden converging across all of these different

2:30:03.340 --> 2:30:10.000
 molecular pathways, the delivery of specific drugs and specific interventions into specific

2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:11.000
 cell types.

2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:14.080
 And again, you've talked with Bob Langer about this, there's, you know, many giants in that

2:30:14.080 --> 2:30:15.080
 field.

2:30:15.080 --> 2:30:20.560
 And then the last concept is not intervening at the single gene level.

2:30:20.560 --> 2:30:27.600
 I want you to sort of conceptualize the concept of an on target side effect.

2:30:27.600 --> 2:30:29.200
 What is an on target side effect?

2:30:29.200 --> 2:30:33.320
 An off target side effect is when you design a molecule to target one gene and instead

2:30:33.320 --> 2:30:36.720
 it targets another gene and you have side effects because of that.

2:30:36.720 --> 2:30:41.040
 And on target side effect is when your molecule does exactly what you were expecting, but

2:30:41.040 --> 2:30:43.840
 that gene is plyotropic.

2:30:43.840 --> 2:30:48.160
 Plyo means many, tropos means ways, many ways, it acts in many ways.

2:30:48.160 --> 2:30:50.040
 It's a multifunctional gene.

2:30:50.040 --> 2:30:55.320
 So you find that this gene plays a role in this, but as we talked about the wiring of

2:30:55.320 --> 2:30:59.000
 genes to phenotypes is extremely dense and extremely complex.

2:30:59.000 --> 2:31:04.000
 So the next stage of intervention will be intervening not at the gene level, but at

2:31:04.000 --> 2:31:06.160
 the network level.

2:31:06.160 --> 2:31:11.440
 Intervening at the set of pathways and the set of genes with multi input perturbations

2:31:11.440 --> 2:31:18.040
 to the system, multi input modulations, pharmaceutical or other interventional, and that basically

2:31:18.040 --> 2:31:24.980
 allow you to now work at the sort of full level of understanding, not just in your brain,

2:31:24.980 --> 2:31:29.400
 but across your body, not just in one gene, but across the set of pathways and so on and

2:31:29.400 --> 2:31:31.980
 so forth for every one of these disorders.

2:31:31.980 --> 2:31:37.320
 So I think that we're finally at the level of systems medicine of basically instead of

2:31:37.320 --> 2:31:42.120
 sort of medicine being at the single gene level, medicine being at the systems level

2:31:42.120 --> 2:31:46.480
 where it can be personalized based on the specific set of genetic markers and genetic

2:31:46.480 --> 2:31:53.040
 perturbations that you are either born with or that you have developed during your lifetime.

2:31:53.040 --> 2:31:59.480
 Your unique set of exposures, your unique set of biomarkers, and your unique set of

2:31:59.480 --> 2:32:06.480
 current set of conditions through your EHR and other ways.

2:32:06.480 --> 2:32:12.920
 And the precision component of intervening extremely precisely in the specific pathways

2:32:12.920 --> 2:32:16.840
 and the specific combinations of genes that should be modulated to sort of bring you from

2:32:16.840 --> 2:32:23.480
 the disease state to the physiologically normal state or even to physiologically improved

2:32:23.480 --> 2:32:25.640
 state through this combination of interventions.

2:32:25.640 --> 2:32:30.080
 So that's in my view, the field where basically computer science comes together with artificial

2:32:30.080 --> 2:32:34.200
 intelligence statistics, all of these other tools, molecular biology technologies and

2:32:34.200 --> 2:32:37.960
 biotechnology and pharmaceutical technologies that are sort of revolutionary in the way

2:32:37.960 --> 2:32:38.960
 of intervention.

2:32:38.960 --> 2:32:43.240
 And of course, this massive amount of molecular biology and data gathering and generation

2:32:43.240 --> 2:32:46.360
 and perturbation in massively parallel ways.

2:32:46.360 --> 2:32:47.700
 So there's no better way.

2:32:47.700 --> 2:32:49.740
 There's no better time.

2:32:49.740 --> 2:32:56.800
 There's no better place to be sort of looking at this whole confluence of ideas.

2:32:56.800 --> 2:33:01.440
 And I'm just so thrilled to be a small part of this amazing, enormous ecosystem.

2:33:01.440 --> 2:33:07.520
 It's exciting to imagine what humans of 100, 200 years from now, what their life experience

2:33:07.520 --> 2:33:13.720
 is like, because these ideas seem to have potential to transform the quality of life

2:33:13.720 --> 2:33:22.200
 that, when they look back at us, they probably wonder how we were put up with all the suffering

2:33:22.200 --> 2:33:23.200
 in the world.

2:33:23.200 --> 2:33:25.480
 Manolis, it's a huge honor.

2:33:25.480 --> 2:33:29.240
 Thank you for spending this early Sunday morning with me.

2:33:31.240 --> 2:33:32.240
 Sounds like a plan.

2:33:32.240 --> 2:33:33.960
 Thank you, Lex.

 And now, let me leave you with some words from Haruki Murakami.

2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:24.580
 Human beings are ultimately nothing but carriers, passageways for genes.

2:34:24.580 --> 2:34:30.300
 They ride us into the ground like racehorses from generation to generation.

2:34:30.300 --> 2:34:34.160
 Genes don't think about what constitutes good or evil.

2:34:34.160 --> 2:34:37.040
 They don't care whether we're happy or unhappy.

2:34:37.040 --> 2:34:40.060
 We're just means to an end for them.

2:34:40.060 --> 2:34:45.960
 The only thing they think about is what is most efficient for them.

2:34:45.960 --> 2:35:12.600
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
