 The following is a conversation with Diana Walsh Basolka, a professor of philosophy and religion at UNCW and author of American Cosmic, UFOs, Religion and Technology.

00:12.640 --> 00:21.760
 This book is one of the most fascinating explorations of the interconnected nature of technology, belief and the mystery of alien intelligence.

 As a side note, let me say, as I did in the recent video on how many intelligent alien civilizations are out there, that the nature of alien life, intelligence and how they might communicate with us humans is likely stranger than we imagine, and perhaps stranger than we can imagine.

01:01.840 --> 01:14.800
 What is most fascinating to me is how the belief in the communication with such civilizations changes people's understanding of the world and, as Diana argues, the technology we create.

01:14.800 --> 01:30.160
 Technological innovation itself seems to manifest the mythology in our collective intelligence that turns the seemingly impossible into reality in just a matter of years through the belief of individual humans that carry out that innovation.

01:30.160 --> 01:47.840
 The nature and power of this belief, in both technology and extraterrestrial intelligence, is mysterious and fascinating, perhaps holding the key to us humans understanding our own mind, our consciousness, and engineering versions of it in the machines we create.

 And now, here's my conversation with Diana Walsh Pasalka.

02:03.520 --> 02:08.080
 You are a scholar of religious belief, or belief in general.

02:08.080 --> 02:16.240
 So, the fascinating question, what do you think is the difference between our beliefs and objective reality?

02:16.240 --> 02:17.600
 What is real, period?

02:17.600 --> 02:19.840
 Sure, what is real?

02:19.840 --> 02:22.000
 Easy question.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.920
 So first, let me start with belief.

02:23.920 --> 02:32.880
 So, belief is generally, there are different definitions of belief, just as there are different definitions of what is real, okay?

02:32.880 --> 02:40.720
 So, for belief in my field, it would be attitudes toward something that dictate our actions, okay?

02:40.720 --> 02:46.400
 So, we believe the sun is going to rise tomorrow, therefore we act as if it will rise tomorrow, all right?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.920
 Beliefs can be wrong.

02:47.920 --> 02:54.400
 For a long time, people believed, and actually some still do, that the earth was flat, okay?

02:54.400 --> 02:57.040
 Well, that's obviously an erroneous belief.

02:57.040 --> 03:00.160
 So, beliefs can be wrong.

03:00.160 --> 03:08.880
 Now, the bigger question that philosophers ask is, is this belief accurate toward what we consider to be objective reality?

03:08.880 --> 03:10.800
 So, now let me go to objective reality.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.160
 So, what is real?

03:12.160 --> 03:18.560
 I don't think we can actually obtain a correct understanding of what is real.

03:18.560 --> 03:23.360
 And in that sense, I have to refer to a philosopher again, and that would be Immanuel Kant.

03:23.360 --> 03:32.400
 So, Immanuel Kant is one of the, he was basically in the 1750s, he wrote critiques of reason and things like that.

03:32.400 --> 03:38.480
 So, he said, well, if you're a philosopher or have any kind of understanding of Western history, you know who he is.

03:38.480 --> 03:43.840
 He had this idea that we can actually never get to the thing in itself, okay?

03:43.840 --> 03:46.720
 So, and he called that the numeral, the thing in itself.

03:46.720 --> 03:51.120
 He said, let's take this table, for instance, that you and I are talking across.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.800
 So, this thing is a table.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.080
 You and I both know that.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.520
 We assume it's real.

03:55.520 --> 04:00.320
 We believe in it because we put our water on it and our water stays on it, okay?

04:00.320 --> 04:05.520
 However, can we know this thing in and of itself as a table?

04:05.520 --> 04:10.320
 So, that would be what he then would call the phenomenal.

04:10.320 --> 04:15.680
 How do we know that that phenomena exists as we know it is, okay?

04:15.680 --> 04:16.640
 How do we know?

04:16.640 --> 04:17.520
 We use our faculties.

04:17.520 --> 04:19.440
 So, we use our senses and things like that.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.080
 But again, even our senses can be wrong.

04:22.080 --> 04:31.440
 So, I've been on committees just recently this year, last year, for hiring professors in my department who are philosophers.

04:31.440 --> 04:37.120
 And we're hiring metaphysicians and people who are thinking about the nature of reality.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.640
 And basically, what I've learned from them, yeah, they're very good.

04:40.640 --> 04:45.040
 I'd love to attend those faculty talks of metaphysics professors.

04:45.040 --> 04:49.120
 What's funny is that for each one of them, I'm convinced each time.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.440
 They all say different things, but they're so convincing.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.760
 I'm like, yes, hire that one, right?

04:53.760 --> 04:56.080
 Is it like historical philosophy, like a particular talk?

04:56.080 --> 04:56.560
 No, no.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.600
 Or do they have an actual belief?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.680
 They're practicing metaphysicians.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.280
 Metaphysicians, yes.

05:03.280 --> 05:11.120
 So, what they do is they come and they're usually excellent philosophers from Harvard or USC or whatever.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.520
 They come and they give what's called a job talk.

05:13.520 --> 05:18.160
 That's what every academic does a job talk in order to get it.

05:18.160 --> 05:21.760
 They talk to us about a department about what they do.

05:21.760 --> 05:27.600
 And so, it so happens that we need a metaphysician and now we're hiring again for one.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.520
 And so, I've learned a lot about metaphysics in the last year.

05:31.520 --> 05:37.600
 And this is what I've learned that they use physics as a basis for understanding

05:37.600 --> 05:39.760
 what we can know about what is real.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.880
 And what is real is really difficult to pin down.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.760
 And so, your question is, what is belief?

05:45.760 --> 05:48.480
 Well, belief, does it correspond to reality?

05:48.480 --> 05:50.160
 That's the question I would ask.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.800
 And first, we don't even know what is real.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.760
 So, the table, they would say, how do we know that the table even exists?

05:55.760 --> 05:59.200
 Well, how do we differentiate it from the floor, for example?

05:59.200 --> 06:01.600
 So, these are the questions that philosophers are asking.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.960
 No one else is, of course.

06:02.960 --> 06:06.320
 But philosophers are asking these questions and they have different answers for it.

06:06.320 --> 06:10.160
 So, I would say that it's very difficult to know what is real.

06:10.160 --> 06:17.760
 And in fact, what I do usually is I paraphrase my friend and colleague, Brother Guy Consolmagno.

06:17.760 --> 06:23.280
 He's a Jesuit priest who's also an astronomer and he's the director of the Vatican Observatory.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.520
 And so, he says this, he's a very smart person.

06:25.520 --> 06:29.200
 He says, well, truth is a moving target.

06:30.320 --> 06:36.720
 So, basically, to know what is real out there, like gravity or something like that,

06:36.720 --> 06:38.720
 you've got to approximate it.

06:38.720 --> 06:45.600
 And as human beings, we have senses to tell us what, at least so we don't get hurt.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.400
 We're not going to fall off a building or something like that.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.160
 We have eyes to see and things like that.

06:50.160 --> 06:54.000
 So, we can approximate what reality is, but we're never going to get to it

06:54.000 --> 06:58.480
 unless we develop better senses, okay?

06:58.480 --> 07:01.360
 And I think that that is what we are in the process of doing.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.200
 We're developing better senses.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.520
 We have telescopes, we have microscopes, we have extensions of ourselves,

07:07.520 --> 07:09.360
 which are now called technology.

07:09.360 --> 07:15.760
 And we can get to a better understanding of what reality is and what the objective world is.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.160
 And therefore, our beliefs can be honed.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.480
 So, we can get better beliefs, more accurate beliefs.

07:20.480 --> 07:24.880
 But can we get beliefs that actually correspond to reality?

07:24.880 --> 07:28.560
 Not in any precise way, but in approximate ways.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.840
 So, I hope that's not like too big an answer to your question.

07:31.840 --> 07:35.200
 Well, do you think beliefs are in themselves can become reality?

07:35.200 --> 07:41.760
 I mean, so you've now adapted the, in this little bit of a conversation,

07:41.760 --> 07:45.680
 adapted the metaphysician view of reality, which is the physics.

07:45.680 --> 07:46.080
 Yes.

07:46.080 --> 07:50.800
 But, you know, we humans kind of operate in the space of ideas very much so.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.720
 Like we've kind of in the collective intelligence of human beings,

07:54.720 --> 07:59.680
 have come up with a set of ideas that persist in the minds of these many people.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.080
 And they become quite strong and powerful.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.800
 Like in terms of like impact on our lives,

08:05.360 --> 08:11.840
 they can have sometimes more impact than this table does than the physics.

08:11.840 --> 08:12.960
 Yeah, I agree.

08:12.960 --> 08:19.760
 And in that sense, is there some sense in which our beliefs are reality,

08:19.760 --> 08:22.160
 even if they're not connected to the physics?

08:22.160 --> 08:23.600
 Yes, even if they're not real.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.120
 Yeah, even if, okay.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.560
 So, yes, absolutely.

08:26.560 --> 08:33.520
 So, our beliefs are tremendously, they create social effects, absolutely.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.480
 There was a belief that, I'm going to use this example.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.960
 There was a belief back in the day, and we're talking about,

08:40.960 --> 08:44.720
 when I say back in the day, I'm a historian, so I'm talking about like 1000 years ago,

08:44.720 --> 08:45.200
 right?

08:45.200 --> 08:47.040
 That women had no souls, okay?

08:47.040 --> 08:49.920
 So, look, I don't know if human beings have souls.

08:49.920 --> 08:54.160
 I can tell you this, though, that if human beings have souls, probably animals do too.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.280
 That's my own personal belief.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.280
 That's not a professor belief there.

08:58.080 --> 09:04.240
 But there was this belief among the Catholic magisterium, which runs Europe,

09:04.240 --> 09:05.280
 that women had no souls.

09:05.280 --> 09:08.640
 So, they had to have this big meeting about it, you know, did women have souls?

09:08.640 --> 09:13.120
 But that belief had consequences for women.

09:13.120 --> 09:17.760
 I mean, women were treated and have been treated as if they didn't have souls.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.280
 Okay, so there's...

09:19.280 --> 09:21.920
 And the soul was really the essence of the human being.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.320
 It was.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.240
 It's called the animus, right?

09:24.240 --> 09:29.920
 It's what is the essence of what is eternal, you know, when women weren't eternal.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.360
 Here's another example, okay?

09:31.360 --> 09:33.760
 This is an example from my own research.

09:33.760 --> 09:34.160
 All right.

09:34.160 --> 09:40.320
 So, in the Catholic tradition, there's this idea of purgatory, hell, and heaven.

09:40.320 --> 09:45.040
 And these are three destinations that people can go to when they die.

09:45.040 --> 09:49.440
 And if you're great, you go to heaven automatically and you're considered a saint.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.400
 If you're okay, you go to purgatory, right?

09:52.400 --> 09:55.440
 And you suffer for a time and then get back into heaven.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.360
 If you're terrible, you go to hell, right?

09:57.360 --> 09:58.000
 Okay.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.640
 Well, there was a place that the Catholics determined, and this was a belief for a long time,

10:04.640 --> 10:09.360
 like a thousand years or more, and it was called limbo, all right?

10:09.360 --> 10:13.120
 And limbo comes from the Latin limbus, and it means edge.

10:13.120 --> 10:16.400
 And it was either on the edge of hell or on the edge of heaven.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.320
 No one really could determine which it was.

10:18.320 --> 10:22.000
 No historians are like, well, this person says it was on the edge of heaven.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.400
 Well, listen, this was a terrible...

10:24.400 --> 10:26.080
 First of all, there is no limbo anymore.

10:26.080 --> 10:32.880
 In 2007, Benedict, the then Pope, got rid of the idea that there was limbo, okay?

10:32.880 --> 10:35.840
 So Catholics kind of went crazy because they didn't really know.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.880
 They forgot that limbo existed and they thought it was purgatory.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.880
 And they said, how could you get rid of purgatory?

10:40.880 --> 10:43.040
 But actually, he just got rid of this idea of limbo.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.200
 Oh, so that's a distinct thing from purgatory.

10:45.200 --> 10:45.840
 It was.

10:45.840 --> 10:50.000
 And by the way, people should know they have a book on purgatory that came before...

10:50.000 --> 10:50.880
 American Cosmic.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.800
 Yes, I wrote a book on purgatory, yeah.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.600
 Anyway, so limbo is a distinct thing from purgatory?

10:55.600 --> 10:56.000
 Yeah.

10:56.000 --> 11:04.160
 And the types of people who go to limbo happen to be virtuous pagans, okay?

11:04.160 --> 11:05.920
 Like Socrates or somebody like that.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.760
 And children who weren't baptized.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.280
 So think of this.

11:11.280 --> 11:18.160
 Think of for like more than a thousand years, mothers and fathers gave birth to babies who

11:18.160 --> 11:23.200
 weren't baptized and couldn't be buried with their family in these burial...

11:23.200 --> 11:26.240
 And then they couldn't be reunited with them in heaven.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.640
 Think of the pain and suffering that that caused.

11:28.640 --> 11:29.760
 And that was nothing.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.000
 Limbo's nothing.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.360
 Yet the belief in it caused untold suffering.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.040
 And that's just a small example.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.120
 And that was as real to them?

11:39.120 --> 11:40.640
 It was absolutely real.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.640
 I mean, the effects were real, let's put it that way.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.640
 The place itself, not real.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.600
 But the families themselves, do you think they really believed it?

11:47.600 --> 11:48.880
 They totally believed it.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.640
 As much as the table is real?

11:50.640 --> 11:51.120
 Yes.

11:51.120 --> 11:54.880
 I've read, listen, we have trigger warnings today, right?

11:54.880 --> 11:57.040
 So don't read this, it's gonna make you upset, okay?

11:57.680 --> 12:01.360
 History, primary sources, no trigger warnings, okay?

12:01.360 --> 12:07.920
 So you're going through like somebody's diary from 1400 and you hear the suffering and pain

12:07.920 --> 12:08.880
 that they went through.

12:08.880 --> 12:14.720
 There were times in my research where I'd have to put my primary source down and just

12:14.720 --> 12:18.240
 basically go outside and take a walk because it was so horrific.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.720
 I knew it was true because they wouldn't write something, they're not gonna write in their

12:22.720 --> 12:24.800
 diary something that's not true and it was horrible.

12:24.800 --> 12:30.800
 So yes, these people went through untold suffering for nothing because they had an erroneous belief.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.480
 But they didn't know it was erroneous.

12:32.480 --> 12:33.760
 So it was real to them?

12:33.760 --> 12:34.260
 Yeah.

12:34.960 --> 12:37.120
 So I don't know if you're familiar with Donald Hoffman.

12:37.920 --> 12:46.320
 He has this idea that in terms of the distance we are from being able to know the reality,

12:46.320 --> 12:51.120
 which is there, the physics reality, is we're actually really, really, really, really far

12:51.120 --> 12:52.240
 away from that.

12:52.240 --> 12:52.720
 Yeah.

12:52.720 --> 12:59.440
 So like it's, I think his ideas that were basically like completely detached from it.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.500
 Yes.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.080
 What's your sense, how close are we to the reality?

13:04.080 --> 13:13.040
 We'll talk about a bunch of ideas about our beliefs in technology and beyond, but in terms

13:13.040 --> 13:18.240
 of what is actually real from a physical sense, how close are we to understanding that?

13:18.240 --> 13:19.040
 Pretty far.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.600
 I'm gonna use examples from what I do.

13:21.600 --> 13:29.680
 Okay, so this idea that we're suspicious of what we actually think is real is not new.

13:29.680 --> 13:33.520
 Of course, it goes back a long time, thousands of years, in fact.

13:33.520 --> 13:39.360
 And philosophers, I'm not actually technically a philosopher, but I was one.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.880
 I'm a professor of religious studies.

13:42.880 --> 13:47.040
 Yeah, what do you introduce yourself at, like at a bar when the bartender asks, what do

13:47.040 --> 13:47.760
 you do?

13:47.760 --> 13:52.000
 I never tell people what I do, especially on airplanes.

13:52.000 --> 13:52.880
 It's a bad idea.

13:53.440 --> 13:58.160
 So generally if they push though, I say, I'm the chair of philosophy and religion, although

13:58.160 --> 14:00.720
 I stepped down last year, so I'm no longer the chair.

14:00.720 --> 14:06.720
 But I have like a master's degree in philosophy and I was a philosophy major and I still study

14:06.720 --> 14:09.520
 philosophy, so I integrate it into my research.

14:09.520 --> 14:16.160
 All right, so this idea that we can't know, we're suspicious of what we know, it's called

14:16.160 --> 14:18.160
 external world skepticism.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.480
 That's the official philosophical name for it.

14:21.520 --> 14:27.520
 Our faculties and our senses don't give us accurate perceptions of what is there, okay,

14:27.520 --> 14:30.880
 especially at a quantum level or a molecular level.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.400
 I mean, that's just obvious.

14:32.400 --> 14:36.480
 So yeah, so I think that the person you mentioned is correct in that.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.760
 I think we're far away from it.

14:37.760 --> 14:44.240
 I think you're talking about our direct senses, but you know, we have tools, measurement tools

14:44.240 --> 14:51.280
 from microscopes to all the tools of astronomy, cosmology that gives us a sense of the big

14:51.280 --> 14:53.360
 universe and also the sense of the very small.

14:54.800 --> 15:01.840
 Do you think there's some other things that are completely sort of other dimensions or

15:01.840 --> 15:09.520
 there's ideas of panpsychism, that consciousness permeates all matter, that there's like fundamental

15:09.520 --> 15:13.040
 forces of physics we're not even aware of yet?

15:13.040 --> 15:14.720
 Oh, absolutely.

15:14.720 --> 15:21.520
 I do think, and this is why I write about technology and I mean, that's actually what

15:21.520 --> 15:25.440
 I specialize in is belief in technology with respect to religion.

15:25.440 --> 15:32.640
 So in my opinion, thank goodness for technology because where would we be without it?

15:32.640 --> 15:39.760
 I mean, frankly, I think that it's like Marshall McLuhan was the person who said technology

15:39.760 --> 15:44.240
 is like an extension of our senses and I absolutely believe that to be true.

15:44.240 --> 15:51.680
 I think that we're lucky that Prometheus gave us technology, okay, and that we use it and

15:51.680 --> 15:54.320
 we're making it better and better and better and better.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.040
 And that makes us more efficient.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.960
 It makes us more efficient as a species.

16:00.240 --> 16:09.680
 And like my point is that I think that our instruments, I mean, I don't want to be a

16:09.680 --> 16:16.320
 religious technologist, you know, but our instruments will save us.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.960
 I mean, they're already making life better for us.

16:18.960 --> 16:23.200
 You think it's important that they also help us understand reality more directly, more

16:23.200 --> 16:24.000
 deeply?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.400
 I think directly is better than deeply.

16:26.400 --> 16:31.920
 I think directly, more directly is probably a more accurate term for what you're trying

16:31.920 --> 16:35.920
 to, I think, ask me, you know, can we actually, I mean, I think you're asking me that question

16:35.920 --> 16:40.480
 that Kant basically was trying to get at was can we know the thing in itself?

16:40.480 --> 16:41.440
 Can we know that?

16:41.440 --> 16:45.440
 Can we have like some kind of like intense knowing of it?

16:45.440 --> 16:46.480
 It's almost mystical.

16:47.200 --> 16:52.320
 And I would say that that's where religion comes in, okay?

16:52.320 --> 16:54.080
 That's where we talk about religion.

16:54.640 --> 16:58.080
 And if I may also go back to Immanuel Kant.

16:58.080 --> 17:04.160
 This idea that he, just before he died, just as he died, he was working on, he did this

17:04.160 --> 17:12.240
 critique of reason where basically he believed, he basically talks about can we know what's

17:12.240 --> 17:12.480
 real?

17:12.480 --> 17:15.840
 He basically has this long, you know, that question, can we know what's real?

17:15.840 --> 17:19.360
 And then, you know, a thousand pages later, no.

17:19.360 --> 17:22.080
 I'll just give you the rundown.

17:22.080 --> 17:22.720
 Okay.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.720
 So, okay, yeah, yeah, exactly.

17:25.360 --> 17:29.600
 Then he does this other critique and okay, so he does like three critiques.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.600
 Then he does this critique of judgment.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.080
 Okay.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.400
 Well, judgment is this other thing altogether.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.240
 And I think that that's what you're getting at.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.840
 So how do we know things?

17:37.840 --> 17:41.280
 How can we know things really intensely and intimately?

17:41.280 --> 17:48.400
 And I think that he thought that judgment was the idea that we can actually know the

17:48.400 --> 17:49.040
 thing in itself.

17:49.040 --> 17:52.560
 And he was working on that as he died and then he never finished it.

17:52.560 --> 17:58.240
 Hannah Arendt, another philosopher of the 20th century, took it up, took up the critique

17:58.240 --> 18:00.240
 of judgment and tried to finish it.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.480
 Why the word judgment?

18:03.280 --> 18:09.040
 Because judgment, think about it, when you see a work of art, who judges that to be decent?

18:09.040 --> 18:09.360
 Okay.

18:09.360 --> 18:17.520
 So there is a group of people who come to the decision that that's rotten or, you know,

18:17.520 --> 18:18.640
 that's pretty good.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.840
 You know, like, I noticed that you like to play guitar.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.480
 Well, you choose music that I happen to like too.

18:24.480 --> 18:24.960
 Okay.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.600
 So you and I both have a sense of judgment.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.320
 It's a sense.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.280
 So he said, there's a sense that some people have.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.160
 Why do certain communities have a similar sense?

18:37.120 --> 18:38.160
 What dictates that?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.280
 And so he was working on that.

18:39.280 --> 18:43.440
 He thought it had something to do with the knowledge, the intimate knowledge of the thing

18:43.440 --> 18:44.000
 in itself.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.120
 Yeah, so another philosopher that philosophers actually don't like at all, but religious

18:49.120 --> 18:51.680
 studies people do, is Martin Heidegger.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.400
 So Martin Heidegger has some great essays.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.240
 One is called What is a Work of Art?

18:56.240 --> 19:00.320
 And again, he gets to, you know, he talks about Van Gogh and Van Gogh's shoes.

19:00.320 --> 19:06.240
 You know, that picture, the painting Van Gogh's shoes, it's really a really intense picture.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.840
 It's just shoes.

19:07.840 --> 19:12.000
 It's, you know, it's an amazing painting of shoes.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.880
 And I think everybody can agree that's a cool picture of shoes, right?

19:16.880 --> 19:20.720
 And so why, you know, the question is, why is that a cool picture of shoes?

19:20.720 --> 19:27.360
 You know, what kind of knowledge are we accessing to determine that indeed that works, right?

19:27.360 --> 19:28.880
 And in fact, we still like it.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.800
 So basically the nature of knowledge and what does it represent?

19:32.800 --> 19:39.200
 It can operate in the space of, that's detached from reality or can it ultimately represent

19:39.200 --> 19:39.920
 reality?

19:39.920 --> 19:43.520
 I guess that's the, is that, that's the space of metaphysics?

19:43.520 --> 19:44.560
 Is that the, is that the...

19:44.560 --> 19:45.040
 Yeah.

19:45.040 --> 19:47.600
 So what can we know is actually called epistemology.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.160
 Epistemology.

19:48.160 --> 19:53.200
 But metaphysics is, is basically what is the nature of reality.

19:53.200 --> 19:53.760
 Right.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.120
 And those intersect.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.080
 Absolutely.

19:56.080 --> 19:56.560
 Yeah.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.160
 A lot of things intersect in philosophy.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.400
 We just have fancy names for them.

20:00.400 --> 20:07.280
 Another non philosopher that may be considered a philosopher, since we're talking about reality

20:07.280 --> 20:10.960
 is Ayn Rand and her philosophy of objectivism.

20:12.000 --> 20:19.520
 What are your thoughts on her sense of taking this idea of reality, calling her philosophy

20:19.520 --> 20:28.320
 objectivism, and kind of starting at the idea that you really could know everything, and

20:28.320 --> 20:34.880
 it's pretty obvious, and then from that, you can derive an ethics about how to live life,

20:34.880 --> 20:40.400
 like what is the, what is the good ethical life and all the virtue of selfishness, all

20:40.400 --> 20:40.960
 that kind of stuff.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.880
 So you talked to a lot of academic philosophers.

20:44.880 --> 20:53.360
 So I'd be curious to see from the perspective of like, is she somebody that's taken seriously

20:53.360 --> 20:53.920
 at all?

20:55.680 --> 21:02.640
 Why is she dismissed as I see from my distant perspective by serious philosophers, and also

21:02.640 --> 21:07.280
 like your own personal thoughts of like, is there some interesting bits that you find

21:07.280 --> 21:10.160
 inspiring in her work or not?

21:10.160 --> 21:21.120
 Okay, so Ayn Rand, I've had so many exceedingly intelligent students basically give me her

21:21.120 --> 21:25.920
 books, and basically say, please, Dr. Basilka, read this book.

21:25.920 --> 21:29.680
 And I'll tell them, yes, thank you, I've read this book before.

21:29.680 --> 21:35.360
 And then want to engage in, let me put it this way, they're religious about Ayn Rand.

21:35.360 --> 21:42.480
 Okay, so to them, Ayn Rand represents some type of way of life, her objectivism.

21:43.520 --> 21:47.920
 Now, why is she not taken seriously by philosophers in general?

21:48.960 --> 21:56.000
 Well, let me put it this way, philosophers in general tend to get pretty, I guess you

21:56.000 --> 22:01.040
 could call it, they're kind of scientists, but with words.

22:01.040 --> 22:04.960
 I always call philosophy, when I describe it to someone who's going to take a philosophy

22:04.960 --> 22:10.560
 class, I say, it's basically math problems, like word math problems, okay?

22:10.560 --> 22:11.920
 So that's basically what it is.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.880
 So they take words very seriously, and they're very formal.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.640
 And definitions very seriously, yeah.

22:16.640 --> 22:20.240
 So they all want to get on the same page, so there is no confusion.

22:20.240 --> 22:25.040
 So for Ayn Rand to basically say, you can know everything, and you know, it's like,

22:25.040 --> 22:30.880
 okay, and establish ethics from that, I think philosophers automatically say no.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.480
 Now, that doesn't mean I say no.

22:33.200 --> 22:38.560
 In fact, we have at my university a wonderful business school.

22:38.560 --> 22:45.520
 And when you walk into the dean of the business school's office, Ayn Rand is everywhere.

22:45.520 --> 22:51.040
 So I want to say that not all academics are anti Ayn Rand.

22:51.040 --> 22:56.080
 And in fact, I don't think philosophers are either, except that they don't teach Ayn Rand,

22:56.080 --> 22:56.560
 okay?

22:56.560 --> 23:01.600
 So in one sense, you could say that because they don't teach her, they're being exclusive

23:01.600 --> 23:05.760
 in what they teach, or very particular, perhaps, is another way to put it.

23:06.480 --> 23:11.120
 Yeah, it's hard to know where to place people like her, because, you know, do you put

23:11.120 --> 23:13.120
 Albert Camus as a philosopher?

23:13.120 --> 23:15.040
 So I guess, what's the good term for that?

23:15.040 --> 23:22.240
 Like literary philosophers, or whatever the term is, it's annoying to me that the academic

23:22.240 --> 23:26.640
 philosophers get to own the word philosophy, because like, it's just like people who think

23:26.640 --> 23:30.960
 deeply about life is what I think about as philosophy.

23:30.960 --> 23:36.080
 And like, to me, it's like, all right, so I know Nietzsche is another person that's

23:36.080 --> 23:42.080
 probably not respected in the philosophy circles, because he is, you know, full of contradictions,

23:42.080 --> 23:42.800
 full of...

23:42.800 --> 23:43.840
 I love Nietzsche.

23:43.840 --> 23:47.280
 Nietzsche is my favorite philosopher.

23:47.280 --> 23:47.840
 Oh, really?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.440
 Yes, I absolutely love Nietzsche.

23:49.440 --> 23:53.360
 So he's definitely, you know, I love people that are full of ideas, even if they're full

23:53.360 --> 23:55.760
 of contradictions, and Nietzsche is certainly that.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.000
 And Ayn Rand is also that.

23:58.000 --> 24:06.320
 I'm able to look past the obvious ego that's there on the page, and the fact that she actually

24:06.320 --> 24:08.960
 has, in my view, a lot of wrong ideas.

24:08.960 --> 24:14.160
 But there's a lot of interesting tidbits to pick up, and the same goes with Nietzsche.

24:14.160 --> 24:20.320
 And I'm weirded out by the religious aspect here, on both the people who like worship

24:20.320 --> 24:23.440
 Ayn Rand, and people who completely dismiss her.

24:23.440 --> 24:29.120
 I just kind of see it as, oh, can we just read a few interesting things and get inspired

24:29.120 --> 24:30.960
 by it and move on, as opposed to...

24:30.960 --> 24:31.440
 No.

24:31.440 --> 24:33.360
...have a diplomatic conversation.

24:33.360 --> 24:36.800
 Is there something you find about her work that's interesting to you?

24:36.800 --> 24:39.360
 Or her personality, or any of that?

24:39.360 --> 24:40.880
 Oh, I think she's fascinating.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.200
 I don't dismiss her.

24:43.200 --> 24:50.880
 She was a woman who reached a level of success with her mind at a time when that was difficult.

24:50.880 --> 24:56.320
 So, I mean, she's definitely worth looking at for even that reason.

24:56.320 --> 25:04.640
 But also, her idea, I guess, part of the situation with Rand, first of all, I think that she

25:04.640 --> 25:08.720
 her work is, you have to, it's misinterpreted, okay?

25:08.720 --> 25:10.720
 And I think that's the same with Nietzsche.

25:10.720 --> 25:18.160
 A lot of people think that, I mean, in fact, it is the case that Nietzsche's writing before

25:18.160 --> 25:26.560
 the 20th century, so he's got the, he's somewhat, his rhetoric is sexist and racist and of the

25:26.560 --> 25:27.680
 time period, right?

25:27.680 --> 25:36.640
 He was a educated philosopher of that time period.

25:36.640 --> 25:44.960
 However, his books are amazing, and Nietzsche's philosophy is incredible.

25:44.960 --> 25:49.280
 And I think that's what you're saying about Rand, too.

25:49.280 --> 25:49.840
 And I agree.

25:49.840 --> 25:53.840
 I mean, I think that we get caught up.

25:53.840 --> 25:59.760
 I mean, likely we should, and we should contextualize these thinkers in the time period within which

25:59.760 --> 26:00.640
 they are.

26:00.640 --> 26:04.640
 We should not forgive their, you know, because there were people during Nietzsche's time

26:04.640 --> 26:09.840
 that were, you know, feminist and not racist and things like that.

26:09.840 --> 26:15.440
 And, you know, so, but each has merit.

26:15.440 --> 26:20.880
 I mean, I would say Nietzsche is, and you did ask me to talk about some of the books

26:20.880 --> 26:25.200
 that made the largest impact on me, and Nietzsche's Gay Science is one of them.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.720
 It's one of the best books ever, in my opinion.

26:28.720 --> 26:33.840
 I do think Nietzsche was, I don't know about exactly sexist.

26:33.840 --> 26:39.280
 He certainly was sexist, but it felt like he didn't get laid much in his life.

26:40.000 --> 26:40.560
 No.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.640
 It felt like he was extra sexist.

26:43.360 --> 26:46.160
 I was like, his theories on women are like, all right.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.360
 He's pretty angry.

26:47.360 --> 26:48.880
 He seems frustrated.

26:48.880 --> 26:49.380
 Yeah.

26:49.380 --> 26:52.020
 He's like, all right, calm down, buddy.

26:53.140 --> 26:54.500
 The fate of philosophers.

26:55.540 --> 26:57.860
 I just ignore everything Nietzsche says about women.

27:00.500 --> 27:03.940
 So can we talk about myth and religion a little bit?

27:03.940 --> 27:04.440
 Yes.

27:04.440 --> 27:09.860
 I mean, can we start at the beginning, which is like myths, how are they born?

27:10.660 --> 27:15.060
 There's this collective intelligence amongst us human beings, and we seem to create these

27:15.060 --> 27:19.460
 beautiful ideas that captivate the minds of millions.

27:19.460 --> 27:21.460
 How is such a myth born?

27:21.460 --> 27:22.580
 Great question.

27:22.580 --> 27:23.060
 Okay.

27:23.060 --> 27:25.300
 So that brings us to terminology again.

27:25.940 --> 27:33.860
 And in my field, we definitely, I think, try not to distinguish between religion.

27:33.860 --> 27:38.260
 I guess it's going to be controversial, I think, between religion and myth, because

27:39.220 --> 27:43.940
 we call other cultures, religions, myths, right?

27:43.940 --> 27:46.660
 And then we call our myths, religions.

27:46.660 --> 27:50.660
 And I guess myth has a bad connotation to it, that it's not somehow real.

27:50.660 --> 27:51.300
 Yeah.

27:51.300 --> 27:57.620
 Now, what's interesting is that people like Plato, who lived thousands of years ago, 2500

27:57.620 --> 28:05.140
 about, basically made this distinction himself within his own culture, which was Greek, right?

28:05.140 --> 28:08.180
 So Plato is a very famous Greek philosopher.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.620
 And he would say things like this.

28:09.620 --> 28:17.620
 He would say that he would make a distinction between the reality of the one God, or the

28:17.620 --> 28:23.060
 one, he would call it, he didn't use the word God, but he's referencing a divinity,

28:24.500 --> 28:25.860
 and he believes in the soul.

28:27.540 --> 28:32.420
 But he would also say that the gods and goddesses of the Greeks are just myths.

28:33.140 --> 28:35.140
 So even he would make that distinction.

28:35.140 --> 28:40.980
 Again, he would say the population is not too bright, so they believe in these gods

28:40.980 --> 28:42.020
 and goddesses.

28:42.020 --> 28:48.740
 But he himself is talking to his students, and he's basically talking about forms, so

28:49.540 --> 28:52.580
 that seem to live in these other dimensions.

28:52.580 --> 28:56.980
 Like this table, let's go back to this table that we're talking around right now.

28:56.980 --> 29:01.700
 He would say that this table is the instantiation of the form table, and that there is this

29:01.700 --> 29:03.620
 table that actually exists somewhere.

29:03.620 --> 29:07.220
 It's this place where numbers exist, like the number two, okay?

29:07.220 --> 29:11.140
 So we use the number two mathematically, therefore it exists.

29:11.140 --> 29:13.060
 But have you ever seen a real one?

29:13.060 --> 29:14.740
 Have you ever seen the real two?

29:14.740 --> 29:16.180
 No, okay.

29:16.180 --> 29:17.380
 So but where does it exist?

29:17.380 --> 29:18.660
 So he says that tables...

29:18.660 --> 29:25.700
 So he was also talking about things that he says are real, making a distinction between

29:26.260 --> 29:32.980
 the people, and by the way, he got this from Socrates, his mentor, who was killed by Athens

29:32.980 --> 29:34.980
 because he would say such things.

29:34.980 --> 29:38.660
 People don't like to be told that what they believe in is not real, right?

29:38.660 --> 29:39.060
 Yeah.

29:39.060 --> 29:44.980
 By the way, his idea of forms, you're just making me realize how incredible was that

29:44.980 --> 29:46.820
 somebody like that was able to come up with that.

29:47.460 --> 29:51.780
 I mean, that idea became a myth, the idea of forms, right?

29:51.780 --> 29:59.140
 That permeated probably the most influential set of ideas in the history of philosophy,

29:59.140 --> 30:00.420
 in the history of ideas.

30:00.420 --> 30:01.620
 Yes, yeah.

30:01.620 --> 30:03.540
 I mean, Plato, we know him for a reason, right?

30:03.540 --> 30:04.100
 Yeah.

30:04.100 --> 30:10.180
 So let's say that it's a gray area between religious and myths, and maybe not even...

30:10.180 --> 30:11.220
 It is gray, yeah.

30:12.500 --> 30:18.660
 So how's that idea with little Plato start and permeate through all of society?

30:18.660 --> 30:19.540
 Oh, how does it happen?

30:19.540 --> 30:22.180
 Okay, so there are different ways that religions work.

30:22.980 --> 30:29.460
 So a lot of people would call the UFO narrative today, and this is what I talk about in my

30:29.460 --> 30:31.700
 book, like a myth, right, the UFO myth.

30:31.700 --> 30:33.940
 But a lot of people believe in it, okay?

30:33.940 --> 30:35.380
 So how do these things work?

30:35.380 --> 30:36.660
 Well, what I did was I took...

30:38.260 --> 30:42.500
 There's a Ann Taves at UC Santa Barbara.

30:42.500 --> 30:47.460
 She's a pretty well known academic who studies religion, and she has this building block

30:48.020 --> 30:50.500
 definition of religion, like it builds, okay?

30:50.500 --> 30:56.820
 And so she says there are no religious experiences or mythic experiences.

30:56.820 --> 30:59.060
 There are experiences.

30:59.060 --> 31:03.540
 And then they get interpreted as religious or mythic, okay?

31:03.540 --> 31:08.340
 And so I use that with the UFO narrative.

31:08.340 --> 31:12.180
 So I take and I compare it to the religious narrative.

31:12.180 --> 31:13.700
 So basically what happens?

31:14.660 --> 31:19.780
 What happens is this, is that a person generally has a very intense experience.

31:20.580 --> 31:26.580
 It could be with something that they see in the sky, a being that they see, like Moses

31:26.580 --> 31:28.340
 in the burning bush or something like that.

31:28.340 --> 31:30.100
 They tell other people, okay?

31:30.100 --> 31:34.820
 And those other people believe them because they say, that guy, let's take you.

31:34.820 --> 31:35.620
 Okay, Lex.

31:35.620 --> 31:38.420
 Okay, so you're playing some of your music.

31:39.220 --> 31:41.380
 Jimi Hendrix shows up out of the blue.

31:41.380 --> 31:44.740
 So Jimi Hendrix, who does Electric Church stuff, right?

31:44.740 --> 31:46.420
 The Electric Church movement.

31:46.420 --> 31:47.540
 So he shows up.

31:47.540 --> 31:49.540
 I was, sorry for the small tension.

31:50.100 --> 31:53.540
 I'm not aware of, I apologize if I should be.

31:53.540 --> 31:59.620
 I just know how to play all of the songs, Electric Church.

31:59.620 --> 32:00.580
 Is this a thing?

32:00.580 --> 32:02.740
 Yeah, it's Jimi Hendrix's thing.

32:02.740 --> 32:03.380
 Yeah.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.620
 That was like a philosophy of his or what?

32:05.620 --> 32:06.420
 Yes, yes, yes.

32:06.420 --> 32:10.900
 So he thought it was like a mission for him, like he was a missionary.

32:10.900 --> 32:13.380
 And he was like doing the Electric Church.

32:13.380 --> 32:18.580
 It was through his mission of music that he was actually impacting people spiritually.

32:18.580 --> 32:21.860
 And I think you have to agree that his music is really spiritual, yeah.

32:21.860 --> 32:24.660
 Wow, that's so cool to know that there's like a philosophy there.

32:24.660 --> 32:24.900
 Yeah.

32:24.900 --> 32:26.420
 I wonder if he's ever written anything.

32:26.980 --> 32:28.900
 He's spoken about it many times.

32:28.900 --> 32:29.380
 Interesting.

32:29.380 --> 32:29.620
 Yeah.

32:29.620 --> 32:31.860
 I need to actually do some research here.

32:31.860 --> 32:33.700
 Wow, that adds another level of depth.

32:33.700 --> 32:34.580
 That's awesome.

32:34.580 --> 32:35.140
 Okay, so.

32:35.700 --> 32:40.580
 Okay, so say Lex is playing one of his songs.

32:40.580 --> 32:41.300
 He shows up.

32:41.300 --> 32:42.740
 What's your favorite Hendrix song by the way?

32:43.300 --> 32:44.420
 Oh, that's a hard one.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.940
 I like Castles in the Sand.

32:45.940 --> 32:48.500
 It's a sad one, but I like it.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.740
 So I'm playing something and they show up.

32:50.740 --> 32:53.700
 And all of a sudden, boom, just like Elvis does for people.

32:54.580 --> 32:56.260
 Hendrix shows up, all right?

32:56.260 --> 33:00.980
 And then you're amazed and he tells you something that's very, very significant.

33:00.980 --> 33:03.380
 And he says, you need to tell other people this, okay?

33:03.380 --> 33:04.500
 So then like, okay.

33:04.500 --> 33:06.180
 I go on social media.

33:06.180 --> 33:07.620
 Yes, and you start.

33:07.620 --> 33:15.300
 And because people believe you and because you are a person of credibility, people believe you.

33:15.300 --> 33:17.620
 And so all of a sudden a movement starts, okay?

33:17.620 --> 33:19.220
 And it's the Hendrix movement.

33:19.220 --> 33:21.140
 It's Hendrix 2 or something like that.

33:21.140 --> 33:25.060
 You know, we call it something, the next iteration of Hendrix, right?

33:25.060 --> 33:28.180
 Hendrix lives, but he lives as this vibration.

33:28.180 --> 33:32.820
 And only Lex can manifest this vibration, okay?

33:32.820 --> 33:35.380
 So this is how religions start.

33:36.500 --> 33:37.860
 Excuse your audience who are religious.

33:37.860 --> 33:39.140
 I'm actually a practicing Catholic.

33:39.140 --> 33:40.980
 So this is how religion starts.

33:40.980 --> 33:43.860
 They start with, first off, a contact experience.

33:45.140 --> 33:47.140
 Not all of them, but a good portion of them.

33:47.140 --> 33:52.660
 And some person has an experience that's transcendent, sacred to them.

33:52.660 --> 33:54.340
 And they go and they tell other people.

33:54.340 --> 33:56.740
 And then those people tell other people.

33:56.740 --> 33:59.380
 And then something gets written about it, okay?

33:59.380 --> 34:04.340
 And then it becomes, because it's a charismatic movement, people become affected by it.

34:04.340 --> 34:10.100
 And if too many people are affected by it, an institution steps in and tries to control

34:10.100 --> 34:10.740
 the narrative.

34:10.740 --> 34:16.660
 So this is what you'd call the beginning of a religion or a myth, a very powerful myth.

34:16.660 --> 34:19.060
 And so it's almost like a star, right?

34:19.060 --> 34:20.100
 A star is born.

34:20.100 --> 34:20.660
 A star is born.

34:20.660 --> 34:21.140
 Okay, yeah.

34:21.140 --> 34:25.940
 When you say institution, do you mean some other organization that's already powerful?

34:25.940 --> 34:26.260
 Yes.

34:26.260 --> 34:29.620
 Doesn't want to become overpowered by this new movement?

34:29.620 --> 34:30.420
 Yes, absolutely.

34:30.420 --> 34:31.700
 Is this usually governments?

34:31.700 --> 34:32.660
 It's usually, yeah.

34:32.660 --> 34:34.740
 So I have a couple of examples.

34:34.740 --> 34:38.980
 I use the example of the Christian church in my book, because I'm most familiar with the

34:38.980 --> 34:40.820
 history of Christianity.

34:40.820 --> 34:45.140
 And Christianity was started by this Jewish man.

34:45.140 --> 34:50.660
 And it was a movement that he was a very powerful, charismatic person.

34:50.660 --> 34:52.420
 Other people believed in him.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.340
 And then his followers talked about him.

34:54.340 --> 35:04.500
 And then usually early Christians before the 300s were generally people who were disenfranchised,

35:04.500 --> 35:09.780
 because he had a pretty radical idea that humans should have dignity.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.580
 And this was pretty radical during that time.

35:12.580 --> 35:19.380
 So women who didn't have dignity and slaves who didn't have dignity at the time converged

35:19.380 --> 35:20.980
 to Christianity in droves.

35:20.980 --> 35:27.700
 And so what happened was that all of a sudden it became this belief system that was undercurrent.

35:27.700 --> 35:36.180
 And then Constantine, who was an elite, had an experience and made Christianity a state

35:36.180 --> 35:36.660
 religion.

35:37.380 --> 35:41.860
 By that time, there were different forms of Christianity, probably hundreds of them.

35:41.860 --> 35:43.140
 Well, most likely.

35:43.140 --> 35:51.380
 And Constantine and the people who were powerful with him decided that their idea, this is

35:51.380 --> 35:56.660
 the Council of Nicaea now, decided that there was one form, and they called it universal.

35:56.660 --> 36:00.020
 It's the one form of Christianity, and this should be it.

36:00.020 --> 36:04.900
 And so they kind of took out all the other denominations of Christianity and different

36:04.900 --> 36:05.780
 forms of it.

36:05.780 --> 36:15.060
 So you can see that a very, very powerful set of beliefs put a culture on fire, right?

36:15.060 --> 36:19.060
 And so they had to deal with that fire somehow.

36:19.060 --> 36:20.580
 And so they narrativized it.

36:20.580 --> 36:22.980
 They decided, how do we interpret this?

36:22.980 --> 36:25.220
 And they interpreted it as they wished.

36:25.220 --> 36:27.940
 But that wasn't the only interpretation of Christianity.

36:27.940 --> 36:28.980
 I have another example.

36:29.700 --> 36:37.540
 In the Catholic Church, a lot of times, and I'm going to use the example of Faustina.

36:39.460 --> 36:41.700
 She's a nun, and she's Polish.

36:41.700 --> 36:47.700
 And I think it was in the early 20th century, if not the 1800s, that she had a very powerful,

36:49.300 --> 36:52.260
 many experiences, actually, of Jesus.

36:52.260 --> 36:57.220
 And she saw Jesus with rays coming out of his heart.

36:57.220 --> 37:03.060
 And basically, she called this his divine mercy, and it became a devotion in Poland,

37:03.060 --> 37:04.260
 and it spread.

37:04.260 --> 37:07.620
 The Catholic Church was not into this at all, okay?

37:07.620 --> 37:13.140
 And so they did everything they could to try to suppress Faustina's influence, which was

37:13.140 --> 37:16.660
 growing and growing and growing and growing, okay?

37:16.660 --> 37:20.740
 And so they were very successful in trying to keep her quiet, and she died, okay?

37:20.740 --> 37:28.740
 Years later, John Paul II, Polish, sainted her and created the divine mercy devotion,

37:28.740 --> 37:32.340
 which is worldwide now, and millions and millions of people.

37:32.340 --> 37:35.620
 But do you see how they completely controlled it there?

37:35.620 --> 37:41.380
 So fascinating that it just starts with a single, like you said, contact experience.

37:41.380 --> 37:42.660
 Experience is the key word.

37:42.660 --> 37:48.820
 And is your sense that those experiences are legitimate, so it's not...

37:48.820 --> 37:50.980
 Yes, for the most part.

37:50.980 --> 37:52.660
 Somehow artificially constructed?

37:52.660 --> 37:52.980
 Yeah.

37:52.980 --> 37:56.180
 I think for the most part, they're legitimate experiences that people have.

37:56.180 --> 37:58.740
 Why would someone want to put themselves through what they go through?

37:58.740 --> 38:00.900
 Like, why would Jesus want to get crucified?

38:00.900 --> 38:02.820
 I mean, that's a pretty nasty way to die.

38:03.940 --> 38:06.900
 Why would Faustina bring this upon herself?

38:08.100 --> 38:12.180
 The people that I meet who said that they've seen UFOs, that most of them don't want to

38:12.180 --> 38:15.300
 be known because of the ridicule that goes along with it.

38:15.300 --> 38:21.300
 So I honestly think that there are people who are maybe not stable and would like the

38:21.300 --> 38:25.380
 attention, but for the most part, normal people don't want this attention.

38:25.380 --> 38:26.820
 So you mentioned building blocks.

38:28.100 --> 38:33.940
 You didn't mention the word God or sort of the afterlife.

38:33.940 --> 38:36.580
 Are those essential to the myth?

38:36.580 --> 38:38.500
 So there's a contact experience.

38:38.500 --> 38:43.540
 Is there some other aspects of myth and religion which makes them viral?

38:43.540 --> 38:48.740
 Which makes them spread and captivate the imagination of people?

38:49.780 --> 38:50.260
 Yes.

38:50.260 --> 38:52.580
 Is there a pattern to them?

38:53.060 --> 38:56.340
 I think that for each era, it's different and people have...

38:56.340 --> 39:00.020
 First, let's talk about the definition of religion, if that's okay, because most people

39:00.020 --> 39:06.260
 assume the definitions that we in the West are familiar with, which is that, you know,

39:06.260 --> 39:11.940
 that of Christianity, Islam, Judaism, you know, monotheistic religions.

39:11.940 --> 39:16.740
 And those are just some religions.

39:16.740 --> 39:18.580
 There are so many different types of religions.

39:18.580 --> 39:20.260
 Some religions have no God at all.

39:21.460 --> 39:28.260
 Zen Buddhism, for example, is a religion that asks you to take away your belief structures,

39:28.260 --> 39:29.300
 like to kind of like...

39:29.300 --> 39:32.580
 In fact, I would call that a Kantian type religion, right?

39:32.580 --> 39:37.940
 In that it's basically telling you to get rid of your concepts of what you think about

39:37.940 --> 39:42.420
 things so that you can actually have the experience, like you were talking about earlier,

39:42.420 --> 39:43.940
 of the thing in itself.

39:43.940 --> 39:45.700
 And they call that Satori.

39:45.700 --> 39:49.700
 So there are people who believe, you know, they try to...

39:49.700 --> 39:55.700
 They call it meditation, Zen meditation, and it's fairly radical, actually.

39:55.700 --> 40:00.340
 In some monasteries, I don't know if they still do this, but they'll whack you on the

40:00.340 --> 40:06.980
 head if you appear to be not focusing and, you know, that kind of thing.

40:06.980 --> 40:13.700
 You know, they do things to basically take you away from your conceptions of reality

40:13.700 --> 40:18.980
 and bring you into a state of all that is, which is what they call Satori.

40:19.540 --> 40:21.220
 And that has nothing to do with God.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.700
 I like this religion.

40:23.700 --> 40:28.900
 And anything that involves sticks and whacking in order for you to focus better, I'm gonna

40:28.900 --> 40:30.100
 have to join a monastery.

40:30.100 --> 40:34.900
 So, okay, so digging into definitions of religion.

40:34.900 --> 40:40.340
 So like, what do you think is the scope that defines a religion?

40:41.060 --> 40:41.700
 Oh, okay.

40:41.700 --> 40:46.900
 So in my field, we have a few different definitions of religion, as you can imagine, just like

40:46.900 --> 40:49.620
 philosophers have different definitions of what is real.

40:50.340 --> 40:54.100
 So I take this definition and it comes from John Livingston.

40:54.100 --> 41:02.660
 And it's, religion is that set of beliefs and practices that is inspired by a transformative,

41:02.660 --> 41:07.220
 what is perceived actually to be a transformative and sacred power.

41:07.940 --> 41:08.820
 Can you say that again?

41:08.820 --> 41:09.540
 Yeah.

41:09.540 --> 41:13.540
 So religion is a set of, it's not just belief, it's also practices.

41:13.540 --> 41:17.460
 It's both belief and practices, because you won't have the practices without the belief.

41:17.460 --> 41:22.900
 So you have those together, okay, and it's inspired by what is perceived, because we

41:22.900 --> 41:28.260
 don't know if it's real or not, what is perceived to be of sacred and transforming power.

41:28.260 --> 41:33.060
 So perceived by the followers, or is this connected to the original sort of experience?

41:33.060 --> 41:36.020
 No, no, well, it's perceived by the followers.

41:36.020 --> 41:37.300
 That's a really good definition.

41:37.300 --> 41:45.220
 So, and that's the governing idea is that there's something of great power, perceived

41:45.220 --> 41:51.620
 to be of great power, which you can connect yourself either emotionally or intellectually

41:51.620 --> 41:55.860
 somehow in order to explore the world that is beyond your own capabilities.

41:55.860 --> 41:56.580
 Yes.

41:56.580 --> 41:58.980
 And is there communication also involved?

41:58.980 --> 42:00.980
 Generally, yeah.

42:00.980 --> 42:02.260
 That's a great definition.

42:02.260 --> 42:02.740
 Okay.

42:02.740 --> 42:08.420
 So within that falls everything that we've talked about so far, including technology

42:08.420 --> 42:11.860
 and alien life and so on.

42:12.580 --> 42:19.700
 Do you think ultimately religion is good for human civilization?

42:19.700 --> 42:25.380
 Let me maybe phrase it differently is what's religion good for?

42:25.380 --> 42:27.460
 Okay, yeah, that's a great question.

42:27.460 --> 42:28.740
 Thanks for asking that.

42:28.740 --> 42:30.260
 Most people don't ask that.

42:30.260 --> 42:34.900
 And I think it's the question to ask, why do we still have religion?

42:34.900 --> 42:36.020
 That's the question, right?

42:36.020 --> 42:45.780
 Because scientists and others, scholars, humanists even thought that there's this thing called

42:45.780 --> 42:53.780
 the secularization thesis, and it's this idea that the more we progress rationally and we

42:53.780 --> 42:57.940
 have better instruments for understanding our reality, the less religious we will be.

42:57.940 --> 43:00.340
 But that's been found to be untrue.

43:00.340 --> 43:01.860
 We're still very religious, okay?

43:01.860 --> 43:02.500
 So why?

43:02.500 --> 43:03.540
 Why is it around?

43:03.540 --> 43:05.860
 Well, it's adaptive in some way, in my opinion.

43:06.420 --> 43:12.180
 Many people would not agree with me, but I kind of see it as an evolutionary adaptation.

43:12.180 --> 43:17.700
 Now, think about religions, okay?

43:17.700 --> 43:20.340
 Think about Christianity again, for one.

43:20.340 --> 43:25.780
 Here comes this idea when you have this ruthless empire called the Roman Empire, which litters

43:25.780 --> 43:33.140
 its roads with crucified bodies to let you know, don't mess with us, okay?

43:33.140 --> 43:33.700
 All right.

43:33.700 --> 43:37.780
 Here all of a sudden you have this guy saying, God is love, okay?

43:37.780 --> 43:39.460
 All right, well, that's weird.

43:39.460 --> 43:40.580
 Okay, so why?

43:40.580 --> 43:41.860
 Why does this take off?

43:41.860 --> 43:47.140
 Well, it takes off because we're becoming a colonial power.

43:47.780 --> 43:51.700
 That means we're going into other countries, we're conquering them.

43:54.100 --> 44:00.020
 How do we survive together as cultures that don't clash?

44:00.020 --> 44:04.340
 Well, we have to have a belief structure that allows us to, and I think religions function

44:04.340 --> 44:05.620
 that way, frankly.

44:05.620 --> 44:14.100
 So religions help us, so Richard Dawkins's meme idea, it allows us to explore a space

44:14.100 --> 44:22.660
 of ideas, and that in itself is the, so it's like evolution of ideas, and religion is a

44:22.660 --> 44:25.220
 powerful tool for us to explore ideas.

44:25.220 --> 44:29.380
 Because if I believe that men have souls.

44:31.300 --> 44:31.700
 Do they?

44:31.700 --> 44:36.820
 Yes, they do, okay.

44:36.820 --> 44:39.380
 I'm still trying to figure that out.

44:39.380 --> 44:47.860
 Well, I still, in terms of souls, do believe cats don't have souls, but we'll never be

44:47.860 --> 44:48.820
 able to confirm that.

44:49.460 --> 44:53.620
 Maybe if we get better instruments, the soul instrument, you need to come up with that

44:53.620 --> 44:54.180
 one, please.

44:54.740 --> 44:55.620
 For cats?

44:55.620 --> 44:58.660
 Yeah, not just for cats, but for all animals and people in general.

44:58.660 --> 45:04.020
 For sure, you could put them in like a little, you know, soul machine and find out what's

45:04.020 --> 45:05.380
 the status of their soul.

45:07.300 --> 45:08.260
 That's funny.

45:08.260 --> 45:13.060
 I hope we'll become a scientific discipline of consciousness, and consciousness is in

45:13.060 --> 45:18.180
 some sense connected to maybe what the meaning of the word soul used to be.

45:18.900 --> 45:23.460
 And I think it's a fascinating open question, like what is consciousness and so on that

45:23.460 --> 45:26.740
 maybe we'll touch on in a little bit.

45:26.740 --> 45:28.820
 But yeah, anyway, back to our...

45:28.820 --> 45:30.260
 Religions being adaptive.

45:30.260 --> 45:37.540
 I think that Christianity probably helped us become better people to each other as we

45:37.540 --> 45:40.500
 moved into a more global society.

45:40.500 --> 45:45.460
 And I also, it goes along with my book, which is basically making the argument that belief

45:45.460 --> 45:51.860
 in nonhuman intelligence or ETs or UFOs, UAPs, whatever you want to call them, is a new form

45:51.860 --> 45:52.820
 of religion.

45:52.820 --> 45:57.460
 And how does that work with the scientific method?

45:58.260 --> 46:03.700
 Do you think there's always this role of religion as being, in its broad definition of religion,

46:03.700 --> 46:09.700
 as being a complement to our sort of very rigorous empirical pursuit of understanding

46:09.700 --> 46:10.500
 reality?

46:10.500 --> 46:12.660
 There's always going to be this coupling.

46:12.660 --> 46:19.300
 We'll always define, redefine new eras of civilization of what that religion actually

46:19.300 --> 46:19.780
 looks like.

46:19.780 --> 46:25.220
 So you talk about technology and so on being the modern set of religious beliefs around

46:25.220 --> 46:25.700
 that.

46:26.420 --> 46:27.860
 So is that always going to...

46:27.860 --> 46:33.620
 Is religion always going to kind of cover the space of things we can't quite understand

46:33.620 --> 46:36.740
 with science yet, but we still want to be thinking about?

46:37.460 --> 46:38.340
 Oh, I see what you're saying.

46:38.340 --> 46:39.300
 That's a great question.

46:39.780 --> 46:45.860
 When you say religion, I would use the word religiosity because I think that we're moving

46:45.860 --> 46:51.060
 out of the dogmatic types of religions into more of a, I hate to put it this way, but

46:51.060 --> 46:56.660
 an X Files type religion where we can say, I want to believe, or the truth is out there,

46:56.660 --> 47:01.060
 but we don't know that it's out there, or we don't know yet what it is, but we know

47:01.060 --> 47:01.860
 it's out there.

47:01.860 --> 47:08.740
 So there's this kind of built in capacity for belief in something that we don't have

47:08.740 --> 47:11.620
 evidence for yet, and that's a sort of faith.

47:11.620 --> 47:15.060
 So I would say yes to that question, absolutely.

47:15.060 --> 47:16.660
 I think it's adaptive in that way.

47:16.660 --> 47:17.860
 We're moving into a new...

47:17.860 --> 47:20.500
 I mean, heck, we've already moved into this culture.

47:20.500 --> 47:22.740
 Most people have not caught up with it yet.

47:22.740 --> 47:31.140
 I see that in the school systems, and I think that I'm hoping we can catch up fast because

47:31.140 --> 47:32.820
 really it's moving faster than we are.

47:33.780 --> 47:41.300
 So I mentioned to you offline that I'm finishing up on the rise and fall of the Third Reich.

47:41.300 --> 47:47.700
 I'm not sure if you have anything in your exploration, interesting to say, but the use

47:47.700 --> 47:53.940
 of religion by dictators or the lack of the use of religion by dictators, whether we're

47:53.940 --> 47:59.700
 talking about Stalin, which is mostly secular, I apologize if I'm historically incorrect

47:59.700 --> 48:02.340
 on this, but I believe it's secular.

48:02.340 --> 48:09.780
 And Hitler, I think there's some controversy about how much religion played a role in his

48:09.780 --> 48:16.500
 own personal life and in general in terms of influencing the...

48:18.900 --> 48:24.100
 using it to manipulate the public, but definitely the church played a role.

48:25.060 --> 48:30.660
 Do you have a sense of the use of religion by governments to control the populations,

48:31.380 --> 48:38.980
 by dictators, for example, or is that outside of your little explorations as a religious

48:38.980 --> 48:39.780
 scholar?

48:39.780 --> 48:42.980
 It's not outside of my framework, absolutely not.

48:43.540 --> 48:45.940
 I think that it's done routinely.

48:46.980 --> 48:54.180
 Propaganda is done routinely, especially there's nothing more powerful than religion to get

48:54.180 --> 48:56.260
 people to act, I think.

49:00.020 --> 49:06.180
 My mother's Jewish and my father was Roman Catholic, okay, from Irish extraction.

49:06.180 --> 49:16.580
 And so, both great grandparents came here under duress because they were being, what

49:16.580 --> 49:22.180
 would you call it, there was an act of genocide on both sides being done by other cultures,

49:22.180 --> 49:22.420
 okay?

49:22.420 --> 49:26.100
 So, on the one hand, obviously, we know about the Holocaust, okay?

49:26.100 --> 49:30.420
 So, they came, the great grandparents came here to avoid that and they made it.

49:30.420 --> 49:38.740
 On the other hand, there was an English genocide, we just have to say it, of the Irish, it was

49:38.740 --> 49:42.740
 called a famine, but it wasn't fun, it was a staged thing.

49:42.740 --> 49:49.060
 And so, millions of Irish left Ireland on coffin ships is what they called them because

49:49.060 --> 49:52.580
 they usually wouldn't get here, mine happened to get here, okay?

49:52.580 --> 49:55.220
 So, that's the context that I'm coming from.

49:55.220 --> 50:03.700
 So, in each case, for one thing, Irish weren't considered, Catholics weren't considered,

50:03.700 --> 50:08.180
 they were considered to be terrible and there was a lot of anti Catholic rhetoric here in

50:08.180 --> 50:13.620
 the United States, which is kind of strange because one of the, in fact, the most wealthy

50:13.620 --> 50:17.460
 colonial family were the Carrolls in Maryland and they were Catholic.

50:17.460 --> 50:21.780
 So, when you look at the United States, at our history, and you see the separation of

50:21.780 --> 50:24.340
 church and state, do you wanna know where that came from?

50:24.340 --> 50:31.140
 That came from those guys, they convinced George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, I

50:31.140 --> 50:38.740
 mean, they couldn't vote, yet they have their names on the constitution, is that not a strange

50:38.740 --> 50:39.380
 contradiction?

50:40.420 --> 50:47.060
 So, here you can see how propaganda works, there was anti Catholic propaganda, there

50:47.060 --> 50:54.340
 was anti Jewish propaganda and a lot of it was that these people weren't human, they

50:54.340 --> 50:55.220
 weren't human beings.

50:55.780 --> 51:02.340
 Another thing I'd like to say is that when the Irish did come here, they were indentured,

51:02.340 --> 51:09.460
 a lot of times indentured servants, but that's terminology, what is an indentured servant?

51:10.900 --> 51:11.860
 Slave.

51:11.860 --> 51:12.340
 Pretty much.

51:12.340 --> 51:20.500
 So, in that sense, religion can be used derogatorily as a useful grouping mechanism of

51:20.500 --> 51:21.860
 saying, this is the other.

51:22.500 --> 51:29.460
 And it's powerful too, because behind it is a force of what people contend to be sacred,

51:29.460 --> 51:31.140
 a sacred force, right?

51:31.140 --> 51:38.420
 So, it's up to God to decide who's, so you have to go along with what God says, of course.

51:38.420 --> 51:42.660
 Well, that's basically, that's not the contact event.

51:42.660 --> 51:49.300
 The contact event is usually some type of very specific, legitimate event that a person

51:49.300 --> 51:53.060
 has with something that is non human or considered divine.

51:54.100 --> 52:02.420
 But when religions become narrativized, I would call it, by different institutions,

52:02.420 --> 52:04.580
 that's when you're in danger of getting propaganda.

52:04.580 --> 52:07.380
 You said Nietzsche, one of your favorite philosophers.

52:07.380 --> 52:12.980
 He said, famously, one of the many famous things he said is that God is dead.

52:13.620 --> 52:14.120
 Yes.

52:14.740 --> 52:15.940
 What do you think he meant?

52:16.740 --> 52:17.780
 Do you think he was right?

52:18.740 --> 52:19.300
 Okay, good.

52:19.300 --> 52:20.260
 I love this question.

52:20.260 --> 52:21.700
 No one asks me about Nietzsche.

52:24.260 --> 52:25.540
 And I love Nietzsche.

52:25.540 --> 52:30.420
 Okay, so first, actually, I do think, and I could be corrected and probably will be in

52:30.420 --> 52:33.620
 all the comments, but I think that's a good question.

52:33.620 --> 52:38.260
 Well, first, Nietzsche, it's true, wasn't the first to say God is dead.

52:38.260 --> 52:40.100
 I think Hegel said it, okay?

52:40.100 --> 52:41.220
 No one reads Hegel.

52:41.220 --> 52:44.260
 He's like so difficult to read that it's impossible.

52:44.260 --> 52:45.620
 Same with Heidegger, as you mentioned.

52:46.500 --> 52:48.260
 I love him, but yeah, he's really hard to read.

52:48.980 --> 52:51.060
 So Nietzsche basically said God is dead.

52:51.060 --> 52:53.540
 And let me give you the context for him saying that.

52:53.540 --> 52:54.580
 He also said this.

52:54.580 --> 52:56.340
 He said there was only one Christian.

52:56.340 --> 52:58.740
 He died on the cross, okay?

52:58.740 --> 53:02.420
 So he despised Christianity.

53:02.420 --> 53:03.780
 And he said that...

53:03.780 --> 53:05.460
 And the people who practice it.

53:05.460 --> 53:06.420
 Absolutely, yeah.

53:06.420 --> 53:09.300
 But again, he believed in Jesus, and he believed Jesus was...

53:09.300 --> 53:10.980
 He didn't believe He was a divinity.

53:10.980 --> 53:14.500
 He believed Jesus was a good man, and he died on the cross, okay?

53:14.500 --> 53:16.100
 So he believed in the morality of Jesus.

53:16.100 --> 53:17.220
 Yeah, he absolutely did.

53:17.220 --> 53:17.860
 Yeah, he did.

53:18.980 --> 53:23.300
 And Nietzsche basically was making a historical statement about God is dead.

53:24.260 --> 53:25.380
 And he was right.

53:25.380 --> 53:31.860
 He was basically saying that in the century in which he lived, and he died, I think, in 1900.

53:31.860 --> 53:34.020
 Again, I could be wrong about that.

53:34.020 --> 53:36.820
 So I just want to say that I believe he died in 1900.

53:36.820 --> 53:39.540
 Okay, so he's writing in the 1800s.

53:39.540 --> 53:44.260
 And he's basically saying God is dead, and we killed Him, okay?

53:44.260 --> 53:49.380
 So he's making a historical statement that at that point in time, with science just kind

53:49.380 --> 54:00.100
 of getting better and industrialization happening, the idea of this thing beyond

54:00.100 --> 54:04.260
 what we know as material reality is dead.

54:05.060 --> 54:10.100
 So the substrate of Western civilization is dead.

54:10.100 --> 54:13.540
 That's what Nietzsche is saying, if that makes sense.

54:13.540 --> 54:13.940
 Yes.

54:13.940 --> 54:20.660
 And he basically says with that comes the übermensch, okay, which is the superhuman.

54:20.660 --> 54:22.580
 And he says there aren't many of them.

54:22.580 --> 54:23.780
 He says, but they're going to come.

54:23.780 --> 54:26.580
 And he also talks about the philosophers of the future.

54:26.580 --> 54:29.860
 And he's speaking and writing to them, is my belief.

54:29.860 --> 54:35.620
 So he's basically telling you and me, because we're now the philosophers of his future.

54:35.620 --> 54:36.100
 Yeah.

54:36.100 --> 54:41.940
 He's basically telling us this is what's happening now, and look what it has done.

54:41.940 --> 54:49.380
 He says now everything is possible, all manner of terrible evil, because no one has the belief

54:49.380 --> 54:53.780
 in God anymore, the belief that there is an afterlife.

54:53.780 --> 54:54.980
 You asked about an afterlife.

54:54.980 --> 55:00.740
 So with this kind of belief in a morality comes this belief, you can have morals without

55:00.740 --> 55:01.940
 God, okay, people do.

55:01.940 --> 55:08.100
 But Christianity is this idea that you will reap what you sow.

55:08.100 --> 55:10.900
 So if people don't believe that anymore, what will happen?

55:10.900 --> 55:16.820
 And so that's what he's basically saying, is that the basic anchor for Western society

55:16.820 --> 55:17.620
 is now gone.

55:18.260 --> 55:19.380
 Do you think he was right?

55:19.380 --> 55:21.460
 Absolutely, absolutely right.

55:21.460 --> 55:27.860
 But then again, what do you think if we brought him back to life and he read American Cosmic,

55:27.860 --> 55:36.580
 your book, and he wrote, he tweeted about it, writing a review maybe for the, I don't

55:36.580 --> 55:38.180
 know what they post, for New York Times.

55:38.180 --> 55:42.580
 He'd be an editorial writer with a blue check mark on Twitter.

55:43.860 --> 55:48.660
 What do you think he would say about this idea that you present that's a grander idea

55:48.660 --> 55:51.780
 of religion and, you know.

55:52.740 --> 55:54.900
 Like religiosity, like this new form.

55:54.900 --> 55:58.660
 Yeah, wouldn't that kind of reverse the idea that God is dead?

55:59.300 --> 56:05.540
 Yeah, because it would bring up this idea of external intelligences that are not human,

56:05.540 --> 56:08.980
 which is basically a lot of religions talk about that, right?

56:08.980 --> 56:14.020
 There are bodhisattvas, there are angels, there are demons, you know, there's all these

56:14.020 --> 56:20.020
 types of non human intelligences that religion makes space for.

56:20.020 --> 56:25.540
 So what I'm basically saying in American Cosmic is these new things are within the

56:25.540 --> 56:28.580
 realm of UFOs and UAPs.

56:28.580 --> 56:35.860
 So no, I think that, well, I think Nietzsche would say that that's a progressive adaptation

56:35.860 --> 56:38.500
 of religion is what I would hope he would say.

56:38.500 --> 56:41.620
 Nietzsche, however, is unpredictable, I think.

56:41.620 --> 56:43.460
 I couldn't predict him.

56:43.460 --> 56:51.540
 So I would say that it would be my hope that he would say this is an accurate representation

56:51.540 --> 56:54.100
 of a move into a new type of religion.

56:54.980 --> 56:57.300
 And it's adaptive, therefore, progressive.

56:57.940 --> 57:02.660
 He would probably be uncomfortable reading a book by a brilliant female professor.

57:02.660 --> 57:04.180
 Who happens also to be short.

57:06.340 --> 57:07.780
 I don't know if you read that.

57:07.780 --> 57:12.580
 He said some pretty nasty things about short women.

57:12.580 --> 57:14.100
 Oh, my God.

57:14.100 --> 57:15.140
 Yeah.

57:15.140 --> 57:16.100
 Oh, Nietzsche.

57:16.100 --> 57:17.140
 He should be canceled.

57:18.100 --> 57:20.020
 No, no, please don't cancel Nietzsche.

57:20.580 --> 57:22.740
 You have to take people in the context of their time.

57:23.780 --> 57:26.660
 Although I'm pretty sure in his time he was also an asshole.

57:26.660 --> 57:27.060
 He was.

57:28.740 --> 57:30.180
 But assholes are people too.

57:30.740 --> 57:31.060
 Okay.

57:31.620 --> 57:32.420
 Just bad ones.

57:32.420 --> 57:40.740
 You wrote the book, American Cosmic UFOs, Religion, Technology.

57:41.460 --> 57:43.140
 What was the goal of writing this book?

57:43.860 --> 57:46.340
 What, maybe we'll mention it.

57:46.340 --> 57:53.140
 We have already mentioned it many times, but in this little space of a conversation,

57:54.020 --> 57:59.540
 can you say maybe what is the key insight that you found that lingers with you to this day

57:59.540 --> 58:04.340
 from the process, the long process of putting this book together?

58:04.340 --> 58:04.840
 Sure.

58:05.380 --> 58:12.260
 Just like with my book on purgatory, I went into the research thinking that it would be something

58:12.260 --> 58:13.780
 that it was entirely not.

58:13.780 --> 58:15.780
 It ended up being something completely different.

58:15.780 --> 58:16.900
 And I think that's good.

58:16.900 --> 58:22.500
 I think that people who do research are very excited actually when their research surprises

58:22.500 --> 58:23.060
 them.

58:23.060 --> 58:30.100
 So I was happily surprised by my purgatory book to learn that it was a place.

58:30.100 --> 58:38.420
 And so I went into American Cosmic being a nonbeliever in UFOs entirely.

58:39.140 --> 58:42.100
 And I came out being agnostic.

58:42.820 --> 58:43.320
 Okay.

58:44.900 --> 58:45.700
 Kind of believer.

58:49.380 --> 58:49.880
 Yeah.

58:49.880 --> 58:54.520
 But agnostic, sort of open to the mysteries of the world.

58:54.520 --> 58:55.160
 Yes.

58:55.160 --> 59:04.520
 And I didn't think that, first of all, I knew that the government was part of the situation.

59:04.520 --> 59:06.280
 I just didn't know how much.

59:06.280 --> 59:19.880
 And so I learned that quickly and acclimated to it, accepted it, and noted that, indeed,

59:19.880 --> 59:27.400
 Horatio, the world is much more mysterious than we think it is.

59:28.680 --> 59:33.960
 There are more mysteries in this life than your philosophy provides for.

59:33.960 --> 59:41.400
 So is the sense American Cosmic is about the mysteries of the modern life as encapsulated

59:41.400 --> 59:46.760
 by the realm of technology and the realm of alien intelligences?

59:47.560 --> 59:48.060
 Yes.

59:52.920 --> 59:56.440
 I'd have to go off record as a professor and talk personally.

59:56.440 --> 1:00:05.560
 As a person, I do think that there are mysteries of which we have an inkling.

1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:13.480
 And if it's something as powerful as nonhuman intelligence, whether or not it's from another

1:00:13.480 --> 1:00:20.120
 planet, extraterrestrial, or it happens to be from another dimension or something else,

1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:26.280
 I think that this is going to get the attention of institutions of power.

1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:28.520
 And indeed, I think that's what has happened.

1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:39.640
 And although probably people have had interactions with these things, it appears to me historically

1:00:40.600 --> 1:00:49.640
 for a long time, as long as humans have existed, I would imagine that indeed this is something

1:00:49.640 --> 1:00:56.520
 that's quite powerful and could change the belief structures of our entire societies,

1:00:56.520 --> 1:00:58.040
 our civilization, basically.

1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:02.120
 So it's the same way that you're talking the belief structures were strongly affected

1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:06.280
 by religious beliefs throughout history in the same way this has the potential.

1:01:08.520 --> 1:01:18.600
 It serves as a source of concern for the powerful because it can have very significant effects

1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:19.720
 on the populace.

1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:26.040
 Is there some broader understanding of how we should think about alien intelligences

1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:33.240
 than like little green men that you can maybe elaborate on and talk about?

1:01:34.040 --> 1:01:34.680
 Yes.

1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:38.040
 This comes directly out of my research in Catholic history.

1:01:38.040 --> 1:01:43.320
 What I found was that let's take, for instance, this idea of an angel.

1:01:43.320 --> 1:01:45.480
 Okay, so we all think we know what an angel looks like.

1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:45.880
 Why?

1:01:45.880 --> 1:01:47.560
 Well, we've been told what an angel looks like.

1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:49.480
 We see what an angel looks like.

1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:52.760
 Throughout history, people have painted angels and they all look pretty much the same.

1:01:53.640 --> 1:02:02.040
 But actually, if you go to the primary sources on either in Hebrew or in Greek or in whatever

1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:09.320
 language and in Latin, and you look at experiences that people have talked about where they've

1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:16.040
 written down their experiences about angels, angels don't at all look like what we think

1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:18.440
 they look like. They don't look like little cherubs with wings.

1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:26.600
 They don't look like tall, strong, anthropomorphic, human looking things.

1:02:26.600 --> 1:02:27.160
 They don't.

1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:28.280
 They look really weird.

1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:32.520
 And sometimes they don't look at all humanoid.

1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:39.000
 They look like strange spinning things with eyes and things like that.

1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:42.120
 They communicate telepathically with us.

1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:47.560
 Okay, so what does that mean for the idea of extraterrestrials or what we consider to

1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:48.280
 be aliens?

1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:58.760
 Like, I do think that they're first, if we are, listen, I'm not the first to say this.

1:02:58.760 --> 1:03:05.240
 If we're in contact with nonhuman intelligence, we're most likely in contact with its technology.

1:03:06.280 --> 1:03:07.720
 Because think about us.

1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:11.480
 Do we send human beings to Mars yet?

1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:14.360
 Some people would say yes, but let's put that aside.

1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:15.640
 So no, we don't.

1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:16.760
 We use our technology.

1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:19.320
 We send our rovers to Mars, okay?

1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:26.600
 Okay, so if there's an extraterrestrial civilization, are they coming by themselves?

1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:28.040
 Are they coming to see us?

1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:29.800
 Or are they sending their technology?

1:03:29.800 --> 1:03:34.440
 Most likely they either are technology or they are sending their technology.

1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:37.960
 Yeah, there might be a gray area between what is technology and what the aliens are.

1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:43.400
 Yeah, so but you're saying like basically a robotic probe that would be the equivalent

1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:46.040
 of us, our human civilization created technology.

1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:52.120
 Way more advanced than what we could believe to be a probe, all right?

1:03:52.680 --> 1:04:03.240
 It's kind of funny to think about like if whatever sort of extraterrestrial creations

1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:09.320
 have visited Earth that we're interacting with some like dumb crappy drone technology.

1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:10.120
 Yeah, it's true.

1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:19.560
 And we're like building these like myths and so on from like an experience with some like

1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:22.680
 crappy drone made by some crappy startup somewhere.

1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:23.560
 That is correct.

1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:29.800
 When the actual intelligence is like something much grander.

1:04:29.800 --> 1:04:34.040
 Yeah, that's the more likely situation I describe.

1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:35.560
 That's what I like to tell people.

1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:38.360
 I'm like, no, it's probably a lot weirder than you think.

1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:39.880
 Yeah, oh boy.

1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:44.040
 So but what forms can it possibly take?

1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:51.240
 So like I really love this idea that I tend to be humble in the face of all that we don't

1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:57.560
 know and I tend to believe that the form alien life forms would take.

1:04:57.560 --> 1:05:04.360
 And the way they would communicate is much more likely to be of a form that we can't

1:05:04.360 --> 1:05:08.360
 even comprehend or perhaps can't even perceive directly.

1:05:08.360 --> 1:05:15.240
 So like, you know, it could be in the space of, you know, we don't understand most of

1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:16.440
 how our mind works.

1:05:16.440 --> 1:05:19.080
 It could be in the space of whatever the heck consciousness is.

1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:25.960
 Like maybe consciousness itself is communication with aliens.

1:05:25.960 --> 1:05:36.360
 Or like, I don't know, it could be just our own thoughts is actually the alien life forms

1:05:36.360 --> 1:05:37.160
 communicating.

1:05:37.720 --> 1:05:41.320
 Like, I know all that sounds crazy, but I'm saying like, I'm just trying to come up with

1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:45.480
 the craziest possible thing that doesn't make any sense that could very well be true.

1:05:45.480 --> 1:05:50.200
 And you can't say it's not true, because we don't understand basically anything about

1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:50.920
 our mind.

1:05:50.920 --> 1:05:57.000
 So it could be all of those things, everything from hallucinations, all the things that are

1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:05.000
 explored through the different drugs that we've talked about in this podcast in general.

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:09.080
 Joe Rogan loves to talk about DMT and all those kinds of hallucinogenic drugs.

1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:16.120
 All of it, including love and fear, all those things that could be aliens communicating

1:06:16.120 --> 1:06:20.200
 with us, memes on the internet that could be pretty sure here.

1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:22.840
 Pretty sure humor is alien communication.

1:06:22.840 --> 1:06:24.040
 No, I don't know.

1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:29.640
 But is there some way that's helpful for you to think about beyond the little green

1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:30.280
 men?

1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:31.240
 Oh, absolutely.

1:06:31.240 --> 1:06:34.520
 It accords exactly with how I think, actually.

1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:36.280
 So I'll explain.

1:06:38.280 --> 1:06:43.880
 I liked in American Cosmic, I attained the status of full professor.

1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:46.920
 So I was like, OK, I can pretty much write this book like I want to do it.

1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:47.560
 And I did.

1:06:47.560 --> 1:06:51.160
 So I used a lot of quotes from cool artists like David Bowie.

1:06:52.040 --> 1:06:56.280
 So David Bowie opens the book, and he basically says, and so does Nietzsche, by the way.

1:06:56.280 --> 1:07:00.760
 David Bowie and Nietzsche, boom, two awesome quotes right together.

1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:01.320
 That's how I opened my book.

1:07:01.320 --> 1:07:02.440
 No better opener.

1:07:02.440 --> 1:07:02.760
 Yeah.

1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:03.800
 Do you remember the quotes?

1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:04.760
 Yeah, of course.

1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:09.240
 So the first quote by David Bowie, and that's what I'm going to concentrate on in response

1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:12.120
 to what you just said, which I think is absolutely correct.

1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:15.560
 David Bowie said, the internet is an alien life form.

1:07:15.560 --> 1:07:21.640
 OK, and if you've not seen David Bowie's interview where he says that, I highly recommend it.

1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:22.920
 He's so brilliant.

1:07:22.920 --> 1:07:27.320
 OK, so David Bowie is actually quite brilliant about the idea of UFOs.

1:07:27.320 --> 1:07:29.800
 He's also brilliant about the idea of technology.

1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:34.760
 OK, and most people wouldn't think that, but I mean, he's pretty darn smart.

1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:36.360
 OK, so all right.

1:07:36.360 --> 1:07:37.880
 So I started to think about it.

1:07:37.880 --> 1:07:41.320
 And I also early on in my research met Jacques Vallée.

1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:42.840
 OK, so he's a technologist.

1:07:42.840 --> 1:07:48.360
 He has a Ph.D. in information technology from computer science, basically, from Northwestern.

1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:49.640
 And he got that back in the day.

1:07:49.640 --> 1:07:52.200
 You know, when I say back in the day, I'm not talking a thousand years ago.

1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:53.400
 I'm talking like in the 60s.

1:07:53.400 --> 1:07:58.280
 OK, so he's back when computer science wasn't really even the field you can get a degree.

1:07:58.280 --> 1:08:00.280
 Yeah, he has a Ph.D. in it.

1:08:00.280 --> 1:08:01.480
 And he's French.

1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:03.480
 He's from France, but he lives in Silicon Valley.

1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:06.760
 And he worked on ARPANET, which is the proto internet.

1:08:06.760 --> 1:08:07.720
 He mapped Mars.

1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:08.760
 He's also an astronomer.

1:08:08.760 --> 1:08:11.160
 I mean, he's just this all around brilliant guy, right?

1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:13.400
 And he's also interested in UFOs.

1:08:13.400 --> 1:08:17.800
 And most people take those two interests of his as separate interests.

1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:22.920
 And I remember being at a very small conference and listening to him, being in awe, of course,

1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:27.880
 because he's an awe inspiring person, and then thinking, wait a minute, why do people

1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:30.920
 compartmentalize those two things about him?

1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:32.360
 They're one in the same.

1:08:32.360 --> 1:08:39.000
 OK, so when we talk about UFOs and UAPs and stuff, we have to talk about digital technology

1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:40.120
 and things like that.

1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:41.160
 And things like that.

1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:47.800
 Now, if we're going back to what I so if I were to say what if I were to believe in and

1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:53.480
 I like I said earlier, I was agnostic bordering on belief, most likely a believer in these

1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:59.080
 this extraterrestrial or not extraterrestrial, let me put it another way, nonhuman intelligence

1:08:59.080 --> 1:09:00.520
 that's communicating with us.

1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:02.840
 I'm going to tell you how I think they communicate with us.

1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:04.600
 And I go back to the Greeks again.

1:09:04.600 --> 1:09:09.400
 OK, and the Greeks had this idea of muses, you know, the muses.

1:09:09.400 --> 1:09:13.960
 So, OK, so there are these things called muses and we tend to think of them as metaphors.

1:09:13.960 --> 1:09:14.520
 Right.

1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:16.040
 But what if they're not?

1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:20.280
 What if they're actually nonhuman intelligence trying to communicate with us, but we're so

1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:21.000
 stupid?

1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:22.120
 We can't like understand.

1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:29.240
 Like, so only people with like, you know, in super amazing capacities, like poetic,

1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:34.360
 creative, you know, intelligent, mathematical, whatever, you know, because they tend to do

1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:35.240
 this symbolically.

1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:38.360
 They tend to communicate with us in symbols form.

1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:43.000
 And so music, you know, symbols, we've got math that are, you know, it's a symbolic language.

1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:43.800
 And so what?

1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:49.480
 So, OK, so muses are probably a good idea for me of what this would be.

1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:55.560
 Now, would muses have spaceships, you know, or those things that we call physical counterparts

1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:56.920
 to what they are?

1:09:58.120 --> 1:09:59.800
 That's another question altogether.

1:09:59.800 --> 1:10:02.600
 But if, you know, I know why would I think this?

1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:08.280
 Because if you look at the history, there are space programs, both Russian and American,

1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:12.040
 you're going to find some pretty weird stuff, pretty weird history there, Lex.

1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:18.280
 So you want to get an idea, go back to Tchaikovsky and read a little bit about what he has to

1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:18.840
 say.

1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:23.720
 If you look back at the history of our space programs, the viable space programs are both

1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:32.920
 Russian and American, and each has an amazingly strange history because the founders of the

1:10:32.920 --> 1:10:37.240
 calculations that got us up into space, the rocket scientists, basically, were doing some

1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:40.120
 pretty weird rituals and doing religious things, right?

1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:45.000
 They weren't necessarily, like, Jack Parsons on our side was out in the desert with people

1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:51.560
 like L. Ron Hubbard and doing really intense rituals, believing that they were opening

1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:53.160
 stargates and things like that, OK?

1:10:53.160 --> 1:10:53.720
 That's awesome.

1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:55.400
 And they were really doing that, OK?

1:10:55.400 --> 1:11:03.800
 So then you go to the Russian side, and they had a very specific non dogmatic, according

1:11:03.800 --> 1:11:09.000
 to Catholics or Orthodox Christianity, idea of what Christianity was, and they believed

1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:13.240
 that they were interacting with angels, nonhuman intelligences.

1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:19.160
 So if you look back and you see muses, you can contextualize them within this tradition.

1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:23.720
 And so when I started to talk to people who were actually in the space program and who

1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:28.120
 were in these programs that now the government has said, oh, yeah, we do have these programs,

1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:30.840
 they have the same belief structures.

1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:34.760
 They believe that they were also in contact with these nonhuman intelligences, and they

1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:39.400
 were getting what they called downloads of information and creating, sometimes with Tyler

1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:44.920
 Dee in my book, creating technologies that were real, and they were selling them on NASDAQ

1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:50.200
 for a lot of money, like, say, $100 million or something like that, undisclosed amounts,

1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:52.040
 but a lot.

1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:58.280
 And these things are viable technologies that we use now, and they make our lives better,

1:11:58.280 --> 1:12:00.840
 and we progress as a species because of them.

1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:03.640
 Now, that has nothing to do with the scientific method.

1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:10.040
 As much as I know, as much as anybody's going to get angry at me for saying that, but sorry,

1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:16.200
 those were strange encounters that created our ability to go into space.

1:12:16.920 --> 1:12:19.960
 I don't know if they're real or not, but these people believe they were real.

1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:28.440
 YARO Right, so they have a power in actually having an impact on this world, in inspiring

1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:33.560
 humans to create technology, which enables us to do things we haven't been able to do before.

1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:34.040
 KATE Yeah.

1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:38.120
 YARO And these, I like how we're putting angels,

1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:48.920
 alien life forms, aliens, and technology all in the nonhuman intelligence camp, which I really

1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:52.840
 like that because that's very true.

1:12:53.640 --> 1:13:01.480
 It's this other source of wisdom, intelligence, maybe a connection to the mysterious.

1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:04.760
 KATE Yes, I was really surprised by it.

1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:09.800
 YARO Can you speak a little bit more to the connection

1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:19.000
 between aliens and technology that Jacques Vallée had in his own one individual mind,

1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:24.920
 that's very tempting to kind of separate as two separate endeavors.

1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:33.240
 Why did you come to believe that they are one and the same, or at least part of the same

1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:36.760
 intellectual journey?

1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:40.040
 KATE Thanks for asking that again, because nobody

1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:45.720
 asks me that question, and it's central to my project.

1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:50.280
 So Jacques was a huge influence, is a huge influence on me.

1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:53.000
 He taught me a lot.

1:13:54.760 --> 1:13:59.880
 He gave me access to some of his information that he keeps.

1:14:00.920 --> 1:14:04.520
 But a lot of his information is actually there out there for everyone to read.

1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:11.080
 He has an academia.edu page, so he didn't have this, unfortunately, when I was doing

1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:13.640
 my research in 2012 and 2013.

1:14:13.640 --> 1:14:16.600
 So I had to go back and do microfiche type stuff.

1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:20.200
 What I did was I began to read everything that he wrote, and he actually gave me a lot

1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:21.240
 of his books too.

1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:26.200
 And he told me, I remember, he dropped me off from, this is actually quite interesting

1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:31.720
 if you'll allow me to tell you a little story, and it also includes ayahuasca.

1:14:31.720 --> 1:14:35.560
 SIMON Great, every story that includes ayahuasca

1:14:35.560 --> 1:14:36.280
 is a great story.

1:14:36.280 --> 1:14:39.800
 KATE Okay, so I was at a conference, and it was

1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:45.240
 a small conference of very interesting people in California, on the Pacific Ocean.

1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:46.680
 And Jacques was there.

1:14:46.680 --> 1:14:49.160
 And this actually opens my book.

1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:53.480
 This is the, I go, it's the preface to my book.

1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:54.760
 I go on this ride.

1:14:54.760 --> 1:14:56.120
 He takes me through Silicon Valley.

1:14:56.760 --> 1:14:58.520
 I've lived there, right?

1:14:58.520 --> 1:15:03.000
 My grandparents grew up in the same place that he raised his children, in Belmont.

1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:09.080
 And so, but we were there with Robbie Graham, who's a great ufologist in his own right,

1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:11.560
 and film theorist.

1:15:12.120 --> 1:15:13.560
 I highly recommend his work.

1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:18.360
 So we were together, and he was taking us to San Francisco, where I was going to meet

1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:20.680
 my brother, who was going to take me home.

1:15:20.680 --> 1:15:24.360
 And so he took us on this long journey, and he talked to us.

1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:29.880
 And as we got out of the car, he gave me several of his books.

1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:33.080
 And one in particular he gave me, and he said, read this first.

1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:37.160
 And I was like, okay, I definitely will read that first.

1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:39.480
 Okay, so this is how the ayahuasca figures in.

1:15:39.480 --> 1:15:43.160
 So we were, I didn't take it, nor have I taken it.

1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:49.560
 Okay, so we were at this place in California, and Alex Gray and his wife were there.

1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:53.720
 And they were talking about their experiences with psychedelics.

1:15:53.720 --> 1:15:56.600
 He's an amazing visionary artist, okay?

1:15:56.600 --> 1:16:01.480
 So he believes that there's a place that you can enter, and he and his wife would enter

1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:06.760
 this space with either ayahuasca or LSD or something like that.

1:16:06.760 --> 1:16:11.560
 And they would not talk to each other, but they would be having the same exact experience.

1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:14.920
 So it was almost like having the same dream, right?

1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:23.480
 Okay, so somehow that whole event with Jacques there, and them talking about their experiences

1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:27.960
 in these realms, of which religious studies people are quite familiar, by the way, because

1:16:27.960 --> 1:16:30.680
 visionary experiences are what we study.

1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:36.280
 So all of this seems super familiar to me, and I recognized that immediately that Jacques,

1:16:38.200 --> 1:16:46.600
 that it hit me like, you know, very obvious that UFOs and these experiences and technology

1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:50.600
 all seemed, they were all meshed together.

1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:54.360
 And I knew that I had to take them, I knew I had to read everything Jacques ever wrote.

1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:59.240
 And the best stuff he's written, by the way, is his little essays that he wrote in the

1:16:59.240 --> 1:17:04.440
 1970s, and they were peer reviewed essays about the beginning of the internet and how a lot

1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:13.960
 of it was based on basically neural connection with the internet, like somehow psychic connection

1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:15.800
 through the internet with others and things like that.

1:17:15.800 --> 1:17:21.000
 So the brain is a biological neural network, there's this connection between visual neurons

1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:26.680
 and so on, and that's what ultimately is able to have memories and has cognitive ability

1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:31.400
 and is able to perceive the world and generate ideas.

1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:37.320
 And those ideas are then spread on the internet, even from the very early days to other humans.

1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:42.840
 So it gets injected or travels into the brains of other humans and that goes around in there

1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:45.880
 and then spits out other stuff and it goes back and forth.

1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:53.640
 So it's nice to think of the network that's in our mind, individual mind as, I mean, very

1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:59.160
 much even deeply connected to the network that is the connection between humans through

1:17:59.160 --> 1:18:00.200
 the internet.

1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:09.640
 And so in that sense, Jacques saw the internet as this powerful, as a source of power and

1:18:09.640 --> 1:18:11.400
 wisdom that is beyond our own.

1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:17.240
 Exactly, that's external to us, like if you could call it autonomous AI, right?

1:18:17.240 --> 1:18:21.400
 It's nonhuman intelligence in a sense, even though humans are a part of it.

1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:24.600
 Yes, or we're invaded by it or whatever you want to call it.

1:18:24.600 --> 1:18:28.040
 Yeah, whoever, right, it's the chicken and the egg, right.

1:18:28.040 --> 1:18:33.480
 So if I can go on, I don't want to experience things, I'm not done with that.

1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:41.880
 So this is where I come to this idea that we're in this space, we're in now a new space

1:18:41.880 --> 1:18:43.560
 of religion, of religiosity.

1:18:43.560 --> 1:18:48.200
 So what happens is then, and it's like a biosphere and I'll talk about that in a minute.

1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:55.800
 So Jacques takes us back, we get to San Francisco and my brother, who is your straight lace

1:18:55.800 --> 1:19:00.360
 person, army guy and everything like that, I get into his car and the first thing he

1:19:00.360 --> 1:19:04.600
 tells me is, I took ayahuasca and I was like, what?

1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:06.840
 And he goes, it's going to save humanity.

1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:07.880
 That's great.

1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:14.360
 As I mentioned to you offline, I talked to Matthew Johnson, he's a Hopkins professor

1:19:14.360 --> 1:19:22.440
 and he's really a scholar of most, he's studied most drugs, he's also really deeply studied

1:19:22.440 --> 1:19:28.320
 cocaine and all those stuff and negative effects and he's focused on a lot of positive effects

1:19:28.320 --> 1:19:29.560
 of the different psychedelics.

1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:31.000
 It's kind of fascinating.

1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:41.200
 So I'm very much interested in exploring the science of what these things do to the human

1:19:41.200 --> 1:19:43.880
 mind and also personally exploring it.

1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:50.480
 Although it's like this weird gray area, which he's masterful at, which is he's a professor

1:19:50.480 --> 1:19:55.920
 at John Hopkins, one of the most prestigious universities in the world and doing large

1:19:55.920 --> 1:20:03.360
 scale studies of this stuff and until he got a lot of money for these studies, even in

1:20:03.360 --> 1:20:05.520
 Hopkins itself, there's not much respect.

1:20:05.520 --> 1:20:12.600
 It's not even respect, it was like people just didn't want to talk about it as a legitimate

1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:13.600
 field of inquiry.

1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:21.800
 It's kind of fascinating how hesitant we are as a little human civilization to legitimize

1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:27.360
 the exploration of the mysterious, of whatever the definition of the mysterious is for that

1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:29.160
 particular period of time.

1:20:29.160 --> 1:20:32.360
 So for us now, there's like little groups of things.

1:20:32.360 --> 1:20:37.880
 I would say consciousness in the space of computer science research is something that's

1:20:37.880 --> 1:20:43.600
 still like, I don't know, maybe let philosophers kick it around for a little longer.

1:20:43.600 --> 1:20:55.200
 And then certainly extraterrestrial life forms in most formulations of that problem space

1:20:55.200 --> 1:21:01.080
 is still the other, it's still the source of the mysterious, except maybe like SETI,

1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:06.320
 which is like, how can we detect signals from far away alien intelligences that we'll be

1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:10.960
 able to perceive?

1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:15.440
 And psychedelics is another one of those that's like, we're starting to see, okay, well, can

1:21:15.440 --> 1:21:22.360
 we try to see if there's some medical applications of like helping you get, like he does studies

1:21:22.360 --> 1:21:27.600
 of help you quit smoking or help you in some kind of treatment of some disease.

1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:32.360
 And he's sneaking into that, I mean, it's like openly sneaking into it, he's doing studies

1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:40.160
 on it of like, how can you expand the mind with these tools and what can the mind discover

1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:42.480
 through psychedelics and so on.

1:21:42.480 --> 1:21:47.680
 And we're like slowly creeping into the space of being able to explore these mysterious

1:21:47.680 --> 1:21:48.680
 questions.

1:21:48.680 --> 1:21:55.200
 But it's like, it sucks that sometimes a lot of people have to die, meaning, sorry, they

1:21:55.200 --> 1:21:58.120
 have to age out.

1:21:58.120 --> 1:22:06.320
 Like it's like faculty have, and people have a fixed set of ideas and they stick by them.

1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:13.640
 In order for new ideas to come in, then the young folks have to be born with an open mind,

1:22:13.640 --> 1:22:18.280
 the possibility of those ideas, and then they have to become old enough and get A's in school

1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:21.800
 and whatever to then carry those ideas forward.

1:22:21.800 --> 1:22:27.360
 So the acceptance of the exploration of the mysterious takes time.

1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:28.360
 It's kind of sad.

1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:30.040
 It is sad.

1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:31.580
 I agree.

1:22:31.580 --> 1:22:38.280
 Maybe to go into my source of passion, which is artificial intelligence.

1:22:38.280 --> 1:22:48.520
 What's your sense about the possibility, like Pamela McCordick has this quote that I like,

1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:57.280
 I talked to her a couple of years ago, I guess already on this podcast, that artificial intelligence

1:22:57.280 --> 1:23:00.580
 began with the ancient wish to forge the gods.

1:23:00.580 --> 1:23:14.080
 So do you think artificial intelligence may become the very kind of gods that were at

1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:17.320
 the center of our, the religions of most of our history?

1:23:17.320 --> 1:23:19.680
 Yeah, there's a lot there.

1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:26.640
 So I'm going to start by addressing this idea of artificial intelligence being separate

1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:27.960
 from human beings.

1:23:27.960 --> 1:23:34.680
 So I don't think that's actually, that might happen.

1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:36.960
 I mean, it's already happened, but let's put it this way.

1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:42.320
 You're talking about super artificial intelligence, like autonomous, conscious artificial intelligence?

1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:43.320
 Yes.

1:23:43.320 --> 1:23:44.320
 Okay, yeah.

1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:45.320
 Something with artificial consciousness.

1:23:45.320 --> 1:23:52.960
 First of all, I think she's correct, but also there's an awesome quote.

1:23:52.960 --> 1:24:00.640
 I'd also like to bring up this writer of fiction, actually, Ted Chiang, and one of his essays,

1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:01.840
 he writes short essays.

1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:06.160
 One of them was The Basis for the Movie Arrival, which if you haven't seen it, it's a really

1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:15.380
 great movie about UFOs, and it has a very creative way of proposing an idea of how they

1:24:15.380 --> 1:24:20.900
 might be able to communicate, first of all, how they appear to us, and second of all,

1:24:20.900 --> 1:24:24.200
 how they may be communicating with us humans.

1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:25.200
 Exactly.

1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:32.200
 The author Ted Chiang has a lot, I recommend his writings, his short stories.

1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:40.360
 One is very short, and it appeared in Nature about 20 years ago, and it is called, I think

1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:45.480
 it's called Eating the Crumbs from the Table or something like that, and it's basically

1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:52.280
 this short essay, and I hate to do a spoiler here, but if you don't want to know what it's

1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:54.240
 about, don't listen right now for five minutes.

1:24:54.240 --> 1:24:55.240
 Yeah, spoiler alert.

1:24:55.240 --> 1:24:56.240
 Yeah.

1:24:56.240 --> 1:24:57.240
 Okay.

1:24:57.240 --> 1:24:58.240
 So this is what it's about.

1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:03.760
 So basically it's about human beings becoming two different species, okay?

1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:09.240
 And one of them is created, they're called metahumans, and they start biohacking themselves

1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:10.240
 with tech.

1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:11.240
 Okay?

1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:12.240
 Sound familiar?

1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:19.120
 So they do this, and they become metahumans and another species, right, and just kind

1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:28.120
 of another fork, such that humans can barely understand them because they're so far removed.

1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:32.040
 So in a sense, are they gods, right?

1:25:32.040 --> 1:25:35.440
 No, they're metahumans, they're superhumans, they're enhanced humans, okay?

1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:38.360
 I see that hopefully on the horizon, frankly.

1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:39.580
 I hope so.

1:25:39.580 --> 1:25:46.260
 Not that we have two species, but that we can use our technology or we can become so

1:25:46.260 --> 1:25:50.160
 integrated with our technology that we can survive, okay?

1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:53.040
 We can survive the radiation in space.

1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:56.080
 We can't go places now because of the radiation in space.

1:25:56.080 --> 1:26:01.120
 Perhaps we can develop our bodies such that we can survive the radiation in space.

1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:03.240
 So there's this idea of these metahumans.

1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:09.400
 Now, there's also this idea that technology is just another form of humans.

1:26:09.400 --> 1:26:11.000
 We've created it, right?

1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:18.140
 And so maybe it is bent on surviving, thereby using us kind of as a meme or a team.

1:26:18.140 --> 1:26:23.480
 Some people are calling them teams now, these self generating, they're replicating themselves

1:26:23.480 --> 1:26:24.960
 through us, okay?

1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:29.160
 I see that also, and I don't think that's terribly bad.

1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:32.100
 Maybe it's just the way that we are evolving.

1:26:32.100 --> 1:26:37.600
 It doesn't mean that we're evolving all the time, like we're taller than we used to be,

1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:40.700
 we have different skills.

1:26:40.700 --> 1:26:43.340
 So I don't see that as a bad thing.

1:26:43.340 --> 1:26:47.600
 I think a lot of people see it as if we're not how we are now, it's a tragedy.

1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:48.700
 But it's not a tragedy.

1:26:48.700 --> 1:26:51.440
 How we are now is actually a tragedy for most people alive.

1:26:51.440 --> 1:26:54.760
 Yeah, and we might be evolving in ways we can't possibly perceive.

1:26:54.760 --> 1:27:02.960
 Like you said, that humans have created Twitter and Twitter may be changing us in ways that

1:27:02.960 --> 1:27:06.320
 we can't even understand now, currently.

1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:10.240
 From a perspective, if you look at the entirety of the network of Twitter, that might be an

1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:20.560
 organism that the organism understands what's happening from its level of perception.

1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:25.680
 But we humans are just like the cells of the human body, we're interacting individually,

1:27:25.680 --> 1:27:29.280
 but we're not actually aware of the big picture that's happening.

1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:33.680
 And we naturally somehow, or whatever the force that's creating the entirety of this,

1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:42.040
 whatever one version of it is the evolutionary process, like biological evolution, whatever

1:27:42.040 --> 1:27:46.440
 force that is, is just creating these greater and greater level of complexity, and maybe

1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:55.000
 somehow not other kinds of non human intelligence are involved that we're calling alien intelligences.

1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:01.320
 So just to step back, and we'll come back to AI, because I love the topic, but through

1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:05.680
 American Cosmic and in general, you've interacted with much of the UFO community, you mentioned

1:28:05.680 --> 1:28:06.680
 ufologists.

1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:12.680
 By the way, is it ufologists or is it ufologists?

1:28:12.680 --> 1:28:13.680
 It's ufologists.

1:28:13.680 --> 1:28:14.680
 Ufologists.

1:28:14.680 --> 1:28:15.680
 Yeah.

1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:17.700
 So first of all, what is a ufologist?

1:28:17.700 --> 1:28:23.840
 And second of all, what have you learned about this community of ufologists?

1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:30.880
 Or also as you refer to them as the invisibles, or the members of the invisible college, or

1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:35.280
 just in general, people who study UFOs from the different, all the different kinds of

1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:36.880
 groups that study UFOs?

1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:37.880
 Sure.

1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:43.600
 Generally, what I found is that they are okay, so people who are interested in UFOs from

1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:48.440
 like being a kid, you know, and seeing some cool movie like Star Wars or something, and

1:28:48.440 --> 1:28:54.760
 then they become interested, and then they study it as best they can, UFOs, or UAPs.

1:28:54.760 --> 1:29:00.800
 They're generally an honest group of people who are using their tools, and they're generally

1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:03.360
 two types of them.

1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:06.880
 There are those who believe in the nuts and bolts, like the physical craft, and they believe

1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:10.400
 in that these are things from other planets, okay?

1:29:10.400 --> 1:29:15.800
 So that's like the ETH hypothesis, you know.

1:29:15.800 --> 1:29:19.480
 I'm sorry, ETH hypothesis, ETH is what we call it.

1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:20.480
 Yeah.

1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:21.480
 Sorry about that.

1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:26.840
 So this is like there's an actual spaceship, like something akin, but much more advanced

1:29:26.840 --> 1:29:29.200
 than the rockets we use now.

1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:35.240
 And there's some kind of, not necessarily biological, but something like biological

1:29:35.240 --> 1:29:37.680
 organisms that travel on these spaceships.

1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:38.680
 Yes.

1:29:38.680 --> 1:29:43.960
 So this would be like what, to the Star Academy, is trying to decipher, like how, you know,

1:29:43.960 --> 1:29:44.960
 how do they do it?

1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:48.760
 You know, maybe we could use that technology, the propulsion and things like that.

1:29:48.760 --> 1:29:50.280
 They look at the rocket technology.

1:29:50.280 --> 1:29:54.840
 Okay, so there are those, and then there are people who believe that it's more consciousness

1:29:54.840 --> 1:29:55.840
 based, okay?

1:29:55.840 --> 1:30:01.880
 So these are your two types of ufologists who are known, and these are people who we

1:30:01.880 --> 1:30:02.980
 know about.

1:30:02.980 --> 1:30:08.400
 Then I found that there are people who are, quote, unquote, I call them the invisibles,

1:30:08.400 --> 1:30:13.920
 because Jacques Vallée in the 70s, he and I think actually Allen Hynek, his colleague

1:30:13.920 --> 1:30:19.160
 quoted, this is a Francis Bacon thing, by the way, it goes back to the early modern

1:30:19.160 --> 1:30:24.920
 time period when scientists could be killed for basically trying to go outside with the

1:30:24.920 --> 1:30:29.800
 church or the government institution determined was dogma.

1:30:29.800 --> 1:30:31.240
 And so they had to be really careful.

1:30:31.240 --> 1:30:33.680
 So he called it the invisible college.

1:30:33.680 --> 1:30:39.920
 So Hynek took that term and reused it, or what do you call it, repurposed it.

1:30:39.920 --> 1:30:41.080
 So he repurposed it.

1:30:41.080 --> 1:30:44.360
 So they were still talking to each other, though.

1:30:44.360 --> 1:30:48.920
 So what I found to be the case was that there was a group of people who were scientists

1:30:48.920 --> 1:30:51.380
 but were not on the internet.

1:30:51.380 --> 1:30:57.280
 You know, people today, and students of mine in particular, and my own kids, actually,

1:30:57.280 --> 1:31:01.260
 they think that you only exist if you're on the internet or something only exists if it's

1:31:01.260 --> 1:31:02.260
 on the internet.

1:31:02.260 --> 1:31:04.040
 And that's, of course, untrue.

1:31:04.040 --> 1:31:08.480
 And so what I found was that most people who are the most powerful people of our society

1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:10.800
 and are doing things are not on the internet.

1:31:10.800 --> 1:31:12.720
 You're not going to find any trace of them.

1:31:12.720 --> 1:31:18.960
 So a lot of these people are what I call invisibles, people who are studying, at least their work

1:31:18.960 --> 1:31:19.960
 is invisible.

1:31:19.960 --> 1:31:22.560
 You might find them on the internet, but you're going to find that they're part of the bowling

1:31:22.560 --> 1:31:24.000
 league or something like that.

1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:30.080
 You will not find that they are actually engaged in research about this topic.

1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:33.560
 And so I called them the invisibles because I was surprised to find them.

1:31:33.560 --> 1:31:37.320
 And I thought, well, this is no longer the invisible college because these people are

1:31:37.320 --> 1:31:39.040
 not even talking to each other.

1:31:39.040 --> 1:31:42.800
 And that's why I reference this movie Fight Club.

1:31:42.800 --> 1:31:49.480
 In it, you have an invisible, and his name is Tyler Durden, and he's incredible.

1:31:49.480 --> 1:31:52.280
 He does incredible things.

1:31:52.280 --> 1:31:58.380
 He's like a person who should not exist because he does so many things that are amazing.

1:31:58.380 --> 1:32:02.160
 And so I found a person like that, and he's a real person.

1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:07.280
 He's partially on the internet, but nothing that he does around that topic of UFOs is

1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:08.280
 on the internet.

1:32:08.280 --> 1:32:11.680
 So I decided to call him Tyler D after Tyler Durden.

1:32:11.680 --> 1:32:17.640
 And so these people, I've termed the UFO Fight Club because they work together, but they

1:32:17.640 --> 1:32:20.880
 don't know, in fact, his boss doesn't know what he does.

1:32:20.880 --> 1:32:25.080
 They don't talk to each other because, you know, the first rule of Fight Club.

1:32:25.080 --> 1:32:26.080
 Same as the second, yeah.

1:32:26.080 --> 1:32:27.080
 Exactly, yeah.

1:32:27.080 --> 1:32:28.080
 You don't talk about people.

1:32:28.080 --> 1:32:30.000
 No, you don't do it.

1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:36.560
 Why do you have a sense that there's such a, I don't want to say fear, but a principle

1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:39.080
 of staying out of the limelight?

1:32:39.080 --> 1:32:44.880
 I think there's something real, and I think that the use of it could be dangerous for

1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:45.880
 people.

1:32:45.880 --> 1:32:50.920
 Oh, sorry, you mean like something real, like there's actual, I don't know, what's the

1:32:50.920 --> 1:32:53.440
 right terminology here to use it?

1:32:53.440 --> 1:33:02.060
 Alien technology, ideas about technology that are being explored that are dangerous have

1:33:02.060 --> 1:33:05.760
 made public, that may become dangerous have made public.

1:33:05.760 --> 1:33:06.920
 So that's the word.

1:33:06.920 --> 1:33:09.120
 You don't have to call it alien technology.

1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:13.840
 You can call it ideas about alien technology because I don't know if it's actual alien

1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:14.840
 technology or not.

1:33:14.840 --> 1:33:16.040
 I honestly don't know.

1:33:16.040 --> 1:33:24.760
 But I do know for a fact, because it's a historical fact, that Jack Parsons and Konstantin Tchaikovsky,

1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:29.860
 who's Russian, believed in these things and believed that they were downloading this information.

1:33:29.860 --> 1:33:34.400
 Whether or not they were, I don't, I mean, they definitely created the rocket technologies.

1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:36.060
 That's true.

1:33:36.060 --> 1:33:41.280
 How they did and whether their process was exactly what they said it was, I don't know.

1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:42.640
 So this is the same thing today.

1:33:42.640 --> 1:33:46.040
 So we've got some powerful technologies going on here.

1:33:46.040 --> 1:33:50.720
 And of course we have a military and we have a military for a reason.

1:33:50.720 --> 1:33:53.200
 Almost every government who needs a military has one.

1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:59.720
 And so they're going to keep these the way they should be kept, in my interpretation.

1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:01.640
 I mean, think about it.

1:34:01.640 --> 1:34:03.800
 Everybody accepts the fact that we have a military.

1:34:03.800 --> 1:34:04.800
 Almost everybody does.

1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:08.880
 Why are they so upset then that the military keeps secrets?

1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:09.880
 Yeah.

1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:11.200
 Well, that's the nature of things.

1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:13.880
 We can get into that whole thing.

1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:22.760
 I tend to, I've spoken with the CTO Lockheed Martin on this, I obviously read and think

1:34:22.760 --> 1:34:23.760
 about war a lot.

1:34:23.760 --> 1:34:29.980
 It's such a difficult question because this space, this particular space of technology,

1:34:29.980 --> 1:34:34.600
 there's a gray area that I think is evolving over time.

1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:40.480
 I think nuclear weapons change the game in terms of what should and shouldn't be secret.

1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:45.920
 I think there's already technology that will enable us to destroy each other.

1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:49.680
 And so there's some sense in which some technology should be made public.

1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:56.280
 This is the same discussion of, you know, between companies, which part of your technology

1:34:56.280 --> 1:35:01.440
 should you make public through like, for example, academic publications and all that kind of

1:35:01.440 --> 1:35:02.440
 stuff.

1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:07.640
 Like how the Google search engine works, PageRank algorithm, or how the different deep learning,

1:35:07.640 --> 1:35:12.660
 like there's pretty vibrant machine learning research communities within Google, Facebook

1:35:12.660 --> 1:35:13.720
 and so on.

1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:16.080
 And they release a lot of different ideas.

1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:20.960
 It's an interesting question, like how dangerous is it to release some of the ideas?

1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:24.440
 I think it's a gray area that's constantly changing.

1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:27.440
 I do also think it's super interesting.

1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:35.260
 I wonder if you could elaborate on a little bit that there's this gray area between what's

1:35:35.260 --> 1:35:43.720
 actually real in terms of alien technology and the belief of it when held in the minds

1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:49.720
 of really brilliant people that they ultimately may produce the same kind of result in terms

1:35:49.720 --> 1:35:56.920
 of being able to create new technologies that are human usable.

1:35:56.920 --> 1:36:08.920
 Like is there, in your mind, they're one in the same as like believing in alien craft

1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:12.080
 and actually being in possession of an alien craft?

1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:14.240
 I don't think they're the same, no.

1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:17.800
 Belief is powerful, okay?

1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:22.440
 In new age communities, you know, people think thoughts are things, okay?

1:36:22.440 --> 1:36:24.280
 That's been said, you know, thoughts are things.

1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:27.080
 You can make them happen kind of thing, believe in them enough.

1:36:27.080 --> 1:36:34.920
 It is true that if I believe I can run a 540 mile, I'll do it, okay, and I probably will

1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:35.920
 do it.

1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:41.040
 And I've done it before actually, much younger, but I did it.

1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:44.240
 But my coach is the one that instilled that belief in me, right?

1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:48.240
 And so, but can I run like a one minute mile?

1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:49.240
 No.

1:36:49.240 --> 1:36:50.240
 Okay.

1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:51.720
 So I guess, does that answer your question?

1:36:51.720 --> 1:36:55.480
 Like there's only so far belief goes in generating reality.

1:36:55.480 --> 1:36:56.480
 Well, yeah.

1:36:56.480 --> 1:37:04.080
 I mean, I guess that's what, just having listened to Jacques Vallée, it seemed like reality

1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:10.880
 is not, was not as important for the scientific exploration of the concept of alien technology.

1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:13.880
 I could be wrong, but this is what I think Jacques getting at.

1:37:13.880 --> 1:37:20.960
 There are other ways to access places in reality other than what we consider to be physical.

1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:23.720
 There's consciousness, okay?

1:37:23.720 --> 1:37:30.760
 So like I said, so religious studies is, among other things, it's looking at visionary experiences,

1:37:30.760 --> 1:37:31.760
 all right?

1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:33.400
 So people do have visionary experiences.

1:37:33.400 --> 1:37:39.440
 They did without drugs, they did with drugs, they do with drugs, they do, many have them

1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:40.960
 without drugs today.

1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:46.540
 And oftentimes those visionary experiences correspond to each other.

1:37:46.540 --> 1:37:48.880
 Now how do we make sense of that?

1:37:48.880 --> 1:37:52.080
 So do these places actually exist?

1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:54.080
 In a sense, I think they do.

1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:59.880
 And so I think that, let's take that very famous case of a Virgin Mary apparition in

1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:04.520
 Fatima where I think there was like a lot of people, thousands and thousands, if not

1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:10.640
 like I think 50,000 or something like that, a lot of people gathered to see what's now

1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:14.840
 called the miracle of Fatima, which was the spinning of the sun.

1:38:14.840 --> 1:38:20.280
 Well, a lot of people saw different things, but they all saw some kind of thing, okay?

1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:25.920
 So they all saw different things, but it was, something happened, okay?

1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:36.280
 So I guess the question is, what are these places where we access what I'd call like

1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:38.680
 nonphysical realities, okay?

1:38:38.680 --> 1:38:42.480
 Where we actually do get information, like who could say that Jack Parsons didn't get

1:38:42.480 --> 1:38:45.400
 information from doing these rituals and accessing these?

1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:50.260
 We have to say that he actually did because we see the results, the physical results.

1:38:50.260 --> 1:38:55.840
 The same thing with Tyler, and that's why I put Tyler in this camp with this tradition

1:38:55.840 --> 1:38:56.880
 with Jack Parsons.

1:38:56.880 --> 1:39:03.600
 I say that Tyler is getting these, what he calls downloads, and you can see the results

1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:05.640
 of them physically.

1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:06.640
 He sells them on the Nasdaq.

1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:08.580
 He makes millions of dollars from them.

1:39:08.580 --> 1:39:09.720
 They help people.

1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:14.280
 I've seen people who they've helped, okay?

1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:22.960
 Do you think psychedelics that I just mentioned earlier have a possibility of going to these

1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:34.160
 kind of, same kind of places of exploring ideas that are outside of our more commonplace

1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:37.160
 understanding of the world?

1:39:37.160 --> 1:39:41.440
 In my, yeah, I think so, absolutely, however, I think we have to be really careful about

1:39:41.440 --> 1:39:48.280
 those because young people or people in general, I should say, absolutely can get hurt by them.

1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:53.480
 I mean, but we get hurt by alcohol, you know, we drive our cars and we kill each other.

1:39:53.480 --> 1:40:01.080
 But psychedelics are really interesting because I know that within the history of our country,

1:40:01.080 --> 1:40:08.320
 we have used psychedelics in various capacities for our military in order to try to stimulate

1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:13.800
 ideas and access places and information that can't be accessed normally.

1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:14.800
 This is all fact.

1:40:14.800 --> 1:40:15.800
 Yeah.

1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:20.320
 I talked to Matt for like four hours, so we ran out of time being able to talk, but I

1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:25.240
 wanted to talk to him about MK Alter and Ted Kaczynski.

1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:27.200
 There's so many mysterious things there.

1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:31.680
 There's like layers of what's known or what's not known, it's fascinating.

1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:37.320
 But I think what is interesting is psychedelics were used or were attempted to be used as

1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:40.020
 tools of different kinds.

1:40:40.020 --> 1:40:41.020
 That's the point.

1:40:41.020 --> 1:40:48.440
 So like we think of technology as tools to enable us to do things in that same way that

1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:54.640
 psychedelics, like many drugs could be used as tools, some more effective than others.

1:40:54.640 --> 1:40:55.640
 Absolutely.

1:40:55.640 --> 1:41:03.080
 I'm not sure what you can do effectively with alcohol, although I think somebody commented

1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:10.120
 somewhere on social media that, I don't know why everyone is so negative about alcohol

1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:17.180
 because I think the person said that it's given me some of the most incredible, it enabled

1:41:17.180 --> 1:41:23.320
 me to let go and have some of the most incredible experiences with friends in my life.

1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:24.320
 And it's true.

1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:28.080
 People sometimes say alcohol is dangerous, it can make you do horrible.

1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:36.760
 But the reality is it's also a fascinating tool for letting go of trying to be somebody

1:41:36.760 --> 1:41:41.520
 maybe that you're not and allowing you to be yourself fully in whatever crazy form that

1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:46.680
 is and allow you to have really deep and interesting experiences with those you love.

1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:53.600
 So yeah, even alcohol can be used as an effective tool for exploring experiences and becoming

1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:57.720
 expanding your mind and becoming a better person.

1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:02.840
 So what the hell was I talking about?

1:42:02.840 --> 1:42:11.200
 So yes, so psychedelics and MK Ultra, is there something interesting to say in our historical

1:42:11.200 --> 1:42:12.200
 use of psychedelics?

1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:15.880
 I mean, think about it, when did we start doing that?

1:42:15.880 --> 1:42:17.320
 When did we start using those?

1:42:17.320 --> 1:42:18.320
 That's true.

1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:20.440
 It's quite a long time ago, right?

1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:26.720
 But okay, but true, but when did our government start experimenting with them with us?

1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:28.480
 Our government is the United States government.

1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:29.480
 Yeah.

1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:30.480
 Okay.

1:42:30.480 --> 1:42:33.680
 So that happened in around the 1950s.

1:42:33.680 --> 1:42:42.480
 After quote unquote, the 1940s, where we have 47 and we have this Roswell type stuff going

1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:45.500
 on, like crash sites and things like that.

1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:50.640
 So I think that there might be a correlation there.

1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:52.600
 I don't know what it is.

1:42:52.600 --> 1:42:53.600
 But I do think...

1:42:53.600 --> 1:42:54.600
 That's fascinating actually.

1:42:54.600 --> 1:42:55.600
 Yeah.

1:42:55.600 --> 1:42:59.480
 A lot of interesting things started around that time period.

1:42:59.480 --> 1:43:04.960
 And so Aldous Huxley would say, we opened the doors of perception, okay, and what flew

1:43:04.960 --> 1:43:05.960
 in.

1:43:05.960 --> 1:43:10.800
 Oh man, that was beautifully put.

1:43:10.800 --> 1:43:18.640
 It'd be interesting to get your opinions on certain more concrete sightings that are sort

1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:26.240
 of monumental sightings with alien intelligences in the history, in the recent history that

1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:32.560
 at least I'm aware of, I'm not very much aware of this history.

1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:38.720
 But the most recent one, I've spoken with David Fravor on this podcast, I really like

1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:39.720
 him as a person.

1:43:39.720 --> 1:43:44.160
 He's a fun guy, but also he's gotten a chance to...

1:43:44.160 --> 1:43:50.200
 He's described his account of having an experience with what he and others now term the TikTok

1:43:50.200 --> 1:43:51.200
 UFO.

1:43:51.200 --> 1:43:56.240
 What do you think of that particular sighting, which has captivated the imagination of many

1:43:56.240 --> 1:44:01.520
 in particular because there's been videos released of it, of these UFOs.

1:44:01.520 --> 1:44:09.200
 But I find the videos to be way too blurry and grainy to be of interest to me personally,

1:44:09.200 --> 1:44:15.800
 to me the most fascinating thing is the first person account from David and others about

1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:16.860
 that experience.

1:44:16.860 --> 1:44:18.620
 But what are your thoughts?

1:44:18.620 --> 1:44:24.700
 Those videos have been out for a while, actually much, I think in the mid 2000s they were out.

1:44:24.700 --> 1:44:30.640
 But what you have is you have kind of like this corroboration from a group and also the

1:44:30.640 --> 1:44:34.040
 New York Times involvement in 2017.

1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:40.560
 My opinion about the TikToks is that first, I believe the people who have had the experiences,

1:44:40.560 --> 1:44:45.680
 I know some of them, like some of the radar people and things like that, they'd saw them

1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:46.680
 and they're not...

1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:48.480
 I don't believe they're making it up, okay.

1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:55.660
 I do think that this is being used as a spin, okay, and I'm just gonna say that.

1:44:55.660 --> 1:44:59.680
 And the reason I think that is this is because at the time it was released, I was still in

1:44:59.680 --> 1:45:04.240
 touch with many people who were among the UFO Fight Club.

1:45:04.240 --> 1:45:07.220
 And so they had intimate knowledge of these things.

1:45:07.220 --> 1:45:12.720
 And the first thing they said was, we have satellites that can read the news on your

1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:14.560
 phone when you're reading it.

1:45:14.560 --> 1:45:19.600
 So we've got better footage than this and this is not good footage at all.

1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:24.000
 Therefore they believe that it was authentic footage that had been doctored up.

1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.160
 Now, why?

1:45:26.160 --> 1:45:29.060
 I don't know why.

1:45:29.060 --> 1:45:31.280
 So I honestly don't know if it's accurate or not.

1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:36.960
 I mean, I believe the people, absolutely, but was this something out there to fool these

1:45:36.960 --> 1:45:37.960
 people?

1:45:37.960 --> 1:45:38.960
 Perhaps.

1:45:38.960 --> 1:45:39.960
 I don't know.

1:45:39.960 --> 1:45:41.120
 Is it spun?

1:45:41.120 --> 1:45:45.760
 The people who I know who are part of the UFO Fight Club believed it was real, okay,

1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:48.480
 and said, this is badly done, but real.

1:45:48.480 --> 1:45:49.480
 Okay.

1:45:49.480 --> 1:45:50.480
 I see.

1:45:50.480 --> 1:45:51.480
 But so there's some kind of...

1:45:51.480 --> 1:45:55.920
 When you say spinning, there's some parties involved that are trying to leverage it from

1:45:55.920 --> 1:45:56.920
 the...

1:45:56.920 --> 1:45:58.200
 For funds, probably.

1:45:58.200 --> 1:45:59.560
 For funds, for financial interests.

1:45:59.560 --> 1:46:01.040
 Yeah, I think so.

1:46:01.040 --> 1:46:11.240
 Nevertheless, it has inspired a conversation and just a lot of people in the world that

1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:16.880
 there's something mysterious out there that we're not fully informed about.

1:46:16.880 --> 1:46:20.560
 And I was certainly grateful that the New York Times ran the story right before my book

1:46:20.560 --> 1:46:21.560
 came out.

1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:27.120
 Well, see, but there's the financial interest that to me, as a person who doesn't give a

1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:34.920
 damn about money, actually, I don't like money, except for when it's used in the context of

1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:37.480
 a company to build cool things.

1:46:37.480 --> 1:46:45.360
 But personally, I don't know, I find the financial interest side off putting, especially when

1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:48.360
 we're talking about the exploration of some of the most...

1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:51.440
 Money is a silly creation of human beings.

1:46:51.440 --> 1:46:52.440
 I agree.

1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:58.560
 And it's used to provide temporary...

1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:06.120
 The unfortunate thing with money is that it helps you buy things that too easily allow

1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:12.760
 you to forget the important things in life and also to forget the difficult aspects of

1:47:12.760 --> 1:47:18.720
 life, to do the difficult intellectual work of being cognizant of your mortality, of fully

1:47:18.720 --> 1:47:25.360
 engaging in life, in a life of reason too, of thinking deeply about the world, all those

1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:26.520
 kinds of things.

1:47:26.520 --> 1:47:31.320
 If you get a nice car or something like that and just, I don't know, all the different

1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:34.760
 things you can do with money, it can make you forget that.

1:47:34.760 --> 1:47:40.760
 Anyway, there's a long way to say that, yes, yes, it's very nice that it coincided nicely

1:47:40.760 --> 1:47:42.000
 with the book.

1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:49.960
 But also, I think it, like I said, I think it inspired quite a lot of people that maybe

1:47:49.960 --> 1:47:53.000
 there's a lot of things out there that were...

1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:56.360
 It reminded a lot of people, there's things out there we don't know about.

1:47:56.360 --> 1:48:00.280
 Lex, I can agree with you on that, but can I push back on two things?

1:48:00.280 --> 1:48:01.280
 Mm hmm.

1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:02.280
 Okay.

1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:03.280
 Let's do it.

1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:04.280
 All right.

1:48:04.280 --> 1:48:06.920
 The first one is that I was happy to receive money from the book because of the New York

1:48:06.920 --> 1:48:07.920
 Times article.

1:48:07.920 --> 1:48:09.320
 That's absolutely false.

1:48:09.320 --> 1:48:14.360
 So I published my book with Oxford, which is an academic press, and you don't get paid

1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:15.720
 with an academic press.

1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:16.720
 Okay.

1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:18.000
 So money was not it for me.

1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:21.880
 What it was, was recognition that my research was being validated.

1:48:21.880 --> 1:48:26.400
 So because then people called me and said, well, maybe it's more than interesting.

1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:27.400
 Okay.

1:48:27.400 --> 1:48:28.400
 And they did.

1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:29.400
 Okay.

1:48:29.400 --> 1:48:35.000
 The other thing about money is just as you say that, now I agree with you, I'm upset

1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:36.000
 about money too.

1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:40.480
 I think there should be universal health care, a universal income.

1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:44.640
 I don't think people should be in poverty, especially because we are so wealthy as a

1:48:44.640 --> 1:48:45.640
 species, frankly.

1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:46.640
 Okay.

1:48:46.640 --> 1:48:53.200
 That said, think about this, if you don't have money, you can't have a life of the mind

1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:54.200
 either.

1:48:54.200 --> 1:48:55.200
 Right?

1:48:55.200 --> 1:48:56.200
 100%.

1:48:56.200 --> 1:48:57.960
 So I'm not espousing that money is the devil.

1:48:57.960 --> 1:49:04.720
 I just think that money can be a drug.

1:49:04.720 --> 1:49:09.440
 Or I would compare it to like food or something like that, where like you really should have

1:49:09.440 --> 1:49:11.920
 enough to nourish yourself.

1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:12.920
 Yes.

1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:13.920
 Right.

1:49:13.920 --> 1:49:17.220
 And too much can be a huge problem.

1:49:17.220 --> 1:49:19.440
 So that's where I come from with money.

1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:24.380
 And I'm just aware, I'm fortunate enough to have the skills and the health to be able

1:49:24.380 --> 1:49:30.120
 to earn a living in whatever way, like I wish of having being in the United States and being

1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:31.200
 able to speak English.

1:49:31.200 --> 1:49:37.680
 So the very least I could work with McDonald's and my standards are, I told Joe, I made a

1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:38.680
 mistake.

1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:44.160
 I told Joe Rogan that I've always had a few money and people are like, oh, Lex was always

1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:45.160
 rich.

1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:46.160
 No, no, no.

1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:47.160
 I was always broke.

1:49:47.160 --> 1:49:54.080
 What I mean by I've always had a few monies, my standard, what it takes to have a few is

1:49:54.080 --> 1:49:55.200
 always very little.

1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:57.200
 I'm just happy with very little.

1:49:57.200 --> 1:50:04.080
 But yes, it's true that money for many people, including for myself, it's just a different

1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:06.640
 level for different people, is freedom.

1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:07.640
 Yes, absolutely.

1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:11.480
 Freedom to think, freedom to pursue your passions.

1:50:11.480 --> 1:50:18.200
 It just so happens I am very fortunate that many of my passions often come with a salary

1:50:18.200 --> 1:50:19.200
 if I wished.

1:50:19.200 --> 1:50:20.200
 Right.

1:50:20.200 --> 1:50:23.300
 So everything like me, I love programming.

1:50:23.300 --> 1:50:29.080
 So even just like working as a basic level software engineer will be a source of a lot

1:50:29.080 --> 1:50:30.080
 of joy for me.

1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:34.460
 And that happens in this modern world to come with a salary.

1:50:34.460 --> 1:50:36.520
 So yeah, it's definitely true.

1:50:36.520 --> 1:50:38.960
 I just mean that it can become a dangerous drug.

1:50:38.960 --> 1:50:46.480
 So I'm glad you are in this pursuit that you are in for the love of knowledge.

1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:49.960
 And it's true.

1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:51.520
 People should definitely buy your book.

1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:53.960
 I won't be making money off of it.

1:50:53.960 --> 1:50:55.960
 Oh yeah, it's true actually.

1:50:55.960 --> 1:50:56.960
 Absolutely.

1:50:56.960 --> 1:50:58.440
 Maybe my next book.

1:50:58.440 --> 1:50:59.440
 Yes.

1:50:59.440 --> 1:51:00.440
 Yeah.

1:51:00.440 --> 1:51:12.160
 Your sense is there's some groups of people that may be trying to leverage this for financial

1:51:12.160 --> 1:51:13.160
 gains.

1:51:13.160 --> 1:51:17.160
 And you know, probably good financial, I mean, they may have good reasons for this too.

1:51:17.160 --> 1:51:20.440
 Like, okay, let's take the study of UFOs, okay?

1:51:20.440 --> 1:51:25.240
 Maybe many people in government that decide who dole out the money, let's put it that

1:51:25.240 --> 1:51:27.900
 way, they think UFOs aren't real.

1:51:27.900 --> 1:51:30.280
 So they're not going to give these programs money.

1:51:30.280 --> 1:51:33.080
 So how do these programs make money?

1:51:33.080 --> 1:51:34.740
 They're going to have to find a way to do it.

1:51:34.740 --> 1:51:36.840
 So maybe that's how they do it.

1:51:36.840 --> 1:51:37.840
 Okay.

1:51:37.840 --> 1:51:38.840
 So I...

1:51:38.840 --> 1:51:39.840
 That's fascinating.

1:51:39.840 --> 1:51:42.040
 This is a way to raise money for science.

1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:43.040
 Doing the research.

1:51:43.040 --> 1:51:44.040
 Yeah, I think so.

1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:49.480
 So let's take a step back to Roswell, we talked about it a little bit.

1:51:49.480 --> 1:51:58.520
 What's your sense about that whole time, Roswell and just Area 51, and the sightings, and also

1:51:58.520 --> 1:52:02.840
 the follow on mythology around those sightings?

1:52:02.840 --> 1:52:03.840
 That's with us today.

1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:04.840
 Of course.

1:52:04.840 --> 1:52:05.840
 All right.

1:52:05.840 --> 1:52:06.840
 So...

1:52:06.840 --> 1:52:07.840
 Where do I get started?

1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:10.240
 Well, I mean, it is a mythology here, right?

1:52:10.240 --> 1:52:15.120
 The mythology of Roswell, it's very religious like in the sense that there's a pilgrimage

1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:20.880
 to Roswell people make and they go to, there's a festival there as well, like a religious

1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:23.000
 festival.

1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:26.780
 You can get little kitschy stuff like you can get at a religious festival there.

1:52:26.780 --> 1:52:31.360
 So it's very much like a place of pilgrimage where a herophany occurred and a herophany

1:52:31.360 --> 1:52:34.760
 is basically contact with nonhuman intelligence.

1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:35.760
 Okay.

1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:40.840
 So nonhuman intelligence is thought to have contacted humans or crashed at this place

1:52:40.840 --> 1:52:42.720
 in Roswell, New Mexico.

1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:48.760
 Now what's fascinating is that I begin my book by going out to a crash site in New Mexico.

1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:55.040
 I have to get blindfolded with my, well, to tell you the truth, the story is that I'm

1:52:55.040 --> 1:53:01.600
 with Tyler, who's an invisible, and he wants to show me a place in New Mexico where a crash

1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:02.600
 happened.

1:53:02.600 --> 1:53:08.320
 And he says that he thinks that I need to see physical evidence because I don't believe.

1:53:08.320 --> 1:53:11.520
 And so I said, I'll go, but I'm going to bring a friend of mine.

1:53:11.520 --> 1:53:12.960
 And he said, no, you have to go alone.

1:53:12.960 --> 1:53:19.640
 He goes, it's a place that is on government owned property and it's a no fly zone.

1:53:19.640 --> 1:53:22.320
 And when you go, you'll be blindfolded.

1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:27.680
 And I said, I definitely need to bring a friend.

1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:29.720
 So he said, well, who do you want to bring?

1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:35.360
 I just had met this university scientist who's very well known and I call him James in my

1:53:35.360 --> 1:53:36.360
 book.

1:53:36.360 --> 1:53:40.320
 And I asked, and I had a feeling James would definitely want to do this.

1:53:40.320 --> 1:53:43.360
 And I asked James and he said, I'll go tomorrow.

1:53:43.360 --> 1:53:48.600
 So I suggested this to Tyler and Tyler said, absolutely not.

1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:52.680
 And I thought, I know he's going to look up James and he's going to say yes, because if

1:53:52.680 --> 1:53:56.760
 anybody can figure out what this material is that you're going to go look for, it's

1:53:56.760 --> 1:53:57.760
 going to be James.

1:53:57.760 --> 1:53:59.240
 He has the instruments.

1:53:59.240 --> 1:54:04.720
 And so Tyler did, in fact, look him up and finally said, okay, you can go.

1:54:04.720 --> 1:54:07.880
 So we both head out there and we get blindfolded and Tyler takes us out there.

1:54:07.880 --> 1:54:11.920
 It takes about 40 minutes outside of a certain place in New Mexico.

1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:16.600
 So in terms of Roswell, this is what I can say is that according to Tyler, there were

1:54:16.600 --> 1:54:25.560
 about seven crashes out in the 1940s in New Mexico in various places.

1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:29.120
 We went to one of them according to Tyler.

1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:33.880
 At the time I was completely an atheist with regard to anything that had to do with UFOs.

1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:41.480
 So we were out there, we had specially configured metal detectors for these metals.

1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:44.120
 And we did find these, okay.

1:54:44.120 --> 1:54:49.720
 And they've since been studied by various scientists, material scientists, so forth.

1:54:49.720 --> 1:54:57.240
 And I believe Jacques talked about not those particular ones, but others on the Joe Rogan

1:54:57.240 --> 1:54:58.240
 show.

1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:05.680
 They're anomalies, so there are scientists, I'm not a scientist, so I can't weigh in on

1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:12.560
 whether, I just believe the people, these people I believe because they're well known

1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:13.560
 scientists.

1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:14.560
 What do you mean they're not anomalies?

1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:15.560
 No, they are anomalous.

1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:23.480
 Oh, anomalous in terms of the materials that are naturally occurring on earth.

1:55:23.480 --> 1:55:24.960
 Yes.

1:55:24.960 --> 1:55:36.880
 Okay, so there's some kind of inklings of evidence that something happened in Roswell

1:55:36.880 --> 1:55:40.840
 in terms of crashes of alien technology.

1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:42.960
 What else is there to the mythology?

1:55:42.960 --> 1:55:45.960
 So there's some crashes, right?

1:55:45.960 --> 1:55:46.960
 Yeah.

1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:47.960
 I mean, that's kind of epic.

1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:50.360
 It's pretty epic, yeah.

1:55:50.360 --> 1:55:55.800
 And what else, like what are we supposed to take away from this?

1:55:55.800 --> 1:55:56.800
 Right, yeah.

1:55:56.800 --> 1:55:57.800
 So it's weird.

1:55:57.800 --> 1:56:03.200
 Okay, so there's this, okay, so in religious studies, like I said, we call it a herophany,

1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:08.480
 which is the meeting of a nonhuman intelligent thing, whatever it is, an angel, a god, whatever,

1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:12.520
 a goddess with, or an alien, with humans.

1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:16.440
 And that's the place, okay, so the place is New Mexico.

1:56:16.440 --> 1:56:22.720
 So New Mexico becomes folded into the mythology of this new religion, is what I call a new

1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:26.280
 type of religion, of the UFO.

1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:30.360
 And it becomes ground zero for this new mythology.

1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:35.600
 Just like Mecca is the place where Muslims go, they have to go, right, at least once

1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:38.200
 in their lives, it's a pilgrimage place now.

1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:41.480
 So in my book, that's how I tell it.

1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:45.920
 Now what about Roswell in the public imagination?

1:56:45.920 --> 1:56:51.800
 Really according to Annie Jacobson, who's good, she's a great author, investigative

1:56:51.800 --> 1:56:53.840
 journalist, she's written about Roswell too.

1:56:53.840 --> 1:56:58.040
 I don't agree with all of what she comes up with, but part of it is that there's a lot

1:56:58.040 --> 1:57:03.180
 of military stuff going on there that is classified, and there's a reason why you can't get in,

1:57:03.180 --> 1:57:07.080
 and nor would you want to, right?

1:57:07.080 --> 1:57:10.960
 So there's a lot of experimentation going on there.

1:57:10.960 --> 1:57:18.160
 I don't believe that it has to do with ETs, frankly, but in the imaginations of Americans,

1:57:18.160 --> 1:57:22.920
 Roswell is that place, but I went to a different place, and apparently there are several places

1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:23.920
 in New Mexico.

1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:29.800
 Now, strangely enough, I traveled back to New Mexico at the very end chapter of my book,

1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:33.080
 but I don't go there physically.

1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:40.640
 I go there through the story of a Catholic nun who actually believes that she bilocated

1:57:40.640 --> 1:57:47.000
 to New Mexico in the, gosh, in the 1600s.

1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:48.960
 So yeah, it was very strange.

1:57:48.960 --> 1:57:54.280
 And I was at the Vatican at the Space Observatory when I made that connection that she probably

1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:59.880
 went to the very, well, she believed she went to this very place that I had gone.

1:57:59.880 --> 1:58:01.920
 Can you elaborate a little bit?

1:58:01.920 --> 1:58:03.560
 What does it mean to go to that place?

1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:04.560
 For her?

1:58:04.560 --> 1:58:05.560
 Yeah, yeah.

1:58:05.560 --> 1:58:06.560
 For her.

1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:13.800
 What does it mean, so we're kind of breaking down the barrier between what it means to

1:58:13.800 --> 1:58:15.920
 be in a place and time, right?

1:58:15.920 --> 1:58:16.920
 Right.

1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:17.920
 I agree with you.

1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:19.720
 This is the field of religious studies.

1:58:19.720 --> 1:58:23.040
 So, and again, I don't say it's true in my book.

1:58:23.040 --> 1:58:28.440
 I just say it's a very strange coincidence that I'm at the Vatican Observatory.

1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:33.280
 In fact, I'd finished my book, but while I was at the Vatican Observatory, I was there

1:58:33.280 --> 1:58:37.480
 with Tyler, and we were looking at the records.

1:58:37.480 --> 1:58:42.180
 They're called the trial records, but they're the canonization records of these two saints.

1:58:42.180 --> 1:58:44.520
 Each was said to have done amazing things.

1:58:44.520 --> 1:58:50.480
 One was Joseph of Cupertino, who levitated, okay, or is said to have levitated.

1:58:50.480 --> 1:58:56.400
 The other was Maria of Agrida from Spain, their contemporaries in the 1600s, who was

1:58:56.400 --> 1:59:00.680
 said to have been able to bilocate, which is to be in two places at once, okay?

1:59:00.680 --> 1:59:05.560
 So this is a belief in Catholicism that certain very holy people can do these kinds of things

1:59:05.560 --> 1:59:11.080
 like levitate, which, by the way, is also associated with UFO abductions.

1:59:11.080 --> 1:59:13.680
 People get levitated out of their beds and things like that.

1:59:13.680 --> 1:59:21.540
 So we were sent there by a billionaire who was interested in levitation and bilocation.

1:59:21.540 --> 1:59:27.960
 And since I could get into the Vatican and I knew the director of the Vatican Observatory,

1:59:27.960 --> 1:59:33.600
 both Tyler and I were able to go to the secret archives and look at the canonization records

1:59:33.600 --> 1:59:40.300
 and then go to Castle Gandolfo, which is about an hour from the Vatican where the first observatory,

1:59:40.300 --> 1:59:44.240
 the space observatory of the Vatican is.

1:59:44.240 --> 1:59:48.000
 The second one is in Arizona and it has a much larger telescope.

1:59:48.000 --> 1:59:53.760
 So we went and Brother Guy gave me the keys to the archive and said, look at anything

1:59:53.760 --> 1:59:54.760
 you want.

1:59:54.760 --> 1:59:56.760
 And I got to see a lot of stuff by Carl Sagan, by the way.

1:59:56.760 --> 1:59:58.600
 I know he talked about, yeah, it was awesome.

1:59:58.600 --> 2:00:03.480
 So they have a whole section on the search for extraterrestrial life.

2:00:03.480 --> 2:00:04.480
 And they don't, by the way.

2:00:04.480 --> 2:00:05.480
 How awesome is that?

2:00:05.480 --> 2:00:06.480
 It was awesome.

2:00:06.480 --> 2:00:07.480
 Yeah.

2:00:07.480 --> 2:00:08.480
 So we got to stay there.

2:00:08.480 --> 2:00:09.480
 They have a scholars quarters.

2:00:09.480 --> 2:00:11.100
 And so they had two.

2:00:11.100 --> 2:00:13.840
 And so Tyler stayed in one and I stayed in the other.

2:00:13.840 --> 2:00:20.800
 And Brother Guy probably shouldn't have been so nice to me and given me the keys because

2:00:20.800 --> 2:00:24.640
 when I got home, we were there for two weeks, when I got home, I got this frantic phone

2:00:24.640 --> 2:00:29.120
 call from him and he basically said, Diana, he goes, do you remember where you put the

2:00:29.120 --> 2:00:30.800
 original Kepler?

2:00:30.800 --> 2:00:33.240
 And so I had this Kepler, right?

2:00:33.240 --> 2:00:36.040
 And so I misplaced it.

2:00:36.040 --> 2:00:39.760
 Luckily I remembered where it went.

2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:42.160
 I was like, oh gosh, thank goodness I found it.

2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:47.200
 But he'll probably change the rules of the Vatican observatory after my visit.

2:00:47.200 --> 2:00:55.840
 So Maria, she's actually in the history of our country in that she first wrote a cosmography

2:00:55.840 --> 2:00:59.400
 of what she said was the spinning earth.

2:00:59.400 --> 2:01:01.200
 And this was in the 1600s.

2:01:01.200 --> 2:01:03.000
 And that's her first book.

2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:04.840
 And she wrote that.

2:01:04.840 --> 2:01:11.960
 And then she said that she was transported on the wings of angels to the new world.

2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:19.480
 And she said that she met a culture of people and she basically told them about the faith

2:01:19.480 --> 2:01:21.480
 of Catholicism.

2:01:21.480 --> 2:01:27.440
 And then what happened was that the people that, and she described the fauna, she described

2:01:27.440 --> 2:01:29.720
 the people and everything like that.

2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:32.220
 And so there were actually missionaries there.

2:01:32.220 --> 2:01:40.480
 And when they went to try to convert some of the people who already lived there, apparently

2:01:40.480 --> 2:01:42.000
 they already knew a bunch of stuff.

2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:43.480
 And they said, how did you know all this stuff?

2:01:43.480 --> 2:01:48.760
 And they said, this lady in blue came and told us, and they said, did it look like this?

2:01:48.760 --> 2:01:53.240
 And they showed them, they obviously didn't have a photograph, but they had a picture

2:01:53.240 --> 2:01:56.200
 of a sister, a nun.

2:01:56.200 --> 2:02:02.400
 And they said, yeah, she wore similar clothes, but she was much younger.

2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:04.400
 And these guys thought that was weird.

2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:08.960
 But when they went back to Spain, they found that this woman had been doing that in her

2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:11.320
 mind, had been traveling.

2:02:11.320 --> 2:02:12.960
 I mean, I don't know what to make of it.

2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:18.880
 There's so many things that are sort of forcing you to kind of go outside of, you know, I'm

2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:19.880
 of many minds.

2:02:19.880 --> 2:02:25.840
 I have a very, most of my days spent with very rigorous scientific kind of things and

2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:27.480
 even engineering kind of things.

2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:34.240
 And then I'm also open minded and just the entirety of the idea of extraterrestrial life

2:02:34.240 --> 2:02:41.400
 forces you to think outside of conventional boundaries of thought, scientific, current

2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:43.200
 scientific thought.

2:02:43.200 --> 2:02:44.200
 Let's put it that way.

2:02:44.200 --> 2:02:45.200
 And your story right now.

2:02:45.200 --> 2:02:46.200
 It's freaking you out.

2:02:46.200 --> 2:02:47.200
 Yeah.

2:02:47.200 --> 2:02:48.200
 That's okay.

2:02:48.200 --> 2:02:50.640
 That's a nice way to put it.

2:02:50.640 --> 2:02:57.520
 What do you, just another person that seems to be a key figure in this, in the mythology

2:02:57.520 --> 2:02:59.360
 of this is Bob Lazar.

2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:01.380
 It'd be interesting.

2:03:01.380 --> 2:03:07.120
 Maybe there's others you can tell me about, but Bob, who's also been on Joe Rogan, but

2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:16.080
 his story has been told quite a bit that he's got, I think he said that he witnessed some

2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:25.760
 of the work being done on the spacecraft that was, you know, that was captured and so on

2:03:25.760 --> 2:03:30.640
 in order to try to reverse engineer some of the technology in terms of the propulsion

2:03:30.640 --> 2:03:31.640
 and so on.

2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:37.080
 What are your thoughts about his story, how it fits into the mythology of this whole thing

2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:40.240
 and broader ufologist community?

2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:41.240
 Okay.

2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:50.920
 So regarding Bob Lazar, with respect to his claims, again, I have no way to adjudicate

2:03:50.920 --> 2:03:55.800
 whether or not he actually encountered this.

2:03:55.800 --> 2:03:59.520
 I do have friends who are.

2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:08.680
 And the people that I know who know his story, some know him, believe him.

2:04:08.680 --> 2:04:16.520
 And they have said to me that the most important thing that they think he has said, in fact,

2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:25.360
 one of them I think made a meme out of it or something like that was basically he said,

2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:28.200
 maybe the public, you know, I regret making it public.

2:04:28.200 --> 2:04:30.940
 Maybe the public isn't ready for this kind of information.

2:04:30.940 --> 2:04:37.120
 And basically they've, they emphasize that to me and they emphasized it so much that

2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:39.860
 they wanted me to know, right?

2:04:39.860 --> 2:04:43.180
 So that is somewhat creepy to me.

2:04:43.180 --> 2:04:49.300
 So I think, okay, this poor guy, Bob Lazar, so many people, you know, this is what happens

2:04:49.300 --> 2:04:52.160
 to people who have experiences like this.

2:04:52.160 --> 2:05:00.200
 They're questioned, their reputations are put on the line, in some instances their reputations

2:05:00.200 --> 2:05:04.900
 are manipulated on purpose to make them look uncredible.

2:05:04.900 --> 2:05:14.320
 To me, as a scientist, it's just inspiring that it kind of gives this kind of, I'm not

2:05:14.320 --> 2:05:19.440
 even thinking of it, is there an actual spacecraft being hidden somewhere and studied and so

2:05:19.440 --> 2:05:20.440
 on?

2:05:20.440 --> 2:05:24.640
 But I think of it like, I don't know, it's a thing that gives you a spark of a dream,

2:05:24.640 --> 2:05:32.720
 you know, as a reminder that we don't understand most of how this world works.

2:05:32.720 --> 2:05:38.380
 And then we can build technologies that aren't here today that will allow us to understand

2:05:38.380 --> 2:05:39.380
 much more.

2:05:39.380 --> 2:05:44.240
 And it's kind of like, almost like a feeling that it provides and that it inspires and

2:05:44.240 --> 2:05:45.920
 makes you dream.

2:05:45.920 --> 2:05:47.320
 That's the way I see the Bob Lazar story.

2:05:47.320 --> 2:05:52.040
 I don't necessarily, people ask me, because I'm at MIT, people ask me, did Bob Lazar actually

2:05:52.040 --> 2:05:53.880
 go to MIT and so on?

2:05:53.880 --> 2:05:57.960
 I don't know, and I personally don't care.

2:05:57.960 --> 2:06:01.080
 That's not what's interesting to me about that story.

2:06:01.080 --> 2:06:06.360
 To me, the myth is more interesting, not interesting actually, but inspiring.

2:06:06.360 --> 2:06:11.760
 Yes, because inspiring, you're suggesting that the myth inspires you to create reality.

2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:12.760
 Yes.

2:06:12.760 --> 2:06:15.120
 Yeah, I think that's true.

2:06:15.120 --> 2:06:25.720
 So even if it's not real, in some sense, just like you said, it does in some sense, it doesn't.

2:06:25.720 --> 2:06:28.840
 So a lot of people know how much I love 2001 Space Odyssey.

2:06:28.840 --> 2:06:38.640
 So I got a lot of these emails asking like, hey bro, do you know what's up with the monoliths

2:06:38.640 --> 2:06:41.440
 in the middle of the desert or whatever it was?

2:06:41.440 --> 2:06:47.680
 I haven't been actually paying attention, I apologize, but you kind of mentioned offline

2:06:47.680 --> 2:06:49.760
 that this is kind of cool and interesting.

2:06:49.760 --> 2:06:56.920
 What do you make of these monoliths and in general, are you a fan of 2001 Space Odyssey

2:06:56.920 --> 2:06:58.920
 where monoliths showed up?

2:06:58.920 --> 2:07:02.620
 Do you have any thoughts about either the science fiction, the mythology of it or the

2:07:02.620 --> 2:07:04.280
 reality of it?

2:07:04.280 --> 2:07:05.280
 Yes.

2:07:05.280 --> 2:07:06.280
 Okay.

2:07:06.280 --> 2:07:07.720
 No, okay.

2:07:07.720 --> 2:07:09.720
 And please say more.

2:07:09.720 --> 2:07:10.720
 Right.

2:07:10.720 --> 2:07:18.320
 So first of all, Kubrick's films are not ever easy for me because they're so weird, right?

2:07:18.320 --> 2:07:25.080
 And I don't actually enjoy watching them, but it doesn't take away from their incredible

2:07:25.080 --> 2:07:29.480
 brilliance though and their visionary merit.

2:07:29.480 --> 2:07:37.400
 So 2001 Space Odyssey is incredibly visionary and of course, all those things that people

2:07:37.400 --> 2:07:40.200
 say, I don't have to restate them.

2:07:40.200 --> 2:07:43.160
 In terms of what I have, it's a subtext to my book, by the way.

2:07:43.160 --> 2:07:49.760
 I didn't mean it to be, but it's almost a character in my book, 2001 Space Odyssey.

2:07:49.760 --> 2:07:54.920
 And when the monoliths started to appear, again, everything went crazy with my everything,

2:07:54.920 --> 2:07:57.440
 internet, social media, phone.

2:07:57.440 --> 2:07:58.440
 What's up?

2:07:58.440 --> 2:07:59.440
 What's going on, right?

2:07:59.440 --> 2:08:00.520
 Is this disclosure?

2:08:00.520 --> 2:08:05.120
 And I thought, well, I'll tell you one thing, is let's look at the timing of it.

2:08:05.120 --> 2:08:09.920
 It's a cool, it isn't art and then copy art and things like that.

2:08:09.920 --> 2:08:15.160
 It's actually happening at a really interesting time when all of us are forced to go online.

2:08:15.160 --> 2:08:17.480
 When all of us are forced, because of COVID, right?

2:08:17.480 --> 2:08:22.880
 We're completely now invaded by the screen or we're invading the screen.

2:08:22.880 --> 2:08:25.240
 Our infrastructure now is completely changed.

2:08:25.240 --> 2:08:31.280
 So the monolith, basically, if art is supposed to show us life, it certainly has.

2:08:31.280 --> 2:08:33.860
 If that's an art project, somebody did an awesome job with it.

2:08:33.860 --> 2:08:36.400
 But apparently that monolith was there for a long time, right?

2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:37.560
 I mean, that's the thing.

2:08:37.560 --> 2:08:41.120
 It's been there for a couple of years, so they said, okay, all right.

2:08:41.120 --> 2:08:47.840
 That said, if your audience is interested, I think the best theory about the meaning

2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:54.000
 of the monolith is Robert Ager or Robert Ayer.

2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:56.480
 I think it's Robert Ager.

2:08:56.480 --> 2:09:01.560
 He's got a website where he does analyses of films and it's called Collative Learning

2:09:01.560 --> 2:09:05.760
 or Collative Learning, and he does the meaning of the monolith.

2:09:05.760 --> 2:09:09.160
 Everyone should go look at that because I fully agree with him.

2:09:09.160 --> 2:09:13.440
 I studied different meanings of the monolith in 2001 A Space Odyssey.

2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:14.440
 I was fascinated.

2:09:14.440 --> 2:09:17.240
 Okay, so what is this about?

2:09:17.240 --> 2:09:21.720
 I accepted as soon as I listened to it and watched it.

2:09:21.720 --> 2:09:27.160
 So basically, he says that the monolith is, okay, can you pick up your phone here?

2:09:27.160 --> 2:09:29.840
 What does that look like?

2:09:29.840 --> 2:09:33.440
 It looks awfully a lot like a monolith.

2:09:33.440 --> 2:09:34.440
 Yeah.

2:09:34.440 --> 2:09:39.560
 So basically, that's what he was saying was that Kubrick was basically, the monolith was

2:09:39.560 --> 2:09:45.760
 technology or the screen in particular, and he basically was saying that the cinema screen,

2:09:45.760 --> 2:09:46.760
 we're being completely...

2:09:46.760 --> 2:09:50.140
 And if you think about it, look at all this, we live in a screen culture.

2:09:50.140 --> 2:09:56.720
 We have computer screens, iPhone screens, there's phone screens, we have TV screens,

2:09:56.720 --> 2:09:57.720
 everything is something...

2:09:57.720 --> 2:10:01.880
 And now that COVID has come, we're forced to go into these screens and we're forced

2:10:01.880 --> 2:10:06.680
 to live a different material existence than we have lived before.

2:10:06.680 --> 2:10:12.880
 So in my sense, I think that if it's an art project, it's a really good one for that.

2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:20.440
 So I like that meaning of it, it's a screen and a screen could take all kinds of forms.

2:10:20.440 --> 2:10:27.640
 I mean, our perception system in a sense is a screen between reality and our mind.

2:10:27.640 --> 2:10:33.960
 The screen of the computer is a screen, the virtual reality worlds that we might be one

2:10:33.960 --> 2:10:39.920
 day living in, there'll be an interface, I mean, ultimately it's about the interface.

2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:40.920
 That's interesting.

2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:46.040
 It's an interface to another world of ideas.

2:10:46.040 --> 2:10:49.080
 It's also a material change.

2:10:49.080 --> 2:10:50.080
 It's a change in our material...

2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:55.780
 I mean, when people talk about augmented reality, I say we already live in augmented reality,

2:10:55.780 --> 2:10:56.780
 don't we?

2:10:56.780 --> 2:11:00.720
 I mean, this isn't our grandparents existence.

2:11:00.720 --> 2:11:01.720
 Yeah.

2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:07.800
 I sometimes, you have to pause and remind yourself how weirdly different this reality

2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:11.880
 is than just even like, I mean, 30 years ago.

2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:19.360
 The internet changed so much and social media has changed so much about actually just the

2:11:19.360 --> 2:11:21.040
 space of our thinking.

2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:25.860
 Wikipedia changed so much about the offloading of our knowledge.

2:11:25.860 --> 2:11:28.680
 The way we interact with knowledge.

2:11:28.680 --> 2:11:35.680
 I mean, it offloaded our longterm memory about facts onto a digital format.

2:11:35.680 --> 2:11:40.760
 So in the sense that expanded our mind, it's kind of interesting.

2:11:40.760 --> 2:11:44.160
 I'd be curious to see if he has just one interpretation.

2:11:44.160 --> 2:11:45.160
 I wonder if there's others.

2:11:45.160 --> 2:11:46.880
 I've corresponded with him, yes.

2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:50.240
 So over the years he and I have corresponded.

2:11:50.240 --> 2:11:53.120
 And I told him, I said, look, I'm going to be using this in my book.

2:11:53.120 --> 2:11:55.500
 So I think you should read what I say.

2:11:55.500 --> 2:11:57.640
 And he was, he of course wanted to see it.

2:11:57.640 --> 2:11:58.640
 So.

2:11:58.640 --> 2:11:59.640
 What do you think about your book?

2:11:59.640 --> 2:12:01.320
 Did he get a chance to read it?

2:12:01.320 --> 2:12:02.320
 Yeah.

2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:03.320
 Oh yeah.

2:12:03.320 --> 2:12:12.000
 So he is a nonbeliever in alien intelligence and UFOs, but he, and that's fine, but I still

2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:16.200
 agree with him that the meaning of the monolith was the screen, but that doesn't mean the

2:12:16.200 --> 2:12:20.800
 screen isn't like what David Bowie said, right?

2:12:20.800 --> 2:12:22.680
 So it's not exclusive.

2:12:22.680 --> 2:12:26.920
 So I could still use his theory, but differ from the conclusions.

2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:34.560
 In terms of nonbeliever and believer, there's, when you say believer, you also are kind of

2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:42.880
 implying this, the idea that aliens have visited or had made direct contact with humans in

2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:45.680
 some form.

2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:54.000
 There's also the exploration and the idea of just alien intelligence is out there in

2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:55.000
 the universe.

2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:56.000
 Yeah.

2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:01.840
 You know, the Drake equation estimating how many intelligent civilizations may be out

2:13:01.840 --> 2:13:02.840
 there.

2:13:02.840 --> 2:13:03.840
 How many have ever existed?

2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:05.640
 How many are about to communicate with us?

2:13:05.640 --> 2:13:12.140
 I mean, when you just zoom out from our own little selfish perspective of earth and look

2:13:12.140 --> 2:13:18.200
 at the entirety, let's say the Milky Way galaxy, but maybe even the universe, does the idea

2:13:18.200 --> 2:13:24.040
 that there are intelligent civilizations out there, something that you're excited about

2:13:24.040 --> 2:13:27.300
 or something that you're terrified about?

2:13:27.300 --> 2:13:28.900
 That's a good question.

2:13:28.900 --> 2:13:35.400
 So basically I would say I'm not so keen on it.

2:13:35.400 --> 2:13:42.000
 I think that our relationship with technology as it is and as it, as I hope it will go will

2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:46.320
 help us survive, okay?

2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:53.440
 I don't think we're equipped to do it as we stand now, but I think that if we can up our

2:13:53.440 --> 2:13:58.600
 game or let's just put it this way, if technology is an extension of ourselves, which it actually

2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:04.080
 is, it will help us because it'll probably be smarter than us, okay?

2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:07.720
 It'll help us survive in the ways in which it determines best, okay?

2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:17.240
 So with that said, if there are nonhuman intelligences out there and they have more advanced, you

2:14:17.240 --> 2:14:25.320
 know, obviously technologies than us and they actually come, the history of human engagement

2:14:25.320 --> 2:14:34.440
 with, you know, other cultures has not gone well for cultures that are less aggressive.

2:14:34.440 --> 2:14:35.440
 So you see what I'm saying?

2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:37.000
 Like, it's not a good idea.

2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:43.240
 Well, I wonder where we stand on the, where humans stand in the full spectrum of aggression.

2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:45.480
 Well, heck, where are we now, Lex?

2:14:45.480 --> 2:14:47.560
 I mean, we're not too great here.

2:14:47.560 --> 2:14:49.600
 We're still aggressing against each other.

2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:52.680
 No, I know, but that will give us a benefit, right?

2:14:52.680 --> 2:14:57.240
 Like, oh, you're saying, I thought, okay, I see.

2:14:57.240 --> 2:15:03.480
 I just have a sense that there may be a lot of intelligences out there that are less aggressive

2:15:03.480 --> 2:15:06.000
 because they've evolved past it.

2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:07.680
 We can't assume that.

2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:10.440
 No, I know we can't assume that, but like.

2:15:10.440 --> 2:15:14.480
 If we can't assume it, then I'm going to assume the worst.

2:15:14.480 --> 2:15:22.760
 Well, that's, despite the fact that I am a Russian and think that life is suffering,

2:15:22.760 --> 2:15:31.640
 I tend to assume, not the best, but I tend to assume that there is a best core to creatures,

2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:35.000
 to people and to creatures that ultimately wins out.

2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:43.240
 I think there's an evolutionary advantage to being good to other living creatures.

2:15:43.240 --> 2:15:49.440
 And so, ultimately, I think that if there's intelligent civilizations out there that prosper

2:15:49.440 --> 2:15:58.400
 sufficiently to be able to travel across the great spans of space, that they've evolved

2:15:58.400 --> 2:16:08.120
 past silly aggression, that it's more likely in my mind to be deeply cooperative.

2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:16.000
 So like growth over destruction, like growth does not require destruction, I think.

2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:22.080
 But if you see the universe as ultimately a place where it's highly constrained in resources

2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:30.640
 that are necessary for traveling across space and time, then perhaps aggression is necessary

2:16:30.640 --> 2:16:36.800
 in order to aggress against others that are desiring to get access to those resources.

2:16:36.800 --> 2:16:37.880
 I don't know.

2:16:37.880 --> 2:16:41.560
 I tend to try to be optimistic on that front.

2:16:41.560 --> 2:16:46.440
 I think I'm emotionally optimistic and intellectually nonoptimistic.

2:16:46.440 --> 2:16:51.160
 Yeah, I guess I'm there with you.

2:16:51.160 --> 2:16:57.600
 I tend to believe that the happiness and deep fulfillment in life is found in that emotional

2:16:57.600 --> 2:16:58.600
 place.

2:16:58.600 --> 2:17:07.000
 The intellectual place is really useful for building cool new technologies and ideas and

2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:08.000
 so on.

2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:10.600
 But happiness is in the emotional place.

2:17:10.600 --> 2:17:15.360
 And there it pays off to be optimistic, I think.

2:17:15.360 --> 2:17:19.080
 You said that technology might be able to save us.

2:17:19.080 --> 2:17:22.080
 That's also kind of optimistic, too.

2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:23.080
 It might kill us.

2:17:23.080 --> 2:17:29.760
 But there's, talking to you offline a little bit, there was a sense that we humans are

2:17:29.760 --> 2:17:38.400
 facing existential risks, that it's not obvious that we will survive for long.

2:17:38.400 --> 2:17:45.160
 Is there things that you worry about in terms of ways we may destroy ourselves or deeply

2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:55.080
 damage the fabric of human civilization that technology may allow us to avoid or alleviate?

2:17:55.080 --> 2:18:01.520
 Yes, I think that you can choose anything, actually.

2:18:01.520 --> 2:18:08.160
 And it could destroy us, pollution.

2:18:08.160 --> 2:18:12.880
 Here we're in a pandemic, a meteor.

2:18:12.880 --> 2:18:19.240
 So we can use technology, or the thing is, is that we say we use technology, but actually

2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:24.440
 that's not a correct way of putting it, in my opinion.

2:18:24.440 --> 2:18:31.640
 So there is a term used by others, coined by somebody I don't know, and I'm sorry to

2:18:31.640 --> 2:18:35.800
 not give credit where credit's due, but it's called technogenesis.

2:18:35.800 --> 2:18:39.720
 And it's this idea, Heidegger actually had this idea, but he didn't use that term.

2:18:39.720 --> 2:18:44.140
 And it's this idea that we coevolve with technology, that we don't actually use it.

2:18:44.140 --> 2:18:49.400
 Most people think it's like a tool we use, okay, let's use technology to do this.

2:18:49.400 --> 2:18:54.800
 Well, actually when we engage with technology, we actually engage with it and it engages

2:18:54.800 --> 2:18:57.200
 back with us and we engage with it.

2:18:57.200 --> 2:18:59.620
 So it's this coevolution that's happening.

2:18:59.620 --> 2:19:11.400
 And in that sense, I think that as we create more autonomous, intelligent AI, it will help

2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:21.360
 us survive because if we coevolve with it, it will need us as much as we need it, is

2:19:21.360 --> 2:19:23.720
 my opinion.

2:19:23.720 --> 2:19:31.280
 How that happens or if that bears out to be true, we'll see, but I don't think the idea

2:19:31.280 --> 2:19:34.680
 that we use technology is a correct way to put it.

2:19:34.680 --> 2:19:39.360
 I think that technology is something so strange, the way it is today, like digital technology,

2:19:39.360 --> 2:19:45.120
 I'm not talking about hammers or things like that, those kinds of tools, okay, is technology

2:19:45.120 --> 2:19:53.280
 is so far removed from that and our environment is so now conditioned by our technology and

2:19:53.280 --> 2:19:55.800
 the infrastructure we live within, the material structure.

2:19:55.800 --> 2:20:01.760
 I think that it's going to, I don't think it's going to be a Frankenstein.

2:20:01.760 --> 2:20:05.120
 I think it's actually going, like a Mary Shelley type idea of technology.

2:20:05.120 --> 2:20:12.560
 I think it's actually going to be more Promethean in the sense of, think about it, we create

2:20:12.560 --> 2:20:18.720
 children and then we get old and we rely upon our children to help us, okay?

2:20:18.720 --> 2:20:20.840
 Well, I feel like that about technology.

2:20:20.840 --> 2:20:23.400
 We've created, well, we've created it, right?

2:20:23.400 --> 2:20:28.480
 And so it's kind of growing up now.

2:20:28.480 --> 2:20:34.200
 Or maybe it's in its teenage years and we'll see.

2:20:34.200 --> 2:20:41.180
 What do you think about in terms of this coevolution of the work around brain computer interfaces

2:20:41.180 --> 2:20:54.400
 and maybe Neuralink and Elon seeing Neuralink in particular as its longterm mission as a

2:20:54.400 --> 2:20:57.000
 symbiosis with artificial intelligence.

2:20:57.000 --> 2:21:07.480
 So like giving a greater bandwidth channel of communication between technology, AI systems

2:21:07.480 --> 2:21:14.200
 and the biological neural networks of our human mind.

2:21:14.200 --> 2:21:20.520
 What do you think about this idea of connecting directly to the brain in AI systems?

2:21:20.520 --> 2:21:25.360
 I mean, okay, I've listened to your podcast with Elon.

2:21:25.360 --> 2:21:29.960
 I've listened to Elon before, he's very intelligent, obviously super smart guy.

2:21:29.960 --> 2:21:35.680
 I think this is already, I mean, not in the specific ways that he is doing it, but I think

2:21:35.680 --> 2:21:37.360
 we are already doing that, okay?

2:21:37.360 --> 2:21:41.440
 And I can give you some examples.

2:21:41.440 --> 2:21:44.880
 And there are really trivial examples, but they do make the point and this is one of

2:21:44.880 --> 2:21:45.880
 them.

2:21:45.880 --> 2:21:53.240
 So before he started this research on UFOs and UAPs and technology, I actually was looking

2:21:53.240 --> 2:22:01.840
 at the effects of technology and in particular media on religion.

2:22:01.840 --> 2:22:10.160
 And what I did was I was lucky to be asked to be a consultant for various movies and

2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:13.620
 one in particular I learned a lot from and that was The Conjuring.

2:22:13.620 --> 2:22:17.480
 So I was a history consultant for The Conjuring.

2:22:17.480 --> 2:22:21.480
 It happens to be my field, it's Catholic studies, right?

2:22:21.480 --> 2:22:25.060
 And you've got these people who are real people and they're, you know, exercising demons and

2:22:25.060 --> 2:22:26.060
 things like that.

2:22:26.060 --> 2:22:28.880
 Okay, so I thought, wow, this is a great example for me.

2:22:28.880 --> 2:22:30.520
 You know, I didn't do it for the money.

2:22:30.520 --> 2:22:33.440
 It doesn't pay well, but I did it to learn, right?

2:22:33.440 --> 2:22:37.880
 So I work closely with the screenwriters who I work with now all the time.

2:22:37.880 --> 2:22:40.280
 I work with them all the time now.

2:22:40.280 --> 2:22:44.960
 And what I found was this, I found that as the most interesting part of the creation

2:22:44.960 --> 2:22:51.640
 of this movie was the editing process because it would go through editing and they would

2:22:51.640 --> 2:22:58.060
 use test audiences and a lot of the test audiences would be like, you know, there's like these

2:22:58.060 --> 2:23:02.040
 things where they test their flicker rates and things like that, the eye flicker rates.

2:23:02.040 --> 2:23:08.920
 And so, and when it goes really intense, they go to UC Irvine and they do this thing called

2:23:08.920 --> 2:23:16.680
 cognitive consumption, which is basically, or I'm sorry, cognitive consumerism, where

2:23:16.680 --> 2:23:22.680
 they basically hook test audiences up to EKGs and they read their brains and they figure

2:23:22.680 --> 2:23:25.680
 out which scenes create the most.

2:23:25.680 --> 2:23:26.680
 Arousal.

2:23:26.680 --> 2:23:27.680
 Yeah.

2:23:27.680 --> 2:23:29.400
 And then they cut out all the other scenes.

2:23:29.400 --> 2:23:30.400
 Okay?

2:23:30.400 --> 2:23:33.680
 So what we're getting is we're getting like this drug when we go to the movies or when

2:23:33.680 --> 2:23:40.080
 we do video games or when we watch, we're literally physiologically responding to our

2:23:40.080 --> 2:23:41.080
 technologies.

2:23:41.080 --> 2:23:42.080
 So we're already there.

2:23:42.080 --> 2:23:44.520
 We're already interfacing with them physiologically.

2:23:44.520 --> 2:23:45.840
 So that's my example.

2:23:45.840 --> 2:23:52.560
 Now, the kind of thing that he's doing, Musk is doing with Neuralink, I say, go for it.

2:23:52.560 --> 2:23:53.560
 That's awesome.

2:23:53.560 --> 2:23:54.560
 I hope he does it.

2:23:54.560 --> 2:23:55.560
 You know, I'm fascinated.

2:23:55.560 --> 2:23:57.520
 I want it to happen.

2:23:57.520 --> 2:23:59.080
 Why do I want it to happen?

2:23:59.080 --> 2:24:03.600
 Because I think that, well, first it's inevitable that it's going to happen.

2:24:03.600 --> 2:24:08.040
 I also want to point out that Jacques Vallée was trying to get this done back in the sixties

2:24:08.040 --> 2:24:09.120
 and the seventies.

2:24:09.120 --> 2:24:17.960
 He was writing papers about, in fact, the ARPANET, the ProtoInternet was called Augmentation

2:24:17.960 --> 2:24:19.920
 of the Human Intellect.

2:24:19.920 --> 2:24:21.960
 So we've been doing this for a while.

2:24:21.960 --> 2:24:22.960
 Okay?

2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:27.000
 So props to Elon Musk, but we've been thinking about this for a good time.

2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:29.760
 We've even been visioning it.

2:24:29.760 --> 2:24:30.760
 Okay?

2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:37.800
 So there was a really interesting Jesuit priest, he was French, Tellur de Chardin.

2:24:37.800 --> 2:24:39.640
 I don't know if you know who he is.

2:24:39.640 --> 2:24:41.360
 If not, he's fascinating.

2:24:41.360 --> 2:24:45.900
 He was actually a soldier before he became a priest.

2:24:45.900 --> 2:24:49.920
 And so he believed, he also saw what he called a biosphere.

2:24:49.920 --> 2:24:55.340
 Now this guy is talking in like the early 20th century, like the 1917, 19, you know,

2:24:55.340 --> 2:24:56.520
 that time period.

2:24:56.520 --> 2:25:01.480
 And so basically he said and wrote about this thing called the noosphere.

2:25:01.480 --> 2:25:05.520
 And he basically said, there will be a point when we merge with our technology and it's

2:25:05.520 --> 2:25:08.240
 going to be somewhat like some kind of a biosphere.

2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:13.240
 We have this atmosphere and then we have the stratosphere and it's going to be this biosphere

2:25:13.240 --> 2:25:16.140
 and we're all going to be hooked into it mentally.

2:25:16.140 --> 2:25:20.600
 So we'll be able to communicate in a way in which we don't communicate now.

2:25:20.600 --> 2:25:23.940
 So you know, that sounds so similar to the singularity.

2:25:23.940 --> 2:25:30.720
 So after I've read him many, many years ago, but when I read the Kurzweil's book about

2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:36.460
 the singularity, to me, it read just like religious language.

2:25:36.460 --> 2:25:42.640
 Like it read like, you know, cause he, in fact, it's so much like revelation to me when

2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:46.040
 I read it that I even assign it to my students in my classes.

2:25:46.040 --> 2:25:48.200
 I'm like, this is, this is it.

2:25:48.200 --> 2:25:53.080
 You know, this is like a really great book of the singularity, you know, the coming singularity.

2:25:53.080 --> 2:25:58.240
 And this religious event, because it seems like it, when he writes about it, he says,

2:25:58.240 --> 2:26:01.320
 I felt it before I even understood it.

2:26:01.320 --> 2:26:02.320
 You know?

2:26:02.320 --> 2:26:03.320
 He, I mean Kurzweil.

2:26:03.320 --> 2:26:04.320
 Kurzweil, yeah, Kurzweil.

2:26:04.320 --> 2:26:10.000
 So what, I mean, what are your feelings about, not feelings, thoughts, feelings too, about

2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:12.760
 the idea of the singularity?

2:26:12.760 --> 2:26:17.080
 Do you think it's ultimately the thing that echoes throughout the history of ideas is

2:26:17.080 --> 2:26:27.240
 this like moment of a revelation, like this, this almost mythological religious moment?

2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:37.200
 Or is there something more physical to this idea of concrete about the idea of, there'll

2:26:37.200 --> 2:26:43.880
 come a point where our technology, there'll be like a phase shift between the basic fabric

2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:49.120
 of like humanity, of how we interact, you know, how evolution brought us to be these

2:26:49.120 --> 2:26:56.040
 biological interaction, that our technology crosses some kind of line of capability that

2:26:56.040 --> 2:27:01.960
 the world would be more technology than human to where it'll leave us behind.

2:27:01.960 --> 2:27:02.960
 Sort of.

2:27:02.960 --> 2:27:03.960
 Oh yeah.

2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:05.680
 I don't think it's going to leave us behind.

2:27:05.680 --> 2:27:08.400
 I think it's going to take us along.

2:27:08.400 --> 2:27:12.320
 But it will be, I mean, I guess the idea of the singularity, first of all, isn't the

2:27:12.320 --> 2:27:15.520
 idea of the singularity is like, we can't possibly predict what's on the other side

2:27:15.520 --> 2:27:16.520
 of the singularity.

2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:21.240
 These are the senses like, this is like the world will be fundamentally transformed.

2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:22.240
 Yes.

2:27:22.240 --> 2:27:23.240
 Okay.

2:27:23.240 --> 2:27:24.240
 So right.

2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:28.280
 And then it was, you know, this was characterized in various movies like Lucy and stuff like

2:27:28.280 --> 2:27:29.280
 that.

2:27:29.280 --> 2:27:34.360
 You know, Lucy being the first human that, right, we, so kind of replicating that this

2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:38.960
 is going to be the next iteration of humans is the singularity.

2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:41.360
 I actually don't believe that.

2:27:41.360 --> 2:27:47.040
 I'm frankly, however, and the reason I don't believe it is because we're material beings

2:27:47.040 --> 2:27:49.440
 and technology has to have a host.

2:27:49.440 --> 2:27:54.000
 So we're not going to, you know, become something super abstract.

2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:56.480
 Like there's, it's just impossible to do.

2:27:56.480 --> 2:27:57.480
 There's nothing like that.

2:27:57.480 --> 2:28:01.680
 Well, people will be listening to this podcast a hundred years from now and laughing at it

2:28:01.680 --> 2:28:08.880
 because they'll be all existing in a virtual reality where it will be all information as

2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:17.000
 opposed to material, meaning connected to some kind of concept of physical, physical

2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:18.000
 reality.

2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:19.000
 I don't even know the right words to use here.

2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:24.680
 You see, that's because there are none because there's no place from, there's no view from

2:28:24.680 --> 2:28:25.680
 nowhere.

2:28:25.680 --> 2:28:32.320
 There's no non material, like we have thoughts, but they're connected to us, right?

2:28:32.320 --> 2:28:35.280
 They're in our, you know, they're somehow, okay.

2:28:35.280 --> 2:28:37.640
 As far as, as far as you know.

2:28:37.640 --> 2:28:43.840
 Listen, platonic forms, I think is about as, as, you know, close to what we're talking

2:28:43.840 --> 2:28:45.640
 about as possible.

2:28:45.640 --> 2:28:50.280
 Like this place where these things exist and then there's like a physical instantiation

2:28:50.280 --> 2:28:51.280
 of it.

2:28:51.280 --> 2:28:57.840
 No, but see we're, the question is from the perspective of the platonic form, what does

2:28:57.840 --> 2:29:00.440
 our physical world look like?

2:29:00.440 --> 2:29:01.440
 You know what I'm saying?

2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:06.680
 Like, you know, if, if, if say you're a creature existing in a virtual reality, like if you

2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:13.720
 grew up your whole life in a virtual reality game, like what is it?

2:29:13.720 --> 2:29:18.400
 And somebody in that virtual reality world tells you that there actually exists this

2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:25.960
 physical world and in fact your own, you think you're in this virtual world, but it's actually

2:29:25.960 --> 2:29:31.200
 you're in a body and this is just your mind putting yourself and there's a piece of technology.

2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:35.800
 Like how will they, how will they be able to think of that physical world?

2:29:35.800 --> 2:29:40.160
 Would they, would they sound exactly like you just sounded a minute ago saying like,

2:29:40.160 --> 2:29:41.800
 well, that's silly.

2:29:41.800 --> 2:29:44.440
 Who cares if there's a physical world?

2:29:44.440 --> 2:29:52.900
 It's the, the entirety of the perception and my memories and all of that is in this other

2:29:52.900 --> 2:29:57.200
 realm of, of like information.

2:29:57.200 --> 2:29:58.980
 It's just all just information.

2:29:58.980 --> 2:30:02.800
 Why do I need some kind of weird meat bag to contain?

2:30:02.800 --> 2:30:08.120
 So there's a great, again, I always, you know, return to something for your audience to read

2:30:08.120 --> 2:30:14.280
 or you, there's a great, very short article online for free by David Chalmers.

2:30:14.280 --> 2:30:15.600
 Do you know him?

2:30:15.600 --> 2:30:16.600
 He's the philosopher of consciousness.

2:30:16.600 --> 2:30:17.600
 Yeah.

2:30:17.600 --> 2:30:18.600
 Interviewed him on this podcast.

2:30:18.600 --> 2:30:19.600
 Yeah.

2:30:19.600 --> 2:30:20.600
 Yeah.

2:30:20.600 --> 2:30:21.600
 Yeah.

2:30:21.600 --> 2:30:22.600
 He's cool.

2:30:22.600 --> 2:30:27.160
 I used to, I was friends with his best friend for a while when, in, when I was in grad school.

2:30:27.160 --> 2:30:29.360
 He probably has some weird friends.

2:30:29.360 --> 2:30:30.360
 He does.

2:30:30.360 --> 2:30:32.960
 He's a philosopher.

2:30:32.960 --> 2:30:33.960
 Okay.

2:30:33.960 --> 2:30:39.440
 So, I like his fashion choice and his style too and hang out with him a little bit.

2:30:39.440 --> 2:30:40.440
 It's a great guy.

2:30:40.440 --> 2:30:41.440
 Okay.

2:30:41.440 --> 2:30:44.960
 So he wrote this article, which I use a lot.

2:30:44.960 --> 2:30:51.200
 I love it because it's accessible to undergraduates and it's called Matrix as Metaphysics.

2:30:51.200 --> 2:30:56.960
 And basically it's, it's an answer to external world skepticism, which is basically how do

2:30:56.960 --> 2:30:58.940
 we know there's an external world, right?

2:30:58.940 --> 2:31:01.540
 How do we know that we're not in a matrix right now?

2:31:01.540 --> 2:31:09.680
 And so basically he's using, he's also, he even references, he uses a religious reference

2:31:09.680 --> 2:31:10.680
 even.

2:31:10.680 --> 2:31:19.600
 He says, you could think of the Matrix of the movie as a new, as the new book of Genesis

2:31:19.600 --> 2:31:21.600
 for our new world, right?

2:31:21.600 --> 2:31:28.360
 And I thought, yeah, that's absolutely correct because, you know, we don't know and we don't,

2:31:28.360 --> 2:31:34.960
 we won't know for sure or for certain, therefore what we know is what is real to us.

2:31:34.960 --> 2:31:40.280
 And so he goes through these scenarios and within philosophy it's called, there's a,

2:31:40.280 --> 2:31:43.440
 this is different from that, but it's like this brain in a vat, right?

2:31:43.440 --> 2:31:48.880
 If you're a brain in a vat and some not so kind scientist is like recreating this world

2:31:48.880 --> 2:31:54.080
 for you just to see, you know, and you think you're this awesome rock star, right?

2:31:54.080 --> 2:31:57.260
 And you're living this awesome existence, but you're actually just this brain in this

2:31:57.260 --> 2:31:58.260
 vat.

2:31:58.260 --> 2:31:59.260
 Okay.

2:31:59.260 --> 2:32:01.300
 But there's still a brain in a vat, okay?

2:32:01.300 --> 2:32:08.680
 So his idea in The Matrix as metaphysics kind of takes out the brain in a vat like this.

2:32:08.680 --> 2:32:10.480
 I don't know if this is possible.

2:32:10.480 --> 2:32:15.880
 So I've read critiques of this that, you know, what you're talking about is a non dualism,

2:32:15.880 --> 2:32:24.920
 like there's like, you know, or it's not necessarily a non dualism.

2:32:24.920 --> 2:32:32.080
 I just, I mean, information in and of itself has to have some kind of material component

2:32:32.080 --> 2:32:33.080
 to it.

2:32:33.080 --> 2:32:38.920
 I mean, it's that when taking it outside of the realm of human beings, because dualism

2:32:38.920 --> 2:32:44.660
 is kind of talking about humans in a sense, it's just possible to me that there could

2:32:44.660 --> 2:32:51.480
 be creatures that exist in a very different form, perhaps rely on very different set of

2:32:51.480 --> 2:32:57.680
 materials that may perhaps not even look like materials to us.

2:32:57.680 --> 2:32:58.880
 Yes, I agree.

2:32:58.880 --> 2:33:06.880
 Which is why like information, it could be, even in computers, the information that's

2:33:06.880 --> 2:33:15.680
 traveling inside a computer is connected to actual material movement, right?

2:33:15.680 --> 2:33:20.600
 So like it is ultimately connected to material movement, but it's less and less about the

2:33:20.600 --> 2:33:24.160
 material and more and more about the information.

2:33:24.160 --> 2:33:27.360
 So I just mean that there's, it's possible that...

2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:32.520
 You think the singularity is basically like sloughing off our material existence?

2:33:32.520 --> 2:33:38.920
 Because I can tell you that this has been the hope of philosophers and theologians forever.

2:33:38.920 --> 2:33:43.360
 Yeah, well, I don't, I think we're living in a, through a singularity.

2:33:43.360 --> 2:33:50.440
 I don't think, I think this world, just like, as you've said already, has been already

2:33:50.440 --> 2:33:53.360
 transformed significantly and keeps continually being transformed.

2:33:53.360 --> 2:33:54.360
 Yes.

2:33:54.360 --> 2:33:59.120
 And we're just riding this big, beautiful wave of transformation.

2:33:59.120 --> 2:34:08.600
 And that's why it's both exciting and terrifying from a scientific perspective that like we're

2:34:08.600 --> 2:34:15.000
 so bad at predicting the future and the future is always so amazing in terms of the things

2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:16.240
 that has brought us.

2:34:16.240 --> 2:34:21.560
 I mean, I don't know if it's always will be this exciting in terms of the rate of innovation,

2:34:21.560 --> 2:34:23.760
 but it seems to be increasing still.

2:34:23.760 --> 2:34:25.600
 And it's really exciting.

2:34:25.600 --> 2:34:26.600
 It's exciting.

2:34:26.600 --> 2:34:27.600
 I think so too.

2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:28.600
 Yeah.

2:34:28.600 --> 2:34:32.720
 It's terrifying because obviously we're building better and better tools for destroying ourselves.

2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:38.720
 But I, on the optimistic side, believe that we're also can build better and better tools

2:34:38.720 --> 2:34:41.600
 to defend against all the ways we can destroy ourselves.

2:34:41.600 --> 2:34:45.560
 And it's kind of this interesting race of innovation.

2:34:45.560 --> 2:34:47.680
 Yeah.

2:34:47.680 --> 2:34:48.680
 Books are great.

2:34:48.680 --> 2:34:53.160
 Of course, the greatest book of all time, two of the greatest books of all time are

2:34:53.160 --> 2:34:54.160
 yours.

2:34:54.160 --> 2:35:04.440
 But besides those, what books, technical, fiction or philosophical, had an impact on

2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:10.800
 your life or possibly you think others might want to read and get some insights from?

2:35:10.800 --> 2:35:13.040
 And what ideas did you pick up from them?

2:35:13.040 --> 2:35:14.040
 Great.

2:35:14.040 --> 2:35:16.480
 Okay, I really enjoy Nietzsche.

2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:17.480
 Okay.

2:35:17.480 --> 2:35:19.800
 So anything by Nietzsche, Friedrich Nietzsche.

2:35:19.800 --> 2:35:20.800
 He's a philosopher.

2:35:20.800 --> 2:35:25.880
 I actually hated him when I first read him in my early twenties.

2:35:25.880 --> 2:35:28.400
 That's like the opposite of most people's experience, right?

2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:32.960
 They usually love them in their twenties and then they throw them to the curb.

2:35:32.960 --> 2:35:33.960
 Later.

2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:34.960
 Yeah.

2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:38.240
 I think he's totally misrepresented and misinterpreted.

2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:39.240
 He grew on you.

2:35:39.240 --> 2:35:41.500
 Well, it happened in one night.

2:35:41.500 --> 2:35:45.440
 So let me just describe it because it's kind of funny.

2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:46.440
 Yeah.

2:35:46.440 --> 2:35:47.440
 Happened on New Year's.

2:35:47.440 --> 2:35:51.960
 So I had friends when I was in my twenties and they kept telling me, you have to read

2:35:51.960 --> 2:35:52.960
 Nietzsche, you have to read Nietzsche.

2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:53.960
 And I tried.

2:35:53.960 --> 2:35:54.960
 Okay.

2:35:54.960 --> 2:36:02.080
 But again, you know, no, I was not into how he described the philosophical concepts he

2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:04.360
 was trying to get across.

2:36:04.360 --> 2:36:09.320
 But they weren't giving up, I have very persistent friends.

2:36:09.320 --> 2:36:18.160
 So one of them gave me The Gay Science and I had it on my bookstand and it was New Year's

2:36:18.160 --> 2:36:22.120
 Eve and I'm actually not a big part, I'm actually an introvert.

2:36:22.120 --> 2:36:24.160
 I'm a geeky introvert, okay?

2:36:24.160 --> 2:36:26.320
 So I don't go out and party a lot.

2:36:26.320 --> 2:36:29.440
 It was New Year's Eve, even that couldn't get me out to go party.

2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:34.780
 So I just wanted to go to bed and New Year's Eve hit and everybody went out and I was asleep

2:36:34.780 --> 2:36:38.680
 and they woke me up and I was like, darn, they woke me up, eh, might as well read this

2:36:38.680 --> 2:36:39.680
 book by Nietzsche.

2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:40.680
 Okay.

2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:45.200
 So I picked it up and lo and behold, I turned to a page that was exactly about, it was called

2:36:45.200 --> 2:36:50.320
 Sanctus Januarius, which is basically St. January and it was about New Year's Eve.

2:36:50.320 --> 2:36:53.000
 And I thought, whoa, what a weird coincidence.

2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:59.040
 And it was also super Catholic and it was a really beautiful little aphorism.

2:36:59.040 --> 2:37:03.180
 It's actually a book of aphorisms, which are kind of religious, right?

2:37:03.180 --> 2:37:08.080
 And so it's religious, the genre is religious, let's put it that way, but he's not.

2:37:08.080 --> 2:37:13.760
 So basically he says, today's the day when people are supposed to make these resolutions,

2:37:13.760 --> 2:37:14.760
 right?

2:37:14.760 --> 2:37:20.600
 And he says, from here on out, I will never say no, I will only say yes.

2:37:20.600 --> 2:37:21.600
 Okay.

2:37:21.600 --> 2:37:24.400
 I look away, if something's horrible, I'll just look away from it, I won't get angry

2:37:24.400 --> 2:37:25.400
 at it.

2:37:25.400 --> 2:37:28.440
 And then he also says, I will be like St. January.

2:37:28.440 --> 2:37:33.600
 And St. January is actually the saint whose blood is in this place in Italy.

2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:39.660
 I think it's in Italy, and every year it turns to blood again.

2:37:39.660 --> 2:37:46.800
 So it's like it's desiccated, so it's this miracle, it says, my blood is now, it flows

2:37:46.800 --> 2:37:47.800
 again.

2:37:47.800 --> 2:37:48.800
 And I was like, wow, that's really beautiful.

2:37:48.800 --> 2:37:54.120
 And I said, and a strange coincidence because it just turned 12th.

2:37:54.120 --> 2:37:59.060
 So it's like New Year's Eve, I pick up the book, I read this aphorism and I said, strange

2:37:59.060 --> 2:38:00.680
 coincidence that.

2:38:00.680 --> 2:38:03.720
 And then I turned the page, and the page is about coincidences.

2:38:03.720 --> 2:38:07.440
 And I was like, I shut it, and I thought, this is weird.

2:38:07.440 --> 2:38:11.280
 And I felt like it was alive, I felt like the book was alive and Nietzsche was speaking

2:38:11.280 --> 2:38:12.280
 to me, right?

2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:15.540
 I had a experience and engagement with Nietzsche.

2:38:15.540 --> 2:38:21.240
 And so after that, I couldn't put his stuff down, it was engaging, fascinating, everything.

2:38:21.240 --> 2:38:23.600
 So yeah, so that's one book, The Gay Science.

2:38:23.600 --> 2:38:27.520
 What did you pick up from The Gay Science or from Nietzsche in general?

2:38:27.520 --> 2:38:30.920
 Because there's some ideas that just kind of...

2:38:30.920 --> 2:38:35.840
 Yeah, the idea is basically that truth, he's got awesome one liners.

2:38:35.840 --> 2:38:39.280
 So truth is a woman.

2:38:39.280 --> 2:38:42.740
 So okay, what does he mean by that?

2:38:42.740 --> 2:38:43.740
 Truth is a woman.

2:38:43.740 --> 2:38:45.560
 Basically, she's going to lie to you.

2:38:45.560 --> 2:38:49.840
 She looks real attractive, but she's not going to tell you the truth.

2:38:49.840 --> 2:38:51.560
 Oh, Nietzsche.

2:38:51.560 --> 2:38:52.560
 Yeah.

2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:56.720
 So okay, so basically, I'm not saying that that's true about women.

2:38:56.720 --> 2:38:58.800
 I'm obviously a woman.

2:38:58.800 --> 2:39:04.680
 So basically what he's saying is that truth is like what I said, Brother Guy said, it's

2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:06.560
 a moving target, okay?

2:39:06.560 --> 2:39:09.920
 We started this whole conversation with what's real, right?

2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:11.880
 So I should have just gone straight to Nietzsche.

2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:13.880
 Haven't you heard truth is a woman?

2:39:13.880 --> 2:39:17.080
 Okay, so truth is a woman.

2:39:17.080 --> 2:39:21.480
 All right, so that and also, and Foucault, this other philosopher, French philosopher

2:39:21.480 --> 2:39:28.120
 actually takes up this idea and creates his own framework called genealogy from it.

2:39:28.120 --> 2:39:34.080
 So the genealogy of morals, so that we only believe certain things and we sediment them

2:39:34.080 --> 2:39:35.080
 into truth.

2:39:35.080 --> 2:39:38.920
 So we say a truth told, who said that?

2:39:38.920 --> 2:39:40.400
 Was it Lenin or Stalin?

2:39:40.400 --> 2:39:46.440
 A truth told enough times, I mean, a lie told enough times becomes the truth.

2:39:46.440 --> 2:39:48.520
 So that's basically Nietzschean right there, okay?

2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:49.520
 So that's Nietzsche.

2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:56.000
 So Nietzsche also is a huge critic of Christianity, which I'm actually Catholic, I'm a practicing

2:39:56.000 --> 2:39:57.000
 Catholic.

2:39:57.000 --> 2:40:02.640
 So I appreciated his critique, I thought it was actually quite accurate.

2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:06.400
 He's a critique of religion in general and he's fascinating.

2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:12.160
 And also I find that he talks about altered states of consciousness and he calls them

2:40:12.160 --> 2:40:14.240
 elevated states.

2:40:14.240 --> 2:40:18.280
 And I think through his book, you can actually experience elevated states.

2:40:18.280 --> 2:40:23.680
 So yeah, Nietzsche, thumbs up.

2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:24.680
 So what other books?

2:40:24.680 --> 2:40:25.680
 Yeah, okay.

2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:30.600
 So Hannah Rent, she is a philosopher that not a lot of people know about, but she was

2:40:30.600 --> 2:40:38.560
 a Jewish woman during the Holocaust and she was interned at Bergen Belsen, which was basically

2:40:38.560 --> 2:40:42.000
 Auschwitz for women and she escaped.

2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:45.600
 She came to the United States and she had worked with Heidegger, even though he's supposed

2:40:45.600 --> 2:40:50.800
 to be anti Semitic and a Nazi and everything, but they were lovers, okay?

2:40:50.800 --> 2:40:55.160
 So she comes out and she's at Columbia University and she teaches philosophy there.

2:40:55.160 --> 2:40:58.680
 And she writes two books, which I'll recommend.

2:40:58.680 --> 2:41:03.480
 One is called Eichmann in Jerusalem, where she attends the Nuremberg trials.

2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:07.800
 And she basically makes this really astute observation about evil.

2:41:07.800 --> 2:41:11.720
 And she says, Eichmann is one of the people who sent the Jews to the concentration camps

2:41:11.720 --> 2:41:14.220
 who ran the trains, okay?

2:41:14.220 --> 2:41:19.960
 And she said, the thing about Eichmann was that he didn't seem particularly evil.

2:41:19.960 --> 2:41:23.360
 Actually, he seemed to be quite a nice guy.

2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:28.360
 She said, what was interesting about him was he seemed incredibly thoughtless and stupid.

2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:31.520
 And she said, and he used a lot of stereotypes like memes.

2:41:31.520 --> 2:41:34.640
 So she actually wrote about memes before we had them.

2:41:34.640 --> 2:41:38.280
 And now people just use memes and they're actually used against us even.

2:41:38.280 --> 2:41:42.800
 There's even a segments of warfare called memetic warfare, all right?

2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:47.040
 So memes are something that can sway a whole population of people.

2:41:47.040 --> 2:41:50.680
 So she wrote about memes before they were even in existence.

2:41:50.680 --> 2:41:51.680
 And that's Eichmann in Jerusalem.

2:41:51.680 --> 2:41:58.400
 And I think she also has some really amazing things to say about evil is that when people

2:41:58.400 --> 2:42:02.880
 remain thoughtless, she has another book called The Life of the Mind, which is gigantic.

2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:07.480
 And I don't think anybody will read it, but frankly, it's one of the best books I've

2:42:07.480 --> 2:42:08.480
 ever read.

2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:09.920
 And I've read it many times.

2:42:09.920 --> 2:42:13.720
 And basically, The Life of the Mind, in The Life of the Mind, she asks a very simple question.

2:42:13.720 --> 2:42:15.840
 She says, why do people do bad things?

2:42:15.840 --> 2:42:17.040
 Why are they evil?

2:42:17.040 --> 2:42:22.580
 And what she says is she wonders if it's, she says that bad people sleep well at night

2:42:22.580 --> 2:42:25.720
 contrary to, you know how the saying, how do you sleep at night?

2:42:25.720 --> 2:42:29.160
 Well, that's only because you're a good person that you're asking that question because you

2:42:29.160 --> 2:42:33.640
 actually have a conscience and a conscience is this dual kind of, you fight with yourself

2:42:33.640 --> 2:42:36.480
 about the consequences of your actions.

2:42:36.480 --> 2:42:39.820
 And she says, bad people don't seem to have a conscience.

2:42:39.820 --> 2:42:41.640
 Do they actually sleep well at night?

2:42:41.640 --> 2:42:45.880
 And so she goes through a whole history of philosophy about evil, and that's really a

2:42:45.880 --> 2:42:46.880
 good one too.

2:42:46.880 --> 2:42:49.040
 But I also have to recommend this one too.

2:42:49.040 --> 2:42:50.040
 There's one more.

2:42:50.040 --> 2:42:53.100
 So I know I recommended two, but just from the same philosopher.

2:42:53.100 --> 2:42:58.600
 My friend Jeffrey Kreipel, he's at Rice University and he's in my field, religious studies.

2:42:58.600 --> 2:42:59.880
 He's written several books.

2:42:59.880 --> 2:43:02.600
 I mean, he's written a heck of a lot of books, let's put it that way.

2:43:02.600 --> 2:43:07.520
 But I think his best book or the one that impacted me the most is called Authors of

2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:09.200
 the Impossible.

2:43:09.200 --> 2:43:15.120
 And his book, his writing is very much like Nietzsche's writing in the sense that he,

2:43:15.120 --> 2:43:19.200
 it's almost as if he reaches out of the pages and he grabs you and he kind of slaps you

2:43:19.200 --> 2:43:24.600
 around and says, think about this, you know, and you can't help but be changed after you've

2:43:24.600 --> 2:43:25.600
 read it.

2:43:25.600 --> 2:43:27.720
 And he's got a great chapter in there about Jacques Vallée.

2:43:27.720 --> 2:43:37.240
 Oh, so he covers a bunch of different thinkers and authors that somehow are, what is it?

2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:39.720
 Some aspect of revolutionism aspect.

2:43:39.720 --> 2:43:42.180
 They're thinking the impossible.

2:43:42.180 --> 2:43:47.520
 There's a great one he's written called Mutants and Mystics, where he talks about the comic

2:43:47.520 --> 2:43:52.040
 strips, the, gosh, why can't I remember the name of the person?

2:43:52.040 --> 2:43:53.760
 He just died, Stan Lee.

2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:58.700
 He talks about the history of the comics by Stan Lee and they're all paranormal.

2:43:58.700 --> 2:44:03.240
 They all start off super paranormal and it's fascinating.

2:44:03.240 --> 2:44:13.280
 On the topic of Hannah Arendt, so I haven't read her work, but I've vaguely touched upon

2:44:13.280 --> 2:44:20.320
 sort of like commentary of her work and it seems like some people think her work is dangerous

2:44:20.320 --> 2:44:21.320
 in some aspect.

2:44:21.320 --> 2:44:27.160
 I don't know if you can comment on why that is.

2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:32.400
 It feels like similar with Ayn Rand or something like that, where like this is, I should say

2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:34.120
 not dangerous, but controversial.

2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:35.120
 Yes, it is.

2:44:35.120 --> 2:44:36.880
 Yes, they think it's controversial.

2:44:36.880 --> 2:44:40.360
 This is the reason I believe, I've heard of the controversy.

2:44:40.360 --> 2:44:47.520
 The controversy is that she didn't, first of all, she is Jewish and she did escape a

2:44:47.520 --> 2:44:54.360
 concentration camp and yet she's called, she's been called anti Jewish.

2:44:54.360 --> 2:45:01.600
 And I think part of that was that she basically was saying something that I believe that a

2:45:01.600 --> 2:45:08.760
 lot of normal people are like Eichmann and evil things are done by people who just follow

2:45:08.760 --> 2:45:12.640
 the rules and they don't think about what they're doing.

2:45:12.640 --> 2:45:18.320
 And that's one of the most pernicious forms of evil of our time.

2:45:18.320 --> 2:45:24.820
 So we talked quite a bit about the definitions of religion and what are the different building

2:45:24.820 --> 2:45:26.280
 blocks of religion.

2:45:26.280 --> 2:45:32.020
 So one of the, I don't think we touched on, we did a little bit with the afterlife, but

2:45:32.020 --> 2:45:36.440
 in a sense, I don't know if you're familiar with the Ernest Becker work and all the philosophies

2:45:36.440 --> 2:45:44.940
 around there about the fear of death and how the fear of our own mortality, awareness of

2:45:44.940 --> 2:45:57.120
 our mortality and its fear is in case of Ernest Becker is a significant component in the psychology

2:45:57.120 --> 2:46:01.320
 in the way we humans develop our understanding of the world.

2:46:01.320 --> 2:46:09.440
 So what are your thoughts in the context of religion or maybe in the context of your own

2:46:09.440 --> 2:46:19.760
 mind about the role of death in life or fear of death in life and are you afraid of death?

2:46:19.760 --> 2:46:22.520
 We cover everything in this podcast.

2:46:22.520 --> 2:46:25.280
 Every single topic is covered.

2:46:25.280 --> 2:46:26.280
 Wow.

2:46:26.280 --> 2:46:27.280
 Okay.

2:46:27.280 --> 2:46:36.600
 I so happen to have benefited perhaps from living with an older brother who seemingly

2:46:36.600 --> 2:46:42.880
 had no fear of death while growing up and he did everything, okay?

2:46:42.880 --> 2:46:49.440
 So he climbed mountains, he was a rock climber, he jumped out of airplanes.

2:46:49.440 --> 2:46:53.720
 Of course, he had to be a Green Beret and go into the special forces where that type

2:46:53.720 --> 2:46:57.800
 of thing is a requirement, right?

2:46:57.800 --> 2:47:03.340
 And so because of that, I did a lot of things outside of my comfort zone and which probably

2:47:03.340 --> 2:47:09.560
 I shouldn't have done and hope to goodness, my kids don't do them, okay?

2:47:09.560 --> 2:47:10.560
 Okay.

2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:12.560
 So do I fear death?

2:47:12.560 --> 2:47:14.920
 I think about death a lot actually.

2:47:14.920 --> 2:47:20.720
 You may not know this about me, but in my field, I was the head, I was the co chair

2:47:20.720 --> 2:47:22.640
 of the death panel.

2:47:22.640 --> 2:47:23.640
 It's called the death panel.

2:47:23.640 --> 2:47:31.240
 No, it's like it's the panel to think about death in religious studies and I was that

2:47:31.240 --> 2:47:32.240
 for many years.

2:47:32.240 --> 2:47:34.120
 So you've thought about it a bit.

2:47:34.120 --> 2:47:35.120
 A bit.

2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:40.240
 Let's see, I think that people are a little too confident, I think about life in general

2:47:40.240 --> 2:47:43.680
 that they're gonna kind of live all the time and not die.

2:47:43.680 --> 2:47:48.800
 I happen to, I mean, I hate to say it, I'm super positive and most people would consider

2:47:48.800 --> 2:47:52.000
 me to be too happy almost, right?

2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:56.440
 And so it's odd then that I spend a lot of time thinking about death, but I wonder if

2:47:56.440 --> 2:47:58.520
 there's a connection there.

2:47:58.520 --> 2:48:01.240
 I'm happy to be alive, right?

2:48:01.240 --> 2:48:04.880
 That's kind of what the thinking about death does is it makes you appreciate the days that

2:48:04.880 --> 2:48:05.880
 you do have.

2:48:05.880 --> 2:48:06.880
 Yeah.

2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:07.880
 It's a weird controversy.

2:48:07.880 --> 2:48:17.520
 I tend to believe that the fact that this life ends gives each day a significant amount

2:48:17.520 --> 2:48:19.560
 of meaning.

2:48:19.560 --> 2:48:23.600
 So I don't know, it seems like an important feature of life.

2:48:23.600 --> 2:48:28.680
 It's not like a bug, it seems like a feature that it ends, but it's a strange feature because

2:48:28.680 --> 2:48:32.040
 I wish it, like all the good stuff you wish it wouldn't end.

2:48:32.040 --> 2:48:36.160
 Well, you know what's interesting, Lex, and I do point this out to my students because

2:48:36.160 --> 2:48:41.640
 we cover in a lot of the basic studies courses I teach, we cover all religions or as many

2:48:41.640 --> 2:48:43.720
 as we can, like the major religions.

2:48:43.720 --> 2:48:46.680
 And so take Hinduism, for example.

2:48:46.680 --> 2:48:48.760
 Now this is an ancient religion, okay?

2:48:48.760 --> 2:48:52.720
 So you and I are here talking about how we enjoy living and life and things like that.

2:48:52.720 --> 2:48:57.800
 Well, the goal of Hinduism is basically never to get reincarnated again, is basically to

2:48:57.800 --> 2:48:59.440
 not live, okay?

2:48:59.440 --> 2:49:02.720
 And to get off samsara, which is the wheel of life and death.

2:49:02.720 --> 2:49:03.720
 Yeah.

2:49:03.720 --> 2:49:04.720
 Escape the whole thing.

2:49:04.720 --> 2:49:05.720
 Yeah, exactly.

2:49:05.720 --> 2:49:06.720
 Think of that.

2:49:06.720 --> 2:49:11.380
 Conditions are so different that you and I and my students are happy to be alive.

2:49:11.380 --> 2:49:17.000
 But back in the day, thousands of years ago, when they wrote, they actually didn't write

2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:21.120
 it, they spoke the Vedas, which were the sacred traditions of India.

2:49:21.120 --> 2:49:22.120
 They wanted off.

2:49:22.120 --> 2:49:24.160
 They didn't want to come back.

2:49:24.160 --> 2:49:25.720
 Life was terrible.

2:49:25.720 --> 2:49:30.680
 That's what people don't have the adequate understanding of history, that for the majority

2:49:30.680 --> 2:49:34.400
 of people, life is really hard, right?

2:49:34.400 --> 2:49:38.600
 And you and I are, and your audience, among the lucky.

2:49:38.600 --> 2:49:39.600
 Yeah.

2:49:39.600 --> 2:49:42.440
 Yeah, we actually like life.

2:49:42.440 --> 2:49:45.160
 We want to live.

2:49:45.160 --> 2:49:46.160
 Most of the time.

2:49:46.160 --> 2:49:47.160
 Yeah, most of the time.

2:49:47.160 --> 2:49:51.400
 What do you think the biggest, since we're covering every single possible topic, let

2:49:51.400 --> 2:49:54.960
 me ask the biggest one, the unanswerable one.

2:49:54.960 --> 2:49:59.600
 From the perspective of alien intelligence, or from the perspective of religious studies,

2:49:59.600 --> 2:50:05.960
 or from the perspective of just Diana, what do you think is the meaning of this existence

2:50:05.960 --> 2:50:07.960
 of this life of ours?

2:50:07.960 --> 2:50:08.960
 Yes.

2:50:08.960 --> 2:50:09.960
 Okay.

2:50:09.960 --> 2:50:10.960
 So, all right.

2:50:10.960 --> 2:50:20.200
 So, well, of course I have to, my philosophical training as an undergrad always makes me think

2:50:20.200 --> 2:50:24.400
 about like, what's the assumption in your question?

2:50:24.400 --> 2:50:25.400
 There's an assumption there.

2:50:25.400 --> 2:50:26.400
 It's like, there is a meaning.

2:50:26.400 --> 2:50:27.400
 Okay.

2:50:27.400 --> 2:50:28.400
 That's the assumption.

2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:29.400
 What do you mean by meaning?

2:50:29.400 --> 2:50:30.400
 What do you mean by life?

2:50:30.400 --> 2:50:31.400
 Yeah.

2:50:31.400 --> 2:50:32.400
 Can you define the terms?

2:50:32.400 --> 2:50:33.400
 No, no.

2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:34.400
 But listen.

2:50:34.400 --> 2:50:35.400
 Okay.

2:50:35.400 --> 2:50:36.400
 I'll answer your question.

2:50:36.400 --> 2:50:37.400
 I'm just going to say that there's this assumption that we should have meaning to life.

2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:38.400
 Okay.

2:50:38.400 --> 2:50:39.400
 Well, maybe we shouldn't.

2:50:39.400 --> 2:50:40.400
 Maybe it's just all random.

2:50:40.400 --> 2:50:41.400
 Okay.

2:50:41.400 --> 2:50:42.400
 However, I believe that it's not.

2:50:42.400 --> 2:50:46.960
 And in my opinion, the meaning of life, in my opinion, is intrinsic.

2:50:46.960 --> 2:50:48.200
 I enjoy living.

2:50:48.200 --> 2:50:49.200
 I want to live.

2:50:49.200 --> 2:50:50.680
 Sometimes I don't enjoy living.

2:50:50.680 --> 2:50:53.320
 And when I don't enjoy living, I change my circumstances.

2:50:53.320 --> 2:50:54.960
 So it's intrinsic.

2:50:54.960 --> 2:50:59.600
 And I think that certain things are intrinsic and like love, love of your children is kind

2:50:59.600 --> 2:51:03.800
 of, well, it's actually physiological, but it's also intrinsic.

2:51:03.800 --> 2:51:04.800
 It's beautiful.

2:51:04.800 --> 2:51:12.320
 You know, there's something about it that is intrinsically desirable.

2:51:12.320 --> 2:51:17.000
 So I think the meaning of life is like that, intrinsically desirable.

2:51:17.000 --> 2:51:25.560
 So it's something that just is born inside you based on what makes you feel good?

2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:27.720
 No, that's hedonism.

2:51:27.720 --> 2:51:32.080
 That's about what a wordy place, love, love, love of your children.

2:51:32.080 --> 2:51:33.080
 Yeah.

2:51:33.080 --> 2:51:39.120
 So basically, love of your children, by the way, is not always easy because they do things

2:51:39.120 --> 2:51:40.840
 that they shouldn't do.

2:51:40.840 --> 2:51:41.880
 You have to discipline them.

2:51:41.880 --> 2:51:45.280
 That's one of the worst things about parenthood to me is disciplining my children.

2:51:45.280 --> 2:51:46.280
 I don't like to do that.

2:51:46.280 --> 2:51:48.360
 I love them.

2:51:48.360 --> 2:51:55.120
 So a lot of things that I do that I feel are good are not easy.

2:51:55.120 --> 2:52:01.180
 So there's an intrinsic sense that, like, okay, let's take animals, okay?

2:52:01.180 --> 2:52:02.640
 So we have dogs and cats, okay?

2:52:02.640 --> 2:52:05.000
 So you might not, but I do.

2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:07.760
 I told you about them.

2:52:07.760 --> 2:52:10.520
 Can you share their names?

2:52:10.520 --> 2:52:12.560
 If I share their names, I will share their names.

2:52:12.560 --> 2:52:13.560
 Okay.

2:52:13.560 --> 2:52:18.160
 So we have a cat, and it has red fluffy hair, and so we called it Trump.

2:52:18.160 --> 2:52:23.560
 Well, when we got our dog, we figured that it needed a companion, so we called it Putin.

2:52:23.560 --> 2:52:24.880
 So we have Trump and Putin.

2:52:24.880 --> 2:52:30.480
 Those are the greatest pet names of all time, I'm sorry.

2:52:30.480 --> 2:52:36.280
 And maybe we'll be able to share a picture of your cat because this is awesome.

2:52:36.280 --> 2:52:38.880
 It is really cute, yeah.

2:52:38.880 --> 2:52:39.880
 Very photogenic.

2:52:39.880 --> 2:52:49.360
 I mean, is this something that's, whether we're talking about love or the intrinsic

2:52:49.360 --> 2:52:54.960
 meaning, do you think that's something that's really special to humans?

2:52:54.960 --> 2:53:01.640
 Or if there is intelligent alien civilizations out there, do you think that's something that

2:53:01.640 --> 2:53:06.000
 they possess as well, maybe in different forms?

2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:13.720
 Like whatever this thing that meaning is, this intrinsic drive that we have, do you

2:53:13.720 --> 2:53:19.680
 think that's just a property of life, of some level of complexity?

2:53:19.680 --> 2:53:22.640
 That we will see that everywhere in this universe?

2:53:22.640 --> 2:53:28.600
 In my opinion, and this is just my opinion, I do think that it is, but I also think that

2:53:28.600 --> 2:53:30.360
 it can take different forms.

2:53:30.360 --> 2:53:33.480
 So if there is like, think of gravity, right?

2:53:33.480 --> 2:53:36.280
 Gravity kind of like makes stuff stick to it, right?

2:53:36.280 --> 2:53:37.480
 It attracts stuff.

2:53:37.480 --> 2:53:38.920
 Well, what is love to you?

2:53:38.920 --> 2:53:40.280
 That does that too, right?

2:53:40.280 --> 2:53:43.840
 So people who are, we call them charismatic.

2:53:43.840 --> 2:53:46.120
 Charism, it means love.

2:53:46.120 --> 2:53:47.560
 Charism means light and love.

2:53:47.560 --> 2:53:54.000
 So a charismatic person is a person who attracts people to them like the sun does, right?

2:53:54.000 --> 2:53:56.780
 Like, you know?

2:53:56.780 --> 2:54:02.980
 So I think that whatever this property is, that's intrinsic, is like gravity and most

2:54:02.980 --> 2:54:06.720
 likely takes different forms in different types of life forms.

2:54:06.720 --> 2:54:12.960
 Yeah, I can't wait until like a Albert Einstein type of figure in the future will discover

2:54:12.960 --> 2:54:17.240
 that love is in fact one of the fundamental forces of physics.

2:54:17.240 --> 2:54:19.280
 That would be cool.

2:54:19.280 --> 2:54:23.440
 Diana, this is one of the favorite conversations I've ever had.

2:54:23.440 --> 2:54:28.080
