00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
 As part of MIT course 6S099 on artificial general intelligence, I got a chance to sit

00:05.800 --> 00:12.960
 down with Christoph Koch, who is one of the seminal figures in neurobiology, neuroscience,

00:12.960 --> 00:15.640
 and generally in the study of consciousness.

00:15.640 --> 00:21.180
 He is the president, the chief scientific officer of the Allen Institute for Brain Science

00:21.180 --> 00:22.480
 in Seattle.

00:22.480 --> 00:27.360
 From 1986 to 2013, he was a professor at Caltech.

00:27.360 --> 00:33.880
 Before that, he was at MIT, he is extremely well cited, over 100,000 citations.

00:33.880 --> 00:38.760
 His research, his writing, his ideas have had big impact on the scientific community

00:38.760 --> 00:43.720
 and the general public in the way we think about consciousness, in the way we see ourselves

00:43.720 --> 00:44.840
 as human beings.

00:44.840 --> 00:49.360
 He's the author of several books, The Quest for Consciousness and Neurobiological Approach,

00:49.360 --> 00:55.180
 and a more recent book, Consciousness, Confessions of a Romantic Reductionist.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.760
 Thanks very much and I hope you enjoy.

01:11.760 --> 01:17.360
 Okay, before we delve into the beautiful mysteries of consciousness, let's zoom out a little

01:17.360 --> 01:23.200
 bit and let me ask, do you think there's intelligent life out there in the universe?

01:23.200 --> 01:25.560
 Yes, I do believe so.

01:25.560 --> 01:29.600
 We have no evidence of it, but I think the probabilities are overwhelming in favor of

01:29.600 --> 01:30.600
 it.

01:30.600 --> 01:35.200
 Given a universe where we have 10 to the 11 galaxies and each galaxy has between 10 to

01:35.200 --> 01:41.520
 the 11, 10 to the 12 stars and we know most stars have one or more planets.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.480
 So how does that make you feel?

01:43.480 --> 01:49.020
 It still makes me feel special because I have experiences.

01:49.020 --> 01:55.320
 I feel the world, I experience the world and independent of whether there are other creatures

01:55.320 --> 02:00.520
 out there, I still feel the world and I have access to this world in this very strange

02:00.520 --> 02:04.760
 compelling way and that's the core of human existence.

02:04.760 --> 02:10.480
 Now, you said human, do you think if those intelligent creatures are out there, do you

02:10.480 --> 02:13.680
 think they experience their world?

02:13.680 --> 02:18.120
 Yes, if they are evolved, if they are a product of natural evolution as they would have to

02:18.120 --> 02:20.200
 be, they will also experience their own world.

02:20.200 --> 02:24.640
 The consciousness isn't just human, you're right, it's much wider.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.920
 It may be spread across all of biology.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.880
 The only thing that we have special is we can talk about it.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.360
 Of course, not all people can talk about it.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.600
 Babies and little children can talk about it.

02:35.600 --> 02:41.200
 Patients who have a stroke in the left inferior frontal gyrus can talk about it, but most

02:41.200 --> 02:45.760
 normal adult people can talk about it and so we think that makes us special compared

02:45.760 --> 02:49.480
 to let's say monkeys or dogs or cats or mice or all the other creatures that we share the

02:49.480 --> 02:54.240
 planet with, but all the evidence seems to suggest that they too experience the world

02:54.240 --> 02:59.520
 and so it's overwhelmingly likely that aliens would also experience their world.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.520
 Of course, differently because they have a different sensorium, they have different sensors,

03:02.520 --> 03:08.280
 they have a very different environment, but the fact that I would strongly suppose that

03:08.280 --> 03:09.760
 they also have experiences.

03:09.760 --> 03:16.400
 They feel pain and pleasure and see in some sort of spectrum and hear and have all the

03:16.400 --> 03:17.760
 other senses.

03:17.760 --> 03:21.080
 Of course, their language, if they have one, would be different so we might not be able

03:21.080 --> 03:24.600
 to understand their poetry about the experiences that they have.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.240
 That's correct.

03:26.240 --> 03:33.200
 So in a talk, in a video, I've heard you mention Siputzo, a dachshund that you came up with,

03:33.200 --> 03:37.160
 that you grew up with, it was part of your family when you were young.

03:37.160 --> 03:40.840
 First of all, you're technically a Midwestern boy.

03:40.840 --> 03:41.840
 You just –

03:41.840 --> 03:42.840
 Technically.

03:42.840 --> 03:43.840
 Yes.

03:43.840 --> 03:48.480
 But after that, you traveled around a bit, hence a little bit of the accent.

03:48.480 --> 03:55.920
 You talked about Siputzo, the dachshund, having these elements of humanness, of consciousness

03:55.920 --> 03:56.920
 that you discovered.

03:56.920 --> 04:01.440
 So I just wanted to ask, can you look back in your childhood and remember when was the

04:01.440 --> 04:07.280
 first time you realized you yourself, sort of from a third person perspective, are a

04:07.280 --> 04:08.800
 conscious being?

04:08.800 --> 04:15.480
 This idea of stepping outside yourself and seeing there's something special going on

04:15.480 --> 04:17.960
 here in my brain.

04:17.960 --> 04:19.640
 I can't really actually – it's a good question.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.960
 I'm not sure I recall a discrete moment.

04:21.960 --> 04:25.880
 I mean, you take it for granted because that's the only world you know.

04:25.880 --> 04:33.040
 The only world I know and you know is the world of seeing and hearing voices and touching

04:33.040 --> 04:34.040
 and all the other things.

04:34.040 --> 04:40.040
 So it's only much later at early – in my underguided days when I enrolled in physics

04:40.040 --> 04:43.480
 and in philosophy that I really thought about it and thought, well, this is really fundamentally

04:43.480 --> 04:48.040
 very, very mysterious and there's nothing really in physics right now that explains

04:48.040 --> 04:52.000
 this transition from the physics of the brain to feelings.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.480
 Where do the feelings come in?

04:53.480 --> 04:57.560
 So you can look at the foundational equation of quantum mechanics, general relativity.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.960
 You can look at the periodic table of the elements.

04:59.960 --> 05:05.680
 You can look at the endless ATGC chat in our genes and nowhere is consciousness.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.600
 Yet I wake up every morning to a world where I have experiences.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.680
 And so that's the heart of the ancient mind body problem.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.760
 How do experiences get into the world?

05:16.760 --> 05:19.720
 So what is consciousness?

05:19.720 --> 05:20.800
 Experience.

05:20.800 --> 05:24.560
 This is any experience.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.500
 Some people call it subjective feeling.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.520
 Some people call it phenomenology.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.500
 Some people call it qualia of the philosopher.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.840
 But they all denote the same thing.

05:32.840 --> 05:37.200
 It feels like something in the famous word of the philosopher Thomas Nagel.

05:37.200 --> 05:45.200
 It feels like something to be a bat or to be an American or to be angry or to be sad

05:45.200 --> 05:49.440
 or to be in love or to have pain.

05:49.440 --> 05:53.080
 And that is what experience is, any possible experience.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.320
 Could be as mundane as just sitting in a chair.

05:55.320 --> 06:01.240
 Could be as exalted as having a mystical moment in deep meditation.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.520
 Those are just different forms of experiences.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.520
 Experience.

06:04.520 --> 06:11.920
 So if you were to sit down with maybe the next, skip a couple generations, of IBM Watson,

06:11.920 --> 06:18.320
 something that won Jeopardy, what is the gap, I guess the question is, between Watson, that

06:18.320 --> 06:26.280
 might be much smarter than you, than us, than any human alive, but may not have experience,

06:26.280 --> 06:27.280
 what is the gap?

06:27.280 --> 06:30.520
 Well, so that's a big, big question.

06:30.520 --> 06:35.720
 That's occupied people for the last, certainly last 50 years since we, you know, since the

06:35.720 --> 06:39.040
 advent, the birth of computers.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.920
 That's a question Alan Turing tried to answer.

06:40.920 --> 06:46.280
 And of course he did it in this indirect way by proposing a test, an operational test.

06:46.280 --> 06:50.400
 But that's not really, that's, you know, he tried to get at what does it mean for a person

06:50.400 --> 06:52.840
 to think, and then he had this test, right?

06:52.840 --> 06:57.200
 You lock them away, and then you have a communication with them, and then you try to guess after

06:57.200 --> 07:00.720
 a while whether that is a person or whether it's a computer system.

07:00.720 --> 07:05.400
 There's no question that now or very soon, you know, Alexa or Siri or, you know, Google

07:05.400 --> 07:07.640
 now will pass this test, right?

07:07.640 --> 07:12.440
 And you can game it, but you know, ultimately, certainly in your generation, there will be

07:12.440 --> 07:16.680
 machines that will speak with complete poise that will remember everything you ever said.

07:16.680 --> 07:21.320
 They'll remember every email you ever had, like Samantha, remember in the movie Her?

07:21.320 --> 07:22.320
 Yeah.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.360
 There's no question it's going to happen.

07:24.360 --> 07:28.280
 But of course, the key question is, does it feel like anything to be Samantha in the movie

07:28.280 --> 07:29.280
 Her?

07:29.280 --> 07:32.200
 Or does it feel like anything to be Watson?

07:32.200 --> 07:38.200
 And there one has to very, very strongly think there are two different concepts here that

07:38.200 --> 07:39.200
 we co mingle.

07:39.200 --> 07:45.160
 There is the concept of intelligence, natural or artificial, and there is a concept of consciousness,

07:45.160 --> 07:47.400
 of experience, natural or artificial.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.440
 Those are very, very different things.

07:49.440 --> 07:53.440
 Now, historically, we associate consciousness with intelligence.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.440
 Why?

07:54.440 --> 07:59.240
 Because we live in a world, leaving aside computers, of natural selection, where we're

07:59.240 --> 08:04.120
 surrounded by creatures, either our own kin that are less or more intelligent, or we go

08:04.120 --> 08:06.040
 across species.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.120
 Some are more adapted to a particular environment.

08:08.120 --> 08:12.760
 Others are less adapted, whether it's a whale or dog, or you go talk about a paramecium

08:12.760 --> 08:15.040
 or a little worm.

08:15.040 --> 08:21.240
 And we see the complexity of the nervous system goes from one cell to specialized cells, to

08:21.240 --> 08:26.000
 a worm that has three nets, that has 30 percent of its cells are nerve cells, to creature

08:26.000 --> 08:30.160
 like us or like a blue whale that has 100 billion, even more nerve cells.

08:30.160 --> 08:35.160
 And so based on behavioral evidence and based on the underlying neuroscience, we believe

08:35.160 --> 08:40.840
 that as these creatures become more complex, they are better adapted to their particular

08:40.840 --> 08:46.520
 ecological niche, and they become more conscious, partly because their brain grows.

08:46.520 --> 08:50.840
 And we believe consciousness, unlike the ancient, ancient people thought most, almost every

08:50.840 --> 08:55.240
 culture thought that consciousness with intelligence has to do with your heart.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.920
 And you still see that today.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.420
 You see, honey, I love you with all my heart.

08:59.420 --> 09:04.440
 But what you should actually say is, no, honey, I love you with all my lateral hypothalamus.

09:04.440 --> 09:09.280
 And for Valentine's Day, you should give your sweetheart, you know, hypothalamus, a piece

09:09.280 --> 09:11.400
 of chocolate and not a heart shaped chocolate.

09:11.400 --> 09:14.560
 Anyway, so we still have this language, but now we believe it's a brain.

09:14.560 --> 09:18.720
 And so we see brains of different complexity and we think, well, they have different levels

09:18.720 --> 09:19.720
 of consciousness.

09:19.720 --> 09:25.300
 They're capable of different experiences.

09:25.300 --> 09:32.040
 But now we confront the world where we know where we're beginning to engineer intelligence.

09:32.040 --> 09:37.080
 And it's radical unclear whether the intelligence we're engineering has anything to do with

09:37.080 --> 09:40.120
 consciousness and whether it can experience anything.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.900
 Because fundamentally, what's the difference?

09:42.900 --> 09:44.840
 Intelligence is about function.

09:44.840 --> 09:48.840
 Intelligence no matter exactly how you define it, sort of adaptation to new environments,

09:48.840 --> 09:53.240
 being able to learn and quickly understand, you know, the setup of this and what's going

09:53.240 --> 09:55.900
 on and who are the actors and what's going to happen next.

09:55.900 --> 09:58.200
 That's all about function.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.800
 Consciousness is not about function.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.420
 Consciousness is about being.

10:02.420 --> 10:05.640
 It's in some sense much fundamental.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.760
 You can see this in several cases.

10:08.760 --> 10:12.160
 You can see it, for instance, in the case of the clinic.

10:12.160 --> 10:17.200
 When you're dealing with patients who are, let's say, had a stroke or had were in traffic

10:17.200 --> 10:20.120
 accident, et cetera, they're pretty much immobile.

10:20.120 --> 10:26.640
 Terri Schiavo, you may have heard historically, she was a person here in the 90s in Florida.

10:26.640 --> 10:27.640
 Her heart stood still.

10:27.640 --> 10:28.640
 She was reanimated.

10:28.640 --> 10:31.760
 And then for the next 14 years, she was what's called in a vegetative state.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.000
 So there are thousands of people in a vegetative state.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.720
 So they're, you know, they're, you know, they're like this.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.680
 Occasionally, they open their eyes for two, three, four, five, six, eight hours, and then

10:40.680 --> 10:41.680
 close their eyes.

10:41.680 --> 10:42.680
 They have sleep wake cycle.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.160
 Occasionally, they have behaviors.

10:44.160 --> 10:50.480
 They do like, you know, but there's no way that you can establish a lawful relationship

10:50.480 --> 10:55.360
 between what you say or the doctor says or the mom says and what the patient does.

10:55.360 --> 11:03.120
 So there isn't any behavior, yet in some of these people, there is still experience.

11:03.120 --> 11:08.840
 You can design and build brain machine interfaces where you can see there's still experience

11:08.840 --> 11:09.840
 something.

11:09.840 --> 11:13.640
 And of course, these cases of locked in state, there's this famous book called The Diving

11:13.640 --> 11:19.640
 Bell and the Butterfly, where you had an editor, a French editor, he had a stroke in the brainstem,

11:19.640 --> 11:22.960
 unable to move except his vertical eyes, eye movement.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.280
 He could just move his eyes up and down.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.840
 And he dictated an entire book.

11:27.840 --> 11:30.320
 And some people even lose this at the end.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.360
 All the evidence seems to suggest that they're still in there.

11:33.360 --> 11:37.520
 In this case, you have no behavior, you have consciousness.

11:37.520 --> 11:41.880
 Second case is tonight, like all of us, you're going to go to sleep, close your eyes, you

11:41.880 --> 11:46.520
 go to sleep, you will wake up inside your sleeping body, and you will have conscious

11:46.520 --> 11:47.520
 experiences.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.840
 They are different from everyday experience.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.520
 You might fly, you might not be surprised that you're flying, you might meet a long

11:53.520 --> 11:58.280
 dead pet, childhood dog, and you're not surprised that you're meeting them.

11:58.280 --> 12:02.420
 But you have conscious experience of love, of hate, they can be very emotional.

12:02.420 --> 12:07.680
 Your body during this state, typically it's REM state, sends an active signal to your

12:07.680 --> 12:09.360
 motor neurons to paralyze you.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.720
 It's called atonia.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.220
 Because if you don't have that, like some patients, what do you do?

12:14.220 --> 12:15.660
 You act out your dreams.

12:15.660 --> 12:19.960
 You get, for example, REM behavioral disorder, which is bad juju to get.

12:19.960 --> 12:20.960
 Okay.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.760
 Third case is pure experience.

12:22.760 --> 12:27.400
 So I recently had this, what some people call a mystical experience.

12:27.400 --> 12:30.240
 I went to Singapore and went into a flotation tank.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.240
 Yeah.

12:31.240 --> 12:32.240
 All right.

12:32.240 --> 12:37.800
 So this is a big tub filled with water, that's body temperature and Epsom salt.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.440
 You strip completely naked, you lie inside of it, you close the lid.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.440
 Darkness.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.920
 Complete darkness, soundproof.

12:44.920 --> 12:48.640
 So very quickly, you become bodiless because you're floating and you're naked.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.580
 You have no rings, no watch, no nothing.

12:50.580 --> 12:52.880
 You don't feel your body anymore.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.640
 There's no sound, soundless.

12:54.640 --> 13:01.080
 There's no photon, sightless, timeless, because after a while, early on you actually hear

13:01.080 --> 13:06.600
 your heart, but then you sort of adapt to that and then sort of the passage of time

13:06.600 --> 13:07.600
 ceases.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.600
 Yeah.

13:08.600 --> 13:12.560
 And if you train yourself, like in a meditation, not to think, early on you think a lot.

13:12.560 --> 13:13.560
 It's a little bit spooky.

13:13.560 --> 13:17.000
 You feel somewhat uncomfortable or you think, well, I'm going to get bored.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.640
 And if you try to not to think actively, you become mindless.

13:20.640 --> 13:27.120
 There you are, bodiless, timeless, you know, soundless, sightless, mindless, but you're

13:27.120 --> 13:28.120
 in a conscious experience.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.120
 You're not asleep.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.120
 Yeah.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.120
 You're not asleep.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.640
 You are a being of pure, you're a pure being.

13:33.640 --> 13:34.640
 There isn't any function.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.280
 You aren't doing any computation.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.280
 You're not remembering.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.280
 You're not projecting.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.280
 You're not planning.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.680
 Yet you are fully conscious.

13:40.680 --> 13:41.960
 You're fully conscious.

13:41.960 --> 13:42.960
 There's something going on there.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.320
 It could be just a side effect.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.320
 So what is the...

13:45.320 --> 13:47.880
 You mean epiphenomena.

13:47.880 --> 13:57.480
 So what's the select, meaning why, what is the function of you being able to lay in this

13:57.480 --> 14:01.120
 sensory free deprivation tank and still have a conscious experience?

14:01.120 --> 14:02.120
 Evolutionary?

14:02.120 --> 14:03.120
 Evolutionary.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.720
 Obviously we didn't evolve with flotation tanks in our environment.

14:06.720 --> 14:11.520
 I mean, so biology is notoriously bad at asking why question, telenormical question.

14:11.520 --> 14:12.520
 Why do we have two eyes?

14:12.520 --> 14:15.520
 Why don't we have four eyes like some teachers or three eyes or something?

14:15.520 --> 14:20.440
 Well, no, there's probably, there is a function to that, but we're not very good at answering

14:20.440 --> 14:21.440
 those questions.

14:21.440 --> 14:25.200
 We can speculate endlessly where biology is very, or science is very good about mechanistic

14:25.200 --> 14:26.200
 question.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.200
 Why is there a charge in the universe?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.200
 Right?

14:28.200 --> 14:30.200
 We find a certain universe where there are positive and negative charges.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.200
 Why?

14:31.200 --> 14:33.040
 Why does quantum mechanics hold?

14:33.040 --> 14:36.040
 You know, why doesn't some other theory hold?

14:36.040 --> 14:38.600
 Quantum mechanics holding our universe is very unclear why.

14:38.600 --> 14:42.120
 So telenormical question, why questions are difficult to answer.

14:42.120 --> 14:49.000
 There's some relationship between complexity, brain processing power and consciousness.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.800
 But however, in these cases, in these three examples I gave, one is an everyday experience

14:53.800 --> 14:54.800
 at night.

14:54.800 --> 14:55.800
 The other one is trauma.

14:55.800 --> 15:00.520
 And third one is in principle, you can, everybody can have these sort of mystical experiences.

15:00.520 --> 15:09.440
 You have a dissociation of function from, of intelligence from consciousness.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.260
 You caught me asking a why question.

15:12.260 --> 15:15.180
 Let me ask a question that's not a why question.

15:15.180 --> 15:19.440
 You're giving a talk later today on the Turing test for intelligence and consciousness, drawing

15:19.440 --> 15:21.320
 lines between the two.

15:21.320 --> 15:28.320
 So is there a scientific way to say there's consciousness present in this entity or not?

15:28.320 --> 15:34.220
 And to anticipate your answer, cause you, you will also, there's a neurobiological answer.

15:34.220 --> 15:38.640
 So we can test the human brain, but if you take a machine brain that you don't know tests

15:38.640 --> 15:45.440
 for yet, how would you even begin to approach a test if there's consciousness present in

15:45.440 --> 15:46.440
 this thing?

15:46.440 --> 15:47.440
 Okay.

15:47.440 --> 15:48.440
 That's a really good question.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.440
 So let me take it in two steps.

15:49.440 --> 15:54.280
 So as you point out for, for, for, for humans, let's just stick with humans.

15:54.280 --> 15:58.680
 There's now a test called the Zap and Zip is a procedure where you ping the brain using

15:58.680 --> 16:00.960
 transcranial magnetic stimulation.

16:00.960 --> 16:06.000
 You look at the electrical reverberations essentially using EG, and then you can measure

16:06.000 --> 16:07.880
 the complexity of this brain response.

16:07.880 --> 16:12.360
 And you can do this in awake people, in asleep, normal people, you can do it in awake people

16:12.360 --> 16:13.740
 and then anesthetize them.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.640
 You can do it in patients.

16:15.640 --> 16:20.400
 And it, it, it has a hundred percent accuracy that in all those cases, when you're clear,

16:20.400 --> 16:23.920
 the patient or the person is either conscious or unconscious, the complexity is either high

16:23.920 --> 16:24.960
 or low.

16:24.960 --> 16:28.640
 And then you can adopt these techniques to similar creatures like monkeys and dogs and,

16:28.640 --> 16:32.080
 and, and mice that have very similar brains.

16:32.080 --> 16:36.320
 Now of course you, you point out that may not help you because we don't have a cortex,

16:36.320 --> 16:40.120
 you know, and if I send a magnetic pulse into my iPhone or my computer, it's probably going

16:40.120 --> 16:41.520
 to break something.

16:41.520 --> 16:42.520
 So we don't have that.

16:42.520 --> 16:47.460
 So what we need ultimately, we need a theory of consciousness.

16:47.460 --> 16:49.400
 We can't just rely on our intuition.

16:49.400 --> 16:52.840
 Our intuition is, well, yeah, if somebody talks, they're conscious.

16:52.840 --> 16:56.760
 However, then there are all these patients, children, babies don't talk, right?

16:56.760 --> 17:01.400
 But we believe that, that the babies also have conscious experiences, right?

17:01.400 --> 17:04.960
 And then there are all these patients I mentioned and they don't talk.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.800
 When you dream, you can't talk because you're paralyzed.

17:07.800 --> 17:11.220
 So what we ultimately need, we can't just rely on our intuition.

17:11.220 --> 17:15.560
 We need a theory of conscience that tells us what is it about a piece of matter?

17:15.560 --> 17:19.720
 What is it about a piece of highly excitable matter like the brain or like a computer that

17:19.720 --> 17:21.840
 gives rise to conscious experience?

17:21.840 --> 17:24.400
 We all believe, none of us believes anymore in the old story.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.680
 It's a soul, right?

17:25.680 --> 17:28.680
 That used to be the most common explanation that most people accept that instill a lot

17:28.680 --> 17:34.040
 of people today believe, well, there's, there's God endowed only us with a special thing

17:34.040 --> 17:35.440
 that animals don't have.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.900
 Rene Descartes famously said, a dog, if you hit it with your carriage may yell, may cry,

17:39.900 --> 17:41.840
 but it doesn't have this special thing.

17:41.840 --> 17:45.120
 It doesn't have the magic, the magic soul.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.680
 It doesn't have res cogitans, the soul.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.920
 Now we believe that isn't the case anymore.

17:48.920 --> 17:55.680
 So what is the difference between brains and, and these guys, silicon?

17:55.680 --> 17:58.200
 And in particular, once their behavior matches.

17:58.200 --> 18:03.220
 So if you have Siri or Alexa in 20 years from now that she can talk just as good as any

18:03.220 --> 18:07.680
 possible human, what grounds do you have to say she's not conscious in particular, if

18:07.680 --> 18:11.520
 she says it's of course she will, well, of course I'm conscious.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.600
 You ask her how are you doing?

18:12.600 --> 18:17.840
 And she'll say, well, you know, they, they'll generate some way to, of course she'll behave

18:17.840 --> 18:19.880
 like a, like a person.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.640
 Now there's several differences.

18:21.640 --> 18:28.260
 One is, so this relates to the problem, the very hard, why is consciousness a hard problem?

18:28.260 --> 18:30.760
 It's because it's subjective, right?

18:30.760 --> 18:36.440
 Only I have it, for only I know I have direct experience of my own consciousness.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.780
 I don't have experience in your consciousness.

18:38.780 --> 18:42.720
 Now I assume as a sort of a Bayesian person who believes in probability theory and all

18:42.720 --> 18:46.960
 of that, you know, I can do, I can do an abduction to the, to the best available facts.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.920
 I deduce your brain is very similar to mine.

18:48.920 --> 18:53.160
 If I put you in a scanner, your brain is roughly going to behave the same way as I do.

18:53.160 --> 18:56.480
 If, if, if, you know, if I give you this muesli and ask you, how does it taste?

18:56.480 --> 19:00.520
 You tell me things that, you know, that, that I would also say more or less, right?

19:00.520 --> 19:02.680
 So I infer based on all of that, that you're conscious.

19:02.680 --> 19:03.920
 Now with theory, I can't do that.

19:03.920 --> 19:09.280
 So there I really need a theory that tells me what is it about, about any system, this

19:09.280 --> 19:11.240
 or this, that makes it conscious.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.240
 We have such a theory.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.240
 Yes.

19:13.240 --> 19:17.640
 So the integrated information theory, but let me first, maybe as an introduction for

19:17.640 --> 19:24.280
 people who are not familiar, Descartes, can you, you talk a lot about pan, panpsychism.

19:24.280 --> 19:29.320
 Can you describe what, uh, physicalism versus dualism?

19:29.320 --> 19:33.520
 This you, you mentioned the soul, what, what is the history of that idea?

19:33.520 --> 19:39.600
 What is the idea of panpsychism or no, the debate really, uh, out of which panpsychism

19:39.600 --> 19:48.480
 can, um, emerge of, of, of, um, dualism versus, uh, physicalism or do you not see panpsychism

19:48.480 --> 19:49.480
 as fitting into that?

19:49.480 --> 19:52.640
 No, you can argue there's some, okay, so let's step back.

19:52.640 --> 19:57.800
 So panpsychism is a very ancient belief that's been around, uh, I mean, Plato and Aristotle

19:57.800 --> 20:01.560
 talks about it, uh, modern philosophers talk about it.

20:01.560 --> 20:06.200
 Of course, in Buddhism, the idea is very prevalent that, I mean, there are different versions

20:06.200 --> 20:07.200
 of it.

20:07.200 --> 20:12.400
 One version says everything is ensouled, everything, rocks and stones and dogs and people and forest

20:12.400 --> 20:14.480
 and iPhones, all of us all, right?

20:14.480 --> 20:15.480
 All matter is ensouled.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.240
 That's sort of one version.

20:17.240 --> 20:24.120
 Another version is that all biology, all creatures, small or large, from a single cell to a giant

20:24.120 --> 20:26.160
 sequoia tree feel like something.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.280
 This one I think is somewhat more realistic.

20:28.280 --> 20:33.180
 Um, so the different versions, what do you mean by feel like something, have, have feelings,

20:33.180 --> 20:37.000
 have some kind of, it feels like something, it may well be possible that it feels like

20:37.000 --> 20:39.360
 something to be a paramecium.

20:39.360 --> 20:45.080
 I think it's pretty likely it feels like something to be a bee or a mouse or a dog.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.080
 Sure.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.080
 So, okay.

20:47.080 --> 20:53.200
 So, so that you can see that's also, so panpsychism is very broad and you can, so some people,

20:53.200 --> 20:59.520
 for example, Bertrand Russell, tried to advocate this, this idea, it's called Rasselian Monism,

20:59.520 --> 21:04.400
 that that panpsychism is really physics viewed from the inside.

21:04.400 --> 21:09.920
 So the idea is that physics is very good at describing relationship among objects like

21:09.920 --> 21:12.920
 charges or like gravity, right?

21:12.920 --> 21:16.840
 You know, describe the relationship between curvature and mass distribution, okay?

21:16.840 --> 21:18.480
 That's the relationship among things.

21:18.480 --> 21:21.000
 Physics doesn't really describe the ultimate reality itself.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.720
 It's just relationship among, you know, quarks or all these other stuff from like a third

21:25.720 --> 21:27.280
 person observer.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.280
 Yes.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.280
 Yes.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.280
 Yes.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.880
 And consciousness is what physics feels from the inside.

21:31.880 --> 21:36.760
 So my conscious experience, it's the way the physics of my brain, particularly my cortex

21:36.760 --> 21:38.680
 feels from the inside.

21:38.680 --> 21:42.720
 And so if you are paramecium, you got to remember, you say paramecium, well, that's a pretty

21:42.720 --> 21:43.720
 dumb creature.

21:43.720 --> 21:49.960
 It is, but it has already a billion different molecules, probably, you know, 5,000 different

21:49.960 --> 21:54.880
 proteins assembled in a highly, highly complex system that no single person, no computer

21:54.880 --> 21:59.280
 system so far on this planet has ever managed to accurately simulate.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.040
 Its complexity vastly escapes us.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.040
 Yes.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.800
 And it may well be that that little thing feels like a tiny bit.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.520
 Now, it doesn't have a voice in the head like me.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.520
 It doesn't have expectations.

22:07.520 --> 22:12.520
 You know, it doesn't have all that complex things, but it may well feel like something.

22:12.520 --> 22:13.520
 Yeah.

22:13.520 --> 22:14.520
 So this is really interesting.

22:14.520 --> 22:20.920
 Can we draw some lines and maybe try to understand the difference between life, intelligence

22:20.920 --> 22:23.360
 and consciousness?

22:23.360 --> 22:25.480
 How do you see all of those?

22:25.480 --> 22:31.320
 If you had to define what is a living thing, what is a conscious thing and what is an intelligent

22:31.320 --> 22:32.320
 thing?

22:32.320 --> 22:34.480
 Do those intermix for you or are they totally separate?

22:34.480 --> 22:35.480
 Okay.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.040
 So A, that's a question that we don't have a full answer to.

22:38.040 --> 22:42.080
 A lot of the stuff we're talking about today is full of mysteries and fascinating ones,

22:42.080 --> 22:43.080
 right?

22:43.080 --> 22:46.880
 For example, you can go to Aristotle, who's probably the most important scientist and

22:46.880 --> 22:49.760
 philosopher who's ever lived in, certainly in Western culture.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.760
 He had this idea, it's called hylomorphism.

22:51.760 --> 22:55.160
 It's quite popular these days, that there are different forms of soul.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.400
 The soul is really the form of something.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.760
 He says, all biological creatures have a vegetative soul.

23:00.760 --> 23:01.760
 That's life principle.

23:01.760 --> 23:07.400
 Today, we think we understand something more than it is biochemistry and nonlinear thermodynamics.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.480
 Then he said they have a sensitive soul.

23:09.480 --> 23:15.080
 Only animals and humans have also a sensitive soul or a petitive soul.

23:15.080 --> 23:18.240
 They can see, they can smell, and they have drives.

23:18.240 --> 23:21.080
 They want to reproduce, they want to eat, et cetera.

23:21.080 --> 23:26.080
 And then only humans have what he called a rational soul, okay?

23:26.080 --> 23:30.040
 And that idea then made it into Christendom and then the rational soul is the one that

23:30.040 --> 23:31.040
 lives forever.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.040
 He was very unclear.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.640
 He wasn't really, I mean, different readings of Aristotle give different, whether did he

23:35.640 --> 23:38.240
 believe that rational soul was immortal or not.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.800
 I probably think he didn't.

23:39.800 --> 23:43.040
 But then, of course, that made it through Plato into Christianity, and then this soul

23:43.040 --> 23:48.440
 became immortal and then became the connection to God.

23:48.440 --> 23:54.440
 So you ask me, essentially, what is our modern conception of these three, Aristotle would

23:54.440 --> 23:56.200
 have called them different forms.

23:56.200 --> 24:00.200
 Life, we think we know something about it, at least life on this planet, right?

24:00.200 --> 24:04.040
 Although we don't understand how to originate it, but it's been difficult to rigorously

24:04.040 --> 24:05.280
 pin down.

24:05.280 --> 24:08.640
 You see this in modern definitions of death.

24:08.640 --> 24:14.160
 In fact, right now, there's a conference ongoing, again, that tries to define legally and medically

24:14.160 --> 24:15.400
 what is death.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.400
 It used to be very simple.

24:16.400 --> 24:21.780
 Death is you stop breathing, your heart stops beating, you're dead, totally uncontroversial.

24:21.780 --> 24:23.480
 If you're unsure, you wait another 10 minutes.

24:23.480 --> 24:25.320
 If the patient doesn't breathe, he's dead.

24:25.320 --> 24:29.540
 Well, now we have ventilators, we have heart pacemakers, so it's much more difficult to

24:29.540 --> 24:30.880
 define what death is.

24:30.880 --> 24:35.840
 Typically, death is defined as the end of life and life is defined before death.

24:35.840 --> 24:39.280
 Okay, so we don't have really very good definitions.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.840
 Intelligence, we don't have a rigorous definition.

24:41.840 --> 24:46.640
 We know something how to measure, it's called IQ or G factors, right?

24:46.640 --> 24:50.360
 And we're beginning to build it in a narrow sense, right?

24:50.360 --> 24:56.800
 Like go, AlphaGo and Watson and, you know, Google cars and Uber cars and all of that,

24:56.800 --> 25:01.240
 it's still narrow AI and some people are thinking about artificial general intelligence.

25:01.240 --> 25:05.320
 But roughly, as we said before, it's something to do with ability to learn and to adapt to

25:05.320 --> 25:06.600
 new environments.

25:06.600 --> 25:11.080
 But that is, as I said, also, it's radical difference from experience.

25:11.080 --> 25:16.480
 And it's very unclear if you build a machine that has AGI, it's not at all a priori, it's

25:16.480 --> 25:20.760
 not at all clear that this machine will have consciousness, it may or may not.

25:20.760 --> 25:25.000
 So let's ask it the other way, do you think if you were to try to build an artificial

25:25.000 --> 25:31.080
 general intelligence system, do you think figuring out how to build artificial consciousness

25:31.080 --> 25:34.960
 would help you get to an AGI?

25:34.960 --> 25:40.480
 So or put another way, do you think intelligent requires consciousness?

25:40.480 --> 25:43.160
 In human, it goes hand in hand.

25:43.160 --> 25:48.360
 In human, or I think in biology, consciousness, intelligence goes hand in hand, quay is illusion

25:48.360 --> 25:54.480
 because the brain evolved to be highly complex, complexity via the theory integrated information

25:54.480 --> 25:59.720
 theory is sort of ultimately is what is closely tied to consciousness.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.680
 Ultimately it's causal power upon itself.

26:01.680 --> 26:05.100
 And so in evolved systems, they go together.

26:05.100 --> 26:09.440
 In artificial system, particularly in digital machines, they do not go together.

26:09.440 --> 26:16.480
 And if you ask me point blank, is Alexa 20.0 in the year 2040, when she can easily pass

26:16.480 --> 26:18.280
 every Turing test, is she conscious?

26:18.280 --> 26:21.080
 No, even if she claims she's conscious.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.180
 In fact, you could even do a more radical version of this thought experiment.

26:24.180 --> 26:26.840
 You can build a computer simulation of the human brain.

26:26.840 --> 26:31.240
 You know what Henry Markham in the Blue Brain Project or the Human Brain Project in Switzerland

26:31.240 --> 26:32.240
 is trying to do.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.640
 Let's grant them all the success.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.720
 So in 10 years, we have this perfect simulation of the human brain.

26:36.720 --> 26:40.440
 Every neuron is simulated and it has a larynx and it has motor neurons.

26:40.440 --> 26:45.480
 It has a Broca's area and of course they'll talk and they'll say, hi, I just woke up.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.480
 I feel great.

26:46.480 --> 26:50.480
 OK, even that computer simulation that can in principle map onto your brain will not

26:50.480 --> 26:51.480
 be conscious.

26:51.480 --> 26:52.480
 Why?

26:52.480 --> 26:56.000
 Because it simulates, it's a difference between the simulated and the real.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.280
 So it simulates the behavior associated with consciousness.

26:59.280 --> 27:04.000
 It might be, it will, if it's done properly, will have all the intelligence that that particular

27:04.000 --> 27:06.080
 person they're simulating has.

27:06.080 --> 27:10.800
 But simulating intelligence is not the same as having conscious experiences.

27:10.800 --> 27:15.200
 And I give you a really nice metaphor that engineers and physicists typically get.

27:15.200 --> 27:19.720
 I can write down Einstein's field equation, nine or ten equations that describe the link

27:19.720 --> 27:23.400
 in general relativity between curvature and mass.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.400
 I can do that.

27:24.400 --> 27:29.920
 I can run this on my laptop to predict that the central, the black hole at the center

27:29.920 --> 27:36.440
 of our galaxy will be so massive that it will twist space time around it so no light can

27:36.440 --> 27:37.440
 escape.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.580
 It's a black hole.

27:38.580 --> 27:44.400
 But funny, have you ever wondered why doesn't this computer simulation suck me in?

27:44.400 --> 27:49.020
 It simulates gravity, but it doesn't have the causal power of gravity.

27:49.020 --> 27:50.760
 That's a huge difference.

27:50.760 --> 27:55.520
 So it's a difference between the real and the simulator, just like it doesn't get wet

27:55.520 --> 27:59.080
 inside a computer when the computer runs code that simulates a weather storm.

27:59.080 --> 28:04.560
 And so in order to have, to have artificial consciousness, you have to give it the same

28:04.560 --> 28:06.880
 causal power as the human brain.

28:06.880 --> 28:11.560
 You have to build so called a neuromorphic machine that has hardware that is very similar

28:11.560 --> 28:16.520
 to the human brain, not a digital clocked phenomenon computer.

28:16.520 --> 28:24.000
 So that's, just to clarify though, you think that consciousness is not required to create

28:24.000 --> 28:25.560
 human level intelligence.

28:25.560 --> 28:30.360
 It seems to accompany in the human brain, but for machine not.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.840
 That's correct.

28:31.840 --> 28:39.220
 So maybe just because this is AGI, let's dig in a little bit about what we mean by intelligence.

28:39.220 --> 28:44.280
 So one thing is the G factor, these kind of IQ tests of intelligence.

28:44.280 --> 28:51.400
 But I think if you, maybe another way to say, so in 2040, 2050, people will have Siri that

28:51.400 --> 28:54.840
 is just really impressive.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.800
 Do you think people will say Siri is intelligent?

28:57.800 --> 28:58.800
 Yes.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.200
 Intelligence is this amorphous thing.

29:01.200 --> 29:05.560
 So to be intelligent, it seems like you have to have some kind of connections with other

29:05.560 --> 29:11.520
 human beings in a sense that you have to impress them with your intelligence.

29:11.520 --> 29:17.480
 And there feels, you have to somehow operate in this world full of humans.

29:17.480 --> 29:21.820
 And for that, there feels like there has to be something like consciousness.

29:21.820 --> 29:26.600
 So you think you can have just the world's best natural NLP system, natural language

29:26.600 --> 29:32.000
 understanding generation, and that will be, that will get us happy and say, you know what,

29:32.000 --> 29:33.920
 we've created an AGI.

29:33.920 --> 29:40.520
 I don't know happy, but yes, I do believe we can get what we call high level functional

29:40.520 --> 29:46.760
 intelligence, particular sort of the G, you know, this fluid like intelligence that we

29:46.760 --> 29:51.280
 cherish, particularly at a place like MIT, right, in machines.

29:51.280 --> 29:54.920
 I see a priori no reasons, and I see a lot of reason to believe it's going to happen

29:54.920 --> 29:58.360
 very, you know, over the next 50 years or 30 years.

29:58.360 --> 30:06.360
 So for beneficial AI, for creating an AI system that's, so you mentioned ethics, that is exceptionally

30:06.360 --> 30:11.880
 intelligent but also does not do, does, you know, aligns its values with our values as

30:11.880 --> 30:12.880
 humanity.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.880
 Do you think then it needs consciousness?

30:14.880 --> 30:19.960
 Yes, I think that that is a very good argument that if we're concerned about AI and the threat

30:19.960 --> 30:26.320
 of AI, a la Nick Bostrom, existentialist threat, I think having an intelligence that has empathy,

30:26.320 --> 30:32.200
 right, why do we find abusing a dog, why do most of us find that abhorrent, abusing any

30:32.200 --> 30:33.200
 animal, right?

30:33.200 --> 30:37.840
 Why do we find that abhorrent because we have this thing called empathy, which if you look

30:37.840 --> 30:42.560
 at the Greek really means feeling with, I feel a path of empathy, I have feeling with

30:42.560 --> 30:43.560
 you.

30:43.560 --> 30:48.760
 I see somebody else suffer that isn't even my conspecific, it's not a person, it's not

30:48.760 --> 30:53.560
 my wife or my kids, it's a dog, but I feel naturally most of us, not all of us, most

30:53.560 --> 30:55.840
 of us will feel emphatic.

30:55.840 --> 31:02.200
 And so it may well be in the long term interest of survival of homo sapiens sapiens that if

31:02.200 --> 31:08.320
 we do build AGI and it really becomes very powerful that it has an emphatic response

31:08.320 --> 31:11.960
 and doesn't just exterminate humanity.

31:11.960 --> 31:17.640
 So as part of the full conscious experience to create a consciousness, artificial or in

31:17.640 --> 31:23.800
 our human consciousness, do you think fear, maybe we're going to get into the earlier

31:23.800 --> 31:29.760
 days with Nietzsche and so on, but do you think fear and suffering are essential to

31:29.760 --> 31:30.760
 have consciousness?

31:30.760 --> 31:37.200
 Do you have to have the full range of experience to have a system that has experience or can

31:37.200 --> 31:41.880
 you have a system that only has very particular kinds of very positive experiences?

31:41.880 --> 31:46.180
 Look you can have in principle, people have done this in the rat where you implant an

31:46.180 --> 31:51.040
 electrode in the hypothalamus, the pleasure center of the rat and the rat stimulates itself

31:51.040 --> 31:52.960
 above and beyond anything else.

31:52.960 --> 31:57.680
 It doesn't care about food or natural sex or drink anymore, it just stimulates itself

31:57.680 --> 32:00.440
 because it's such a pleasurable feeling.

32:00.440 --> 32:04.080
 I guess it's like an orgasm just you have all day long.

32:04.080 --> 32:11.240
 And so a priori I see no reason why you need a great variety.

32:11.240 --> 32:14.600
 Now clearly to survive that wouldn't work, right?

32:14.600 --> 32:22.640
 But if I'd engineered artificially, I don't think you need a great variety of conscious

32:22.640 --> 32:23.640
 experience.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.440
 You could have just pleasure or just fear.

32:25.440 --> 32:30.280
 It might be a terrible existence, but I think that's possible at least on conceptual logical

32:30.280 --> 32:31.280
 ground.

32:31.280 --> 32:35.400
 Because any real creature whether artificially engineered, you want to give it fear, the

32:35.400 --> 32:38.480
 fear of extinction that we all have.

32:38.480 --> 32:44.240
 And you also want to give it positive repetitive states, states that you want the machine encouraged

32:44.240 --> 32:48.120
 to do because they give the machine positive feedback.

32:48.120 --> 32:54.640
 So you mentioned panpsychism, to jump back a little bit, everything having some kind

32:54.640 --> 32:57.520
 of mental property.

32:57.520 --> 33:02.160
 How do you go from there to something like human consciousness?

33:02.160 --> 33:08.840
 So everything having some elements of consciousness, is there something special about human consciousness?

33:08.840 --> 33:10.720
 So it's not everything.

33:10.720 --> 33:17.760
 Like a spoon, the form of panpsychism I think about doesn't ascribe consciousness to anything

33:17.760 --> 33:20.040
 like this, the spoon on my liver.

33:20.040 --> 33:26.800
 However, the theory, the integrated information theory does say that the system, even one

33:26.800 --> 33:30.560
 that looks from the outside relatively simple, at least if they have this internal causal

33:30.560 --> 33:35.320
 power, it does feel like something.

33:35.320 --> 33:38.920
 The theory a priori doesn't say anything what's special about human.

33:38.920 --> 33:44.240
 Biologically we know the one thing that's special about human is we speak and we have

33:44.240 --> 33:48.360
 an overblown sense of our own importance.

33:48.360 --> 33:54.360
 We believe we're exceptional and we're just God's gift to the universe.

33:54.360 --> 33:58.660
 But behaviorally the main thing that we have, we can plan over the long term, we have language

33:58.660 --> 34:03.640
 and that gives us an enormous amount of power and that's why we are the current dominant

34:03.640 --> 34:05.840
 species on the planet.

34:05.840 --> 34:15.400
 So you mentioned God, you grew up a devout Roman Catholic family, so with consciousness

34:15.400 --> 34:21.240
 you're sort of exploring some really deeply fundamental human things that religion also

34:21.240 --> 34:22.240
 touches on.

34:22.240 --> 34:27.400
 Where does religion fit into your thinking about consciousness?

34:27.400 --> 34:31.800
 You've grown throughout your life and changed your views on religion as far as I understand.

34:31.800 --> 34:37.000
 Yeah, I mean I'm now much closer to, I'm not a Roman Catholic anymore, I don't believe

34:37.000 --> 34:43.280
 there's sort of this God, the God I was educated to believe in, sits somewhere in the fullness

34:43.280 --> 34:49.920
 of time, I'll be united in some sort of everlasting bliss, I just don't see any evidence for that.

34:49.920 --> 34:55.200
 Look, the world, the night is large and full of wonders, there are many things that I don't

34:55.200 --> 34:59.200
 understand, I think many things that we as a cult, look we don't even understand more

34:59.200 --> 35:03.640
 than 4% of all the universe, dark matter, dark energy, we have no idea what it is, maybe

35:03.640 --> 35:06.680
 it's lost socks, what do I know?

35:06.680 --> 35:13.040
 So all I can tell you is it's sort of my current religious or spiritual sentiment is much closer

35:13.040 --> 35:19.880
 to some form of Buddhism, without the reincarnation unfortunately, there's no evidence for it

35:19.880 --> 35:20.880
 than reincarnation.

35:20.880 --> 35:25.560
 So can you describe the way Buddhism sees the world a little bit?

35:25.560 --> 35:32.240
 Well so they talk about, so when I spent several meetings with the Dalai Lama and what always

35:32.240 --> 35:36.940
 impressed me about him, he really, unlike for example let's say the Pope or some Cardinal,

35:36.940 --> 35:40.800
 he always emphasized minimizing the suffering of all creatures.

35:40.800 --> 35:45.240
 So they have this, from the early beginning they look at suffering in all creatures, not

35:45.240 --> 35:52.160
 just in people, but in everybody, this universal and of course by degrees, an animal in general

35:52.160 --> 35:59.500
 is less capable of suffering than a well developed, normally developed human and they think consciousness

35:59.500 --> 36:06.480
 pervades in this universe and they have these techniques, you can think of them like mindfulness

36:06.480 --> 36:12.600
 etc. and meditation that tries to access what they claim of this more fundamental aspect

36:12.600 --> 36:13.600
 of reality.

36:13.600 --> 36:17.000
 I'm not sure it's more fundamental, I think about it, there's the physical and then there's

36:17.000 --> 36:21.120
 this inside view, consciousness and those are the two aspects that's the only thing

36:21.120 --> 36:25.520
 I have access to in my life and you've got to remember my conscious experience and your

36:25.520 --> 36:29.680
 conscious experience comes prior to anything you know about physics, comes prior to knowledge

36:29.680 --> 36:34.780
 about the universe and atoms and super strings and molecules and all of that.

36:34.780 --> 36:39.080
 The only thing you directly are acquainted with is this world that's populated with things

36:39.080 --> 36:43.120
 in images and sounds in your head and touches and all of that.

36:43.120 --> 36:49.200
 I actually have a question, so it sounds like you kind of have a rich life, you talk about

36:49.200 --> 36:55.120
 rock climbing and it seems like you really love literature and consciousness is all about

36:55.120 --> 37:00.800
 experiencing things, so do you think that has helped your research on this topic?

37:00.800 --> 37:05.260
 Yes, particularly if you think about it, the various states, so for example when you do

37:05.260 --> 37:11.320
 rock climbing or now I do rowing, crew rowing and a bike every day, you can get into this

37:11.320 --> 37:16.360
 thing called the zone and I've always wanted about it, particularly with respect to consciousness

37:16.360 --> 37:20.960
 because it's a strangely addictive state.

37:20.960 --> 37:24.680
 Once people have it once, they want to keep on going back to it and you wonder what is

37:24.680 --> 37:30.840
 it so addicting about it and I think it's the experience of almost close to pure experience

37:30.840 --> 37:35.620
 because in this zone, you're not conscious of inner voice anymore, there's always inner

37:35.620 --> 37:39.200
 voice nagging you, you have to do this, you have to do that, you have to pay your taxes,

37:39.200 --> 37:42.480
 you have to fight with your ex and all of those things, they're always there.

37:42.480 --> 37:46.320
 But when you're in the zone, all of that is gone and you're just in this wonderful state

37:46.320 --> 37:51.480
 where you're fully out in the world, you're climbing or you're rowing or biking or doing

37:51.480 --> 37:57.500
 soccer or whatever you're doing and sort of consciousness is this, you're all action or

37:57.500 --> 38:02.320
 in this case of pure experience, you're not action at all but in both cases, you experience

38:02.320 --> 38:10.120
 some aspect of conscious, you touch some basic part of conscious existence that is so basic

38:10.120 --> 38:12.720
 and so deeply satisfying.

38:12.720 --> 38:16.480
 You I think you touch the root of being, that's really what you're touching there, you're

38:16.480 --> 38:21.800
 getting close to the root of being and that's very different from intelligence.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.920
 So what do you think about the simulation hypothesis, simulation theory, the idea that

38:25.920 --> 38:28.040
 we all live in a computer simulation?

38:28.040 --> 38:30.400
 Rapture for nerds.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.400
 Rapture for nerds.

38:31.400 --> 38:39.440
 I think it's as likely as the hypothesis had engaged hundreds of scholars for many centuries,

38:39.440 --> 38:42.680
 are we all just existing in the mind of God?

38:42.680 --> 38:47.680
 And this is just a modern version of it, it's equally plausible.

38:47.680 --> 38:51.400
 People love talking about these sort of things, I know they're book written about this simulation

38:51.400 --> 38:56.280
 hypothesis, if that's what people want to do, that's fine, it seems rather esoteric,

38:56.280 --> 38:58.320
 it's never testable.

38:58.320 --> 39:02.660
 But it's not useful for you to think of in those terms, so maybe connecting to the questions

39:02.660 --> 39:07.840
 of free will which you've talked about, I vaguely remember you saying that the idea

39:07.840 --> 39:13.480
 that there's no free will, it makes you very uncomfortable.

39:13.480 --> 39:19.440
 So what do you think about free will from a physics perspective, from a conscious perspective,

39:19.440 --> 39:20.440
 what does it all fit?

39:20.440 --> 39:24.840
 Okay, so from the physics perspective, leaving aside quantum mechanics, we believe we live

39:24.840 --> 39:27.160
 in a fully deterministic world, right?

39:27.160 --> 39:30.400
 But then comes of course quantum mechanics, so now we know that certain things are in

39:30.400 --> 39:36.700
 principle not predictable, which as you said I prefer, because the idea that the initial

39:36.700 --> 39:40.640
 condition of the universe and then everything else, we're just acting out the initial condition

39:40.640 --> 39:42.680
 of the universe, that doesn't…

39:42.680 --> 39:45.320
 It's not a romantic notion.

39:45.320 --> 39:47.160
 Certainly not.

39:47.160 --> 39:50.780
 Now when it comes to consciousness, I think we do have certain freedom.

39:50.780 --> 39:55.120
 We are much more constrained by physics of course and by our past and by our own conscious

39:55.120 --> 39:59.160
 desires and what our parents told us and what our environment tells us.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.160
 We all know that, right?

40:00.160 --> 40:03.760
 There's hundreds of experiments that show how we can be influenced.

40:03.760 --> 40:08.360
 But finally in the final analysis, when you make a life – and I'm talking really about

40:08.360 --> 40:11.560
 critical decision where you really think, should I marry, should I go to this school

40:11.560 --> 40:18.680
 or that school, should I take this job or that job, should I cheat on my taxes or not?

40:18.680 --> 40:22.560
 These are things where you really deliberate and I think under those conditions, you are

40:22.560 --> 40:24.720
 as free as you can be.

40:24.720 --> 40:31.440
 When you bring your entire being, your entire conscious being to that question and try to

40:31.440 --> 40:37.080
 analyze it under all the various conditions, then you make a decision, you are as free

40:37.080 --> 40:38.880
 as you can ever be.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.680
 That is I think what free will is.

40:40.680 --> 40:44.560
 It's not a will that's totally free to do anything it wants.

40:44.560 --> 40:45.920
 That's not possible.

40:45.920 --> 40:46.920
 Right.

40:46.920 --> 40:52.760
 So as Jack mentioned, you actually write a blog about books you've read, amazing books

40:52.760 --> 41:01.080
 from, I'm Russian, from Bulgakov, Neil Gaiman, Carl Sagan, Murakami.

41:01.080 --> 41:06.760
 So what is a book that early in your life transformed the way you saw the world, something

41:06.760 --> 41:09.880
 that changed your life?

41:09.880 --> 41:10.880
 Nietzsche I guess did.

41:10.880 --> 41:14.520
 That's Brooks R. Truster because he talks about some of these problems.

41:14.520 --> 41:17.920
 He was one of the first discoverer of the unconscious.

41:17.920 --> 41:23.240
 This is a little bit before Freud when he was in the air.

41:23.240 --> 41:29.040
 He makes all these claims that people sort of under the guise or under the mass of charity

41:29.040 --> 41:32.360
 actually are very noncharitable.

41:32.360 --> 41:39.840
 So he is sort of really the first discoverer of the great land of the unconscious and that

41:39.840 --> 41:41.600
 really struck me.

41:41.600 --> 41:45.480
 And what do you think about the unconscious, what do you think about Freud, what do you

41:45.480 --> 41:47.880
 think about these ideas?

41:47.880 --> 41:51.920
 Just like dark matter in the universe, what's over there in that unconscious?

41:51.920 --> 41:52.920
 A lot.

41:52.920 --> 41:53.920
 I mean much more than we think.

41:53.920 --> 41:57.480
 This is what a lot of last 100 years of research has shown.

41:57.480 --> 42:02.840
 So I think he was a genius, misguided towards the end, but he started out as a neuroscientist.

42:02.840 --> 42:09.480
 He contributed, he did the studies on the lamprey, he contributed himself to the neuron

42:09.480 --> 42:13.400
 hypothesis, the idea that there are discrete units that we call nerve cells now.

42:13.400 --> 42:20.920
 And then he wrote about the unconscious and I think it's true, there's lots of stuff happening.

42:20.920 --> 42:25.560
 You feel this particular when you're in a relationship and it breaks asunder, right?

42:25.560 --> 42:29.880
 And then you have this terrible, you can have love and hate and lust and anger and all of

42:29.880 --> 42:31.520
 it's mixed in.

42:31.520 --> 42:35.080
 And when you try to analyze yourself, why am I so upset?

42:35.080 --> 42:41.080
 It's very, very difficult to penetrate to those basements, those caverns in your mind

42:41.080 --> 42:45.840
 because the prying eyes of conscious doesn't have access to those, but they're there in

42:45.840 --> 42:48.560
 the amygdala or lots of other places.

42:48.560 --> 42:53.720
 They make you upset or angry or sad or depressed and it's very difficult to try to actually

42:53.720 --> 42:54.720
 uncover the reason.

42:54.720 --> 42:58.360
 You can go to a shrink, you can talk with your friend endlessly, you construct finally

42:58.360 --> 43:02.520
 a story why this happened, why you love her or don't love her or whatever, but you don't

43:02.520 --> 43:07.640
 really know whether that actually happened because you simply don't have access to those

43:07.640 --> 43:09.280
 parts of the brain and they're very powerful.

43:09.280 --> 43:12.600
 Do you think that's a feature or a bug of our brain?

43:12.600 --> 43:16.840
 The fact that we have this deep, difficult to dive into subconscious?

43:16.840 --> 43:24.320
 I think it's a feature because otherwise, look, we are like any other brain or nervous

43:24.320 --> 43:28.640
 system or computer, we are severely band limited.

43:28.640 --> 43:34.480
 If everything I do, every emotion I feel, every eye movements I make, if all of that

43:34.480 --> 43:42.720
 had to be under the control of consciousness, I wouldn't be here.

43:42.720 --> 43:46.460
 What you do early on, your brain, you have to be conscious when you learn things like

43:46.460 --> 43:52.320
 typing or like riding on a bike, but then what you do, you train up routes, I think

43:52.320 --> 43:54.640
 that involve basal ganglia and striatum.

43:54.640 --> 43:58.800
 You train up different parts of your brain and then once you do it automatically like

43:58.800 --> 44:02.000
 typing, you can show you do it much faster without even thinking about it because you've

44:02.000 --> 44:07.800
 got these highly specialized, what Frans Krik and I call zombie agents, they're taking care

44:07.800 --> 44:11.320
 of that while your consciousness can sort of worry about the abstract sense of the text

44:11.320 --> 44:12.320
 you want to write.

44:12.320 --> 44:15.000
 I think that's true for many, many things.

44:15.000 --> 44:21.240
 But for the things like all the fights you had with an ex girlfriend, things that you

44:21.240 --> 44:25.280
 would think are not useful to still linger somewhere in the subconscious.

44:25.280 --> 44:28.400
 So that seems like a bug that it would stick to there.

44:28.400 --> 44:31.320
 You think it would be better if you can analyze it and then get it out of the system.

44:31.320 --> 44:34.800
 Better to get it out of the system or just forget it ever happened.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.400
 That seems a very buggy kind of.

44:37.400 --> 44:41.620
 Well yeah, in general we don't have, and that's probably functional, we don't have an ability

44:41.620 --> 44:45.240
 unless it's extreme, there are cases, clinical dissociations, right?

44:45.240 --> 44:50.360
 When people are heavily abused, when they completely repress the memory, but that doesn't

44:50.360 --> 44:53.560
 happen in normal people.

44:53.560 --> 44:59.040
 We don't have an ability to remove traumatic memories and of course we suffer from that.

44:59.040 --> 45:04.000
 On the other hand, probably if you had the ability to constantly wipe your memory, you'd

45:04.000 --> 45:07.160
 probably do it to an extent that isn't useful to you.

45:07.160 --> 45:11.000
 So yeah, it's a good question to balance.

45:11.000 --> 45:18.440
 So on the books, as Jack mentioned, correct me if I'm wrong, but broadly speaking, academia

45:18.440 --> 45:23.480
 and the different scientific disciplines, certainly in engineering, reading literature

45:23.480 --> 45:26.680
 seems to be a rare pursuit.

45:26.680 --> 45:30.680
 So I'm wrong on this, but that's in my experience, most people read much more technical text

45:30.680 --> 45:36.760
 and do not sort of escape or seek truth in literature.

45:36.760 --> 45:38.440
 It seems like you do.

45:38.440 --> 45:42.340
 So what do you think is the value, what do you think literature adds to the pursuit of

45:42.340 --> 45:43.880
 scientific truth?

45:43.880 --> 45:46.640
 Do you think it's good, it's useful for everybody?

45:46.640 --> 45:52.600
 Gives you access to a much wider array of human experiences.

45:52.600 --> 45:54.320
 How valuable do you think it is?

45:54.320 --> 45:58.560
 Well if you want to understand human nature and nature in general, then I think you have

45:58.560 --> 46:04.720
 to better understand a wide variety of experiences, not just sitting in a lab staring at a screen

46:04.720 --> 46:08.040
 and having a face flashed onto you for a hundred milliseconds and pushing a button.

46:08.040 --> 46:10.680
 That's what I used to do, that's what most psychologists do.

46:10.680 --> 46:16.880
 There's nothing wrong with that, but you need to consider lots of other strange states.

46:16.880 --> 46:18.560
 And literature is a shortcut for this.

46:18.560 --> 46:22.840
 Well yeah, because literature, that's what literature is all about, all sorts of interesting

46:22.840 --> 46:28.680
 experiences that people have, the contingency of it, the fact that women experience the

46:28.680 --> 46:32.320
 world different, black people experience the world different.

46:32.320 --> 46:35.920
 The one way to experience that is reading all these different literature and try to

46:35.920 --> 46:36.920
 find out.

46:36.920 --> 46:37.920
 You see, everything is so relative.

46:37.920 --> 46:41.600
 You read a book 300 years ago, they thought about certain problems very, very differently

46:41.600 --> 46:43.320
 than us today.

46:43.320 --> 46:46.120
 We today, like any culture, think we know it all.

46:46.120 --> 46:47.440
 That's common to every culture.

46:47.440 --> 46:50.100
 Every culture believes at its heyday they know it all.

46:50.100 --> 46:53.400
 And then you realize, well, there's other ways of viewing the universe and some of them

46:53.400 --> 46:56.800
 may have lots of things in their favor.

46:56.800 --> 47:02.720
 So this is a question I wanted to ask about time scale or scale in general.

47:02.720 --> 47:07.160
 When you, with IIT or in general, try to think about consciousness, try to think about these

47:07.160 --> 47:17.640
 ideas, we kind of naturally think in human time scales, and also entities that are sized

47:17.640 --> 47:18.640
 close to humans.

47:18.640 --> 47:22.560
 Do you think of things that are much larger and much smaller as containing consciousness?

47:22.560 --> 47:32.480
 And do you think of things that take, you know, eons to operate in their conscious cause

47:32.480 --> 47:33.480
 effect?

47:33.480 --> 47:35.560
 That's a very good question.

47:35.560 --> 47:38.920
 So I think a lot about small creatures because experimentally, you know, a lot of people

47:38.920 --> 47:41.380
 work on flies and bees, right?

47:41.380 --> 47:45.360
 So most people just think they are automata, they're just bugs for heaven's sake, right?

47:45.360 --> 47:48.840
 But if you look at their behavior, like bees, they can recognize individual humans.

47:48.840 --> 47:52.520
 They have this very complicated way to communicate.

47:52.520 --> 47:55.740
 If you've ever been involved or you know your parents when they bought a house, what sort

47:55.740 --> 47:57.880
 of agonizing decision that is.

47:57.880 --> 48:01.320
 And bees have to do that once a year, right, when they swarm in the spring.

48:01.320 --> 48:04.880
 And then they have this very elaborate way, they have free and scouts, they go to the

48:04.880 --> 48:08.080
 individual sites, they come back, they have this power, this dance, literally, where they

48:08.080 --> 48:12.160
 dance for several days, they try to recruit other deets, this very complicated decision

48:12.160 --> 48:16.440
 rate, when they finally, once they make a decision, the entire swarm, the scouts warm

48:16.440 --> 48:18.480
 up the entire swarm and then go to one location.

48:18.480 --> 48:21.960
 They don't go to 50 locations, they go to one location that the scouts have agreed upon

48:21.960 --> 48:22.960
 by themselves.

48:22.960 --> 48:23.960
 That's awesome.

48:23.960 --> 48:27.040
 If we look at the circuit complexity, it's 10 times more denser than anything we have

48:27.040 --> 48:28.040
 in our brain.

48:28.040 --> 48:31.140
 Now they only have a million neurons, but the neurons are amazingly complex.

48:31.140 --> 48:35.020
 Complex behavior, very complicated circuitry, so there's no question they experience something,

48:35.020 --> 48:39.600
 their life is very different, they're tiny, they only live, you know, for, well, workers

48:39.600 --> 48:42.160
 live maybe for two months.

48:42.160 --> 48:47.980
 So I think, and IIT tells you this, in principle, the substrate of consciousness is the substrate

48:47.980 --> 48:53.140
 that maximizes the cause effect power over all possible spatial temporal grains.

48:53.140 --> 48:55.960
 So when I think about, for example, do you know the science fiction story, The Black

48:55.960 --> 48:56.960
 Cloud?

48:56.960 --> 49:00.040
 Okay, it's a classic by Fred Hoyle, the astronomer.

49:00.040 --> 49:06.240
 He has this cloud intervening between the earth and the sun and leading to some sort

49:06.240 --> 49:09.040
 of, to global cooling, this is written in the 50s.

49:09.040 --> 49:14.440
 It turns out you can, using the radio dish, they communicate with actually an entity,

49:14.440 --> 49:19.680
 it's actually an intelligent entity, and they sort of, they convince it to move away.

49:19.680 --> 49:24.840
 So here you have a radical different entity, and in principle, IIT says, well, you can

49:24.840 --> 49:30.200
 measure the integrated information, in principle at least, and yes, if the maximum of that

49:30.200 --> 49:35.980
 occurs at a time scale of months, rather than in assets for a fraction of a second, yes,

49:35.980 --> 49:41.600
 then they would experience life where each moment is a month rather than, or microsecond,

49:41.600 --> 49:46.800
 right, rather than a fraction of a second in the human case.

49:46.800 --> 49:50.500
 And so there may be forms of consciousness that we simply don't recognize for what they

49:50.500 --> 49:55.480
 are because they are so radical different from anything you and I are used to.

49:55.480 --> 49:59.720
 Again, that's why it's good to read or to watch science fiction movies, well, to think

49:59.720 --> 50:00.720
 about this.

50:00.720 --> 50:06.640
 Do you know Stanislav Lem, this Polish science fiction writer, he wrote Solaris and was turned

50:06.640 --> 50:07.640
 into a Hollywood movie?

50:07.640 --> 50:08.640
 Yes.

50:08.640 --> 50:13.080
 His best novel is in the 60s, a very engineer, he's an engineer in background.

50:13.080 --> 50:19.240
 His most interesting novel is called The Victorious, where human civilization, they have this

50:19.240 --> 50:25.120
 mission to this planet and everything is destroyed and they discover machines, humans got killed

50:25.120 --> 50:30.080
 and then these machines took over and there was this machine evolution, Darwinian evolution,

50:30.080 --> 50:32.200
 he talks about this very vividly.

50:32.200 --> 50:39.200
 And finally, the dominant machine intelligence organism that survived were gigantic clouds

50:39.200 --> 50:42.520
 of little hexagonal universal cellular automata.

50:42.520 --> 50:46.560
 This was written in the 60s, so typically they're all lying on the ground individual

50:46.560 --> 50:50.920
 by themselves, but in times of crisis, they can communicate, they assemble into gigantic

50:50.920 --> 50:55.840
 nets into clouds of trillions of these particles and then they become hyper intelligent and

50:55.840 --> 51:00.000
 they can beat anything that humans can throw at it.

51:00.000 --> 51:05.080
 It's very beautiful and compelling where you have an intelligence where finally the humans

51:05.080 --> 51:09.440
 leave the planet, they're simply unable to understand and comprehend this creature.

51:09.440 --> 51:13.160
 They can say, well, either we can nuke the entire planet and destroy it or we just have

51:13.160 --> 51:18.480
 to leave because fundamentally it's an alien, it's so alien from us and our ideas that we

51:18.480 --> 51:20.280
 cannot communicate with them.

51:20.280 --> 51:25.960
 Yeah, actually in conversation, so you're talking to us, Steven Wolf from Brought Up

51:25.960 --> 51:32.440
 is that there could be ideas that you already have these artificial general intelligence

51:32.440 --> 51:36.240
 like super smart or maybe conscious beings in the cellular automata, we just don't know

51:36.240 --> 51:37.240
 how to talk to them.

51:37.240 --> 51:41.440
 So it's the language of communication, but you don't know what to do with it.

51:41.440 --> 51:46.800
 So that's one sort of view is consciousness is only something you can measure.

51:46.800 --> 51:50.160
 So it's not conscious if you can't measure it.

51:50.160 --> 51:53.200
 So you're making an ontological and an epistemic statement.

51:53.200 --> 51:59.240
 One is it's just like seeing the multiverses, that might be true, but I can't communicate

51:59.240 --> 52:00.240
 with them.

52:00.240 --> 52:01.640
 I can't have any knowledge of them.

52:01.640 --> 52:02.640
 That's an epistemic argument.

52:02.640 --> 52:03.640
 Right?

52:03.640 --> 52:04.640
 So those are two different things.

52:04.640 --> 52:05.640
 So it may well be possible.

52:05.640 --> 52:09.320
 Look, in another case that's happening right now, people are building these mini organoids.

52:09.320 --> 52:10.960
 Do you know what this is?

52:10.960 --> 52:14.640
 So you can take stem cells from under your arm, put it in a dish, add four transcription

52:14.640 --> 52:19.920
 factors and then you can induce them to grow into large, well, large, they're a few millimeters.

52:19.920 --> 52:23.540
 They're like a half a million neurons that look like nerve cells in a dish called mini

52:23.540 --> 52:27.300
 organoids at Harvard, at Stanford, everywhere they're building them.

52:27.300 --> 52:31.920
 It may well be possible that they're beginning to feel like something, but we can't really

52:31.920 --> 52:33.560
 communicate with them right now.

52:33.560 --> 52:36.400
 So people are beginning to think about the ethics of this.

52:36.400 --> 52:41.840
 So yes, he may be perfectly right, but it's one question, are they conscious or not?

52:41.840 --> 52:43.040
 It's a totally separate question.

52:43.040 --> 52:44.040
 How would I know?

52:44.040 --> 52:45.800
 Those are two different things.

52:45.800 --> 52:52.940
 If you could give advice to a young researcher, sort of dreaming of understanding or creating

52:52.940 --> 52:59.120
 human level intelligence or consciousness, what would you say?

52:59.120 --> 53:01.440
 Just follow your dreams.

53:01.440 --> 53:02.440
 Read widely.

53:02.440 --> 53:08.880
 No, I mean, I suppose with discipline, what is the pursuit that they should take on?

53:08.880 --> 53:09.880
 Is it neuroscience?

53:09.880 --> 53:11.700
 Is it computational cognitive science?

53:11.700 --> 53:12.700
 Is it philosophy?

53:12.700 --> 53:15.400
 Is it computer science or robotics?

53:15.400 --> 53:22.840
 No, in a sense that, okay, so the only known system that have high level of intelligence

53:22.840 --> 53:24.480
 is homo sapiens.

53:24.480 --> 53:28.480
 So if you wanted to build it, it's probably good to continue to study closely what humans

53:28.480 --> 53:29.480
 do.

53:29.480 --> 53:32.920
 So cognitive neuroscience, you know, somewhere between cognitive neuroscience on the one hand

53:32.920 --> 53:37.360
 and some philosophy of mind and then AI, AI computer science.

53:37.360 --> 53:42.120
 You can look at all the original ideas in your network, they all came from neuroscience,

53:42.120 --> 53:43.120
 right?

53:43.120 --> 53:47.360
 Reinforce whether it's Snarky, Minsky building is Snarky or whether it's, you know, the early

53:47.360 --> 53:50.960
 Hubel and Wiesel experiments at Harvard that then gave rise to networks and then multi

53:50.960 --> 53:52.920
 layer networks.

53:52.920 --> 53:57.240
 So it may well be possible, in fact, some people argue that to make the next big step

53:57.240 --> 54:02.680
 in AI once we realize the limits of deep convolutional networks, they can do certain things, but

54:02.680 --> 54:03.680
 they can't really understand.

54:03.680 --> 54:08.800
 They don't, they can't really, I can't really show them one image.

54:08.800 --> 54:14.880
 I can show you a single image of somebody, a pickpocket who steals a wallet from a purse.

54:14.880 --> 54:17.040
 You immediately know that's a pickpocket.

54:17.040 --> 54:21.200
 Now computer system would just say, well, it's a man, it's a woman, it's a purse, right?

54:21.200 --> 54:24.520
 Unless you train this machine on showing it a hundred thousand pickpockets, right?

54:24.520 --> 54:29.800
 So it doesn't have this easy understanding that you have, right?

54:29.800 --> 54:33.000
 So some people make the argument in order to go to the next step or you really want

54:33.000 --> 54:37.140
 to build machines that understand in a way you and I, we have to go to psychology.

54:37.140 --> 54:40.440
 We need to understand how we do it and how our brains enable us to do it.

54:40.440 --> 54:45.040
 And so therefore being on the cusp, it's also so exciting to try to understand better our

54:45.040 --> 54:48.800
 nature and then to build, to take some of those inside and build them.

54:48.800 --> 54:52.720
 So I think the most exciting thing is somewhere in the interface between cognitive science,

54:52.720 --> 54:55.920
 neuroscience, AI, computer science and philosophy of mind.

54:55.920 --> 54:56.920
 Beautiful.

54:56.920 --> 54:57.920
 Yeah.

54:57.920 --> 55:00.520
 I'd say if there is from the machine learning, from our, from the computer science, computer

55:00.520 --> 55:05.800
 vision perspective, many of the researchers kind of ignore the way the human brain works

55:05.800 --> 55:12.160
 or even psychology or literature or studying the brain, I would hope Josh Tenenbaum talks

55:12.160 --> 55:14.760
 about bringing that in more and more.

55:14.760 --> 55:20.120
 And that's, yeah, so you've worked on some amazing stuff throughout your life.

55:20.120 --> 55:24.640
 What's the thing that you're really excited about?

55:24.640 --> 55:30.560
 What's the mystery that you would love to uncover in the near term beyond, beyond all

55:30.560 --> 55:32.400
 the mysteries that you're already surrounded by?

55:32.400 --> 55:36.720
 Well, so there's a structure called the claustrum.

55:36.720 --> 55:40.040
 This is a structure, it's underneath our cortex, it's yay big.

55:40.040 --> 55:44.200
 You have one on the left, on the right, underneath this, underneath the insula, it's very thin,

55:44.200 --> 55:48.280
 it's like one millimeter, it's embedded in, in wiring, in white matter, so it's very difficult

55:48.280 --> 55:50.200
 to image.

55:50.200 --> 55:55.080
 And it has, it has connection to every cortical region.

55:55.080 --> 55:58.360
 And Francis Crick, the last paper he ever wrote, he dictated corrections the day he

55:58.360 --> 56:00.840
 died in hospital on this paper.

56:00.840 --> 56:05.920
 You know, we hypothesize, well, because it has this unique anatomy, it gets input from

56:05.920 --> 56:10.800
 every cortical area and projects back to every, every cortical area.

56:10.800 --> 56:16.760
 That the function of this structure is similar, it's just a metaphor to the role of a conductor

56:16.760 --> 56:18.760
 in a symphony orchestra.

56:18.760 --> 56:20.560
 You have all the different cortical players.

56:20.560 --> 56:24.640
 You have some that do motion, some that do theory of mind, some that infer social interaction

56:24.640 --> 56:28.160
 and color and hearing and all the different modules in cortex.

56:28.160 --> 56:32.040
 But of course, what consciousness is, consciousness puts it all together into one package, right?

56:32.040 --> 56:33.560
 The binding problem, all of that.

56:33.560 --> 56:38.200
 And this is really the function because it has relatively few neurons compared to cortex,

56:38.200 --> 56:43.720
 but it talks, it receives input from all of them and it projects back to all of them.

56:43.720 --> 56:45.120
 And so we're testing that right now.

56:45.120 --> 56:50.040
 We've got this beautiful neuronal reconstruction in the mouse called crown of thorns, crown

56:50.040 --> 56:54.520
 of thorns neurons that are in the claustrum that have the most widespread connection of

56:54.520 --> 56:56.360
 any neuron I've ever seen.

56:56.360 --> 57:00.280
 They're very, you have individual neurons that sit in the claustrum tiny, but then they

57:00.280 --> 57:05.480
 have this single neuron, they have this huge axonal tree that cover both ipsy and contralateral

57:05.480 --> 57:11.000
 cortex and trying to turn using, you know, fancy tools like optogenetics, trying to turn

57:11.000 --> 57:15.440
 those neurons on or off and study it, what happens in the, in the mouse.

57:15.440 --> 57:20.520
 So this thing is perhaps where the parts become the whole.

57:20.520 --> 57:25.440
 Perhaps it's one of the structures, it's a very good way of putting it, where the individual

57:25.440 --> 57:30.080
 parts turn into the whole of the whole of the conscious experience.

57:30.080 --> 57:35.400
 Well, with that, thank you very much for being here today.

57:35.400 --> 57:36.400
 Thank you very much.

57:36.400 --> 57:37.400
 Thank you very much.

57:37.400 --> 57:55.640
 All right, thank you very much.
