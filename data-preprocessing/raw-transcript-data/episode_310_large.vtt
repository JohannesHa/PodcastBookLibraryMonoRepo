00:00.000 --> 00:01.580
 Mossad will do anything.

00:01.580 --> 00:05.460
 Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes

00:05.460 --> 00:08.740
 to ensure the survival of every Israeli citizen

00:08.740 --> 00:09.780
 around the world.

00:09.780 --> 00:12.940
 Most other countries will stop at some point,

00:12.940 --> 00:14.340
 but Mossad doesn't do that.

00:16.940 --> 00:19.940
 The following is a conversation with Andrew Bustamante,

00:19.940 --> 00:22.540
 former CIA covert intelligence officer

00:22.540 --> 00:24.780
 and US Air Force combat veteran,

00:24.780 --> 00:27.740
 including the job of operational targeting

00:27.740 --> 00:31.220
 in cryptic communications and launch operations

00:31.220 --> 00:36.220
 for 200 nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles.

00:36.260 --> 00:39.900
 Andrew's over seven years as a CIA spy

00:39.900 --> 00:43.740
 have given him a skillset and a perspective on the world

00:43.740 --> 00:45.640
 that is fascinating to explore.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.620
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:50.820 --> 00:52.100
 in the description.

00:52.100 --> 00:55.740
 And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Bustamante.

00:55.740 --> 00:59.340
 The Central Intelligence Agency was formed

00:59.340 --> 01:01.540
 almost 75 years ago.

01:01.540 --> 01:03.020
 What is the mission of the CIA?

01:03.020 --> 01:04.120
 How does it work?

01:04.120 --> 01:07.380
 The mission of the CIA is to collect intelligence

01:07.380 --> 01:08.740
 from around the world that supports

01:08.740 --> 01:12.420
 a national security mission and be the central repository

01:12.420 --> 01:14.640
 for all other intelligence agencies

01:14.640 --> 01:17.360
 so that it's one collective source

01:17.360 --> 01:20.220
 where all intelligence can be synthesized

01:20.220 --> 01:23.060
 and then passed forward to the decision makers.

01:23.060 --> 01:26.140
 That doesn't include domestic intelligence.

01:26.140 --> 01:29.420
 It's primarily looking outward outside the United States.

01:29.420 --> 01:30.260
 Correct.

01:30.260 --> 01:34.440
 CIA is the foreign intelligence collection,

01:35.660 --> 01:37.500
 king spoke, if you will.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.940
 FBI does domestic,

01:38.940 --> 01:41.620
 and then Department of Homeland Security does domestic.

01:41.620 --> 01:45.300
 Law enforcement essentially handles all things domestic.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.740
 Intelligence is not law enforcement,

01:46.740 --> 01:49.980
 so we technically cannot work inside the United States.

01:49.980 --> 01:52.460
 Is there clear lines to be drawn between,

01:52.460 --> 01:55.980
 like you just said, the FBI, CIA, FBI,

01:55.980 --> 01:58.260
 and the other U.S. intelligence agencies

01:58.260 --> 02:01.860
 like the DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency,

02:01.860 --> 02:03.500
 Department of Homeland Security,

02:04.420 --> 02:08.100
 NSA, National Security Agency, and there's a list.

02:08.100 --> 02:09.740
 There's a list of about 33

02:09.740 --> 02:11.100
 different intelligence organizations.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.980
 Yeah. So like the Army, the Navy has,

02:12.980 --> 02:14.780
 all the different organizations

02:14.780 --> 02:16.740
 have their own intelligence groups.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.740
 So is there clear lines here to be drawn,

02:19.740 --> 02:23.180
 or is the CIA the giant integrator of all of these?

02:23.180 --> 02:24.540
 It's a little bit of both, to be honest.

02:24.540 --> 02:26.280
 So yes, there are absolutely lines,

02:26.280 --> 02:28.340
 and more so than the lines.

02:28.340 --> 02:30.960
 There are lines that divide what our primary mission is.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.740
 Everything's gotta be prioritized.

02:32.740 --> 02:34.060
 That's one of the benefits

02:34.060 --> 02:36.100
 and the superpowers of the United States,

02:36.100 --> 02:38.620
 is we prioritize everything.

02:38.620 --> 02:41.080
 So different intelligence organizations are prioritized

02:41.080 --> 02:43.540
 to collect certain types of intelligence.

02:43.540 --> 02:47.100
 And then within the confines of how they collect,

02:47.100 --> 02:49.340
 they're also given unique authorities,

02:49.340 --> 02:51.500
 authorities are a term that's directed

02:51.500 --> 02:53.460
 by the executive branch.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.500
 Different agencies have different authorities

02:55.500 --> 02:58.620
 to execute missions in different ways.

02:58.620 --> 03:01.220
 FBI can't execute the same way CIA executes,

03:01.220 --> 03:05.480
 and CIA can't execute the same way NGA executes.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.900
 But then at the end, excuse me, when it's all collected,

03:08.900 --> 03:13.900
 then yes, CIA still acts as a final synthesizing repository

03:15.080 --> 03:17.700
 to create what's known as the president's daily brief,

03:17.700 --> 03:20.760
 the PDB, the only way CIA can create the PDB

03:20.760 --> 03:24.860
 is by being the single source of all source intelligence

03:24.860 --> 03:28.380
 from around the IC, the intelligence community,

03:28.380 --> 03:33.380
 which are those 30 some odd and always changing organizations

03:33.500 --> 03:35.980
 that are sponsored for intelligence operations.

03:35.980 --> 03:38.900
 What is the PDB, the president's daily brief look like?

03:38.900 --> 03:39.740
 How long is it?

03:39.740 --> 03:41.580
 What does it contain?

03:41.580 --> 03:43.940
 So first of all, it looks like the most expensive

03:43.940 --> 03:45.300
 book report you can ever imagine.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.820
 It's got its own binder.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.980
 It's all very high end.

03:48.980 --> 03:51.100
 It feels important, it looks important.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.220
 It's not like a cheap trapper keeper.

03:54.220 --> 03:56.780
 It's somewhere between, I would give it probably

03:56.780 --> 03:59.340
 between 50 and 125 pages a day.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.500
 It's produced every day around two o clock in the morning

04:02.500 --> 04:04.500
 by a dedicated group of analysts.

04:04.500 --> 04:09.500
 And each page is essentially a short paragraph

04:09.880 --> 04:13.400
 to a few paragraphs about a priority happening

04:13.400 --> 04:16.500
 that affects national security from around the world.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.660
 The president rarely gets to the entire briefing in a day.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.780
 He relies on a briefer instead to prioritize

04:22.780 --> 04:25.060
 what inside the briefing needs to be shared

04:25.060 --> 04:25.900
 with the president.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.600
 Because some days the PDB will get briefed in 10 minutes

04:28.600 --> 04:30.560
 and some days it'll be briefed over the course of two hours.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.820
 It depends on the president's schedule.

04:32.820 --> 04:36.220
 How much competition is there for the first page?

04:36.220 --> 04:39.660
 And so how much jockeying there is for attention?

04:41.080 --> 04:44.500
 I imagine for all the different intelligence agencies

04:44.500 --> 04:46.980
 and within the CIA there's probably different groups

04:46.980 --> 04:50.680
 that are modular and they all care about different nations

04:50.680 --> 04:53.380
 or different cases.

04:54.740 --> 04:58.660
 Do you understand how much competition there is

04:58.660 --> 05:00.600
 for the attention, for the limited attention

05:00.600 --> 05:01.480
 of the president?

05:01.480 --> 05:05.300
 You're 100% correct in how the agency

05:05.300 --> 05:09.620
 and how officers and managers at the agency handle the PDB.

05:09.620 --> 05:10.940
 There's a ton of competition.

05:10.940 --> 05:12.660
 Everybody wants to be the first on the radar.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.360
 Everybody wants to be on the first page.

05:14.360 --> 05:17.240
 The thing that we're not baking into the equation

05:17.240 --> 05:19.140
 is the president's interests.

05:19.140 --> 05:21.460
 The president dictates what's on the first page of his PDB

05:21.460 --> 05:23.780
 and he will tell them usually the day before,

05:23.780 --> 05:25.420
 I wanna see this on the first page tomorrow.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.580
 Bring this to me in the beginning.

05:26.580 --> 05:28.700
 I don't wanna hear about what's happening in Mozambique.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.880
 I don't really care about what's happening in Saudi Arabia.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.820
 I wanna see one, two, three.

05:32.820 --> 05:34.220
 And regardless of whether or not

05:34.220 --> 05:37.020
 those are the three biggest things in the world,

05:37.020 --> 05:39.300
 the president's the executive, he's the one.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.660
 He's the ultimate customer.

05:40.660 --> 05:42.580
 So we do what the customer says.

05:42.580 --> 05:44.620
 That has backfired in the past.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.500
 If you haven't already started seeing

05:46.500 --> 05:49.240
 how that could go wrong, that has backfired in the past,

05:49.240 --> 05:51.200
 but that is essentially what happens

05:51.200 --> 05:53.320
 when you serve in the executive branch.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.080
 You serve the executive.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.060
 So what's the role of the director of the CIA

05:58.060 --> 05:59.800
 versus the president?

05:59.800 --> 06:01.280
 What's that dance like?

06:01.280 --> 06:06.060
 So the president really leads the focus of the CIA?

06:06.060 --> 06:09.320
 The president is the commander in chief for the military,

06:09.320 --> 06:12.660
 but the president is also the executive

06:12.660 --> 06:16.220
 for the entirety of the intelligence community.

06:16.220 --> 06:19.540
 So he's the ultimate customer.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.940
 If you look at it like a business,

06:21.940 --> 06:24.300
 the customer, the person spending the money

06:24.300 --> 06:27.500
 is the president and the director is the CEO.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.600
 So if the director doesn't create what the president wants,

06:30.600 --> 06:31.620
 there's gonna be a new director.

06:31.620 --> 06:32.900
 That's why the director of CIA

06:32.900 --> 06:34.560
 is a presidential appointed position.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.240
 Sometimes they're extremely qualified

06:36.240 --> 06:37.620
 intelligence professionals.

06:37.620 --> 06:39.600
 Sometimes they're just professional politicians

06:39.600 --> 06:41.500
 or soldiers that get put into that seat

06:41.500 --> 06:43.800
 because the president trusts them

06:43.800 --> 06:46.740
 to do what he wants them to do.

06:46.740 --> 06:51.740
 Another gaping area that causes problems,

06:52.380 --> 06:54.240
 but that's still the way it is.

06:54.240 --> 06:57.260
 So you think this is a problematic configuration

06:57.260 --> 06:58.100
 of the whole system?

06:58.100 --> 06:59.460
 Massive flaw in the system.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.860
 It is a massive flaw in the system

07:00.860 --> 07:03.860
 because if you're essentially appointing a director

07:03.860 --> 07:05.500
 to do what you want them to do,

07:05.500 --> 07:08.580
 then you're assigning a crony.

07:08.580 --> 07:10.820
 And that's what we define corruption as

07:10.820 --> 07:11.660
 within the United States.

07:11.660 --> 07:12.660
 And inside the United States,

07:12.660 --> 07:15.020
 we say if you pick somebody outside of merit

07:15.020 --> 07:16.660
 for any other reason other than merit,

07:16.660 --> 07:19.500
 then it's cronyism or it's nepotism.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.720
 Here, that's exactly what our structure is built on.

07:21.720 --> 07:22.900
 All presidential appointees

07:22.900 --> 07:25.060
 are appointed on something other than merit.

07:25.060 --> 07:27.460
 So for an intelligence agency to be effective,

07:27.460 --> 07:31.740
 it has to discover the truth and communicate that truth.

07:31.740 --> 07:34.700
 And maybe if you're appointing the director of that agency,

07:34.700 --> 07:37.780
 you're not, they're less likely to communicate the truth

07:37.780 --> 07:39.980
 to you unless the truth aligns perfectly

07:39.980 --> 07:41.740
 with your desired worldview.

07:41.740 --> 07:43.080
 Well, not necessarily perfectly

07:43.080 --> 07:44.840
 because there are other steps, right?

07:44.840 --> 07:46.900
 They have to be, they have to go in front of Congress

07:46.900 --> 07:48.440
 and they have to have the support

07:48.440 --> 07:51.940
 of multiple legislatures or legislators,

07:51.940 --> 07:55.800
 but the challenge is that the shortlist of people

07:55.800 --> 07:59.280
 who even get the opportunity aren't a meritorious list.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.540
 It's a shortlist based off of who the president is picking

08:01.540 --> 08:03.340
 or who the would be president is picking.

08:03.340 --> 08:05.100
 Now, I think we've proven

08:05.100 --> 08:07.680
 that an intelligence organization can be,

08:07.680 --> 08:10.580
 an intelligence organization can be extremely effective

08:10.580 --> 08:13.300
 even within the flawed system.

08:13.300 --> 08:16.300
 The challenge is how much more effective could we be

08:16.300 --> 08:17.740
 if we improved?

08:17.740 --> 08:20.180
 And that's, I think that's the challenge

08:20.180 --> 08:21.940
 that faces a lot of the US government.

08:21.940 --> 08:24.860
 I think that's a challenge that has resulted

08:24.860 --> 08:28.540
 in what we see today when it comes to the decline

08:28.540 --> 08:31.140
 of American power and American influence,

08:31.140 --> 08:35.420
 the rise of foreign influence, authoritarian powers,

08:35.420 --> 08:39.460
 and a shrinking US economy, a growing Chinese economy.

08:39.460 --> 08:42.420
 And it's just, we have questions, hard questions

08:42.420 --> 08:43.340
 we need to ask ourselves

08:43.340 --> 08:45.200
 about how we're gonna handle the future.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.820
 What aspect of that communication between the president

08:47.820 --> 08:52.820
 and the CIA could be fixed to help fix the problems

08:53.420 --> 08:54.540
 that you're referring to

08:54.540 --> 08:57.580
 in terms of the decline of American power?

08:57.580 --> 09:02.580
 So when you talk about the president wanting to prioritize

09:02.600 --> 09:04.600
 what the president cares about,

09:04.600 --> 09:07.540
 that immediately shows a break

09:07.540 --> 09:09.700
 between what actually matters

09:09.700 --> 09:12.320
 to the longterm success of the United States

09:12.320 --> 09:13.300
 versus what happened,

09:13.300 --> 09:15.540
 what benefits the short term success

09:15.540 --> 09:16.500
 of the current president.

09:16.500 --> 09:20.160
 Because any president is just a human being

09:20.160 --> 09:21.900
 and has a very narrow focus.

09:21.900 --> 09:24.720
 And narrow focus is not a longterm calculation.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.660
 Exactly, what's the maximum amount of years

09:26.660 --> 09:28.300
 the president can be president?

09:28.300 --> 09:29.260
 Eight.

09:29.260 --> 09:30.620
 He has to be, he or she.

09:30.620 --> 09:31.620
 In the United States.

09:31.620 --> 09:32.700
 In the United States,

09:32.700 --> 09:34.340
 according to our current constitution.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.180
 Yeah.

09:35.180 --> 09:39.340
 But they're very limited

09:39.340 --> 09:41.600
 in terms of what they have to prioritize.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.060
 And then if you look at a four year cycle,

09:44.060 --> 09:45.740
 two years of that is essentially preparing

09:45.740 --> 09:47.120
 for the next election cycle.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.160
 So that's only two years of really quality attention

09:49.160 --> 09:50.060
 you get from the president,

09:50.060 --> 09:51.500
 who is the chief executive

09:51.500 --> 09:53.100
 of all the intelligence community.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.220
 So the most important thing to them

09:55.220 --> 09:57.020
 is not always the most important thing

09:57.020 --> 09:59.660
 to the longterm survival of the United States.

09:59.660 --> 10:02.020
 What do you make of the hostile relationship

10:02.020 --> 10:04.680
 that to me at least stands out of the presidents

10:04.680 --> 10:07.320
 between Donald Trump and the CIA?

10:07.320 --> 10:11.460
 Was that a very kind of personal bickering?

10:11.460 --> 10:13.280
 I mean, is there something interesting to you

10:13.280 --> 10:16.300
 about the dynamics between that particular president

10:16.300 --> 10:17.980
 and that particular instantiation

10:17.980 --> 10:19.380
 of the intelligence agency?

10:19.380 --> 10:21.720
 Man, there were lots of things fascinating to me

10:21.720 --> 10:23.700
 about that relationship.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.140
 What's the good and the bad, sorry to interrupt.

10:26.140 --> 10:27.980
 So let me start with the good first

10:27.980 --> 10:28.820
 because there's a lot of people

10:28.820 --> 10:30.940
 who don't think there was any good.

10:30.940 --> 10:35.740
 So the good thing is we saw that the president

10:35.740 --> 10:40.380
 who's the chief customer, the executive to the CIA,

10:40.380 --> 10:42.520
 when the president doesn't want to hear

10:42.520 --> 10:45.520
 what CIA has to say, he's not gonna listen.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.580
 I think that's an important lesson

10:46.580 --> 10:49.140
 for everyone to take home.

10:49.140 --> 10:51.620
 If the president doesn't care what you have to say,

10:51.620 --> 10:52.820
 he's gonna take funding away

10:52.820 --> 10:54.660
 or she will take funding away.

10:54.660 --> 10:56.260
 They're gonna take attention away.

10:56.260 --> 11:01.260
 They're going to shut down your operations, your missions.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.780
 They're gonna kill the careers of the people working there.

11:04.780 --> 11:05.940
 Think about that, for the four years

11:05.940 --> 11:08.500
 that President Trump was the president,

11:08.500 --> 11:12.000
 basically everybody at CIA, their career was put on pause.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.660
 Some people's careers were ended.

11:13.660 --> 11:16.300
 Some people voluntarily left their career there

11:16.300 --> 11:20.380
 because they found themselves working for a single customer

11:20.380 --> 11:21.940
 that didn't want what they had to produce.

11:21.940 --> 11:24.500
 So for people who don't know,

11:24.500 --> 11:26.980
 Donald Trump did not display significant,

11:26.980 --> 11:28.860
 deep interest in the output.

11:29.820 --> 11:30.900
 He did not trust it, yeah.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.460
 He was a disinterested customer.

11:32.460 --> 11:33.300
 Exactly right.

11:33.300 --> 11:34.420
 Of the information.

11:34.420 --> 11:37.020
 And then what do disinterested customers do?

11:37.020 --> 11:39.740
 They go find someone else to create their product.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.180
 And that's exactly what Donald Trump did.

11:41.180 --> 11:43.340
 And he did it through the private intelligence world,

11:43.340 --> 11:45.540
 funding private intelligence companies

11:45.540 --> 11:48.120
 to run their own operations that brought him

11:48.120 --> 11:50.960
 the information he cared about when CIA wouldn't.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.700
 It also didn't help that CIA

11:52.700 --> 11:54.580
 stepped outside of their confines, right?

11:54.580 --> 11:56.660
 CIA is supposed to collect foreign intelligence

11:56.660 --> 11:58.740
 and not comment on domestic matters.

11:58.740 --> 12:00.420
 They went way outside of that

12:00.420 --> 12:02.380
 when they started challenging the president,

12:02.380 --> 12:04.180
 when they started questioning the results,

12:04.180 --> 12:08.340
 when they started publicly claiming Russian influence.

12:08.340 --> 12:10.780
 That's all something the FBI could have handled by itself.

12:10.780 --> 12:12.560
 The Justice Department could have handled by itself.

12:12.560 --> 12:16.340
 CIA had no place to contribute to that conversation.

12:16.340 --> 12:18.800
 And when they did, all they did was undermine

12:18.800 --> 12:21.700
 the relationship they had with their primary customer.

12:21.700 --> 12:26.240
 Let me sort of focus in on this relationship

12:26.240 --> 12:29.120
 between the president or the leader

12:29.120 --> 12:31.100
 and the intelligence agency

12:31.100 --> 12:33.120
 and look outside the United States.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.500
 It seems like authoritarian regimes

12:36.500 --> 12:37.860
 or regimes throughout history,

12:37.860 --> 12:39.780
 if you look at Stalin and Hitler,

12:39.780 --> 12:41.820
 if you look at today with Vladimir Putin,

12:42.700 --> 12:44.420
 the negative effects of power

12:44.420 --> 12:46.460
 corrupting the mind of a leader

12:46.460 --> 12:50.340
 manifest itself is that they start

12:50.340 --> 12:53.420
 to get bad information from the intelligence agencies.

12:53.420 --> 12:55.660
 So this kind of thing that you're talking about,

12:55.660 --> 12:58.660
 over time, they start hearing information

12:58.660 --> 13:00.760
 they want to hear.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.220
 The agency starts producing

13:02.220 --> 13:05.620
 only the kind of information they want to hear,

13:05.620 --> 13:09.900
 and the leader's worldview starts becoming distorted

13:09.900 --> 13:13.860
 to where the propaganda they generate

13:13.860 --> 13:17.260
 is also the thing that the intelligence agencies

13:17.260 --> 13:19.740
 provide to them, and so they start getting this,

13:19.740 --> 13:21.580
 they start believing their own propaganda,

13:21.580 --> 13:23.760
 and they start getting a distorted view of the world.

13:23.760 --> 13:27.460
 Sorry for the sort of walking through in a weird way,

13:27.460 --> 13:29.820
 but I guess I want to ask, do you think,

13:29.820 --> 13:32.620
 let's look at Vladimir Putin specifically.

13:32.620 --> 13:37.620
 Do you think he's getting accurate information

13:37.780 --> 13:38.620
 about the world?

13:38.620 --> 13:40.820
 Do you think he knows the truth of the world,

13:40.820 --> 13:42.640
 whether that's the war in Ukraine,

13:42.640 --> 13:45.140
 whether that's the behavior of the other nations,

13:45.140 --> 13:47.460
 in NATO, the United States in general?

13:47.460 --> 13:49.060
 What do you think?

13:49.060 --> 13:52.580
 It's rare that I'll talk about just thinking.

13:52.580 --> 13:55.420
 I prefer to share my assessment,

13:55.420 --> 13:56.980
 why I assess things a certain way,

13:56.980 --> 13:59.580
 rather than just what's my random opinion.

13:59.580 --> 14:02.940
 In my assessment, Vladimir Putin is winning.

14:02.940 --> 14:04.140
 Russia is winning.

14:04.140 --> 14:06.980
 They're winning in Ukraine, but they're also winning

14:06.980 --> 14:08.820
 the battle of influence against the West.

14:08.820 --> 14:11.160
 They're winning in the face of economic sanctions.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.340
 They're winning.

14:12.340 --> 14:15.460
 Empirically, when you look at the math, they're winning.

14:15.460 --> 14:18.140
 So when you ask me whether or not Putin

14:18.140 --> 14:20.540
 is getting good information from his intelligence services,

14:20.540 --> 14:24.460
 when I look at my overall assessment of multiple data points,

14:24.460 --> 14:26.920
 he must be getting good information.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.540
 Do I know how or why?

14:28.540 --> 14:29.700
 I do not.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.220
 I don't know how or why it works there.

14:31.220 --> 14:35.020
 I don't know how such deep cronyism,

14:35.020 --> 14:40.020
 such deep corruption can possibly yield true real results.

14:40.020 --> 14:42.600
 And yet, somehow there are real results happening.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.160
 So it's either excessive waste and an accidental win,

14:46.160 --> 14:48.280
 or there really is a system and a process there

14:48.280 --> 14:49.360
 that's functioning.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.760
 So this winning idea is very interesting.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.400
 In what way, short term and long term, is Russia winning?

14:55.400 --> 14:57.160
 Some people say there was a miscalculation

14:57.160 --> 14:58.920
 of the way the invasion happened.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.520
 There was an assumption that you would be able

15:02.520 --> 15:05.000
 to successfully take Kiev.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.880
 You'd be able to successfully capture the East,

15:07.880 --> 15:10.720
 the South, and the North of Ukraine.

15:10.720 --> 15:14.120
 And with what now appears to be

15:14.120 --> 15:16.360
 significantly insufficient troops

15:16.360 --> 15:19.920
 spread way too thin across way too large of a front.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.680
 So that seems to be like an intelligence failure.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.720
 And that doesn't seem to be like winning.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.760
 In another way, it doesn't seem like winning

15:30.760 --> 15:33.840
 if we put aside the human cost of war.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.280
 It doesn't seem like winning

15:36.280 --> 15:39.600
 because the hearts and minds of the West

15:40.720 --> 15:43.260
 were completely on the side of Ukraine.

15:43.260 --> 15:46.120
 This particular leader, Volodymyr Zelensky,

15:46.120 --> 15:48.080
 captured the attention of the world

15:48.080 --> 15:52.120
 and the hearts and minds of Europe, the West,

15:52.120 --> 15:54.460
 and many other nations throughout the world,

15:54.460 --> 15:57.360
 both financially, in terms of military equipment,

15:57.360 --> 16:01.460
 and in terms of sort of social and cultural

16:01.460 --> 16:04.760
 and emotional support for the independence fight

16:04.760 --> 16:05.880
 of this nation.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.720
 That seems to be like a miscalculation.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.120
 So against that pushback,

16:12.120 --> 16:15.840
 why do you think there's still kernels

16:15.840 --> 16:19.920
 of winning in this on the Russian side?

16:19.920 --> 16:21.920
 What you're laying out isn't incorrect.

16:21.920 --> 16:26.320
 And the miscalculations are not unexpected.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.960
 Anybody who's been to a military college,

16:28.960 --> 16:30.700
 including the Army War College in Pennsylvania,

16:30.700 --> 16:34.880
 where so many of our military leaders are brought up,

16:34.880 --> 16:37.920
 when you look at the conflict in Ukraine,

16:37.920 --> 16:40.400
 it fits the exact mold

16:40.400 --> 16:44.840
 of what an effective longterm military conflict,

16:44.840 --> 16:46.200
 protracted military conflict,

16:46.200 --> 16:49.600
 would and should look like for military dominance.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.420
 Now, did Zelensky and did the Ukrainians

16:52.420 --> 16:53.260
 shock the world?

16:53.260 --> 16:54.240
 Absolutely.

16:54.240 --> 16:57.800
 But in that, they also shocked American intelligence,

16:57.800 --> 17:00.200
 which, like you said, miscalculated.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.560
 The whole world miscalculated

17:01.560 --> 17:03.200
 how the Ukrainians would respond.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.560
 Putin did not move in there accidentally.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.800
 He had an assessment.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.400
 He had high likelihood of a certain outcome,

17:09.400 --> 17:11.440
 and that outcome did not happen.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.120
 Why did he have that calculation?

17:13.120 --> 17:15.980
 Because in 2014, it worked.

17:15.980 --> 17:19.760
 He invaded, he took Crimea in 14 days.

17:19.760 --> 17:24.760
 He basically created an infiltration campaign

17:25.080 --> 17:26.880
 that turned key leaders over

17:26.880 --> 17:29.240
 in the first few days of the conflict.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.720
 So essentially, there was no conflict.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.240
 It worked in 2008 when he took Georgia.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.040
 Nobody talks about that.

17:35.040 --> 17:38.340
 He invaded Georgia the exact same way, and it worked.

17:38.340 --> 17:39.400
 So in 2008, it worked.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.360
 In 2014, it worked.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.180
 There was no reason to believe it wasn't going to work again.

17:43.180 --> 17:45.520
 So he just carried out the same campaign.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.600
 But this time, something was different.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.100
 That was a miscalculation for sure on the part of Putin.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.000
 And the reason that there was no support from the West,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.440
 because let's not forget, there is no support.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.680
 There is nothing other than the Lend Lease Act,

17:58.680 --> 18:01.880
 which is putting Ukraine in massive debt right now

18:01.880 --> 18:03.340
 to the West.

18:03.340 --> 18:05.200
 That's the only form of support they're getting

18:05.200 --> 18:07.080
 from NATO or the United States.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.840
 So if somebody believed Ukraine would win,

18:10.840 --> 18:12.280
 if somebody believed Ukraine had a chance,

18:12.280 --> 18:13.680
 they would have gotten more material support

18:13.680 --> 18:15.520
 than just debt.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.780
 And we can jump into that anytime you want to.

18:17.780 --> 18:19.480
 But the whole world miscalculated.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.440
 Everybody thought Russia was going to win in 14 days.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.560
 I said that they would win in 14 days

18:23.560 --> 18:26.360
 because that was the predominant calculation.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.960
 Once the first invasion didn't work,

18:28.960 --> 18:32.760
 then the military does what professional militaries do, man.

18:32.760 --> 18:37.760
 They reevaluate, they reorganize leaders,

18:38.080 --> 18:40.340
 and then they take a new approach.

18:40.340 --> 18:41.720
 You saw three approaches.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.720
 The first two did not work.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.240
 The first two campaigns against Ukraine did not work

18:46.240 --> 18:47.680
 the way they were supposed to work.

18:47.680 --> 18:51.280
 The third has worked exactly like it's supposed to work.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.780
 You don't need Kiev to win Ukraine.

18:53.780 --> 18:56.560
 You don't need hearts and minds to win Ukraine.

18:56.560 --> 19:00.800
 What you need is control of natural resources,

19:00.800 --> 19:02.680
 which they're taking in the East,

19:02.680 --> 19:05.880
 and you need access to the heartbeat,

19:05.880 --> 19:09.120
 the blood flow of food and money into the country,

19:09.120 --> 19:10.900
 which they're taking in the South.

19:10.900 --> 19:14.760
 The fact that Ukraine had to go to the negotiation table

19:14.760 --> 19:19.400
 with Russia and Turkey in order to get exports

19:19.400 --> 19:21.760
 out of the Black Sea approved again

19:21.760 --> 19:24.180
 demonstrates just how much Ukraine is losing.

19:25.240 --> 19:29.500
 The aggressor had a seat at the negotiation table

19:29.500 --> 19:32.400
 to allow Ukraine the ability to even export

19:32.400 --> 19:33.880
 one of its top exports.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.480
 If Russia would have said no,

19:35.480 --> 19:37.120
 then they would not have had that.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.640
 Russia has, that's like someone holding your throat.

19:39.640 --> 19:43.200
 It's like somebody holding your jugular vein and saying,

19:43.200 --> 19:46.480
 if you don't do what I tell you to do,

19:46.480 --> 19:48.340
 then I'm not gonna let you breathe.

19:48.340 --> 19:50.080
 I'm not gonna let blood flow to your brain.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.880
 So do you think it's possible that Russia

19:52.880 --> 19:56.140
 takes the South of Ukraine?

19:56.140 --> 20:01.140
 It takes, so starting from Mariupol, the Kherson region.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.520
 All the way to Odessa.

20:04.520 --> 20:05.760
 All the way to Odessa.

20:05.760 --> 20:09.720
 And into Moldova.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.880
 I believe all of that will happen before the fall.

20:12.880 --> 20:13.800
 Fall of this year?

20:13.800 --> 20:14.680
 Fall of this year.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.600
 Before winter hits Europe,

20:16.600 --> 20:21.480
 NATO wants Germany needs to be able to have sanctions lifted

20:21.480 --> 20:23.720
 so they can tap into Russian power.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.100
 There's no way they can have those sanctions lifted

20:26.100 --> 20:28.240
 unless Russia wins.

20:28.240 --> 20:31.240
 And Russia also knows that all of Europe,

20:31.240 --> 20:33.380
 all of NATO is the true,

20:33.380 --> 20:36.000
 the true people feeling the pain of the war

20:36.000 --> 20:39.160
 outside of Ukraine are the NATO countries

20:39.160 --> 20:42.680
 because they're so heavily reliant on Russia.

20:42.680 --> 20:46.280
 And as they have supported American sanctions against Russia,

20:46.280 --> 20:47.880
 their people feel the pain.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.520
 Economically, their people feel the pain.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.940
 What are they gonna do in the winter?

20:51.940 --> 20:54.700
 Because without Russian gas,

20:54.700 --> 20:56.840
 their people are gonna freeze to death.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.000
 Ukrainian people.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.280
 People all over NATO.

21:00.440 --> 21:03.040
 Ukraine, everybody knows Ukraine's at risk.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.200
 Everybody knows Ukrainians are dying.

21:05.200 --> 21:08.560
 The game of war isn't played just,

21:08.560 --> 21:10.220
 it isn't even played majoritively

21:10.220 --> 21:11.920
 by the people who are fighting.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.640
 The game of war is played by everyone else.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.640
 It's an economic game.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.020
 It's not a military game.

21:16.020 --> 21:18.400
 The flow of resources and energy.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.600
 Attention. And food.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.400
 Exactly right.

21:21.400 --> 21:24.640
 I was on the front in the Kherson region,

21:24.640 --> 21:26.880
 the very area that you're referring to,

21:26.880 --> 21:29.040
 and I spoke to a lot of people,

21:29.040 --> 21:33.240
 and the morale is incredibly high.

21:33.240 --> 21:37.700
 And I don't think the people in that region,

21:37.700 --> 21:42.700
 soldiers, volunteer soldiers, civilians,

21:42.700 --> 21:47.340
 are going to give up that land without dying.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.700
 I agree with you.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.980
 I mean, in order to take Odessa,

21:51.980 --> 21:56.980
 would require huge amount of artillery

21:57.520 --> 22:00.380
 and slaughter of civilians, essentially.

22:00.380 --> 22:01.860
 They're not gonna use artillery in Odessa

22:01.860 --> 22:05.400
 because Odessa's too important to Russian culture.

22:06.300 --> 22:07.880
 It's gonna be even uglier than that.

22:07.880 --> 22:10.340
 It's going to be clearing of streets,

22:10.340 --> 22:13.420
 clearing of buildings, person by person, troop by troop.

22:13.420 --> 22:16.100
 It'll be a lot like what it was in Margol.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.140
 Just shooting at civilians.

22:18.140 --> 22:20.940
 Because they can't afford to just do bombing raids

22:20.940 --> 22:23.100
 because they're gonna destroy cultural,

22:23.100 --> 22:25.500
 significant architecture that's just too important

22:25.500 --> 22:26.700
 to the Russian culture,

22:26.700 --> 22:29.500
 and that's gonna demoralize their own Russian people.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.580
 I have to do a lot of thinking

22:30.580 --> 22:32.620
 to try to understand what I even feel.

22:32.620 --> 22:37.460
 I don't know, but in terms of information,

22:37.460 --> 22:39.380
 the thing that the soldiers are saying,

22:39.380 --> 22:40.740
 the Russian soldiers are saying,

22:40.740 --> 22:43.620
 the thing the Russian soldiers really believe

22:43.620 --> 22:45.420
 is that they're freeing,

22:45.420 --> 22:50.420
 they're liberating the Ukrainian people from Nazis.

22:54.100 --> 22:55.420
 And they believe this.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.820
 Because I visited Ukraine,

22:57.820 --> 23:00.740
 I spoke to over 100,

23:00.740 --> 23:02.540
 probably a couple hundred Ukrainian people

23:02.540 --> 23:04.420
 from different walks of life.

23:04.420 --> 23:08.620
 It feels like the Russian soldiers, at least,

23:08.620 --> 23:11.220
 are under a cloud of propaganda.

23:11.220 --> 23:15.500
 They're not operating on a clear view of the whole world.

23:15.500 --> 23:20.500
 And given all that,

23:20.500 --> 23:25.500
 I just don't see Russia taking the South

23:28.100 --> 23:31.740
 without committing war crimes.

23:32.740 --> 23:36.460
 And if Vladimir Putin is aware of what's happening

23:36.460 --> 23:39.380
 in terms of the treatment of civilians,

23:39.380 --> 23:43.100
 I don't see him pushing forward all the way

23:43.100 --> 23:44.740
 to take the South,

23:44.740 --> 23:49.740
 because that's not going to be effective strategy

23:49.740 --> 23:54.020
 for him to win the hearts and minds of these people.

23:54.020 --> 23:56.740
 Autocracies don't need to win hearts and minds.

23:56.740 --> 24:00.140
 That's a staunchly democratic point of view.

24:00.140 --> 24:02.020
 Hearts and minds mean very little

24:02.020 --> 24:07.020
 to people who understand core basic needs and true power.

24:11.940 --> 24:13.700
 You don't see Xi Jinping worrying

24:13.700 --> 24:14.900
 about hearts and minds in China.

24:14.900 --> 24:17.580
 You don't see it in North Korea.

24:17.580 --> 24:20.100
 You don't see it in Congo.

24:20.100 --> 24:22.420
 You don't see it in most of the world.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.620
 Hearts and minds are a luxury.

24:24.620 --> 24:27.260
 In reality, what people need is food, water, power.

24:27.260 --> 24:32.260
 They need income to be able to secure a lifestyle.

24:32.700 --> 24:34.060
 It is absolutely sad.

24:34.060 --> 24:37.620
 I am not in any way, shape or form saying

24:37.620 --> 24:42.420
 that my assessment on this is enriching

24:42.420 --> 24:46.340
 or enlightening or hopeful.

24:46.340 --> 24:48.700
 It's just fact.

24:48.700 --> 24:52.660
 It's just calculatable empirical evidence.

24:52.660 --> 24:56.300
 If Putin loses in Ukraine, the losses,

24:56.300 --> 24:59.420
 the influential losses, the economic losses,

24:59.420 --> 25:03.740
 the lives lost, the power lost is too great.

25:03.740 --> 25:07.540
 So it is better for him to push and push and push

25:07.540 --> 25:09.380
 through war crimes, through everything else.

25:09.380 --> 25:10.620
 War crimes are something defined

25:10.620 --> 25:12.380
 by the international court system.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.620
 The international court system has Russia

25:14.620 --> 25:16.220
 as part of its board.

25:16.220 --> 25:19.700
 And the international court system is largely powerless

25:20.860 --> 25:23.180
 when it comes to enforcing its own outcomes.

25:23.180 --> 25:26.180
 So the real risk gain scenario here

25:26.180 --> 25:31.180
 for Russia is significantly in favor of gain over risk.

25:34.340 --> 25:36.260
 The other thing that I think is important

25:36.260 --> 25:39.980
 to talk about is we, everybody is trapped

25:39.980 --> 25:42.860
 in the middle of a gigantic information war.

25:42.860 --> 25:46.020
 Yes, there's battlefield bullets and cannons and tanks,

25:46.020 --> 25:48.540
 but there's also a massive informational war.

25:48.540 --> 25:53.540
 The same narrative that you see these ground troops

25:53.540 --> 25:56.780
 in Ukraine, these Russian ground troops in Ukraine,

25:56.780 --> 25:59.780
 believing they're clearing the land of Nazis.

25:59.780 --> 26:02.540
 That information is being fed to them

26:02.540 --> 26:04.100
 from their own home country.

26:05.020 --> 26:06.460
 I don't know why people seem to think

26:06.460 --> 26:08.100
 that the information that they're reading in English

26:08.100 --> 26:09.780
 is any more or less true.

26:10.900 --> 26:13.020
 Every piece of news coming out of the West,

26:13.020 --> 26:14.820
 every piece of information coming out

26:14.820 --> 26:18.420
 in the English language is also a giant narrative

26:18.420 --> 26:23.420
 being shared intentionally to try to undermine the morale

26:23.620 --> 26:26.060
 and the faithfulness of English speaking Russians,

26:26.060 --> 26:27.900
 which somebody somewhere knows exactly

26:27.900 --> 26:29.540
 how many of those there are.

26:29.540 --> 26:32.020
 So we have to recognize that we're not getting

26:32.020 --> 26:33.820
 true information from other side

26:33.820 --> 26:35.980
 because there's a strategic value in making sure

26:35.980 --> 26:37.900
 that there is just the right amount

26:37.900 --> 26:40.300
 of mis or disinformation out there.

26:40.300 --> 26:42.540
 Not because someone's trying to lie to Americans,

26:42.540 --> 26:44.420
 but because someone is trying to influence

26:44.420 --> 26:47.060
 the way English speaking Russians think.

26:47.060 --> 26:49.860
 And in that world, that's exactly why you see

26:49.860 --> 26:54.420
 so many news articles cited to anonymous sources,

26:54.420 --> 26:56.580
 government officials who do not wanna be named.

26:56.580 --> 26:59.780
 There's nothing that links back responsibility there.

26:59.780 --> 27:02.020
 There's nothing that can go to court there,

27:02.020 --> 27:04.180
 but the information still gets released.

27:04.180 --> 27:08.260
 And that's enough to make Ukrainians believe

27:08.260 --> 27:10.060
 that the United States is gonna help them

27:10.060 --> 27:11.300
 or that the West is gonna help them.

27:11.300 --> 27:13.100
 It's enough to make Russians think

27:13.100 --> 27:15.540
 that they're going to lose.

27:15.540 --> 27:18.060
 And maybe they should just give up now

27:18.060 --> 27:19.700
 and leave from the battlefield now.

27:19.700 --> 27:20.940
 We have to understand.

27:20.940 --> 27:24.060
 We are in the middle of a giant information war.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.420
 Maybe you can correct me,

27:25.420 --> 27:27.380
 but it feels like in the English speaking world,

27:27.380 --> 27:29.420
 it's harder to control.

27:29.420 --> 27:32.300
 It's harder to fight the information war

27:32.300 --> 27:36.060
 because of, some people say there's not really

27:36.060 --> 27:37.580
 a freedom of speech in this country,

27:37.580 --> 27:40.180
 but I think if you compare,

27:40.180 --> 27:41.780
 there's a lot more freedom of speech.

27:41.780 --> 27:44.300
 And it's just harder to control narratives

27:44.300 --> 27:48.460
 when there's a bunch of guerrilla journalists

27:48.460 --> 27:50.380
 that are able to just publish anything they want

27:50.380 --> 27:51.980
 on Twitter or anything.

27:51.980 --> 27:53.940
 It's just harder to control narratives.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.100
 So people don't understand what freedom of speech is.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.580
 That's the first major problem.

27:57.580 --> 28:00.340
 And it's shameful how many people in the United States

28:00.340 --> 28:03.740
 do not understand what freedom of speech actually protects.

28:03.740 --> 28:06.580
 So that aside, you're absolutely right.

28:06.580 --> 28:09.140
 Fighting the information war in the West

28:09.140 --> 28:10.380
 is extremely difficult

28:10.380 --> 28:15.380
 because anyone with a blog, anyone with a Twitter account,

28:16.100 --> 28:18.260
 anyone, I mean, anyone can call themselves

28:18.260 --> 28:19.540
 a journalist, essentially.

28:19.540 --> 28:21.740
 We live in a world, we live in a country

28:21.740 --> 28:23.260
 where people read the headline

28:23.260 --> 28:26.580
 and they completely bypass the author line

28:26.580 --> 28:28.220
 and they go straight into the content.

28:28.220 --> 28:30.140
 And then they decide whether the content's real or not

28:30.140 --> 28:31.420
 based on how they feel

28:31.420 --> 28:33.980
 instead of based on empirical, measurable evidence.

28:35.140 --> 28:37.580
 So you mentioned the Lend Lease Act

28:37.580 --> 28:39.740
 and the support of the United States,

28:39.740 --> 28:42.340
 support of Ukraine by the United States.

28:42.340 --> 28:44.700
 Are you skeptical to the level of support

28:44.700 --> 28:46.820
 that the United States is providing

28:46.820 --> 28:49.980
 and is going to provide over time?

28:49.980 --> 28:51.620
 The strategy that the United States has taken

28:51.620 --> 28:54.140
 to support Ukraine is similar to the strategy we took

28:54.140 --> 28:56.340
 to support Great Britain during World War II.

28:57.460 --> 28:58.660
 The enactment of the Lend Lease Act

28:58.660 --> 28:59.980
 is a perfect example of that.

28:59.980 --> 29:02.620
 The Lend Lease Act means that we are lending

29:02.620 --> 29:06.020
 or leasing equipment to the Ukrainian government

29:06.020 --> 29:07.900
 in exchange for future payment.

29:07.900 --> 29:09.940
 So every time a rocket is launched,

29:09.940 --> 29:12.260
 every time a drone crashes into a tank,

29:12.260 --> 29:17.260
 that's a bill that Ukraine is just racking up.

29:17.820 --> 29:18.820
 It's like when you go to a restaurant

29:18.820 --> 29:20.300
 and you start drinking shots.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.700
 Sometime the bill will come due.

29:22.700 --> 29:25.460
 This is exactly what we did when Europe

29:25.460 --> 29:29.340
 and when Great Britain was in the face of a Nazi invasion.

29:29.340 --> 29:31.260
 We signed the same thing into motion.

29:31.260 --> 29:34.260
 Do you know that the UK did not pay off the debt

29:34.260 --> 29:37.140
 from World War II until 2020?

29:37.140 --> 29:41.300
 They've been paying that debt since the end of World War II.

29:41.300 --> 29:44.620
 So what we're doing is we're indebting Ukraine

29:44.620 --> 29:46.780
 against the promise that perhaps

29:46.780 --> 29:48.140
 they will secure their freedom,

29:48.140 --> 29:49.700
 which nobody seems to wanna talk about

29:49.700 --> 29:52.340
 what freedom is actually gonna look like for Ukrainians.

29:52.340 --> 29:54.900
 What are the true handful of outcomes,

29:54.900 --> 29:56.700
 the realistic outcomes that could come of this

29:56.700 --> 29:59.620
 and which of those outcomes really looks like freedom

29:59.620 --> 30:02.060
 to them, especially in the face of the fact

30:02.060 --> 30:04.860
 that they're going to be trillions of dollars in debt

30:04.860 --> 30:08.940
 to the West for supplying them with the training

30:08.940 --> 30:10.900
 and the weapons and the food and the med kits

30:10.900 --> 30:12.300
 and everything else that we're giving them

30:12.300 --> 30:13.980
 because none of it's free.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.100
 It's all coming due.

30:16.100 --> 30:19.900
 We're a democracy, but we're also a capitalist country.

30:19.900 --> 30:22.700
 We can't afford to just give things away for free,

30:22.700 --> 30:24.340
 but we can give things away at a discount.

30:24.340 --> 30:26.540
 We can give things away, lay away,

30:26.540 --> 30:28.380
 but the bill will come due.

30:28.380 --> 30:30.980
 And unfortunately that is not part of the conversation

30:30.980 --> 30:32.420
 that's being had with the American people.

30:32.420 --> 30:36.900
 So debt is a way to establish some level of control.

30:36.900 --> 30:39.260
 Power is power.

30:39.260 --> 30:43.660
 That said, having a very close relationship

30:43.660 --> 30:44.940
 between Ukraine and the United States

30:44.940 --> 30:49.940
 does not seem to be a negative possibility

30:50.620 --> 30:52.500
 when the Ukrainians think about their future

30:52.500 --> 30:53.540
 in terms of freedom.

30:53.540 --> 30:54.380
 That's one thing.

30:54.380 --> 30:57.340
 And the other, there's some aspect of this war

30:57.340 --> 31:01.020
 that I've just noticed that one of the people I talked to

31:01.020 --> 31:06.020
 said that all great nations have a independence war,

31:08.140 --> 31:10.140
 have to have a war for their independence.

31:10.140 --> 31:12.220
 In order, there's something, it's dark,

31:12.220 --> 31:16.220
 but there's something about war just being a catalyst

31:16.220 --> 31:18.860
 for finding your own identity as a nation.

31:18.860 --> 31:21.540
 So you can have leaders, you can have sort of

31:21.540 --> 31:23.780
 signed documents, you can have all this kind of stuff,

31:23.780 --> 31:24.940
 but there's something about war

31:24.940 --> 31:26.820
 that really brings the country together

31:26.820 --> 31:29.860
 and actually try to figure out what is at the core

31:29.860 --> 31:32.820
 of the spirit of the people that defines this country.

31:32.820 --> 31:36.540
 And they see this war as that,

31:36.540 --> 31:38.500
 as the independence war to define the heart

31:38.500 --> 31:39.340
 of what the country is.

31:39.340 --> 31:42.860
 So there's been before the war, before this invasion,

31:43.780 --> 31:46.300
 there was a lot of factions in the country.

31:46.300 --> 31:50.420
 There was a lot of influence from oligarchs

31:50.420 --> 31:51.940
 and corruption and so on.

31:51.940 --> 31:56.180
 A lot of that was the factions were brought together

31:56.180 --> 31:59.980
 under one umbrella effectively to become one nation

31:59.980 --> 32:01.420
 because of this invasion.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.740
 So they see that as a positive direction

32:04.740 --> 32:09.740
 for the defining of what a free democratic country

32:10.300 --> 32:12.020
 looks like after the war,

32:12.020 --> 32:14.740
 in their perspective after the war is won.

32:14.740 --> 32:19.220
 It's a difficult situation because I'm trying to make sure

32:19.220 --> 32:22.140
 that you and all, everybody listening understands

32:22.140 --> 32:25.420
 that what's happening in Ukraine, among Ukrainians,

32:25.420 --> 32:29.140
 is noble and brave and courageous

32:29.140 --> 32:33.220
 and beyond the expectations of anyone.

32:35.500 --> 32:38.860
 The fact is there is no material support

32:38.860 --> 32:40.100
 coming from the outside.

32:40.100 --> 32:43.020
 The American Revolution was won

32:43.020 --> 32:44.620
 because of French involvement.

32:44.620 --> 32:47.900
 French ships, French troops, French generals,

32:47.900 --> 32:49.700
 French military might.

32:49.700 --> 32:55.500
 The independence of communist China was won

32:55.500 --> 32:57.740
 through Russian support, Russian generals,

32:57.740 --> 33:01.020
 Russian troops on the ground fighting with the communists.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.660
 That's how revolutions are won.

33:03.660 --> 33:06.340
 That's how independent countries are born.

33:06.340 --> 33:08.340
 Ukraine doesn't get any of that.

33:08.340 --> 33:10.020
 No one is stepping into that

33:10.020 --> 33:14.020
 because we live in a world right now

33:14.020 --> 33:17.780
 where there simply is no economic benefits

33:17.780 --> 33:21.580
 to the parties in power to support Ukraine to that level.

33:21.580 --> 33:24.500
 And war is a game of economics.

33:24.500 --> 33:28.900
 The economic benefit of Ukraine is crystal clear

33:28.900 --> 33:31.420
 in favor of Russia, which is why Putin cannot lose.

33:31.420 --> 33:33.540
 He will not let himself lose.

33:33.540 --> 33:36.580
 Short of something completely unexpected, right?

33:36.580 --> 33:40.100
 I'm talking 60%, 70% probability, Ukraine loses.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.540
 But there's still 20%, 30% probability

33:42.540 --> 33:44.700
 of the unimaginable happening.

33:44.700 --> 33:45.860
 Who knows what that might be?

33:45.860 --> 33:48.060
 An oligarch assassinates Putin

33:48.060 --> 33:50.500
 or a nuclear bomb goes off somewhere

33:50.500 --> 33:52.940
 or who knows what, right?

33:52.940 --> 33:53.940
 There's still a chance

33:53.940 --> 33:55.540
 that something unexpected will happen

33:55.540 --> 33:57.580
 and change the tide of the war.

33:57.580 --> 34:01.580
 But when it comes down to the core calculus here,

34:01.580 --> 34:06.260
 Ukraine is the agricultural bed to support a future Russia.

34:06.260 --> 34:09.580
 Russia knows, they know they have to have Ukraine.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.740
 They know that they have to have it to protect themselves

34:11.740 --> 34:13.540
 against military pressure from the West.

34:13.540 --> 34:15.620
 They have to have it for agricultural reasons.

34:15.620 --> 34:20.100
 They have major oil and natural gas pipelines

34:20.100 --> 34:22.620
 that flow through Eastern Ukraine.

34:22.620 --> 34:25.500
 They cannot let Ukraine fall

34:25.500 --> 34:27.220
 outside of their sphere of influence.

34:27.220 --> 34:28.420
 They cannot.

34:28.420 --> 34:31.060
 The United States doesn't really have

34:31.060 --> 34:33.620
 any economic vested interest in Ukraine.

34:33.620 --> 34:37.740
 Ideological points of view and promises aside,

34:37.740 --> 34:39.220
 there's no economic benefit.

34:39.220 --> 34:41.260
 And the same thing goes for NATO.

34:41.260 --> 34:44.420
 NATO has no economic investment in Ukraine.

34:44.420 --> 34:49.180
 Ukrainian output, Ukrainian food

34:49.180 --> 34:51.060
 goes to the Middle East and Africa.

34:51.060 --> 34:53.780
 It doesn't go to Europe.

34:53.780 --> 34:58.260
 So the whole, the West siding with Ukraine

34:58.260 --> 35:00.340
 is exclusively ideological

35:00.340 --> 35:02.420
 and it's putting them in a place

35:02.420 --> 35:04.100
 where they fight a war with Russia

35:04.100 --> 35:06.540
 so the whole world can see Russia's capabilities.

35:06.540 --> 35:09.660
 Ukraine is a, as sad as it is to say, man,

35:09.660 --> 35:14.660
 Ukraine is a pawn on a table for superpowers

35:14.660 --> 35:17.420
 to calculate each other's capacities.

35:17.420 --> 35:19.660
 Right now we've only talked about Russia and the United States.

35:19.660 --> 35:21.140
 We haven't even talked about Iran.

35:21.140 --> 35:23.740
 We haven't even talked about China, right?

35:23.740 --> 35:24.980
 It is a pawn on a table.

35:24.980 --> 35:27.340
 This is a chicken fight so that people get to watch

35:27.340 --> 35:29.620
 and see what the other trainers are doing.

35:29.620 --> 35:31.580
 Well, a lot of people might've said the same thing

35:31.580 --> 35:34.140
 about the United States back in the independence fight.

35:34.140 --> 35:38.420
 So there is possibilities, as you've said.

35:38.420 --> 35:41.900
 We're not saying a 0% chance

35:41.900 --> 35:44.580
 and it could be a reasonably high percent chance

35:44.580 --> 35:48.060
 that this becomes one of the great democratic nations

35:48.060 --> 35:50.140
 that the 21st century is remembered by.

35:50.140 --> 35:50.980
 Absolutely.

35:50.980 --> 35:55.100
 And so you said American support.

35:55.100 --> 35:57.580
 So ideologically, first of all,

35:57.580 --> 36:02.580
 you don't assign much longterm power to that.

36:03.180 --> 36:05.980
 That US could support Ukraine

36:05.980 --> 36:09.140
 purely on ideological grounds.

36:09.140 --> 36:12.820
 Just look in the last four years, the last three years.

36:12.820 --> 36:14.460
 Do you remember what happened in Hong Kong

36:14.460 --> 36:15.460
 right before COVID?

36:16.860 --> 36:20.500
 China swooped into Hong Kong violently,

36:21.540 --> 36:23.820
 beating protesters, killing them in the street,

36:23.820 --> 36:26.700
 imprisoning people without just cause.

36:26.700 --> 36:28.860
 And Hong Kong was a democracy

36:30.060 --> 36:32.580
 and the whole world stood by and let it happen.

36:32.580 --> 36:35.580
 And then what happened in Afghanistan just a year ago

36:35.580 --> 36:37.740
 and the whole world stood by

36:37.740 --> 36:39.580
 and let the Taliban take power again

36:39.580 --> 36:41.700
 after 20 years of loss.

36:41.700 --> 36:46.420
 This, we are showing a repeatable point of view.

36:46.420 --> 36:47.700
 We will talk.

36:47.700 --> 36:50.900
 American politicians, American administrations,

36:50.900 --> 36:52.940
 we will say a lot of things.

36:52.940 --> 36:56.340
 We will promise a lot of ideological pro democracy,

36:56.340 --> 36:58.420
 rah rah statements.

36:58.420 --> 36:59.820
 We will say it.

36:59.820 --> 37:02.740
 But when it comes down to putting our own people,

37:02.740 --> 37:07.260
 our own economy, our own GDP at risk,

37:07.260 --> 37:09.260
 we step away from that fight.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.500
 America is currently supplying

37:11.500 --> 37:13.060
 military equipment to Ukraine.

37:13.060 --> 37:13.900
 Absolutely.

37:13.900 --> 37:14.980
 And a lot of that military equipment

37:14.980 --> 37:17.500
 has actually been the thing that turned

37:17.500 --> 37:20.540
 the tides of war a couple of times already.

37:20.540 --> 37:22.620
 Currently that's the high mar systems.

37:23.500 --> 37:27.700
 So you mentioned sort of Putin can't afford to lose,

37:27.700 --> 37:29.980
 but winning can look in different ways.

37:29.980 --> 37:32.180
 So you've kind of defined so on.

37:32.180 --> 37:35.980
 At this moment, the prediction is that winning

37:35.980 --> 37:38.860
 looks like capturing not just the east,

37:38.860 --> 37:41.260
 but the south of Ukraine.

37:41.260 --> 37:44.540
 But you can have narratives of winning

37:44.540 --> 37:48.820
 that return back to what was at the beginning of this year

37:48.820 --> 37:49.820
 before the invasion.

37:49.820 --> 37:50.660
 Correct.

37:50.660 --> 37:53.820
 That Crimea is still with Russia.

37:53.820 --> 37:56.660
 There's some kind of negotiated thing about Donbass

37:56.660 --> 37:58.140
 where it still stays with Ukraine,

37:58.140 --> 37:59.580
 but there's some.

37:59.580 --> 38:00.420
 Puppet government.

38:00.420 --> 38:01.260
 Yeah.

38:01.260 --> 38:03.740
 Just like that's what they have in Georgia right now.

38:03.740 --> 38:07.300
 And that could still be defined through mechanisms.

38:07.300 --> 38:08.340
 As Russia winning.

38:08.340 --> 38:11.020
 As Russia winning for Russia and then for Ukraine

38:11.020 --> 38:16.020
 as Ukraine winning and for the west as democracy winning

38:16.980 --> 38:19.060
 and you kind of negotiate.

38:19.060 --> 38:22.260
 I mean, that seems to be how geopolitics works

38:22.260 --> 38:25.860
 is everybody can walk away with a win win story

38:25.860 --> 38:28.980
 and then the world progresses with the lessons learned.

38:28.980 --> 38:29.860
 That's the high likely.

38:29.860 --> 38:31.580
 That's the most probable outcome.

38:31.580 --> 38:35.820
 The most probable outcome is that Ukraine remains

38:35.820 --> 38:38.820
 in air quotes, a sovereign nation.

38:38.820 --> 38:41.380
 It's not going to be truly sovereign

38:41.380 --> 38:43.540
 because it will become,

38:43.540 --> 38:47.460
 it will have to have new government put in place.

38:47.460 --> 38:50.660
 Zelinsky will, it's extremely unlikely he will be president

38:50.660 --> 38:55.460
 because he has gone too far to demonstrate his power

38:55.460 --> 38:58.140
 over the people and his ability to separate

38:58.140 --> 39:02.420
 the Ukrainian people from the autocratic power of Russia.

39:02.420 --> 39:06.420
 So he would have to be unseated whether he goes into exile

39:06.420 --> 39:09.380
 or whether he is peacefully left alone

39:09.380 --> 39:11.100
 is all gonna be part of negotiations.

39:11.100 --> 39:14.220
 But the thing to keep in mind also is that

39:14.220 --> 39:17.740
 a negotiated peace really just means a negotiated ceasefire.

39:17.740 --> 39:19.060
 We've seen this happen all over the world.

39:19.060 --> 39:20.780
 North Korea and South Korea are technically still

39:20.780 --> 39:23.060
 just in negotiated cease power.

39:23.060 --> 39:27.140
 What you end up having is Russia will allow Ukraine

39:27.140 --> 39:29.620
 to call itself Ukraine, to operate independently,

39:29.620 --> 39:32.020
 to have their own debt to the United States.

39:32.020 --> 39:34.420
 Russia doesn't wanna take on that debt.

39:34.420 --> 39:36.660
 And then in exchange for that,

39:36.660 --> 39:38.700
 they will have firmer guidelines

39:38.700 --> 39:41.660
 as to how NATO can engage with Ukraine.

39:41.660 --> 39:43.140
 And then that becomes an example

39:43.140 --> 39:45.180
 for all the other former Soviet satellite states,

39:45.180 --> 39:48.100
 which are all required economically by Russia,

39:48.100 --> 39:50.660
 not required economically by the West.

39:51.660 --> 39:53.780
 And then you end up seeing how it just,

39:53.780 --> 39:55.460
 you can see how the whole thing plays out

39:55.460 --> 39:59.260
 once you realize that the keystone is Ukraine.

40:00.140 --> 40:02.100
 There is something about Ukraine,

40:02.100 --> 40:05.500
 the deep support by the Ukrainian people of America

40:05.500 --> 40:09.780
 that is in contrast with, for example, Afghanistan,

40:10.860 --> 40:14.100
 that it seems like ideologically,

40:14.100 --> 40:17.180
 Ukraine could be a beacon of freedom

40:17.180 --> 40:20.180
 used in narratives by the United States

40:20.180 --> 40:24.180
 to fight geopolitical wars in that part of the world,

40:24.180 --> 40:26.100
 that they would be a good partner

40:26.100 --> 40:28.940
 for this idea of democracy, of freedom,

40:28.940 --> 40:31.500
 of all the values that America stands for.

40:31.500 --> 40:32.780
 They're a good partner.

40:32.780 --> 40:35.100
 And so it's valuable,

40:35.100 --> 40:38.740
 if you sort of have a cynical, pragmatic view,

40:38.740 --> 40:41.500
 sort of like Henry Kissinger type of view,

40:41.500 --> 40:43.900
 it's valuable to have them as a partner,

40:43.900 --> 40:47.380
 so valuable that it makes sense to support them

40:47.380 --> 40:50.100
 in achieving a negotiated ceasefire

40:50.100 --> 40:51.980
 that's on the side of Ukraine.

40:51.980 --> 40:54.420
 But because of this particular leader,

40:54.420 --> 40:56.220
 this particular culture,

40:56.220 --> 41:00.540
 this particular dynamics of how the war unrolled

41:00.540 --> 41:02.580
 and things like Twitter

41:02.580 --> 41:05.100
 and the way digital communication currently works,

41:05.100 --> 41:08.060
 it just seems like this is a powerful symbol of freedom

41:08.060 --> 41:09.900
 that's useful for the United States

41:09.900 --> 41:12.660
 if we're sort of to take the pragmatic view.

41:12.660 --> 41:16.460
 Don't you think it's possible

41:16.460 --> 41:20.500
 that United States supports Ukraine

41:20.500 --> 41:22.660
 financially, militarily enough

41:22.660 --> 41:25.220
 for it to get an advantage in this war?

41:25.220 --> 41:27.340
 I think they've already gotten advantage in the war.

41:27.340 --> 41:28.820
 The fact that the war is still going on

41:28.820 --> 41:30.820
 demonstrates the asymmetrical advantage.

41:30.820 --> 41:33.420
 The fact that Russia has stepped up

41:33.420 --> 41:36.460
 to the negotiating table with them several times

41:36.460 --> 41:41.180
 without just turning to Chechen,

41:41.180 --> 41:43.180
 I mean, you remember what happened in Chechnya,

41:43.180 --> 41:45.060
 without turning to Chechnya level,

41:45.060 --> 41:48.540
 just mass blind destruction,

41:48.540 --> 41:51.540
 which was another Putin war.

41:51.540 --> 41:53.180
 To see that those things have happened

41:53.180 --> 41:54.860
 demonstrates the asymmetric advantage

41:54.860 --> 41:56.140
 that the West has given.

41:56.140 --> 42:01.820
 I think the true way to look at the benefit of Ukraine

42:01.820 --> 42:06.740
 as a shining example of freedom in Europe for the West

42:06.740 --> 42:08.980
 isn't to understand whether or not they could.

42:08.980 --> 42:10.620
 They absolutely could.

42:10.620 --> 42:14.940
 It's the question of how valuable is that in Europe?

42:14.940 --> 42:16.740
 How valuable is Ukraine?

42:16.740 --> 42:22.380
 Which before February, nobody even thought about Ukraine.

42:22.380 --> 42:24.380
 And the people who did know about Ukraine

42:24.380 --> 42:28.900
 knew that it was an extremely corrupt former Soviet state

42:28.900 --> 42:30.940
 with 20% of its national population

42:30.940 --> 42:33.660
 self identifying as Russian.

42:33.660 --> 42:35.460
 There's a reason Putin went into Ukraine.

42:35.460 --> 42:37.020
 There's a reason he's been promising

42:37.020 --> 42:40.540
 he would go into Ukraine for the better part of a decade.

42:40.540 --> 42:43.660
 Because the circumstances were aligned,

42:43.660 --> 42:45.580
 it was a corrupt country that self identified

42:45.580 --> 42:47.420
 as Russian in many ways.

42:47.420 --> 42:51.980
 It was supposed to be an easier of multiple marks

42:51.980 --> 42:55.900
 in terms of the former Soviet satellite states to go after.

42:55.900 --> 42:57.940
 That's all part of the miscalculation

42:57.940 --> 42:59.860
 that the rest of the world saw too

42:59.860 --> 43:02.860
 when we thought it would fall quickly.

43:02.860 --> 43:05.900
 So to think that it could be a shining example of freedom

43:05.900 --> 43:06.980
 is accurate.

43:06.980 --> 43:10.220
 But is it as shining a star as Germany?

43:10.220 --> 43:11.940
 Is it as shining a star as the UK?

43:11.940 --> 43:13.940
 Is it as shining a star as Romania?

43:13.940 --> 43:17.860
 Is it as shiny a star as France?

43:17.860 --> 43:22.380
 It's got a lot of democratic freedom based countries

43:22.380 --> 43:23.660
 in Europe to compete against

43:23.660 --> 43:26.780
 to be the shining stellar example.

43:26.780 --> 43:29.900
 And in exchange, on counterpoint to that,

43:29.900 --> 43:33.540
 it has an extreme amount of strategic value to Russia

43:33.540 --> 43:36.060
 which has no interest in making it a shining star

43:36.060 --> 43:38.460
 of the example of democracy and freedom.

43:38.460 --> 43:41.700
 Outside of research in terms of the shininess of the star,

43:41.700 --> 43:43.060
 I would argue yes.

43:43.060 --> 43:45.140
 If you look at how much it captivated

43:45.140 --> 43:46.460
 the attention of the world.

43:46.460 --> 43:47.300
 The attention of the world

43:47.300 --> 43:49.020
 has made no material difference, man.

43:49.020 --> 43:50.300
 That's what I'm saying.

43:50.300 --> 43:53.580
 That's your estimation, but are you sure we can,

43:53.580 --> 43:58.580
 we can't, if you can convert that into political influence

43:59.060 --> 44:03.500
 into money, don't you think attention is money?

44:03.500 --> 44:07.500
 Attention is money in democracies and capitalist countries.

44:07.500 --> 44:08.340
 Yes.

44:08.340 --> 44:09.460
 Which serves as a counterweight

44:09.460 --> 44:11.420
 to sort of authoritarian regimes.

44:11.420 --> 44:14.460
 So for Putin, resources matter.

44:14.460 --> 44:16.500
 For the United States, also resources matter,

44:16.500 --> 44:21.220
 but the attention and the belief of the people also matter

44:21.220 --> 44:24.660
 because that's how you attain and maintain political power.

44:24.660 --> 44:26.940
 So going to that exact example,

44:26.940 --> 44:29.340
 then I would highlight that our current administration

44:29.340 --> 44:33.620
 has the lowest approval ratings of any president in history.

44:33.620 --> 44:36.740
 So if people were very fond of the war going on in Ukraine,

44:36.740 --> 44:39.220
 wouldn't that counterbalance some of our upset,

44:39.220 --> 44:41.980
 some of the dissent coming from the economy

44:41.980 --> 44:45.780
 and some of the dissent coming from the great recession

44:45.780 --> 44:48.620
 or the second great, or the great resignation

44:48.620 --> 44:49.980
 and whatever's happening with the draw

44:49.980 --> 44:51.380
 with the down stock market?

44:51.380 --> 44:52.540
 You would think that people would feel

44:52.540 --> 44:54.620
 like they're sacrificing for something

44:54.620 --> 44:57.940
 if they really believed that Ukraine mattered,

44:57.940 --> 45:00.300
 that they would stand next to the president

45:00.300 --> 45:05.060
 who is so staunchly driving and leading the West

45:05.060 --> 45:06.780
 against this conflict.

45:06.780 --> 45:09.780
 Well, I think the opposition to this particular president,

45:09.780 --> 45:12.660
 I personally believe has less to do with the policies

45:12.660 --> 45:16.940
 and more to do with a lot of the other human factors.

45:19.220 --> 45:20.860
 But again, empirically, this is,

45:20.860 --> 45:22.980
 I look at things through a very empirical lens,

45:22.980 --> 45:26.900
 a very cold fact based lens.

45:26.900 --> 45:29.500
 And there are multiple data points that suggest

45:29.500 --> 45:32.420
 that the American people ideologically sympathize

45:32.420 --> 45:34.420
 with Ukraine, but they really just want

45:34.420 --> 45:36.020
 their gas prices to go down.

45:36.020 --> 45:38.180
 They really just want to be able to pay less money

45:38.180 --> 45:39.940
 at the grocery store for their food.

45:39.940 --> 45:41.700
 And they most definitely don't want their sons

45:41.700 --> 45:45.220
 and daughters to die in exchange for Ukrainian freedom.

45:46.100 --> 45:47.900
 It does hurt me to see the politicization

45:47.900 --> 45:48.980
 of this war as well.

45:50.340 --> 45:54.940
 I think that maybe has to do with the kind of calculation

45:54.940 --> 45:58.700
 you're referring to, but it seems like it doesn't.

45:58.700 --> 46:00.660
 It seems like there's a cynical,

46:00.660 --> 46:05.180
 whatever takes attention of the media for the moment,

46:05.180 --> 46:07.100
 the red team chooses one side

46:07.100 --> 46:08.940
 and the blue team chooses another.

46:08.940 --> 46:12.260
 And then I think, correct me if I'm wrong,

46:12.260 --> 46:17.260
 but I believe the Democrats went into full support

46:17.380 --> 46:20.100
 of Ukraine on the ideological side.

46:20.100 --> 46:22.180
 And then I guess Republicans are saying,

46:22.180 --> 46:23.220
 why are we wasting money?

46:23.220 --> 46:25.860
 The gas prices are going up.

46:25.860 --> 46:27.660
 That's a very crude kind of analysis,

46:27.660 --> 46:29.740
 but they basically picked whatever argument

46:29.740 --> 46:33.660
 on whatever side, and now more and more and more,

46:33.660 --> 46:37.260
 this particular war in Ukraine is becoming

46:37.260 --> 46:40.060
 a kind of pawn in the game of politics

46:40.060 --> 46:42.700
 that's first the midterm elections,

46:42.700 --> 46:44.900
 then building up towards the presidential elections,

46:44.900 --> 46:49.900
 and stops being about the philosophical, the social,

46:49.940 --> 46:53.780
 the geopolitical aspects, parameters of this war,

46:53.780 --> 46:55.900
 and more about just like whatever the heck

46:55.900 --> 46:58.900
 captivates Twitter, and we're gonna use that for politics.

46:58.900 --> 47:02.340
 You're right in the sense of the fact that it's,

47:02.340 --> 47:03.940
 I wouldn't say that the red team and the blue team

47:03.940 --> 47:05.300
 picked opposite sides on this.

47:05.300 --> 47:08.860
 What I would say is that media discovered

47:08.860 --> 47:12.300
 that talking about Ukraine wasn't as profitable

47:12.300 --> 47:13.980
 as talking about something else.

47:13.980 --> 47:17.580
 People simply, the American people who read media

47:17.580 --> 47:20.820
 or who watch media, they simply became bored

47:20.820 --> 47:23.940
 reading about news that didn't seem to be changing much.

47:23.940 --> 47:26.540
 And we turned back into wanting to read

47:26.540 --> 47:28.460
 about our own economy, and we wanted to hear more

47:28.460 --> 47:30.060
 about cryptocurrency, and we wanted to hear more

47:30.060 --> 47:32.380
 about the Kardashians, and that's what we care about,

47:32.380 --> 47:33.820
 so that's what media writes about.

47:33.820 --> 47:37.380
 That's how a capitalist market driven world works,

47:37.380 --> 47:38.380
 and that's how the United States works.

47:38.380 --> 47:41.100
 That's why in both red papers and blue papers,

47:41.100 --> 47:42.700
 red sources and blue sources,

47:42.700 --> 47:44.620
 you don't see Ukraine being mentioned very much.

47:44.620 --> 47:47.180
 If anything, I would say that your Republicans

47:47.180 --> 47:49.340
 are probably more in support of what's happening

47:49.340 --> 47:51.340
 in Ukraine right now, because we're creating

47:51.340 --> 47:53.660
 new weapon systems, our military is getting stronger,

47:53.660 --> 47:57.660
 we're sending these, we get to test military systems

47:57.660 --> 48:02.060
 in combat in Ukraine, that's priceless.

48:02.060 --> 48:05.340
 In the world of the military industrial complex,

48:05.340 --> 48:10.020
 being able to field test, combat test a weapon

48:10.020 --> 48:12.500
 without having to sacrifice your own people

48:12.500 --> 48:13.660
 is incredibly valuable.

48:13.660 --> 48:15.740
 You get all the data, you get all the performance metrics,

48:15.740 --> 48:17.540
 but you don't have to put yourself at risk.

48:17.540 --> 48:21.100
 That is one of the major benefits of what we're seeing

48:21.100 --> 48:23.700
 from supporting Ukraine with weapons and with troops.

48:23.700 --> 48:26.540
 The longterm benefit to what will come of this

48:26.540 --> 48:30.780
 for the United States, practically speaking,

48:30.780 --> 48:32.740
 in the lens of national security,

48:32.740 --> 48:34.420
 through military readiness,

48:34.420 --> 48:38.540
 through future economic benefits, those are super strong.

48:38.540 --> 48:42.180
 The geopolitical fight is essentially moot,

48:42.180 --> 48:45.100
 because Ukraine is not a geopolitical player.

48:45.100 --> 48:50.100
 It was not for 70 years, and after this conflict is over,

48:50.220 --> 48:51.420
 it will not again.

48:51.420 --> 48:53.260
 Just think about what you were just saying

48:53.260 --> 48:55.500
 with the American people's attention span

48:55.500 --> 48:57.300
 to Twitter and whatever's currently going on.

48:57.300 --> 49:00.500
 If the Ukraine conflict resolved itself today

49:00.500 --> 49:04.460
 in any direction, how many weeks do you think

49:04.460 --> 49:06.260
 before no one talked about Ukraine anymore?

49:06.260 --> 49:07.780
 Do you think we would make it two weeks?

49:07.780 --> 49:09.540
 Or do you think we'd make it maybe seven days?

49:09.540 --> 49:11.780
 It would be headline news for one or two days,

49:13.140 --> 49:15.020
 and then we'd be onto something else.

49:15.020 --> 49:17.700
 It's just an unfortunate reality

49:17.700 --> 49:21.980
 of how the world works in a capitalist democracy.

49:21.980 --> 49:26.980
 Yeah, it just breaks my heart how much,

49:27.540 --> 49:30.740
 you know, I know that there's Yemen and Syria

49:30.740 --> 49:33.740
 and that nobody talks about anymore.

49:33.740 --> 49:35.600
 Still raging conflicts going on.

49:37.460 --> 49:42.300
 It breaks my heart how much generational hatred is born.

49:42.300 --> 49:46.820
 I happen to be from, my family is from Ukraine

49:46.820 --> 49:49.580
 and from Russia, and so for me, just personally,

49:49.580 --> 49:51.860
 it's a part of the world I care about.

49:51.860 --> 49:56.860
 In terms of its history, because I speak the language,

49:56.940 --> 49:58.940
 I can appreciate the beauty of the literature,

49:58.940 --> 50:01.420
 the music, the art, the cultural history

50:01.420 --> 50:04.560
 of the 20th century through all the dark times,

50:04.560 --> 50:09.000
 through all the hell of the dark sides

50:09.000 --> 50:12.260
 of authoritarian regimes, the destruction of war.

50:12.260 --> 50:14.420
 There's still just the beauty that I'm able to appreciate

50:14.420 --> 50:17.700
 that I can't appreciate about China, Brazil,

50:17.700 --> 50:19.700
 other countries because I don't speak their language.

50:19.700 --> 50:20.900
 This one I can appreciate.

50:20.900 --> 50:24.460
 And so in that way, this is personally really painful to me

50:24.460 --> 50:28.520
 to see so much of that history, the beauty in that history

50:28.520 --> 50:31.020
 suffocated by the hatred that is born

50:31.020 --> 50:34.980
 through this kind of geopolitical game

50:36.240 --> 50:39.980
 fought mostly by the politicians, the leaders.

50:39.980 --> 50:42.840
 People are beautiful, and that's what you're talking about.

50:42.840 --> 50:47.220
 People are just, people are beautiful creatures.

50:47.220 --> 50:52.160
 Culture and art and science,

50:52.160 --> 50:53.700
 these are beautiful, beautiful things

50:53.700 --> 50:55.900
 that come about because of human beings.

50:55.900 --> 50:58.980
 And the thing that gives me hope is that

51:00.260 --> 51:02.600
 no matter what conflict the world has seen,

51:02.600 --> 51:04.540
 and we've seen some devastating,

51:04.540 --> 51:07.360
 horrible crimes against humanity already.

51:07.360 --> 51:10.060
 We saw nuclear bombs go off in Japan.

51:10.060 --> 51:13.780
 We saw genocide happen in Rwanda.

51:13.780 --> 51:16.300
 We've seen horrible things happen.

51:16.300 --> 51:18.260
 But people persevere.

51:18.260 --> 51:21.420
 Language, culture, arts, science, they all persevere.

51:21.420 --> 51:23.600
 They all shine through.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.420
 Some of the most, people don't even realize

51:25.420 --> 51:27.940
 how gorgeous the architecture and the culture is

51:27.940 --> 51:29.060
 inside Iran.

51:29.060 --> 51:30.160
 People have no idea.

51:31.600 --> 51:35.820
 Chinese people in the rural parts of China

51:35.820 --> 51:38.360
 are some of the kindest, most amazing people

51:38.360 --> 51:39.580
 you'll ever meet.

51:39.580 --> 51:44.580
 And Korean art and Korean dance, Korean drumming,

51:44.580 --> 51:47.300
 I know nobody has ever even heard of Korean drumming.

51:47.300 --> 51:50.380
 Korean drumming is this magical, beautiful thing.

51:50.380 --> 51:53.020
 And the North, in North Korea, does it better

51:53.020 --> 51:54.460
 than anybody in the world.

51:54.460 --> 51:57.780
 Taekwondo in North Korea is just exceptional to watch.

51:57.780 --> 51:58.620
 In North Korea?

51:58.620 --> 51:59.500
 In North Korea.

51:59.500 --> 52:00.340
 Nobody knows these things.

52:00.340 --> 52:02.380
 How do you know about Taekwondo in North Korea?

52:02.380 --> 52:03.220
 I have questions.

52:04.660 --> 52:05.500
 That's fascinating.

52:05.500 --> 52:08.180
 That's, people don't think about that,

52:08.180 --> 52:09.820
 but the culture, the beauty of the people

52:09.820 --> 52:11.860
 still flourishes even in the toughest of places.

52:11.860 --> 52:13.700
 Absolutely, and we always will.

52:13.700 --> 52:16.340
 We always will because that is what people do.

52:16.340 --> 52:18.500
 And that is just the truth of it.

52:18.500 --> 52:21.140
 And it breaks my heart to see travesties

52:21.140 --> 52:23.860
 that people commit against people.

52:23.860 --> 52:26.460
 But whether you're looking at a micro level,

52:26.460 --> 52:30.100
 like what happens with shootings here in the United States,

52:30.100 --> 52:31.900
 or whether you look at a macro level,

52:31.900 --> 52:35.020
 like geopolitical power exchanges

52:35.020 --> 52:37.540
 and intra and interstate conflicts,

52:37.540 --> 52:40.400
 like what you see in Syria and what you see in Ukraine,

52:40.400 --> 52:42.180
 those are disgusting, terrible things.

52:42.180 --> 52:43.820
 War is a terrible thing.

52:43.820 --> 52:45.340
 That is a famous quote.

52:47.060 --> 52:49.780
 But people will persevere.

52:49.780 --> 52:52.060
 People will come through.

52:53.100 --> 52:54.300
 I hope so.

52:54.300 --> 52:55.540
 I hope so.

52:55.540 --> 52:58.100
 And I hope we don't do something

52:59.980 --> 53:03.300
 that I'll probably also ask you about later on

53:03.300 --> 53:08.180
 is things that destroy the possibility of perseverance,

53:08.180 --> 53:09.860
 which is things like nuclear war,

53:09.860 --> 53:14.300
 things that can do such tremendous damage

53:14.300 --> 53:17.060
 that we will never recover.

53:17.060 --> 53:21.060
 But yeah, amidst your pragmatic pessimism,

53:22.100 --> 53:24.660
 I think both you and I have a kind of

53:24.660 --> 53:27.020
 maybe small flame of optimism in there

53:27.020 --> 53:30.540
 about the perseverance of the human species in general.

53:30.540 --> 53:33.800
 Let me ask you about intelligence agencies

53:33.800 --> 53:35.240
 outside of the CIA.

53:35.240 --> 53:40.240
 Can you illuminate what is the most powerful

53:41.500 --> 53:43.880
 intelligence agency in the world?

53:43.880 --> 53:48.720
 The CIA, the FSB, formerly the KGB, the MI6, Mossad.

53:49.620 --> 53:52.860
 I've gotten a chance to interact with a lot of Israelis

53:52.860 --> 53:54.180
 while in Ukraine.

53:54.180 --> 53:56.380
 Just incredible people.

53:56.380 --> 53:58.180
 Yeah, in terms of both training and skill,

53:58.180 --> 54:00.080
 just every front.

54:00.080 --> 54:04.220
 American soldiers too, just American military is incredible.

54:04.220 --> 54:07.400
 I just, the competence and skill of the military,

54:08.500 --> 54:10.980
 the United States, Israeli I got to interact,

54:10.980 --> 54:12.560
 and Ukrainian as well.

54:12.560 --> 54:13.400
 It's striking.

54:13.400 --> 54:14.420
 It's striking, it's beautiful.

54:14.420 --> 54:16.860
 I just love people, I love carpenters,

54:16.860 --> 54:19.300
 or people that are just extremely good at their job

54:19.300 --> 54:21.400
 and then take pride in their craftsmanship.

54:21.400 --> 54:22.780
 It's beautiful to see.

54:22.780 --> 54:24.580
 And I imagine the same kind of thing happens

54:24.580 --> 54:27.260
 inside of intelligence agencies as well

54:27.260 --> 54:29.940
 that we don't get to appreciate because of the secrecy.

54:29.940 --> 54:31.500
 Same thing with like Lockheed Martin.

54:31.500 --> 54:34.220
 I interviewed the CTO of Lockheed Martin.

54:34.220 --> 54:37.200
 It breaks my heart, as a person who loves engineering,

54:38.380 --> 54:41.120
 because of the cover of secrecy,

54:41.120 --> 54:43.300
 we'll never get to know some of the incredible engineering

54:43.300 --> 54:46.580
 that happens inside of Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon.

54:46.580 --> 54:49.260
 Yeah, you know, there's kind of this idea

54:49.260 --> 54:52.300
 that these are, you know, people have conspiracy theories

54:52.300 --> 54:56.780
 and kind of assign evil to these companies in some part,

54:56.780 --> 54:59.320
 but I think there's beautiful people inside those companies,

54:59.320 --> 55:02.660
 brilliant people, and some incredible science

55:02.660 --> 55:04.380
 and engineering is happening there.

55:04.380 --> 55:08.940
 Anyway, that said, the CIA, the FSB, the MI6,

55:08.940 --> 55:13.420
 Mossad, China, I know very little about the...

55:13.420 --> 55:14.820
 MSS, the Ministry of State Security.

55:14.820 --> 55:16.520
 I don't know how much you know.

55:16.520 --> 55:17.940
 Yeah.

55:17.940 --> 55:19.780
 Or just other intelligence agencies.

55:19.780 --> 55:21.820
 In India, Pakistan, I've also heard...

55:21.820 --> 55:24.220
 Yeah, RAW is powerful, and so is ISSI.

55:24.220 --> 55:26.860
 Yes, or ISSI.

55:26.860 --> 55:30.420
 And then, of course, European nations in Germany and France.

55:30.420 --> 55:33.700
 Yeah, so what can you say about the power,

55:33.700 --> 55:35.900
 the influence of the different intelligence agencies

55:35.900 --> 55:37.620
 within their nation and outside?

55:37.620 --> 55:41.460
 Yeah, so to answer your question, your original question,

55:41.460 --> 55:42.420
 which is the most powerful,

55:42.420 --> 55:44.760
 I'm gonna have to give you a few different answers.

55:44.760 --> 55:49.240
 So the most powerful intelligence organization in the world

55:49.240 --> 55:53.180
 in terms of reach is the Chinese MSS,

55:53.180 --> 55:54.820
 the Ministry of State Security,

55:54.820 --> 55:57.800
 because they have created

55:57.800 --> 56:01.260
 a single, solitary intelligence service

56:01.260 --> 56:04.200
 that has global reach and is integrated

56:04.200 --> 56:07.460
 with Chinese culture, so that essentially,

56:07.460 --> 56:09.760
 every Chinese person anywhere in the world

56:09.760 --> 56:11.500
 is an informant to the MSS,

56:11.500 --> 56:15.460
 because that's their way of serving the Middle Kingdom,

56:15.460 --> 56:18.780
 Zhongguo, the Central Kingdom, the Chinese word for China.

56:19.760 --> 56:21.220
 So they're the strongest.

56:21.220 --> 56:23.940
 They're the most powerful intelligence service

56:23.940 --> 56:24.820
 in terms of reach.

56:24.820 --> 56:27.140
 Most assets, most informants, most intelligence.

56:27.140 --> 56:29.300
 So it's deeply integrated with the citizenry.

56:29.300 --> 56:30.820
 Correct, with their culture.

56:30.820 --> 56:32.980
 You know what a Chinese person who lives in Syria

56:32.980 --> 56:34.340
 thinks of themself as?

56:34.340 --> 56:35.520
 A Chinese person.

56:35.520 --> 56:36.780
 Do you know what a Chinese person,

56:36.780 --> 56:38.940
 a Chinese national living in the United States

56:38.940 --> 56:40.140
 thinks of themself as?

56:40.140 --> 56:41.640
 A Chinese person, right?

56:41.640 --> 56:44.460
 Americans living abroad often think of ourselves

56:44.460 --> 56:47.940
 as expats, expatriates, living on the local economy,

56:47.940 --> 56:49.980
 embracing the local culture.

56:49.980 --> 56:51.620
 That is not how Chinese people view

56:51.620 --> 56:52.580
 traveling around the world.

56:52.580 --> 56:54.460
 And by the way, if I may mention,

56:54.460 --> 56:59.460
 I believe the way Mossad operates

56:59.460 --> 57:01.100
 is a similar kind of thing,

57:01.100 --> 57:04.460
 because people from Israel living abroad

57:04.460 --> 57:07.740
 still think of themselves as Jewish and Israeli.

57:07.740 --> 57:08.940
 First.

57:08.940 --> 57:11.740
 First, so that allows you to integrate the.

57:11.740 --> 57:13.820
 Culture, and yep, the faith based aspects.

57:13.820 --> 57:14.660
 Exactly right.

57:14.660 --> 57:17.180
 But the number of people in Israel is much, much smaller.

57:17.180 --> 57:18.020
 Exactly right.

57:18.020 --> 57:18.840
 The number of people in China.

57:18.840 --> 57:21.340
 When it comes to reach, China wins that game.

57:21.340 --> 57:23.940
 When it comes to professional capability,

57:23.940 --> 57:28.460
 it's the CIA by far, because budget wise,

57:28.460 --> 57:30.260
 capability wise, weapons system wise,

57:30.260 --> 57:31.500
 modern technology wise,

57:31.500 --> 57:34.060
 CIA is the leader around the world,

57:34.060 --> 57:36.780
 which is why every other intelligence organization out there

57:36.780 --> 57:38.940
 wants to partner with CIA.

57:38.940 --> 57:40.820
 They want to learn from CIA.

57:40.820 --> 57:42.060
 They want to train with CIA.

57:42.060 --> 57:45.300
 They want to partner on counter narcotics,

57:45.300 --> 57:47.020
 and counter drug, and counter terrorism,

57:47.020 --> 57:49.100
 and counter Uyghur, you name it,

57:49.100 --> 57:50.340
 people want to partner with CIA.

57:50.340 --> 57:51.500
 So CIA is the most powerful

57:51.500 --> 57:54.540
 in terms of capability and wealth.

57:54.540 --> 57:59.540
 And then you've got the idea, you've got tech.

57:59.820 --> 58:04.620
 So tech alone, meaning corporate espionage,

58:04.620 --> 58:09.020
 economic espionage, nothing beats DGSE in France.

58:09.020 --> 58:10.660
 They're the top.

58:10.660 --> 58:11.860
 They've got a massive budget

58:11.860 --> 58:14.740
 that almost goes exclusively to stealing foreign secrets.

58:14.740 --> 58:16.740
 They're the biggest threat to the United States,

58:16.740 --> 58:19.580
 even above Russia and above China.

58:19.580 --> 58:20.620
 DGSE in France

58:20.620 --> 58:23.460
 is a massively powerful intelligence organization,

58:23.460 --> 58:25.960
 but they're so exclusively focused

58:25.960 --> 58:29.620
 on a handful of types of intelligence collection

58:29.620 --> 58:31.920
 that nobody even really thinks that they exist.

58:31.920 --> 58:35.640
 And then in terms of just terrifying violence,

58:35.640 --> 58:36.700
 you have Mossad.

58:36.700 --> 58:38.300
 Mossad will do anything.

58:38.300 --> 58:42.140
 Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes

58:42.140 --> 58:43.340
 to ensure the survival

58:43.340 --> 58:46.460
 of every Israeli citizen around the world.

58:46.460 --> 58:49.620
 Most other countries will stop at some point,

58:49.620 --> 58:51.420
 but Mossad doesn't do that.

58:51.420 --> 58:54.780
 So it's the lines you're willing to cross.

58:54.780 --> 58:57.620
 And the reasons that you're willing to cross them.

58:57.620 --> 59:02.620
 The CIA will let an American stay in jail in Russia,

59:02.700 --> 59:06.140
 unlawfully, and seek a diplomatic solution.

59:06.140 --> 59:07.860
 I mean, the United States has let people,

59:07.860 --> 59:10.580
 there are two gentlemen from the 1950s

59:10.580 --> 59:12.900
 who were imprisoned in China for 20 years

59:12.900 --> 59:16.660
 waiting for diplomatic solutions to their release.

59:16.660 --> 59:21.660
 So we do not kill to save a citizen, but Mossad will.

59:26.620 --> 59:28.360
 And then they'll not just kill,

59:28.360 --> 59:31.640
 they'll do large scale infiltration.

59:31.640 --> 59:32.740
 They'll do amazing things.

59:32.740 --> 59:35.660
 There is no, they spare no expense

59:35.660 --> 59:38.340
 because it's a demonstration to their own people.

59:38.340 --> 59:40.600
 Again, going back to the whole idea of influence.

59:40.600 --> 59:45.600
 Every intelligence operation that sees the light of day

59:45.940 --> 59:47.860
 has two purposes.

59:47.860 --> 59:51.380
 The first purpose is the intelligence operation.

59:51.380 --> 59:53.540
 But if it was just the intelligence operation,

59:53.540 --> 59:54.940
 it would stay secret forever.

59:54.940 --> 59:55.980
 The second purpose

59:55.980 --> 59:57.980
 of every successful intelligence operation,

59:57.980 --> 59:59.440
 when they become public,

59:59.440 --> 1:00:02.160
 is to send a signal to the world.

1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:05.400
 If you work against us, we will do this to you.

1:00:05.400 --> 1:00:09.100
 If you work for us, we will take care of you in this way.

1:00:09.100 --> 1:00:11.820
 It's a massive information campaign.

1:00:11.820 --> 1:00:15.420
 Do you think in that way, CIA is not doing a good job?

1:00:15.420 --> 1:00:20.420
 Because there is the FSB, perhaps much less so GRU,

1:00:20.740 --> 1:00:24.660
 but the KGB did this well,

1:00:24.660 --> 1:00:28.700
 which is to send a signal, like basically communicate

1:00:28.700 --> 1:00:33.540
 that this is a terrifying organization with a lot of power.

1:00:33.540 --> 1:00:35.780
 So Mossad is doing a good job of that.

1:00:35.780 --> 1:00:36.820
 Correct.

1:00:36.820 --> 1:00:39.720
 The psychological information warfare.

1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:44.720
 And it seems like the CIA also has a lot of kind of myths

1:00:47.380 --> 1:00:49.420
 about it, conspiracy theories about it,

1:00:49.420 --> 1:00:52.500
 but much less so than the other agencies.

1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:54.900
 CIA does a good job of playing to the mythos.

1:00:54.900 --> 1:00:58.820
 So when General Petraeus used to be the director of CIA.

1:00:58.820 --> 1:01:00.820
 Yeah, and your workout partner.

1:01:00.820 --> 1:01:01.660
 And my workout partner.

1:01:01.660 --> 1:01:02.480
 I read about this.

1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:05.240
 So I loved and hated those workouts with Petraeus

1:01:05.240 --> 1:01:07.900
 because he is a physical beast.

1:01:07.900 --> 1:01:11.740
 He's a strong fit, at the time, 60 something year old man.

1:01:11.740 --> 1:01:13.540
 Let me take a tangent on that because he's coming

1:01:13.540 --> 1:01:14.380
 on this podcast.

1:01:14.380 --> 1:01:15.340
 Oh, excellent man.

1:01:15.340 --> 1:01:20.340
 So can you say what you learned from the man

1:01:20.420 --> 1:01:25.180
 in terms of, or like what you think is interesting

1:01:25.180 --> 1:01:28.340
 and powerful and inspiring about the way he sees the world,

1:01:28.340 --> 1:01:31.780
 or maybe what you learned in terms of how to get strong

1:01:31.780 --> 1:01:34.020
 in the gym or anything about life.

1:01:34.020 --> 1:01:34.860
 Two things right away.

1:01:34.860 --> 1:01:36.180
 And one of them I was gonna share with you anyway.

1:01:36.180 --> 1:01:37.500
 So I'm glad that you asked the question.

1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:42.500
 So the first is that on our runs and man, he runs fast

1:01:43.380 --> 1:01:45.700
 and we would go for six mile runs through Bangkok.

1:01:45.700 --> 1:01:50.300
 And he talked openly about, I asked him,

1:01:51.380 --> 1:01:56.380
 how do you keep this mystery, this epic mythology

1:01:57.980 --> 1:02:00.480
 about your fitness and your strength?

1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:04.760
 How do you keep all of this alive with the troops?

1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:06.620
 And he had this amazing answer.

1:02:06.620 --> 1:02:08.740
 And he was like, I don't talk about it.

1:02:08.740 --> 1:02:13.400
 Myths are born not from somebody orchestrating the myth,

1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:17.000
 but from the source of the myth, simply being secretive.

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:18.700
 So he's like, I don't talk about it.

1:02:18.700 --> 1:02:19.900
 I've never talked about it.

1:02:19.900 --> 1:02:21.220
 I've never exacerbated it.

1:02:21.220 --> 1:02:22.580
 I just do what I do.

1:02:22.580 --> 1:02:23.980
 And I let the troops talk.

1:02:23.980 --> 1:02:26.380
 And he's like, when it's in favor, when it goes in favor

1:02:26.380 --> 1:02:30.820
 of discipline and loyalty and commitment, I let it run.

1:02:30.820 --> 1:02:33.420
 If it starts getting destructive or damaging,

1:02:33.420 --> 1:02:37.900
 then I have my leadership team step in to fix it.

1:02:37.900 --> 1:02:40.460
 But when it comes to the mythos,

1:02:40.460 --> 1:02:42.980
 the myth of him being superpowered soldier,

1:02:42.980 --> 1:02:44.440
 that's what he wants every soldier to be.

1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:45.720
 So he lets it run.

1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:48.940
 And it was so enlightening when he told me,

1:02:48.940 --> 1:02:51.420
 when there's a myth that benefits you, you just let it go.

1:02:51.420 --> 1:02:54.260
 You let it happen because it gets you further

1:02:54.260 --> 1:02:55.200
 without you doing any work.

1:02:55.200 --> 1:02:56.040
 It costs no investment for you.

1:02:56.040 --> 1:02:58.500
 So the catalyst of the virality of the myth

1:02:58.500 --> 1:03:00.500
 is just being mysterious.

1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:02.020
 And that's what CIA does well,

1:03:02.020 --> 1:03:03.260
 to go back to your first question.

1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:04.700
 What does CIA do?

1:03:04.700 --> 1:03:06.540
 They don't answer any questions.

1:03:06.540 --> 1:03:08.300
 They don't say anything.

1:03:08.300 --> 1:03:11.020
 And wherever the myth goes, the myth goes,

1:03:11.020 --> 1:03:13.100
 whether it's that they sold drugs

1:03:13.100 --> 1:03:14.860
 or use child prostitutes or whatever else,

1:03:14.860 --> 1:03:17.120
 wherever the myth goes, they let it go.

1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:18.860
 Because at the end of the day,

1:03:18.860 --> 1:03:22.220
 everybody sits back and says, wow, I really just don't know.

1:03:22.220 --> 1:03:23.820
 Now, the second thing that I learned from Petraeus,

1:03:23.820 --> 1:03:27.140
 and I really am a big fan of Petraeus.

1:03:27.140 --> 1:03:29.100
 I know he made personal mistakes.

1:03:29.100 --> 1:03:30.580
 You don't get to be that powerful

1:03:30.580 --> 1:03:32.180
 without making personal mistakes.

1:03:32.180 --> 1:03:33.460
 But when I worked out with him,

1:03:33.460 --> 1:03:38.460
 the one thing that my commanding officer

1:03:38.460 --> 1:03:39.900
 told me not to ask about,

1:03:39.900 --> 1:03:43.240
 he was like, never ask the general about his family.

1:03:44.180 --> 1:03:45.240
 I'm a family guy.

1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:48.140
 So as soon as I met General Petraeus,

1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:49.940
 one of the first things I asked him was,

1:03:49.940 --> 1:03:51.720
 hey, what was it like raising a family

1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:55.300
 and being the commander of forces in the Middle East?

1:03:55.300 --> 1:03:57.100
 Like you weren't with your family very much.

1:03:57.100 --> 1:03:59.060
 And the thing I love about the guy,

1:03:59.060 --> 1:04:00.420
 he didn't bite off my head.

1:04:00.420 --> 1:04:01.260
 He didn't snap at me.

1:04:01.260 --> 1:04:02.380
 He didn't do anything.

1:04:02.380 --> 1:04:04.780
 He openly admitted that he regretted

1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:06.660
 some of the decisions that he made

1:04:06.660 --> 1:04:11.180
 because he had to sacrifice his family to get there.

1:04:11.180 --> 1:04:13.620
 Relationships with his children,

1:04:13.620 --> 1:04:15.580
 absentee father, missing birthdays,

1:04:15.580 --> 1:04:19.140
 missing, we all say, we all say how sad it is

1:04:19.140 --> 1:04:20.540
 to miss birthdays and miss anniversaries,

1:04:20.540 --> 1:04:21.380
 yada, yada, yada.

1:04:21.380 --> 1:04:22.200
 Everybody knows what that feels like.

1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:23.940
 Even business people know what that feels like.

1:04:23.940 --> 1:04:26.040
 The actual pain that we're talking about

1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:28.300
 is when you're not there to handle

1:04:28.300 --> 1:04:31.660
 your 13 year old's questions when a boy breaks up with her

1:04:31.660 --> 1:04:34.540
 or when you're not there to handle the bloody lip

1:04:34.540 --> 1:04:35.940
 that your nine year old comes back with

1:04:35.940 --> 1:04:37.940
 from their first encounter with a bully.

1:04:37.940 --> 1:04:39.780
 Those are the truly heartbreaking moments

1:04:39.780 --> 1:04:42.380
 that a parent lives and dies by.

1:04:42.380 --> 1:04:45.620
 He missed almost all of those

1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:48.260
 because he was fighting a war that we forgot

1:04:48.260 --> 1:04:50.260
 and we gave up on 20 years later, right?

1:04:51.580 --> 1:04:53.300
 He's so honest about that.

1:04:54.220 --> 1:04:57.040
 And it was really inspiring to me

1:04:57.040 --> 1:04:59.180
 to be told not to ask that question.

1:04:59.180 --> 1:05:02.940
 And when I broke that guidance, he didn't reprimand me.

1:05:02.940 --> 1:05:05.600
 He just, he was authentic.

1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:07.480
 And it was absolutely one of the big decisions

1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:10.620
 that helped me leave CIA on my own in 2014.

1:05:10.620 --> 1:05:15.100
 And he was honest on the sacrifice you make.

1:05:15.100 --> 1:05:17.800
 The same man, the same man who just taught me a lesson

1:05:17.800 --> 1:05:21.500
 about letting a myth live,

1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:24.460
 that same guy was willing to be so authentic

1:05:24.460 --> 1:05:27.980
 about this personal mistake.

1:05:27.980 --> 1:05:30.860
 I like complicated people like that.

1:05:30.860 --> 1:05:34.460
 So what did you, what do you make of that calculation,

1:05:34.460 --> 1:05:36.580
 of family versus job?

1:05:36.580 --> 1:05:40.740
 You've given a lot of your life and passion

1:05:40.740 --> 1:05:42.720
 to the CIA, to that work.

1:05:44.420 --> 1:05:49.080
 You've spoken positively about that world, the good it does.

1:05:51.300 --> 1:05:53.960
 And yet you're also a family man and you value that.

1:05:53.960 --> 1:05:55.220
 What's that calculation like?

1:05:55.220 --> 1:05:56.140
 What's that trade off like?

1:05:56.140 --> 1:05:57.860
 I mean, for me, the calculation is very clear.

1:05:57.860 --> 1:05:58.780
 It's family.

1:05:58.780 --> 1:06:03.220
 I left CIA because I chose my family.

1:06:03.220 --> 1:06:06.540
 And when my son was born, my wife and I found out

1:06:06.540 --> 1:06:08.340
 that we were pregnant while we were still on mission.

1:06:08.340 --> 1:06:09.260
 We were a tandem couple.

1:06:09.260 --> 1:06:12.620
 My wife is also a former CIA officer, undercover like me.

1:06:12.620 --> 1:06:14.940
 We were operating together overseas.

1:06:14.940 --> 1:06:18.780
 We got the positive pregnancy test, like so many people do.

1:06:18.780 --> 1:06:21.780
 And she cried.

1:06:21.780 --> 1:06:23.280
 My wife was a bad ass.

1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:26.340
 I was just, I was like the accidental spy,

1:06:26.340 --> 1:06:28.300
 but my wife was really good at what she does.

1:06:28.300 --> 1:06:32.260
 And she cried and she was like, what do we do now?

1:06:32.260 --> 1:06:34.860
 It's what we've always wanted, a child,

1:06:34.860 --> 1:06:37.820
 but we're in this thing right now.

1:06:38.860 --> 1:06:41.220
 There's no space for a child.

1:06:41.220 --> 1:06:45.620
 So long story short, we had our baby.

1:06:45.620 --> 1:06:48.020
 CIA brought us back to have the baby.

1:06:48.020 --> 1:06:50.560
 And when we started having conversations about,

1:06:50.560 --> 1:06:52.140
 hey, what do we do next?

1:06:52.140 --> 1:06:53.500
 Cause we're not the type of people

1:06:53.500 --> 1:06:57.580
 to wanna just sit around and be domestic.

1:06:57.580 --> 1:06:58.780
 What do we do next?

1:06:58.780 --> 1:07:00.900
 But keep in mind, we have a child now.

1:07:00.900 --> 1:07:02.600
 So here's some of our suggestions.

1:07:02.600 --> 1:07:04.100
 We could do this and we can do that.

1:07:04.100 --> 1:07:06.300
 Let us get our child to a place where we can put him

1:07:06.300 --> 1:07:07.300
 into an international school,

1:07:07.300 --> 1:07:10.460
 or we can get him into some sort of program

1:07:10.460 --> 1:07:15.460
 where we can both operate together again during the day.

1:07:17.260 --> 1:07:18.460
 But CIA just had no,

1:07:18.460 --> 1:07:19.900
 they had no patience for that conversation.

1:07:19.900 --> 1:07:23.860
 There was no, family is not their priority.

1:07:23.860 --> 1:07:26.100
 So the fact that we were a tandem couple,

1:07:26.100 --> 1:07:29.060
 two officers, two operators trying to have a baby

1:07:29.060 --> 1:07:30.620
 was irrelevant to them.

1:07:30.620 --> 1:07:32.700
 So when they didn't play with us,

1:07:32.700 --> 1:07:37.700
 when they did nothing to help us prioritize parenthood

1:07:39.380 --> 1:07:41.460
 as part of our overall experience,

1:07:41.460 --> 1:07:43.100
 that's when we knew that they never would.

1:07:43.100 --> 1:07:46.500
 And what good is it to commit yourself to a career

1:07:46.500 --> 1:07:48.220
 if the career is always going to challenge

1:07:48.220 --> 1:07:50.160
 the thing that you value most?

1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:53.580
 And that was the calculation that we made to leave CIA.

1:07:53.580 --> 1:07:55.820
 Not everybody makes that calculation.

1:07:55.820 --> 1:08:00.340
 And a big part of why I am so vocal about my time in CIA

1:08:00.340 --> 1:08:05.340
 is because I am immensely appreciative of the men and women

1:08:05.420 --> 1:08:09.780
 who to this day have failed marriages

1:08:09.780 --> 1:08:12.100
 and poor relationships with their children

1:08:12.100 --> 1:08:14.220
 because they chose national security.

1:08:14.220 --> 1:08:17.380
 They chose protecting America over their own family.

1:08:17.380 --> 1:08:21.020
 And they've done it even though it's made them

1:08:21.020 --> 1:08:23.580
 abuse alcohol and abuse substances

1:08:23.580 --> 1:08:25.380
 and they've gotten themselves,

1:08:25.380 --> 1:08:29.120
 they've got permanent diseases and issues

1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:31.420
 from living and working abroad.

1:08:31.420 --> 1:08:35.400
 It's just insane the sacrifice that officers make

1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:37.560
 to keep America free.

1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:39.340
 And I'm just not one of those people.

1:08:39.340 --> 1:08:40.180
 I chose family.

1:08:41.600 --> 1:08:44.360
 You said that your wife misses it.

1:08:44.360 --> 1:08:45.200
 Do you miss it?

1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:46.040
 We both miss it.

1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:47.620
 We miss it for different reasons.

1:08:47.620 --> 1:08:49.460
 We miss it for similar reasons, I guess,

1:08:49.460 --> 1:08:50.900
 but we miss it in different ways.

1:08:50.900 --> 1:08:55.340
 The people, the people at CIA are just amazing.

1:08:55.340 --> 1:09:00.340
 They're everyday people like the guy and the gal next door,

1:09:00.500 --> 1:09:04.940
 but so smart and so dedicated and so courageous

1:09:04.940 --> 1:09:06.860
 about what they do and how they do it.

1:09:06.860 --> 1:09:08.960
 I mean, the sacrifices they make are massive,

1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:10.720
 more massive than the sacrifices I made.

1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:12.140
 So I was always inspired

1:09:12.140 --> 1:09:13.700
 and impressed by the people around me.

1:09:13.700 --> 1:09:16.640
 So both my wife and I absolutely miss the people.

1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:20.360
 My wife misses the work because you know everything.

1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:25.220
 When you're inside, it's all, I mean, we had top secret.

1:09:25.220 --> 1:09:27.140
 We had TS SCI clearances at the time.

1:09:27.140 --> 1:09:30.440
 I had a cat six, cat 12, which makes me nuclear cleared.

1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:32.820
 My wife had other privy clearances

1:09:32.820 --> 1:09:37.300
 that allowed her to look into areas that were specialized,

1:09:37.300 --> 1:09:40.920
 but there wasn't a headline that went out

1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:44.220
 that we couldn't fact check with a click of a few buttons.

1:09:44.220 --> 1:09:46.260
 And she misses that because she loved that kind of knowledge.

1:09:46.260 --> 1:09:48.940
 And now you're just one of us living

1:09:48.940 --> 1:09:51.900
 in the cloud of mystery.

1:09:51.900 --> 1:09:52.740
 Exactly.

1:09:52.740 --> 1:09:54.380
 Not really knowing anything about what's going on.

1:09:54.380 --> 1:09:55.620
 Exactly, but for me,

1:09:55.620 --> 1:09:59.060
 I've always been the person that likes operating.

1:09:59.060 --> 1:10:01.020
 And you know what you still get to do when you leave CIA?

1:10:01.020 --> 1:10:02.460
 You still get to operate.

1:10:02.460 --> 1:10:04.340
 Operating is just working with people.

1:10:04.340 --> 1:10:06.180
 It's understanding how people think,

1:10:06.180 --> 1:10:07.180
 predicting their actions,

1:10:07.180 --> 1:10:10.440
 driving their direction of their thoughts, persuading them,

1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:11.740
 winning negotiations.

1:10:13.140 --> 1:10:14.060
 You still get to do that.

1:10:14.060 --> 1:10:15.460
 You do that every day.

1:10:15.460 --> 1:10:18.540
 And you can apply that in all kinds of domains.

1:10:18.540 --> 1:10:21.020
 Well, let me ask you on that.

1:10:21.020 --> 1:10:25.980
 You're a covert CIA intelligence officer for several years.

1:10:25.980 --> 1:10:28.660
 Maybe can you tell me the story of how it all began?

1:10:28.660 --> 1:10:30.700
 How were you recruited?

1:10:30.700 --> 1:10:32.580
 And what did the job entail

1:10:32.580 --> 1:10:34.240
 to the degree you can speak about it?

1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:36.140
 Feel free to direct me if I'm getting too boring

1:10:36.140 --> 1:10:37.460
 or if the camera.

1:10:37.460 --> 1:10:40.780
 Every aspect of this is super exciting.

1:10:40.780 --> 1:10:45.780
 So I was leaving the United States Air Force in 2007.

1:10:46.980 --> 1:10:51.220
 I was a lieutenant getting ready to pin on captain.

1:10:51.220 --> 1:10:53.020
 My five years was up.

1:10:53.020 --> 1:10:56.260
 And I was a very bad fit for the US Air Force.

1:10:56.260 --> 1:10:58.900
 I was an Air Force Academy graduate, not by choice,

1:10:58.900 --> 1:11:01.820
 but by lack of opportunity, lack of options otherwise.

1:11:01.820 --> 1:11:03.740
 So I forced myself through the Academy,

1:11:03.740 --> 1:11:07.140
 barely graduated with a 2.4 GPA.

1:11:07.140 --> 1:11:09.420
 And then went on the Air Force taught me how to fly.

1:11:09.420 --> 1:11:11.960
 And then the Air Force taught me about nuclear weapons.

1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:16.960
 And I ended up as a nuclear missile commander in Montana.

1:11:18.300 --> 1:11:20.820
 And I chose to leave the Air Force

1:11:20.820 --> 1:11:23.200
 because I didn't like shaving my face.

1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:24.260
 I didn't like having short hair.

1:11:24.260 --> 1:11:26.260
 And I most definitely didn't like shining my shoes.

1:11:26.260 --> 1:11:28.180
 And I did not wanna be one of the people

1:11:28.180 --> 1:11:29.340
 in charge of nuclear weapons.

1:11:29.340 --> 1:11:30.680
 So when I found myself as a person

1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:32.980
 in charge of 200 nuclear weapons,

1:11:32.980 --> 1:11:34.620
 I knew that I was going down the wrong road.

1:11:34.620 --> 1:11:36.180
 I have questions about this.

1:11:36.180 --> 1:11:38.420
 And more importantly, I have questions about your hair.

1:11:38.420 --> 1:11:40.300
 So you had short hair at the time?

1:11:40.300 --> 1:11:41.460
 I had, yeah, you have to.

1:11:41.460 --> 1:11:42.980
 Military regulations, you can't have hair

1:11:42.980 --> 1:11:43.980
 longer than one inch.

1:11:43.980 --> 1:11:44.820
 Okay.

1:11:44.820 --> 1:11:48.940
 And this, the beautiful hair you have now,

1:11:48.940 --> 1:11:52.140
 that came to be in the CIA or after?

1:11:52.140 --> 1:11:55.380
 This, so I discovered I had messy hair in CIA

1:11:55.380 --> 1:11:58.540
 because I used to go muge, we called it muge.

1:11:58.540 --> 1:12:00.340
 I used to go Mujahideen style,

1:12:00.340 --> 1:12:03.320
 big burly beard and crazy wacky hair.

1:12:03.320 --> 1:12:06.420
 Because an ambiguously brown guy with a big beard

1:12:06.420 --> 1:12:09.460
 and long hair can go anywhere in the world

1:12:09.460 --> 1:12:12.220
 without anyone even noticing him.

1:12:12.220 --> 1:12:14.580
 They either think that he's a janitor

1:12:14.580 --> 1:12:18.860
 or they think that he's like some forgotten part of history

1:12:18.860 --> 1:12:21.620
 but nobody ever thinks that that guy is a spy.

1:12:21.620 --> 1:12:23.620
 So it was the perfect, for me,

1:12:23.620 --> 1:12:27.700
 it was one of my favorite disguises.

1:12:27.700 --> 1:12:29.140
 It's what's known as a level two disguise.

1:12:29.140 --> 1:12:30.500
 One of my favorite disguises to Don

1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:33.920
 was just dilapidated brown guy.

1:12:35.800 --> 1:12:37.700
 Can you actually, we'll just take a million tangents.

1:12:37.700 --> 1:12:39.540
 What's a level two disguise?

1:12:40.460 --> 1:12:42.940
 What are the different levels of disguise?

1:12:42.940 --> 1:12:44.140
 What are the disguises?

1:12:44.140 --> 1:12:46.660
 Yeah, there's three levels of disguise by and large.

1:12:46.660 --> 1:12:48.460
 Level one is what we also know,

1:12:48.460 --> 1:12:49.900
 what we also call light disguise.

1:12:49.900 --> 1:12:52.900
 So that's essentially, you put on sunglasses

1:12:52.900 --> 1:12:55.060
 and a ball cap and that's a disguise.

1:12:55.060 --> 1:12:57.360
 You look different than you normally look.

1:12:57.360 --> 1:12:59.680
 So it's just different enough

1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:01.360
 that someone who's never seen you before,

1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:02.980
 someone who literally has to see you

1:13:02.980 --> 1:13:05.100
 just from a picture on the internet,

1:13:05.100 --> 1:13:06.460
 they may not recognize you.

1:13:06.460 --> 1:13:08.060
 It's why you see celebrities walk around

1:13:08.060 --> 1:13:11.900
 with ball caps and oversized jackets and baseball hats

1:13:11.900 --> 1:13:12.860
 because they just need to not look

1:13:12.860 --> 1:13:13.900
 like they look in the tabloid

1:13:13.900 --> 1:13:16.340
 or not look like they look in TV.

1:13:16.340 --> 1:13:17.940
 That's level one.

1:13:17.940 --> 1:13:19.840
 Let me jump from level one to level three.

1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:22.300
 Level three is all of your prosthetics,

1:13:22.300 --> 1:13:24.740
 all the stuff you see in Mission Impossible,

1:13:24.740 --> 1:13:28.720
 your fake ears, your fake faces, your fat suits,

1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:32.380
 your stilts inside your feet, all that's level three.

1:13:32.380 --> 1:13:35.860
 Whenever they make any kind of prosthetic disguise,

1:13:35.860 --> 1:13:37.060
 that's a level three disguise

1:13:37.060 --> 1:13:41.300
 because prosthetics are very damning

1:13:41.300 --> 1:13:43.060
 if you are caught with a prosthetic.

1:13:43.060 --> 1:13:45.260
 If you're caught wearing a sudden,

1:13:45.260 --> 1:13:47.220
 wearing a baseball hat and sunglasses,

1:13:47.220 --> 1:13:49.460
 nobody's gonna say you're a spy.

1:13:49.460 --> 1:13:54.100
 But when you're caught with a custom made nose prosthetic

1:13:54.100 --> 1:13:55.480
 that changes the way your face looks

1:13:55.480 --> 1:13:57.660
 or when someone pops out a fake jaw

1:13:57.660 --> 1:14:00.900
 and they see that your top teeth don't look like they did

1:14:00.900 --> 1:14:03.340
 in this prosthetic, then all of a sudden

1:14:03.340 --> 1:14:05.660
 you've got some very difficult questions to ask

1:14:05.660 --> 1:14:06.700
 or to answer.

1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:08.480
 So level three is extremely dangerous.

1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:09.540
 Level one is not dangerous.

1:14:09.540 --> 1:14:12.380
 Level two is longterm disguise.

1:14:12.380 --> 1:14:14.220
 Level two is all the things that you can do

1:14:14.220 --> 1:14:16.160
 to permanently change the way you look

1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:17.740
 for a long period of time

1:14:17.740 --> 1:14:20.440
 so that whether you're aggressed in the street

1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:23.540
 or whether someone breaks into your hotel room or whatever,

1:14:23.540 --> 1:14:24.720
 it's real.

1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:27.300
 So maybe that's, maybe you get a tattoo.

1:14:27.300 --> 1:14:28.860
 Maybe you cut your hair short.

1:14:28.860 --> 1:14:29.780
 Maybe you grow your hair long.

1:14:29.780 --> 1:14:31.120
 Maybe you go bald.

1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:32.540
 Maybe you start wearing glasses.

1:14:32.540 --> 1:14:34.120
 Well, glasses are technically a prosthetic,

1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:38.240
 but you can, if you have teeth pulled,

1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:42.220
 if you gain 20 pounds, really gain 20 pounds

1:14:42.220 --> 1:14:44.300
 or lose 15 pounds, whatever you might do,

1:14:44.300 --> 1:14:45.580
 all of that's considered level two.

1:14:45.580 --> 1:14:48.420
 It's designed for a longterm mission

1:14:48.420 --> 1:14:52.060
 so that people believe you are who you say you are

1:14:52.060 --> 1:14:53.100
 in that disguise.

1:14:53.100 --> 1:14:55.920
 A lot of that is physical characteristics.

1:14:55.920 --> 1:14:59.700
 What about what actors do,

1:14:59.700 --> 1:15:01.260
 which is the...

1:15:01.260 --> 1:15:02.100
 Method acting.

1:15:02.100 --> 1:15:03.020
 Yeah, the method acting,

1:15:03.020 --> 1:15:07.160
 sort of developing a backstory in your own mind,

1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:11.460
 and then you start pretending

1:15:11.460 --> 1:15:15.900
 that you host a podcast and teach at a university

1:15:15.900 --> 1:15:17.980
 and then do research and so on

1:15:17.980 --> 1:15:19.980
 just so that people can believe

1:15:19.980 --> 1:15:22.860
 that you're not actually an agent.

1:15:22.860 --> 1:15:24.700
 Is that part of the disguise levels or no?

1:15:24.700 --> 1:15:28.180
 So yes, disguise has to do with physical character traits.

1:15:28.180 --> 1:15:29.580
 That's what a disguise is.

1:15:29.580 --> 1:15:32.260
 What you're talking about is known as a cover legend.

1:15:32.260 --> 1:15:33.480
 When you go undercover,

1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:35.620
 what you claim to be, who you claim to be,

1:15:35.620 --> 1:15:38.180
 that's called your legend, your cover legend.

1:15:38.180 --> 1:15:40.580
 Every disguise would theoretically have

1:15:40.580 --> 1:15:42.380
 its own cover legend.

1:15:42.380 --> 1:15:43.660
 Even if it's just to describe

1:15:43.660 --> 1:15:45.300
 why you're wearing what you're wearing,

1:15:45.300 --> 1:15:47.100
 it's all a cover.

1:15:47.100 --> 1:15:48.900
 So the method acting,

1:15:48.900 --> 1:15:50.460
 this is a fantastic point

1:15:50.460 --> 1:15:51.460
 that I don't get to make very often,

1:15:51.460 --> 1:15:52.780
 so I'm glad you asked.

1:15:52.780 --> 1:15:55.300
 The difference between CIA officers in the field

1:15:55.300 --> 1:15:56.540
 and method actors

1:15:56.540 --> 1:15:59.940
 is that method actors try to become the character.

1:15:59.940 --> 1:16:04.280
 They try to shed all vestiges of who they really are

1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:05.900
 and become the character,

1:16:05.900 --> 1:16:07.460
 and that's part of what makes them so amazing,

1:16:07.460 --> 1:16:12.200
 but it's also part of what makes them mentally unstable

1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:13.140
 over long periods of time.

1:16:13.140 --> 1:16:14.660
 It's part of what feeds their depression,

1:16:14.660 --> 1:16:16.500
 their anxiety, their personal issues,

1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:18.920
 because they lose sight of who they really are.

1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:20.760
 Field officers don't get that luxury.

1:16:20.760 --> 1:16:24.460
 We have to always, always remember

1:16:24.460 --> 1:16:26.940
 we are a covert CIA intelligence officer

1:16:26.940 --> 1:16:28.620
 collecting secrets in the field.

1:16:28.620 --> 1:16:29.900
 We have to remember that.

1:16:29.900 --> 1:16:32.420
 So we're taught a very specific skill

1:16:32.420 --> 1:16:36.920
 to compartmentalize our true self separately,

1:16:38.020 --> 1:16:42.780
 but make that true self the true identity.

1:16:42.780 --> 1:16:44.620
 So then we can still live and act

1:16:44.620 --> 1:16:47.860
 and effectively carry out our cover legend

1:16:47.860 --> 1:16:49.900
 without ever losing sight,

1:16:49.900 --> 1:16:51.980
 without ever losing that compass true north

1:16:51.980 --> 1:16:53.580
 of who we actually are.

1:16:53.580 --> 1:16:55.140
 And then we can compartmentalize

1:16:55.140 --> 1:16:56.860
 and secure all the information that we need,

1:16:56.860 --> 1:16:58.260
 retain it, remember it,

1:16:58.260 --> 1:17:00.420
 but then return to our true self

1:17:00.420 --> 1:17:03.180
 when we get back to a position of safety.

1:17:03.180 --> 1:17:04.420
 Is it possible to do that?

1:17:04.420 --> 1:17:09.260
 So I just have kind of anecdotal evidence for myself.

1:17:09.260 --> 1:17:12.300
 I really try to be the exact same person in all conditions,

1:17:12.300 --> 1:17:13.860
 which makes it very easy.

1:17:15.100 --> 1:17:17.220
 Like if you're not lying,

1:17:17.220 --> 1:17:21.340
 it makes it very easy to, first of all, to exist,

1:17:21.340 --> 1:17:23.900
 but also to communicate a kind of authenticity

1:17:23.900 --> 1:17:26.460
 and a genuineness, which I think is really important.

1:17:26.460 --> 1:17:29.180
 Like trust and integrity around trust

1:17:29.180 --> 1:17:30.420
 is extremely important to me.

1:17:30.420 --> 1:17:32.380
 It's the thing that opens doors

1:17:32.380 --> 1:17:34.780
 and maintains relationships.

1:17:34.780 --> 1:17:39.380
 And I tend to think, like when I was in Ukraine,

1:17:39.380 --> 1:17:44.380
 so many doors just opened to the very high security areas

1:17:45.140 --> 1:17:46.120
 and everywhere else too.

1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:48.940
 Like I've just interacted with some incredible people

1:17:48.940 --> 1:17:51.780
 without any kind of concerns.

1:17:51.780 --> 1:17:52.980
 You know, who is this guy?

1:17:52.980 --> 1:17:54.180
 Is he gonna spread it?

1:17:54.180 --> 1:17:55.180
 You know, all that kind of stuff.

1:17:55.180 --> 1:17:58.180
 And I tend to believe that you're able

1:17:58.180 --> 1:18:00.860
 to communicate a trustworthiness somehow

1:18:00.860 --> 1:18:05.060
 if you just are who you are.

1:18:05.060 --> 1:18:07.180
 And I think, I suppose method actors

1:18:07.180 --> 1:18:09.300
 are trying to achieve that by becoming something

1:18:09.300 --> 1:18:14.300
 and they can, I just feel like there is very subtle cues

1:18:14.300 --> 1:18:16.920
 that are extremely difficult to fake.

1:18:17.860 --> 1:18:22.060
 Like you really have to become that person, be that person.

1:18:22.060 --> 1:18:25.060
 But you're saying as a CIA agent,

1:18:25.060 --> 1:18:27.720
 you have to remember that you are there

1:18:27.720 --> 1:18:29.100
 to collect information.

1:18:29.100 --> 1:18:31.100
 Do you think that gives you away?

1:18:31.100 --> 1:18:33.920
 So one of the flaws in your argument

1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:38.200
 is that you keep referring to how you feel.

1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:40.420
 I feel this, I feel that, I feel like this,

1:18:40.420 --> 1:18:41.600
 I feel like that.

1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:45.860
 That feeling is a predictable character trait

1:18:45.860 --> 1:18:46.760
 of all human beings.

1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:49.060
 It's a pink matter, we call it pink matter.

1:18:49.060 --> 1:18:50.900
 It's a cognitive trait.

1:18:52.580 --> 1:18:55.020
 You are not alone in trusting your feelings.

1:18:55.020 --> 1:18:56.780
 All people trust their feelings.

1:18:56.780 --> 1:18:59.620
 But because what CIA teaches us

1:18:59.620 --> 1:19:03.340
 is how to systematically create artificial relationships

1:19:04.340 --> 1:19:06.380
 where we're the one in control of the source

1:19:06.380 --> 1:19:08.440
 that is giving us intelligence.

1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:11.680
 And the core element to being able to control

1:19:11.680 --> 1:19:13.020
 a relationship is understanding

1:19:13.020 --> 1:19:14.940
 the pink matter truth of feelings.

1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:19.900
 What all people feel becomes their point of view

1:19:19.900 --> 1:19:21.460
 on what reality is.

1:19:21.460 --> 1:19:23.380
 So when you understand and you learn how to manipulate

1:19:23.380 --> 1:19:26.320
 what people feel, then you can essentially direct them

1:19:26.320 --> 1:19:28.340
 to feel any way you want them to feel.

1:19:28.340 --> 1:19:30.800
 So if you want them to feel like they can trust you,

1:19:30.800 --> 1:19:32.140
 you can make them feel that way.

1:19:32.140 --> 1:19:34.240
 If you want them to feel like you're a good guy

1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:36.400
 or a bad guy, if you want them to feel like

1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:38.180
 they should give you secrets even though their government

1:19:38.180 --> 1:19:40.020
 tells them not to, you can do that.

1:19:40.020 --> 1:19:43.220
 There are men who make women feel like they love them

1:19:43.220 --> 1:19:45.180
 and just so that the woman will sleep with them.

1:19:45.180 --> 1:19:47.460
 There are women who make men feel like they love them

1:19:47.460 --> 1:19:49.620
 just so the men will give them their money.

1:19:49.620 --> 1:19:52.860
 Manipulation is a core behavioral trait

1:19:52.860 --> 1:19:55.820
 of all the human species because we all understand

1:19:55.820 --> 1:19:58.200
 to some level how powerful feelings are,

1:19:58.200 --> 1:19:59.540
 but feelings are not the same thing

1:19:59.540 --> 1:20:01.220
 as logical, rational thought.

1:20:01.220 --> 1:20:03.400
 They're two different sides of the brain.

1:20:03.400 --> 1:20:07.500
 What CIA teaches us how to do is systematically tap into

1:20:07.500 --> 1:20:10.080
 the right side, emotional side of the brain

1:20:10.080 --> 1:20:13.660
 so that we can quickly get past all of the stuff

1:20:13.660 --> 1:20:15.420
 you were just saying, all of the,

1:20:15.420 --> 1:20:16.700
 well, don't you have to be convincing

1:20:16.700 --> 1:20:18.140
 and don't you have to really know your story

1:20:18.140 --> 1:20:20.380
 and don't you have to be able to defend it?

1:20:20.380 --> 1:20:21.640
 Don't you have to have authenticity

1:20:21.640 --> 1:20:25.820
 and don't you have to have genuine feelings?

1:20:25.820 --> 1:20:27.600
 Yes, all of those things are true

1:20:27.600 --> 1:20:29.820
 if you're having a genuine relationship,

1:20:29.820 --> 1:20:31.300
 but in an artificial relationship,

1:20:31.300 --> 1:20:32.800
 there's ways to bypass all of that

1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:34.280
 and get right to the heart of making someone

1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:35.400
 feel comfortable and safe.

1:20:35.400 --> 1:20:37.680
 I guess the question I'm asking

1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:41.500
 and the thing I was implying is that creating

1:20:41.500 --> 1:20:45.480
 an artificial relationship is an extremely difficult skill

1:20:45.480 --> 1:20:50.480
 to accomplish the level, like how good I am at being me

1:20:51.840 --> 1:20:56.340
 and creating a feeling in another person that I create.

1:20:56.340 --> 1:20:58.260
 For you to do that artificially,

1:20:58.260 --> 1:21:00.400
 that's gotta be, you gotta be,

1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:03.700
 my sense is you gotta be really damn good at that kind of thing.

1:21:03.700 --> 1:21:08.060
 I would venture to say, I mean,

1:21:08.060 --> 1:21:10.100
 I don't know how to measure how difficult the thing is,

1:21:10.100 --> 1:21:13.980
 but especially when you're communicating with people

1:21:13.980 --> 1:21:18.640
 whose job depends on forming trusting relationships,

1:21:18.640 --> 1:21:20.240
 they're gonna smell bullshit.

1:21:21.640 --> 1:21:26.640
 And to get past that bullshit detector is tough.

1:21:27.500 --> 1:21:28.420
 It's a tough skill.

1:21:28.420 --> 1:21:29.260
 Well, it's interesting.

1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:30.980
 So I would say that.

1:21:30.980 --> 1:21:32.700
 Or maybe I'm wrong actually on that.

1:21:32.700 --> 1:21:34.640
 I would say that once you understand the system,

1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:35.540
 it's not that hard.

1:21:35.540 --> 1:21:37.060
 It makes a lot of sense.

1:21:37.060 --> 1:21:39.620
 But I would also say that to your exact point,

1:21:39.620 --> 1:21:42.180
 you are right that people smell bullshit.

1:21:42.180 --> 1:21:43.780
 People smell bullshit.

1:21:43.780 --> 1:21:45.120
 But here's the thing.

1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:48.020
 If you come in smelling like goat shit,

1:21:48.900 --> 1:21:51.860
 you still smell like shit, but you don't smell like bullshit.

1:21:51.860 --> 1:21:53.820
 So they don't count you out right away.

1:21:53.820 --> 1:21:57.100
 And if you come in smelling like rotten tomatoes

1:21:57.100 --> 1:21:59.300
 or if you come in smelling like lavender

1:21:59.300 --> 1:22:00.580
 or if you come in smelling like vanilla

1:22:00.580 --> 1:22:02.460
 or if you come in without any smell at all,

1:22:02.460 --> 1:22:05.700
 all that matters is that you don't smell like bullshit.

1:22:05.700 --> 1:22:10.540
 Here's the thing that's one of the secret sauces of CIA.

1:22:10.540 --> 1:22:14.200
 When you look and act like a spy, people think you're a spy.

1:22:14.200 --> 1:22:16.080
 If you look and act in any other way,

1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:18.240
 you know what they never ever think you are?

1:22:19.620 --> 1:22:21.060
 A spy.

1:22:21.060 --> 1:22:22.220
 They might think you're an idiot.

1:22:22.220 --> 1:22:24.940
 They might think you're trailer trash.

1:22:24.940 --> 1:22:27.700
 They might think that you're a migrant worker,

1:22:27.700 --> 1:22:30.820
 but they never think you're a spy.

1:22:30.820 --> 1:22:35.540
 And that lesson in everyday life is immensely powerful.

1:22:35.540 --> 1:22:39.700
 If you're trying to take your boss's job,

1:22:39.700 --> 1:22:41.740
 as long as you don't ever look like the employee

1:22:41.740 --> 1:22:43.300
 who's trying to take the boss's job,

1:22:43.300 --> 1:22:44.860
 the boss is focused on all the employees

1:22:44.860 --> 1:22:46.640
 who are trying to take his job.

1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:48.980
 Everybody's prioritizing whether they know it or not.

1:22:48.980 --> 1:22:51.820
 The goal is to just not be the one that they're targeting.

1:22:51.820 --> 1:22:54.100
 Target them without them knowing you're targeting them.

1:22:54.100 --> 1:22:58.180
 So people just, when they meet you, they put you in a bin.

1:22:58.180 --> 1:23:01.020
 And if you want to avoid being put in a particular bin,

1:23:01.020 --> 1:23:04.060
 just don't act like the person that would be,

1:23:04.060 --> 1:23:06.180
 just show some kind of characteristics

1:23:06.180 --> 1:23:07.420
 that bin you in some other way.

1:23:07.420 --> 1:23:08.260
 Exactly right.

1:23:08.260 --> 1:23:09.540
 You have to be in a bin.

1:23:09.540 --> 1:23:10.980
 Just choose the bin.

1:23:10.980 --> 1:23:12.300
 All right.

1:23:12.300 --> 1:23:16.860
 So you, knowing these methods,

1:23:16.860 --> 1:23:19.140
 when you talk to people, especially in civilian life,

1:23:19.140 --> 1:23:22.740
 how do you know who's lying to you and not?

1:23:22.740 --> 1:23:26.620
 That gets to be more into the trained skill side of things.

1:23:26.620 --> 1:23:29.920
 There's body cues, there's micro expressions.

1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:31.500
 I'm not a big fan of,

1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:33.940
 I don't believe that micro expressions alone do anything.

1:23:33.940 --> 1:23:35.660
 I also don't believe that micro expressions

1:23:35.660 --> 1:23:37.840
 without an effective baseline do anything.

1:23:37.840 --> 1:23:40.180
 So don't for a second think that I'm,

1:23:40.180 --> 1:23:41.620
 all the people out there pitching

1:23:41.620 --> 1:23:43.080
 that you can tell if someone's lying to you

1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:46.080
 just by looking at their face, it's all baloney.

1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:47.660
 In my world, that's baloney.

1:23:47.660 --> 1:23:49.980
 Like the way you move your eyes or something like that.

1:23:49.980 --> 1:23:51.820
 Without knowing a baseline, without knowing.

1:23:51.820 --> 1:23:53.500
 For that individual. For that individual.

1:23:53.500 --> 1:23:54.420
 Then you actually don't know.

1:23:54.420 --> 1:23:56.540
 And an individual's baseline is based on education,

1:23:56.540 --> 1:23:58.360
 culture, life experience, you name it, right?

1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:00.160
 So this is huge.

1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:03.480
 But when you combine facial expressions

1:24:03.480 --> 1:24:06.900
 with body movements, body language, nonverbal cues,

1:24:06.900 --> 1:24:10.540
 and you add on top of that effective elicitation techniques

1:24:10.540 --> 1:24:12.100
 that you are in control of,

1:24:12.100 --> 1:24:15.320
 now you have a more robust platform

1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:16.500
 to tell if someone's lying to you.

1:24:16.500 --> 1:24:21.500
 So there's like a set of like interrogation trajectories

1:24:22.460 --> 1:24:26.200
 you can go down that can help you figure out a person.

1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:30.420
 Technically they're interview, interview concepts.

1:24:30.420 --> 1:24:31.260
 Correct.

1:24:31.260 --> 1:24:32.260
 Because an interrogation,

1:24:32.260 --> 1:24:33.700
 an interrogation is something very different

1:24:33.700 --> 1:24:34.520
 than an interview.

1:24:34.520 --> 1:24:36.160
 And in the world of professionals,

1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:37.380
 an interrogation is very different.

1:24:37.380 --> 1:24:38.300
 What's the difference?

1:24:38.300 --> 1:24:40.860
 The nature of how relaxed the thing is or what?

1:24:40.860 --> 1:24:44.100
 So in an interrogation, there's a clear pattern of dominance.

1:24:44.100 --> 1:24:45.620
 There's no equality.

1:24:45.620 --> 1:24:47.260
 Also, there's no escape.

1:24:47.260 --> 1:24:49.900
 You are there until the interrogator is done with you.

1:24:49.900 --> 1:24:51.820
 Anybody who's ever been reprimanded by mom and dad

1:24:51.820 --> 1:24:53.160
 knows what an interrogation feels like.

1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:54.860
 Anybody who's ever been called into the principal's office

1:24:54.860 --> 1:24:55.980
 or the boss's office,

1:24:55.980 --> 1:24:57.220
 that's what interrogation feels like.

1:24:57.220 --> 1:24:59.580
 You don't leave until the boss says you can leave.

1:24:59.580 --> 1:25:00.420
 And you're there to say,

1:25:00.420 --> 1:25:02.840
 it's to answer questions the boss asks questions.

1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:05.700
 An interview is an equal exchange of ideas.

1:25:05.700 --> 1:25:09.660
 You are in control of this interview, for sure.

1:25:09.660 --> 1:25:11.540
 But if we were having coffee,

1:25:11.540 --> 1:25:13.420
 I could take control if I wanted to take control.

1:25:13.420 --> 1:25:15.140
 If I wanted to ask you personal questions, I would.

1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:17.620
 If I wanted to talk to you about your background, I could.

1:25:17.620 --> 1:25:19.420
 Why am I in control of this interview exactly?

1:25:19.420 --> 1:25:20.580
 Because the person in control

1:25:20.580 --> 1:25:22.100
 is the person asking questions.

1:25:22.100 --> 1:25:25.860
 I'm sitting here, as you've spoken about,

1:25:26.900 --> 1:25:29.780
 my power here is I'm the quiet one listening.

1:25:30.820 --> 1:25:31.660
 You're exactly right.

1:25:31.660 --> 1:25:33.740
 Guess where this conversation goes?

1:25:33.740 --> 1:25:35.140
 Anywhere you choose to take it,

1:25:35.140 --> 1:25:36.620
 because you're the one asking questions.

1:25:36.620 --> 1:25:38.300
 Every time I answer a question,

1:25:38.300 --> 1:25:41.680
 I am creating a pattern of obedience to you,

1:25:41.680 --> 1:25:43.300
 which subliminally, subconsciously,

1:25:43.300 --> 1:25:45.780
 makes me that much more apt to answer your questions.

1:25:45.780 --> 1:25:48.820
 Of course, you can always turn and start asking me questions.

1:25:48.820 --> 1:25:53.820
 But you're saying that through conversation,

1:25:53.900 --> 1:25:55.540
 you can call it interviewing,

1:25:55.540 --> 1:25:59.820
 you can start to see cracks

1:26:02.740 --> 1:26:05.580
 in the story of the person

1:26:05.580 --> 1:26:08.500
 and the degree to which they exaggerate or lie

1:26:08.500 --> 1:26:13.060
 or to see how much they can be trusted, that kind of stuff.

1:26:13.060 --> 1:26:15.020
 What I'm saying is that through a conversation,

1:26:15.020 --> 1:26:16.740
 you develop a baseline.

1:26:16.740 --> 1:26:20.140
 Even just in the first part of our conversation,

1:26:20.140 --> 1:26:23.140
 I've been able to create some baseline elements about you.

1:26:23.140 --> 1:26:25.580
 You've been able to create baseline elements about me.

1:26:25.580 --> 1:26:27.620
 Maybe they're just not a friend of mine.

1:26:27.620 --> 1:26:28.900
 From those baselines,

1:26:28.900 --> 1:26:33.060
 now we can push through more intentional questions

1:26:33.060 --> 1:26:36.980
 to test whether or not the person is being truthful

1:26:36.980 --> 1:26:39.100
 because they're operating within their baseline,

1:26:39.100 --> 1:26:42.480
 or if you are triggering sensitivities

1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:43.480
 outside of their baseline,

1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:45.460
 and then you can start to see their tells.

1:26:45.460 --> 1:26:46.300
 That's fascinating.

1:26:46.300 --> 1:26:49.460
 Yeah, baseline, even the tells, right?

1:26:49.460 --> 1:26:50.300
 The eye contact.

1:26:50.300 --> 1:26:52.320
 You've probably already formed a baseline

1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:54.580
 that I have trouble making eye contact.

1:26:54.580 --> 1:26:56.900
 And so if you ask me difficult questions

1:26:56.900 --> 1:26:58.300
 and I'm not making eye contact,

1:26:58.300 --> 1:27:01.140
 maybe that's not a good signal of me lying or whatever.

1:27:01.140 --> 1:27:01.980
 Correct.

1:27:01.980 --> 1:27:04.140
 Because I always have trouble making eye contact,

1:27:04.140 --> 1:27:04.980
 stuff like that.

1:27:04.980 --> 1:27:06.020
 That's really fascinating.

1:27:06.020 --> 1:27:07.740
 The majority of your eye movement is to the right?

1:27:07.740 --> 1:27:08.580
 Yeah.

1:27:08.580 --> 1:27:10.300
 Your right, my left, right?

1:27:10.300 --> 1:27:11.540
 Which is usually someone who's,

1:27:11.540 --> 1:27:13.460
 if you ask micro expressionists,

1:27:13.460 --> 1:27:15.620
 that's someone who's referencing fact.

1:27:15.620 --> 1:27:16.460
 Yeah.

1:27:16.460 --> 1:27:18.020
 That's not necessarily what's happening for you

1:27:18.020 --> 1:27:19.780
 because you're pulling concepts out of the air.

1:27:19.780 --> 1:27:20.620
 So it's also a place

1:27:20.620 --> 1:27:22.060
 where you reference something other than fact.

1:27:22.060 --> 1:27:24.020
 It's a place for you to find creativity.

1:27:24.020 --> 1:27:25.420
 So if I just thought that you were lying

1:27:25.420 --> 1:27:28.020
 because you look up and to the right, I would be wrong.

1:27:28.020 --> 1:27:29.300
 That's so fascinating.

1:27:29.300 --> 1:27:31.340
 And a lot of that has to do with like habits

1:27:31.340 --> 1:27:33.100
 that are formed and all those kinds of things,

1:27:33.100 --> 1:27:35.940
 or maybe some right hand, left hand type of situation.

1:27:35.940 --> 1:27:36.860
 Right eye dominance.

1:27:36.860 --> 1:27:37.700
 Yeah, right eye dominance.

1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:39.060
 It's gonna make you look to the right.

1:27:39.060 --> 1:27:40.800
 Is this a science or an art?

1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:41.780
 It's a bit of both.

1:27:41.780 --> 1:27:44.180
 I would say that like all good art,

1:27:44.180 --> 1:27:47.460
 art is taught from a foundation of skills.

1:27:47.460 --> 1:27:51.060
 And those skills are played,

1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:53.660
 are taught in a very structured manner.

1:27:53.660 --> 1:27:57.300
 And then the way that you use the skills after that,

1:27:57.300 --> 1:27:59.460
 that's more of the artistic grace.

1:27:59.460 --> 1:28:01.780
 So I've always called espionage an art.

1:28:01.780 --> 1:28:03.500
 Spying is an art.

1:28:03.500 --> 1:28:06.040
 Being able to hack human beings is an art,

1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:08.260
 but it's all based in a foundation of science.

1:28:08.260 --> 1:28:10.300
 You still have to learn how to mix the color palette

1:28:10.300 --> 1:28:11.660
 and use certain brushes.

1:28:11.660 --> 1:28:16.060
 Do you think of that as a kind of the study

1:28:16.060 --> 1:28:17.540
 of human psychology?

1:28:17.540 --> 1:28:20.460
 Is that what a psychologist does or a psychiatrist?

1:28:20.460 --> 1:28:25.460
 What from this process have you learned about human nature?

1:28:25.700 --> 1:28:26.660
 Human nature.

1:28:26.660 --> 1:28:30.060
 I mean, I suppose the answer to that could be a book,

1:28:30.060 --> 1:28:32.260
 but it probably will be a book.

1:28:32.260 --> 1:28:33.300
 I'll save you that, yeah.

1:28:33.300 --> 1:28:38.300
 But is there things that are surprising about human nature,

1:28:38.300 --> 1:28:43.440
 surprising to us civilians that you could speak to?

1:28:43.440 --> 1:28:46.800
 Yes, one thing is extremely surprising about human nature,

1:28:47.900 --> 1:28:49.240
 which is funny, because that's not the answer

1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:50.080
 I would have said.

1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:52.880
 So I'm glad that you clarified this specific question.

1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:55.900
 The thing that's surprising about human nature

1:28:55.900 --> 1:29:00.900
 is that human beings long, like in their soul,

1:29:02.780 --> 1:29:06.780
 there's like a painful longing to be with other people.

1:29:06.780 --> 1:29:08.700
 And that's really surprising,

1:29:08.700 --> 1:29:11.380
 because we all wanna pretend like we're strong.

1:29:11.380 --> 1:29:14.020
 We all wanna pretend like we're independent.

1:29:14.020 --> 1:29:18.760
 We all wanna pretend like we are the masters of our destiny.

1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:22.100
 But what's truly consistent in all people

1:29:22.100 --> 1:29:27.100
 is this longing to commune with others like us.

1:29:29.260 --> 1:29:33.140
 My more practical answer about what I've learned

1:29:33.140 --> 1:29:36.460
 to be the truth is that human nature is predictable.

1:29:36.460 --> 1:29:38.860
 And that predictability is what gives people

1:29:38.860 --> 1:29:41.760
 an incredible advantage over other people.

1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:43.420
 But that's not the surprising piece.

1:29:43.420 --> 1:29:45.060
 I mean, even when CIA taught me

1:29:45.060 --> 1:29:47.420
 that human nature is predictable, it just made sense.

1:29:47.420 --> 1:29:49.020
 I was like, oh yeah, that makes sense.

1:29:49.020 --> 1:29:52.620
 But what I never ever anticipated was

1:29:52.620 --> 1:29:54.020
 no matter where I've been in the world,

1:29:54.020 --> 1:29:54.980
 no matter who I've talked to,

1:29:54.980 --> 1:29:59.260
 no matter what socioeconomic bracket is that longing,

1:29:59.260 --> 1:30:00.980
 man, it hurts.

1:30:00.980 --> 1:30:04.460
 Loneliness sucks, and togetherness feels good,

1:30:04.460 --> 1:30:05.800
 even if you're together with someone

1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:07.220
 you know isn't the right person.

1:30:07.220 --> 1:30:09.260
 It still feels better than being alone.

1:30:09.260 --> 1:30:11.460
 I mean, that's such a deep truth you speak to,

1:30:11.460 --> 1:30:15.020
 and I could talk about that for a long time.

1:30:15.020 --> 1:30:18.580
 There is, I mean, through these conversations in general,

1:30:18.580 --> 1:30:20.560
 whether it's being recorded or not,

1:30:21.900 --> 1:30:26.900
 I hunger to discover in the other person that longing.

1:30:27.060 --> 1:30:29.020
 You strip away the other things,

1:30:29.020 --> 1:30:32.300
 and then you share in the longing for that connection.

1:30:32.300 --> 1:30:35.940
 And I particularly also have detected that in people

1:30:38.620 --> 1:30:42.180
 from all walks of life, including people

1:30:42.180 --> 1:30:47.180
 that others might identify as evil or hard,

1:30:47.940 --> 1:30:52.600
 as completely cold, it's there.

1:30:52.600 --> 1:30:53.440
 It's there.

1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:56.980
 They've hardened themselves in their search,

1:30:56.980 --> 1:30:59.140
 and who knows what dark place their brain is in,

1:30:59.140 --> 1:31:03.620
 their heart is in, but that longing is still there.

1:31:03.620 --> 1:31:06.260
 Even if it's an ember, it's there.

1:31:06.260 --> 1:31:11.120
 It's the reason why in World War I and World War II,

1:31:11.120 --> 1:31:13.900
 you know, enemy combatants still shared cigarettes

1:31:13.900 --> 1:31:17.380
 on the front lines during periods of holidays

1:31:17.380 --> 1:31:18.940
 or bad weather or whatever else,

1:31:18.940 --> 1:31:22.900
 because that human connection, man, it triumphs over all.

1:31:22.900 --> 1:31:27.900
 See, that's in part of what I refer to when I say love,

1:31:27.900 --> 1:31:31.980
 because I feel like if political leaders

1:31:31.980 --> 1:31:34.740
 and people in conflict at the small scale

1:31:34.740 --> 1:31:39.740
 and the large scale were able to tune into that longing,

1:31:42.300 --> 1:31:45.340
 to seek in each other that basic longing

1:31:45.340 --> 1:31:49.460
 for human connection, a lot of problems could be solved.

1:31:49.460 --> 1:31:52.980
 But of course, it's difficult,

1:31:52.980 --> 1:31:56.000
 because it's a game of chicken.

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:59.640
 It's if you open yourself up to reveal

1:31:59.640 --> 1:32:02.600
 that longing for connection with others,

1:32:02.600 --> 1:32:03.760
 people can hurt you.

1:32:03.760 --> 1:32:04.920
 Well, I would go a step farther,

1:32:04.920 --> 1:32:08.920
 and I would say that taking the connection away,

1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:13.920
 punishing, penalizing people by removing the connection

1:32:14.760 --> 1:32:18.120
 is a powerful tool, and that's what we see.

1:32:18.120 --> 1:32:20.000
 That's why we send people to jail.

1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.320
 That's why we put economic sanctions on countries.

1:32:22.320 --> 1:32:24.240
 That's why we ground our children

1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:25.840
 and send them to their rooms.

1:32:25.840 --> 1:32:27.560
 We are penalizing them.

1:32:27.560 --> 1:32:31.400
 Whether we know it or not, we're using punitive damage

1:32:31.400 --> 1:32:33.640
 by taking away that basic human connection,

1:32:33.640 --> 1:32:36.440
 that longing for community.

1:32:36.440 --> 1:32:40.440
 What was your recruitment process and training process

1:32:40.440 --> 1:32:45.440
 and things you could speak to in the CIA?

1:32:46.140 --> 1:32:50.000
 As I was leaving the Air Force, all that was on my mind,

1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:52.560
 I don't know what you were like at 27,

1:32:52.560 --> 1:32:54.960
 but I was a total tip shit at 27.

1:32:54.960 --> 1:32:57.480
 I'm not much better now at 42, but.

1:32:57.480 --> 1:32:58.320
 You and me, Bill.

1:32:58.320 --> 1:33:03.320
 Yeah, but I was like, I just wanted to be anything

1:33:04.960 --> 1:33:06.920
 other than a military officer,

1:33:06.920 --> 1:33:09.480
 so I was actually in the process of applying

1:33:09.480 --> 1:33:12.320
 to the Peace Corps through this thing called the internet,

1:33:12.320 --> 1:33:16.000
 which was still fairly rudimentary in 2007.

1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:18.680
 I had a computer lab that we went to,

1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:20.160
 and it had 10 computers in it,

1:33:20.160 --> 1:33:21.460
 and you had to log in and log out,

1:33:21.460 --> 1:33:22.960
 and slow internet and everything else,

1:33:22.960 --> 1:33:25.320
 but anyways, I was filling out an online application

1:33:25.320 --> 1:33:28.040
 to go work in the US Peace Corps.

1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:29.980
 I wanted to grow my hair out.

1:33:29.980 --> 1:33:33.120
 I wanted to stop wearing shoes that were shiny.

1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:35.120
 I wanted to meet a hippie chick

1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:37.320
 and have hippie babies in the wild

1:33:37.320 --> 1:33:40.480
 teaching Nigerian children how to read,

1:33:40.480 --> 1:33:42.580
 so that was the path I was going down,

1:33:42.580 --> 1:33:45.520
 and as I filled in all of my details,

1:33:45.520 --> 1:33:47.360
 there came this page that popped up,

1:33:47.360 --> 1:33:48.820
 and it was this blinking red page,

1:33:48.820 --> 1:33:50.400
 and it said, stop here.

1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:53.280
 You may qualify for other government positions.

1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:55.460
 If you're willing to put your application

1:33:55.460 --> 1:33:57.480
 on hold for 72 hours,

1:33:57.480 --> 1:33:59.800
 that gives us a chance to reach out to you,

1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:02.280
 so again, 27 year old dipshit.

1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:05.080
 I was like, sure, I'll put myself on hold

1:34:05.080 --> 1:34:07.440
 if I might qualify for other government opportunities,

1:34:07.440 --> 1:34:09.520
 and then about a day later, I got a phone call

1:34:09.520 --> 1:34:11.880
 from an almost unlisted number.

1:34:11.880 --> 1:34:15.020
 It just said 703, which was very strange to see

1:34:15.020 --> 1:34:18.640
 on my flip phone at the time, just one 703 area code,

1:34:18.640 --> 1:34:23.360
 and I picked it up, and it was a person

1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:25.160
 from Northern Virginia asking me

1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:27.120
 if I would be telling me that I was qualified

1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:29.540
 for a position in national security,

1:34:29.540 --> 1:34:32.160
 and if I would be interested, they'll pay for my ticket

1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:35.100
 and fly me up to Langley, Virginia.

1:34:35.100 --> 1:34:36.560
 They didn't say CIA.

1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:37.920
 They said Langley.

1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:39.320
 I put one on one together, and I was like,

1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:43.040
 maybe this is CIA, like, how cool is this?

1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:44.400
 Or maybe this is all make believe,

1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:46.160
 and this is totally fake, so either way,

1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:47.600
 it doesn't hurt me at all to say yes.

1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:50.480
 They already have my phone number, so yes, yes, yes,

1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:52.080
 and then I remember thinking,

1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:54.760
 there's no way that happened, and this isn't real,

1:34:54.760 --> 1:34:57.560
 and then a day later, I got FedEx

1:34:57.560 --> 1:35:00.160
 or an overnight delivery of an airplane ticket

1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:03.240
 and a hotel reservation and a rental car reservation,

1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:05.720
 and then I just kept doing the next thing,

1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:07.880
 which I found out later on is a form of control.

1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:10.560
 You just do the next thing that they tell you to do,

1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:12.480
 and then before I knew it, I was interviewing

1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:15.040
 in a nondescript building with a person

1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:17.760
 who only told me their first name for a position

1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:19.360
 with the National Clandestine Service.

1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:21.280
 So you never really got a chance to think about it

1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:23.080
 because there's small steps along the way,

1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:24.640
 and it kind of just leads you,

1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:29.920
 and maybe your personality is such that.

1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:30.800
 That's an adventure.

1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:34.320
 It's an adventure, and because it's one step at a time,

1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:36.440
 you don't necessarily see the negative consequences

1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:37.280
 of the adventure.

1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:38.980
 You don't think about any of that.

1:35:38.980 --> 1:35:41.680
 You're just stepping into the adventure.

1:35:41.680 --> 1:35:42.520
 And it's easy.

1:35:42.520 --> 1:35:43.680
 There's no work involved.

1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:44.980
 Somebody else is doing all the work,

1:35:44.980 --> 1:35:46.400
 telling me where to be and when.

1:35:46.400 --> 1:35:48.320
 It's a lot like basic training in the military.

1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:49.880
 Anybody who's ever been through basic training

1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:52.240
 will tell you they hated the first few days,

1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:54.540
 and then by the end, it was really comforting

1:35:54.540 --> 1:35:56.440
 because you just did what you were told.

1:35:56.440 --> 1:35:57.540
 They told you when to eat.

1:35:57.540 --> 1:35:59.260
 They made the decision of what to eat,

1:35:59.260 --> 1:36:01.280
 and then you just, you marched when they told you to march,

1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:03.040
 shined your shoes when they told you to shine your shoes.

1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:06.360
 Human beings love being told what to do.

1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:08.760
 What about the training process

1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:13.760
 for becoming a covert CIA agent?

1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:19.000
 Yeah, so the interview process is.

1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.080
 Yeah, the interview process, too.

1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:22.640
 How rigorous was that?

1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:23.840
 It was very rigorous.

1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:26.100
 That was where it became difficult.

1:36:26.100 --> 1:36:28.620
 Everything up to the first interview was easy,

1:36:28.620 --> 1:36:30.320
 but there's three interviews,

1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:31.600
 and some people are lucky enough

1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:34.580
 to have four or five interviews if something goes wrong

1:36:34.580 --> 1:36:37.640
 or something goes awry with the first few interviews.

1:36:37.640 --> 1:36:40.000
 And again, this might be dated from what I went through,

1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:43.400
 but during the interview process is when they start,

1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:45.600
 they do your psychological evaluations.

1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:50.600
 They do your, they do personality assessments.

1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:53.080
 They do skills assessments.

1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:56.640
 They'll start sending you back to wherever you're living

1:36:56.640 --> 1:36:59.840
 with assignments, not intel assignments,

1:36:59.840 --> 1:37:02.700
 but actual homework assignments.

1:37:02.700 --> 1:37:05.460
 Write an essay about three parts of the world

1:37:05.460 --> 1:37:08.080
 that you think will be most impacted

1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:09.400
 in the next three to five years,

1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:12.760
 or prioritize the top three strategic priorities

1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:16.440
 for the United States and put it into 250 words

1:37:16.440 --> 1:37:19.260
 or 2,500 words and whatever else,

1:37:19.260 --> 1:37:21.200
 double spaced in this font, yada, yada, yada,

1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:22.520
 like super specific stuff.

1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:24.040
 It's kind of stressful,

1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:26.040
 but it's just like going back to college again.

1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:27.800
 So you go through all of those acts,

1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:30.640
 and then you submit this stuff to some PO box

1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:33.120
 that doesn't have anybody that's ever gonna respond to you,

1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:34.240
 and then you hope.

1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:36.280
 You just send it into the ether,

1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:38.400
 and you hope that you sent it right.

1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:40.080
 You hope that you wrote well enough.

1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:42.440
 You hope that your assessment was right,

1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:43.320
 whatever else it might be,

1:37:43.320 --> 1:37:45.720
 and then eventually get another phone call that says,

1:37:45.720 --> 1:37:46.800
 hey, we received your package.

1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:49.520
 You've been moved to the next level of interview,

1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:52.080
 and now we need you to go to this other nondescript building

1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:53.560
 in this other nondescript city,

1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:55.640
 and then you start meeting.

1:37:55.640 --> 1:37:59.520
 You start sitting in waiting rooms

1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:00.540
 with other groups of people

1:38:00.540 --> 1:38:02.660
 who are at the same phase of interview with you,

1:38:02.660 --> 1:38:04.520
 which were some of the coolest experiences

1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:05.880
 that I remember still.

1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:07.360
 One of my best friends to this day,

1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:10.240
 who I don't get to talk to because he's still undercover,

1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:12.240
 is a guy I met during those interview processes,

1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:14.120
 and I was like, oh, we met.

1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:14.960
 I saw what he was wearing.

1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:16.800
 He saw what I was wearing.

1:38:16.800 --> 1:38:17.620
 I was brown.

1:38:17.620 --> 1:38:18.460
 So you immediately connected,

1:38:18.460 --> 1:38:19.760
 and you liked the people there.

1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:20.600
 Close.

1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:22.600
 More like we immediately judge each other,

1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:24.080
 because we're all untrained.

1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:26.160
 So he looked at me, and he was like,

1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:28.360
 brown dude with crazy hair, and I was wearing,

1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:29.780
 dude, I was dressed like a total ass.

1:38:29.780 --> 1:38:32.720
 I was dressed in a clubbing shirt.

1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:33.880
 I don't know why I thought it would be a good idea

1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:36.480
 to go to a CIA interview in a clubbing shirt

1:38:36.480 --> 1:38:39.180
 with my buttons unbuttoned down to here.

1:38:39.180 --> 1:38:40.560
 And he was like, yeah, you were really,

1:38:40.560 --> 1:38:42.160
 after we got in, he was like,

1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:43.760
 yeah, dude, you were always really cool to talk to,

1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:46.760
 but I was like, there's no way that idiot's getting in.

1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:48.020
 And I remember looking at him and being like,

1:38:48.020 --> 1:38:50.200
 dude, you were just another white guy in a black suit.

1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:52.560
 They're not looking for you, but here you are.

1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:54.440
 So it was just, those kinds of things were so interesting,

1:38:54.440 --> 1:38:55.400
 because we were totally wrong

1:38:55.400 --> 1:38:56.840
 about what CIA was looking for.

1:38:56.840 --> 1:38:59.920
 Until you're in, you have no idea what they're looking for.

1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:02.640
 And you're just shooting in the dark.

1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:05.880
 Did they have you do like a lie detector test?

1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:07.400
 Yes, it's called a polygraph.

1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:08.560
 Polygraph.

1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:10.040
 How effective, just interesting,

1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:12.840
 or our previous discussion, how effective are those?

1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:14.080
 Polygraphs are really interesting.

1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:16.440
 So one of the things that people don't understand

1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:17.880
 about polygraphs is that polygraphs

1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:19.440
 aren't meant to detect a lie.

1:39:19.440 --> 1:39:21.400
 Like they're called a lie detector,

1:39:21.400 --> 1:39:23.840
 but they're not actually meant to detect a lie.

1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:27.280
 They're built to detect variants

1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:29.680
 from your physiological baseline.

1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:33.360
 So they're essentially meant to identify sensitivities

1:39:33.360 --> 1:39:35.240
 to certain types of questions.

1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:37.400
 And then as they identify a sensitivity to a question,

1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:40.600
 it gives the interviewer an additional piece of information

1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:43.020
 to direct the next round of questions.

1:39:43.020 --> 1:39:44.520
 So then from there, they can kind of see

1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:46.840
 how sensitive you are to a certain level of questions.

1:39:46.840 --> 1:39:50.720
 And your sensitivity could be a sign of dishonesty,

1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:54.520
 but it could also be a sign of vulnerability.

1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:57.360
 So the interrogator themselves, the interviewer themselves,

1:39:57.360 --> 1:39:59.880
 they're the one that have to make the judgment call

1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:00.720
 as to which one it is,

1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:03.580
 which is why you might see multiple interviewers

1:40:03.580 --> 1:40:05.840
 over the course of multiple polygraphs.

1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:07.400
 But that's really what they're all about.

1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:11.280
 So, I mean, outside of, they're extremely uncomfortable,

1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:13.360
 like they're mentally uncomfortable,

1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:15.780
 but then there's also, you sit on a pad

1:40:15.780 --> 1:40:17.280
 because the pad is supposed to be able to tell

1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:20.920
 like your body movements, but also like your sphincter

1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:22.200
 contractions or whatever.

1:40:22.200 --> 1:40:24.560
 So you're sitting on this pad, you're plugged in,

1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:26.280
 you're strapped in, you're tied up,

1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:28.040
 and it takes so much time to get in there.

1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:30.080
 And then they start asking you questions,

1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:31.240
 baseline questions at first,

1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:33.240
 and then other questions from there.

1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:35.260
 And you're just answering the best you can.

1:40:35.260 --> 1:40:36.320
 And you never know what they're seeing

1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:37.160
 and you don't know what they're doing.

1:40:37.160 --> 1:40:39.640
 And it's really hard not to get anxious of that anyways.

1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:40.460
 And then...

1:40:40.460 --> 1:40:42.360
 Are they the whole time monitoring the readings?

1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:45.020
 Yeah, from like a big, they've got multiple screens

1:40:45.020 --> 1:40:47.800
 and they've got just, it's all information superiority.

1:40:47.800 --> 1:40:49.980
 They have information superiority.

1:40:49.980 --> 1:40:51.440
 You're the idiot looking away from them

1:40:51.440 --> 1:40:54.660
 or looking sideways of them and trying not to move

1:40:54.660 --> 1:40:57.040
 because you're afraid that if you like have gas

1:40:57.040 --> 1:40:57.880
 or if you move a little bit,

1:40:57.880 --> 1:40:59.600
 it's gonna bury you from your baseline.

1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:01.240
 And the whole time you're worried, your heart's racing

1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:02.360
 and your blood pressure's increasing,

1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:04.320
 which is a variance from baseline.

1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:06.480
 So yeah, that means it's an interesting art.

1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:07.640
 Or your baseline.

1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:08.480
 Correct.

1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:09.560
 Maybe there's some people that are just chilling

1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:11.800
 the whole time and that's their baseline.

1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:12.880
 Right, right.

1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:14.020
 But that's what they're doing.

1:41:14.020 --> 1:41:14.880
 They're establishing a baseline.

1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:16.840
 I mean, I guess that means the polygraph

1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:21.840
 is a skill that you develop to do it well.

1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:24.380
 So when people talk about beating a lie detector,

1:41:24.380 --> 1:41:26.200
 it's not that they're telling an effective lie.

1:41:26.200 --> 1:41:27.040
 That's not hard.

1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:30.220
 It's not hard to tell a lie to an interviewer.

1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:32.280
 And the interviewer doesn't care

1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:34.260
 if you're being honest or not honest about a topic.

1:41:34.260 --> 1:41:36.760
 What they're looking for is sensitivity.

1:41:36.760 --> 1:41:40.680
 If they see no sensitivity, that's a big sign for them.

1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:43.500
 That's a big sign that you're probably a pathological liar.

1:41:43.500 --> 1:41:46.880
 If you show sensitivity to many things,

1:41:46.880 --> 1:41:49.280
 then that's a sign that you're probably an anxious person

1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:51.640
 and they can still reset their baseline

1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:53.680
 because they can tell how your anxiety

1:41:53.680 --> 1:41:56.720
 is increasing in 15 minute increments.

1:41:56.720 --> 1:41:58.520
 It's a unique skill.

1:41:58.520 --> 1:42:02.000
 I mean, a really good polygrapher is immensely valuable.

1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.160
 But yeah, it's the misnomers,

1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:07.200
 the misconceptions about polygraphs are vast.

1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:09.540
 You also mentioned personality tests.

1:42:09.540 --> 1:42:10.920
 That's really interesting.

1:42:10.920 --> 1:42:14.000
 So how effective are personality tests?

1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:15.360
 One for the hiring process,

1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:17.320
 but also for understanding a human being.

1:42:17.320 --> 1:42:19.820
 So personality is extremely important

1:42:19.820 --> 1:42:20.800
 for understanding human being.

1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:22.740
 And I would say that there's a thousand different ways

1:42:22.740 --> 1:42:23.580
 of looking at personality.

1:42:23.580 --> 1:42:28.080
 The only one that I count with any significance is the MBTI.

1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:30.500
 And the MBTI is what all the leading spy agencies

1:42:30.500 --> 1:42:32.400
 around the world use as well.

1:42:32.400 --> 1:42:34.000
 Well, that's kind of interesting to hear.

1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:34.840
 Oh yeah.

1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:36.480
 So there's been criticisms of that kind of test.

1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:38.360
 There have been criticisms for a long time.

1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:40.200
 Yeah, and you think there's value.

1:42:40.200 --> 1:42:41.400
 Absolutely, absolutely.

1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:43.140
 And there's a few reasons why, right?

1:42:43.140 --> 1:42:45.520
 So first, MBTI makes the claim

1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:49.240
 that your core personality doesn't change over time.

1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:51.720
 And that's how it's calibrated.

1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:53.280
 And one of the big arguments is that people say

1:42:53.280 --> 1:42:55.720
 that your personality can change over time.

1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:59.600
 Now, in my experience, the MBTI is exactly correct.

1:42:59.600 --> 1:43:01.640
 Your core personality does not change

1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:04.400
 because your core personality is defined

1:43:04.400 --> 1:43:08.880
 as your personality when all resources are removed.

1:43:08.880 --> 1:43:13.300
 So essentially, your emergency mode, your dire conditions,

1:43:13.300 --> 1:43:15.580
 that is your core personality.

1:43:15.580 --> 1:43:18.280
 We can all act a little more extroverted.

1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:21.680
 We can all be a little more empathetic

1:43:21.680 --> 1:43:25.040
 when we have tons of time and money and patience.

1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:27.160
 When you strip away all that time, money, and patience,

1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:28.700
 how empathetic are you?

1:43:28.700 --> 1:43:31.320
 How much do you like being around other people?

1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:33.040
 How much do you like being alone?

1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:37.120
 Do you make judgments or do you analyze information?

1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:38.840
 That's what's so powerful about MBTI

1:43:38.840 --> 1:43:40.600
 is it's talking about what people are like

1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:42.320
 when you strip away resources.

1:43:42.320 --> 1:43:44.280
 And then because it's so consistent,

1:43:44.280 --> 1:43:46.380
 it's also only four codes.

1:43:46.380 --> 1:43:50.600
 It's super easy to be able to assess a human being

1:43:50.600 --> 1:43:54.000
 through a dialogue, through a series of conversations,

1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:57.420
 to be able to hone in with high accuracy

1:43:57.420 --> 1:44:00.600
 what is there for letter code.

1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:04.120
 There's only 16 options and it becomes extremely valuable.

1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:08.600
 Is it perfectly precise and does everybody do it the same?

1:44:08.600 --> 1:44:10.920
 I mean, those things are, the answers to those are no,

1:44:10.920 --> 1:44:15.200
 but is it operationally useful in a short period of time?

1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:18.240
 That is a resoundingly powerful yes.

1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:20.360
 Yeah, I just, I only know, I think the first letter,

1:44:20.360 --> 1:44:22.360
 it's introverted and extroverted, right?

1:44:23.480 --> 1:44:25.500
 I've taken the test before,

1:44:25.500 --> 1:44:27.640
 just like a crude version of the test

1:44:27.640 --> 1:44:30.300
 and that's the same problem you have with IQ tests.

1:44:30.300 --> 1:44:33.200
 There's the right thorough way of doing it

1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:34.880
 and there's like fun internet way.

1:44:34.880 --> 1:44:39.880
 And do you mind sharing what your personality?

1:44:42.680 --> 1:44:43.840
 My type index?

1:44:43.840 --> 1:44:44.680
 Yes.

1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:46.800
 I'm an ENTP, that's an extrovert,

1:44:46.800 --> 1:44:51.800
 intuitive, perceiver, thinker, ENT, thinker, P, perceiver.

1:44:54.320 --> 1:44:59.200
 My wife is an ISFJ, which is the polar opposite of me.

1:44:59.200 --> 1:45:01.280
 E, I'm extroverted, she's introverted,

1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:05.200
 I'm an intuitor, she's a sensor, I'm a thinker,

1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:07.520
 she's a feeler, I'm a perceiver, she's a judger.

1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:10.640
 Is there good science on like longterm

1:45:10.640 --> 1:45:13.880
 successful relationships in terms of the dynamics of that,

1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:16.680
 the 16, I wonder if there's good data on this.

1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:19.680
 I don't think there's a lot of good data

1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:23.320
 in personalities writ large because there's not a lot

1:45:23.320 --> 1:45:26.600
 of money to be made in personality testing,

1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:31.600
 but I would say that with experience,

1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:36.200
 with a good MBTI test, with a good paid test,

1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:38.880
 a 400, 500 question test,

1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:41.200
 once you understand your own code

1:45:41.200 --> 1:45:44.920
 and then you're taught how to assess the code of others,

1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:46.640
 with those two things kind of combined

1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:48.800
 because then you have experience and learning,

1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:53.800
 it becomes very useful and you can have high confidence

1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:56.560
 in the conclusions that you reach about

1:45:56.560 --> 1:45:59.960
 people's professions, about people's relationships

1:45:59.960 --> 1:46:02.480
 with family, about people's relationships professionally,

1:46:02.480 --> 1:46:05.080
 people's capabilities to deal with stress,

1:46:05.080 --> 1:46:08.000
 how people will perform when pushed outside

1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:10.460
 of their comfort zones, really, really powerful,

1:46:10.460 --> 1:46:14.120
 useful stuff in corporate world and in the espionage world.

1:46:14.120 --> 1:46:16.820
 So in terms of compressed representation

1:46:16.820 --> 1:46:20.880
 of another human being, you can't do much better

1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:21.960
 than those four letters.

1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:23.240
 I don't believe you can do much better.

1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:26.360
 In my experience, I have not seen anything better.

1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:30.800
 Yeah, it is kind of, it's difficult to realize

1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:32.080
 that there is a core personality

1:46:32.080 --> 1:46:35.600
 or to the degree that's true, it seems to be true.

1:46:35.600 --> 1:46:38.040
 It's even more difficult to realize

1:46:38.040 --> 1:46:42.760
 that there is a stable, at least the science says so,

1:46:42.760 --> 1:46:47.760
 a stable, consistent intelligence, unfortunately,

1:46:48.240 --> 1:46:51.000
 you know, the G factor that they call,

1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.260
 that if you do a barrage of IQ tests,

1:46:53.260 --> 1:46:57.080
 that's going to consistently represent that G factor.

1:46:57.080 --> 1:46:59.360
 And we're all born with that, we can't fix it.

1:46:59.360 --> 1:47:01.900
 And that defines so much of who we are.

1:47:01.900 --> 1:47:03.040
 It's sad.

1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:06.280
 I don't see it as sad, because it's, for me,

1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:08.960
 the faster you learn it, the faster you learn

1:47:08.960 --> 1:47:13.960
 what your own sort of natural strengths and weaknesses are,

1:47:14.060 --> 1:47:16.360
 the faster you get to stop wasting time

1:47:17.400 --> 1:47:19.160
 on things that you're never gonna be good at,

1:47:19.160 --> 1:47:21.120
 and you get to double down on the things

1:47:21.120 --> 1:47:23.520
 that you're already naturally skilled or interested in.

1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:26.560
 So there's always a silver lining to a cloud.

1:47:26.560 --> 1:47:29.600
 But I know now that I will never be a ballerina

1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:32.160
 or a ballerino, I know that I'll never be an artist,

1:47:32.160 --> 1:47:35.260
 I'll never be a musician, I'll never be any of those things.

1:47:35.260 --> 1:47:37.600
 And when I was 18, that might've made me sad,

1:47:37.600 --> 1:47:40.600
 but now at 42, I'm like, well, shit, awesome.

1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:44.120
 I can go be something else good instead of always being bad.

1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:46.600
 You're not gonna be a ballerina, ballerino.

1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:48.560
 Because I'm not graceful.

1:47:48.560 --> 1:47:51.600
 And you've learned this through years of experience.

1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:52.620
 Yeah, exactly.

1:47:52.620 --> 1:47:55.000
 Well, I don't know if there's an MBTI equivalent

1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:56.840
 for grace of movement.

1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:58.840
 I think it's called S sensor.

1:47:58.840 --> 1:47:59.680
 Oh, okay.

1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:02.200
 Yeah, because a sensor is someone who's able

1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:03.520
 to interact with the world around them

1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:06.120
 through their five senses very effectively.

1:48:06.120 --> 1:48:08.800
 Like if you talk to dancers, dancers can actually feel

1:48:08.800 --> 1:48:10.720
 the grace in all of their muscles.

1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:13.520
 They know what position their finger is in.

1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:14.360
 I don't have any idea.

1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:15.920
 I don't know what position my feet are in right now.

1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:18.600
 I had to look to make sure I actually feel the floor right.

1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:20.320
 Yeah, I definitely have.

1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:21.360
 Oh, that's good to know.

1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:25.640
 So I don't, I'm not a dancer, but I do have that.

1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:27.360
 You're a musician, man.

1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:29.760
 Well, the music, I don't know if that's for sure.

1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:32.380
 Yeah, that's true that there is that physical component,

1:48:32.380 --> 1:48:33.760
 but I think deeper,

1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:35.860
 cause there's a technical aspect to that.

1:48:35.860 --> 1:48:39.000
 That's just like, it's less about feel,

1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:43.520
 but I do know jujitsu and grappling I've done all my life.

1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:46.600
 I don't, you know, there's some people who are clumsy

1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:47.680
 and they drop stuff all the time.

1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:49.120
 They run into stuff.

1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:51.920
 I don't, I don't, first of all, I don't know how that happens,

1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:54.680
 but to me, I just have an awareness of stuff.

1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:56.760
 Like if there's a little orientation.

1:48:56.760 --> 1:49:00.520
 Yeah, like, like I know that there's a small object

1:49:00.520 --> 1:49:03.760
 I have to step over and I have a good sense of that.

1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:04.960
 It's so, it's so interesting.

1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:06.440
 Yeah, you're just like born with that or something.

1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:09.560
 My wife is brilliant and she still walks into doors.

1:49:09.560 --> 1:49:10.400
 Yeah.

1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:11.800
 I mean, she'll walk in a doorway.

1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:14.080
 She'll bang her knee on the same wall that's been there

1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:15.280
 for the last 50 years.

1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:17.280
 It's for some reason, really hilarious.

1:49:17.280 --> 1:49:18.280
 That's good for me.

1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:23.360
 You've been asked, I think on Reddit,

1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:26.240
 are there big secrets that you know that could lend you

1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:28.280
 and our country in terrible trouble

1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:30.240
 if you came out to the public and you answered,

1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:32.940
 yes, I wish I could forget them.

1:49:32.940 --> 1:49:36.700
 So let me ask you just about secrecy in general.

1:49:36.700 --> 1:49:39.160
 Are these secrets or just other secrets,

1:49:39.160 --> 1:49:43.280
 ones that the public will never know

1:49:43.280 --> 1:49:47.380
 or will it come out in 10, 20, 50 years?

1:49:47.380 --> 1:49:49.560
 I guess the deeper question is,

1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:53.520
 what is the value of secrecy and transparency?

1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:56.880
 The standard classification

1:49:56.880 --> 1:49:59.280
 for all human intelligence operations

1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:03.340
 is something called two five X two, 25 by two.

1:50:03.340 --> 1:50:07.680
 So 50 years, 25 years times two years or times two rounds.

1:50:07.680 --> 1:50:11.280
 So in essence, anything that I've seen

1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:15.120
 has the first chance of becoming public domain,

1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:17.360
 declassified after 50 years,

1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:19.880
 unless there's some congressional requirement

1:50:19.880 --> 1:50:22.200
 for it to be reviewed and assessed earlier.

1:50:22.200 --> 1:50:24.680
 So by then, I'll be 80 something years old

1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:28.760
 or potentially dead, which is either way.

1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:31.020
 That's when it can come out

1:50:31.020 --> 1:50:34.240
 according to its typical classification.

1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:39.040
 The value of secrets I have seen

1:50:39.040 --> 1:50:42.820
 is that secrets create space.

1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:48.520
 Secrets give opportunity for security.

1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:50.740
 They give opportunity for thinking.

1:50:50.740 --> 1:50:52.080
 They give space

1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:55.100
 and space is an incredibly advantageous thing to have.

1:50:55.100 --> 1:50:57.060
 If you know something somebody else doesn't know,

1:50:57.060 --> 1:50:59.760
 even if it's just 15 or 20 minutes different,

1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:02.600
 you can direct, you can change the course of fate.

1:51:02.600 --> 1:51:05.400
 So I find secrets to be extremely valuable,

1:51:05.400 --> 1:51:06.540
 extremely useful.

1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:10.040
 Even at the place where secrets

1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:12.360
 are being kept from a large mass,

1:51:13.240 --> 1:51:15.520
 part of what all Americans need to understand

1:51:15.520 --> 1:51:19.280
 is that one of the trade offs

1:51:19.280 --> 1:51:23.920
 to building a system of government

1:51:23.920 --> 1:51:26.740
 that allows us to be first world and wealthy

1:51:26.740 --> 1:51:28.480
 and secure and successful,

1:51:28.480 --> 1:51:30.680
 one of the trade offs is that we have given up

1:51:30.680 --> 1:51:32.520
 a great deal of personal freedom.

1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:34.680
 And one of the personal freedoms that we give up

1:51:34.680 --> 1:51:39.000
 is the freedom of knowing what we wanna know.

1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:41.460
 You get to know what the government tells you,

1:51:41.460 --> 1:51:43.060
 you get to know what you need to know

1:51:43.060 --> 1:51:44.400
 or what you've learned yourself,

1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:47.000
 but you don't get to know secrets.

1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.720
 People who do get to know secrets know them for a reason.

1:51:49.720 --> 1:51:51.840
 That's why it's called a need to know.

1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:54.480
 How difficult is it to maintain secrecy?

1:51:54.480 --> 1:51:58.640
 It's surprisingly difficult as technology changes.

1:51:58.640 --> 1:52:00.240
 It's also surprisingly difficult

1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:05.240
 as our culture becomes one where people want notoriety.

1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:09.440
 People wanna be the person who breaks the secret.

1:52:10.460 --> 1:52:13.040
 25 years ago, 40 years ago, that wasn't the case.

1:52:13.040 --> 1:52:14.320
 There was a time in the United States

1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:16.640
 where if someone gave you a secret,

1:52:16.640 --> 1:52:20.020
 it was a point of personal honor not to share the secret.

1:52:20.020 --> 1:52:22.560
 Now we're in a place where someone tells you a secret,

1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:24.920
 like that could turn into a Twitter post

1:52:24.920 --> 1:52:26.320
 that gets you a bunch of thumbs up

1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:27.440
 and a bunch of likes or whatever else.

1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:28.360
 An opportunity. Right.

1:52:28.360 --> 1:52:31.160
 So the value of secrets has changed.

1:52:31.160 --> 1:52:34.140
 And now there's almost a greater value on exposing secrets

1:52:34.140 --> 1:52:36.260
 than there is on keeping secrets.

1:52:36.260 --> 1:52:38.360
 That makes it difficult to keep secrets,

1:52:38.360 --> 1:52:40.720
 especially when technology is going in the same direction.

1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:43.080
 Yeah, where is the line?

1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:45.040
 And by the way, I'm one of those old school people

1:52:45.040 --> 1:52:46.000
 with the secrets.

1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:51.000
 I think it's a karma thing.

1:52:51.080 --> 1:52:52.920
 Again, back to the trust.

1:52:52.920 --> 1:52:55.040
 I think in the short term you can benefit

1:52:55.040 --> 1:52:57.240
 by sharing a secret.

1:52:57.240 --> 1:53:00.260
 But in the long term, if people know they can trust you,

1:53:00.260 --> 1:53:05.000
 like the juicy of the secret, it's a test of sorts.

1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:07.840
 If they know you can keep that secret,

1:53:07.840 --> 1:53:10.040
 that means you're somebody that could be trusted.

1:53:10.040 --> 1:53:14.120
 And I believe that not just effectiveness in this life,

1:53:14.120 --> 1:53:17.320
 but happiness in this life is informing a circle

1:53:17.320 --> 1:53:18.640
 of people you can trust.

1:53:18.640 --> 1:53:22.200
 Right, we're taught that secrets and lies are similar

1:53:22.200 --> 1:53:24.260
 in that they have a limited shelf life.

1:53:24.260 --> 1:53:26.340
 If you treat them like food,

1:53:26.340 --> 1:53:29.160
 secrets and lies have a very limited shelf life.

1:53:29.160 --> 1:53:33.080
 So if you cash in on them while they're still fresh,

1:53:33.960 --> 1:53:35.700
 you beat them before they spoil.

1:53:35.700 --> 1:53:38.040
 You get to take advantage of them before they spoil.

1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:43.040
 However, trust has no limit to its shelf life.

1:53:43.620 --> 1:53:46.380
 So it's almost like you're trading a short term victory

1:53:46.380 --> 1:53:48.280
 and losing a long term victory.

1:53:48.280 --> 1:53:50.540
 It's always better to keep the secret.

1:53:50.540 --> 1:53:53.600
 It's always better to let the lie live

1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:56.040
 because it will eventually come to light

1:53:56.040 --> 1:53:57.920
 from somebody else, not from you,

1:53:57.920 --> 1:53:59.800
 because it already has a limited shelf life.

1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:01.520
 But what you win in exchange

1:54:01.520 --> 1:54:03.600
 for not being the one that cashed in on the secret

1:54:03.600 --> 1:54:05.480
 is immense trust.

1:54:07.920 --> 1:54:12.520
 Let me ask you about lying and trust and so on.

1:54:12.520 --> 1:54:15.620
 So I don't believe I've been contacted by

1:54:15.620 --> 1:54:20.000
 or interacted with the CIA, the MI6, the FSB,

1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.760
 Mossad or any other intelligence agency.

1:54:22.760 --> 1:54:27.760
 I'm kind of offended, but would I know if I was?

1:54:29.880 --> 1:54:31.320
 So from your perspective.

1:54:31.320 --> 1:54:33.420
 No, you would not know if you were.

1:54:33.420 --> 1:54:35.040
 For sure you've been on their radar.

1:54:35.040 --> 1:54:36.620
 Absolutely, you've got a file.

1:54:36.620 --> 1:54:38.080
 You've got a dossier somewhere.

1:54:38.080 --> 1:54:39.560
 Why would I be on their radar?

1:54:39.560 --> 1:54:40.480
 Because you're a.

1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:41.480
 Who's interesting?

1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:46.300
 It's not necessarily that you are interesting

1:54:46.300 --> 1:54:48.920
 to someone as a foreign asset

1:54:48.920 --> 1:54:51.680
 or an intelligence collection source,

1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:54.480
 but your network is extremely interesting.

1:54:54.480 --> 1:54:55.720
 The networks are important too.

1:54:55.720 --> 1:54:57.840
 Correct, if someone had access to,

1:54:57.840 --> 1:54:59.840
 if someone was able to clone your phone,

1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:02.480
 every time you cross a border,

1:55:02.480 --> 1:55:04.800
 you go through some sort of security.

1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:06.460
 If you've ever been pulled into secondary

1:55:06.460 --> 1:55:08.080
 and separated from your bag,

1:55:08.080 --> 1:55:10.660
 that's exactly when and how people clone computers.

1:55:10.660 --> 1:55:13.280
 They clone phones, they make whatever,

1:55:13.280 --> 1:55:17.300
 photocopies of your old school planner,

1:55:17.300 --> 1:55:18.400
 whatever it might be.

1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:23.120
 But for sure you are an intelligence target.

1:55:23.120 --> 1:55:24.840
 It just may be that you're not suitable

1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:28.840
 to be a person who reports foreign intelligence.

1:55:28.840 --> 1:55:30.880
 We've got to understand that all people

1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:33.320
 are potential sources of valuable information

1:55:33.320 --> 1:55:35.580
 to the national security infrastructure

1:55:35.580 --> 1:55:38.960
 of our host country and any country that we visit.

1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:41.480
 Someone like you with your public footprint,

1:55:41.480 --> 1:55:43.880
 with your notoriety, with your educational background,

1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:46.720
 with your national identifications

1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:50.880
 becomes a viable and valuable target of information.

1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:54.220
 Yeah, so to speak to that,

1:55:56.160 --> 1:55:58.200
 I take security pretty seriously,

1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:03.200
 but not to the degree that it runs my life,

1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:05.880
 which I'm very careful about.

1:56:05.880 --> 1:56:07.760
 That's good, I'm glad to hear that.

1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:11.840
 So the moment you start to think about germs, right?

1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:14.120
 Like you start to freak out

1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:17.360
 and you become sort of paralyzed by the stress of it.

1:56:17.360 --> 1:56:19.360
 So you have to balance those two things.

1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:22.640
 If you think about all the things

1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:24.000
 that could hurt you in this world

1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:25.680
 and all the risk you could take,

1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:29.200
 it can overwhelm your life.

1:56:29.200 --> 1:56:32.640
 That said, the cyber world is a weird world

1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:34.880
 because it doesn't have the same.

1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:39.320
 I know not to cross the street without looking each way

1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:41.640
 because there's a physical intuition about it.

1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:45.040
 I'm not sure, I'm a computer science guy,

1:56:45.040 --> 1:56:46.160
 so I have some intuition,

1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:50.400
 but the cyber world, it's really hard

1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:53.280
 to build up an intuition of what is safe and not.

1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:56.560
 I've seen a lot of people just logging out

1:56:56.560 --> 1:56:59.720
 of your devices all the time, like regularly.

1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:01.760
 Just like that physical access step

1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:03.360
 is a lot of people don't take.

1:57:03.360 --> 1:57:07.920
 I can just like walk in into the offices of a lot of CEOs

1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:10.680
 and it's like everything's wide open

1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:13.480
 for physical access of those systems,

1:57:13.480 --> 1:57:16.720
 which is kind of incredible for somebody,

1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:18.440
 that sounds really shady, but it's not.

1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:20.360
 I've written key loggers,

1:57:20.360 --> 1:57:22.000
 like things that record everything you type

1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:23.480
 in the mouse you move.

1:57:23.480 --> 1:57:27.680
 And like I did that for, during my PhD,

1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:30.120
 I was recording everything you do on your device

1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:32.080
 and everything you do on your computer.

1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:36.040
 People sign up to the study, they willingly do this

1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:37.240
 to understand behavior.

1:57:37.240 --> 1:57:38.440
 I was trying to use machine learning

1:57:38.440 --> 1:57:42.160
 to identify who you are based on different biometric

1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:44.840
 and behavioral things, which allows me

1:57:44.840 --> 1:57:46.560
 to study human behavior and to see

1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:49.520
 which is uniquely identifiable.

1:57:49.520 --> 1:57:53.120
 And the goal there was to remove the need for a password.

1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:56.080
 But how easy it is to write a thing

1:57:56.080 --> 1:57:58.240
 that logs everything you type.

1:57:58.240 --> 1:58:01.680
 I was like, wait a minute, like I can probably get

1:58:01.680 --> 1:58:04.240
 a lot of people in the world to run this for me.

1:58:04.240 --> 1:58:06.680
 I can then get all of their passwords.

1:58:06.680 --> 1:58:10.840
 I mean, you could do so much,

1:58:10.840 --> 1:58:15.840
 like I can run the entirety of the CIA from just myself.

1:58:15.880 --> 1:58:17.640
 If I was, and I imagine there's a lot

1:58:17.640 --> 1:58:20.240
 of really good hackers like that out there,

1:58:20.240 --> 1:58:21.360
 much better than me.

1:58:22.440 --> 1:58:25.800
 So I tried to prevent myself from being

1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:28.360
 all the different low hanging fruit attack vectors

1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:29.440
 in my life.

1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:33.120
 I try to make it difficult to be that.

1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:35.680
 But then I'm also aware that there's probably people

1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:37.240
 that are like five steps ahead.

1:58:38.240 --> 1:58:40.440
 You're doing the right thing.

1:58:40.440 --> 1:58:44.240
 What I always advocate is the low hanging fruit

1:58:44.240 --> 1:58:46.800
 is what keeps you from being a target of opportunity.

1:58:46.800 --> 1:58:49.960
 Because you're half assed hackers,

1:58:49.960 --> 1:58:53.280
 you're lazy hackers, you're unskilled hackers.

1:58:53.280 --> 1:58:54.720
 They're looking for low hanging fruit.

1:58:54.720 --> 1:58:57.240
 They're looking for the person who gets the Nigeria email

1:58:57.240 --> 1:58:59.120
 about how you could be getting $5 million

1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:00.480
 if you just give me your bank account.

1:59:00.480 --> 1:59:01.320
 Exactly.

1:59:01.320 --> 1:59:03.640
 That's what they're looking for.

1:59:03.640 --> 1:59:05.400
 The thing that's scary is that if you're not

1:59:05.400 --> 1:59:06.400
 a target of opportunity,

1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:09.200
 if you become a intentional target,

1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:11.840
 then there's almost nothing you can do.

1:59:11.840 --> 1:59:14.520
 Because once you become an intentional target,

1:59:14.520 --> 1:59:17.840
 then your security apparatus,

1:59:17.840 --> 1:59:22.840
 they will create a dedicated customized way vector

1:59:24.280 --> 1:59:27.240
 of attacking your specific security apparatus.

1:59:27.240 --> 1:59:30.400
 And because security is always after, right?

1:59:30.400 --> 1:59:32.960
 There's always, there's the leading advantage

1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:34.960
 and the trailing advantage.

1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:36.720
 When it comes to attacks,

1:59:36.720 --> 1:59:38.280
 the leader always has the advantage

1:59:38.280 --> 1:59:40.120
 because they have to create the attack

1:59:40.120 --> 1:59:42.640
 before anybody else can create a way

1:59:42.640 --> 1:59:44.240
 to protect against the attack.

1:59:44.240 --> 1:59:45.640
 So the attack always comes first

1:59:45.640 --> 1:59:47.040
 and that means they always have the advantage.

1:59:47.040 --> 1:59:49.720
 You are always stuck just leaning on,

1:59:49.720 --> 1:59:52.320
 this is the best security that I know of.

1:59:52.320 --> 1:59:54.760
 Meanwhile, there's always somebody who can create a way

1:59:54.760 --> 1:59:57.120
 of attacking the best security out there.

1:59:57.120 --> 1:59:59.160
 And once they win, they have a monopoly.

1:59:59.160 --> 2:00:02.680
 They have all that time until a new defensive countermeasure

2:00:02.680 --> 2:00:04.120
 is deployed.

2:00:04.120 --> 2:00:07.120
 Yeah, I tend to think exactly as you said,

2:00:07.120 --> 2:00:09.760
 that the long hanging fruit protects against like,

2:00:09.760 --> 2:00:11.760
 yeah, crimes of opportunity.

2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:15.240
 And then I assume that people can just hack in

2:00:15.240 --> 2:00:16.960
 if they really want.

2:00:16.960 --> 2:00:19.000
 Think about how much anxiety we would be able to solve

2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:21.480
 if everybody just accepted that.

2:00:21.480 --> 2:00:22.960
 Well, there's several things you do.

2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:26.800
 First of all, to be honest, it just makes me,

2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:28.680
 it keeps me honest.

2:00:28.680 --> 2:00:34.560
 Not to be a douchebag or like, not, yeah,

2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:39.840
 to assume everything could be public.

2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:44.600
 And so don't trade information that could hurt people

2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:46.080
 if it was made public.

2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:47.840
 So I try to do that.

2:00:47.840 --> 2:00:52.280
 And the thing I try to make sure is I,

2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:54.600
 like Home Alone style, try to.

2:00:54.600 --> 2:00:55.480
 Booby trap.

2:00:55.480 --> 2:00:59.720
 I really would like to know if I was hacked.

2:00:59.720 --> 2:01:06.240
 And so I try to assume that I will be hacked and detect it.

2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:07.160
 Have a tripwire or something.

2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:10.400
 Yeah, a tripwire through everything.

2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:13.440
 And not paranoid tripwise, just like open door.

2:01:13.440 --> 2:01:17.520
 But I think that's probably the future of life on this earth

2:01:17.520 --> 2:01:19.440
 is you're going, like everybody of interest

2:01:19.440 --> 2:01:21.560
 is going to be hacked.

2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:25.040
 That hopefully inspires, now this is outside of company.

2:01:25.040 --> 2:01:25.960
 These are individuals.

2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:30.120
 I mean, there is, of course, if you're actually operating,

2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:31.480
 like I'm just a, who am I?

2:01:31.480 --> 2:01:36.240
 I'm just a scientist person, podcasting person.

2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:41.200
 So if I was actually running a company

2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:46.720
 or was an integral part of some kind of military operation,

2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:50.240
 then you probably have to have an entire team that's now

2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:55.840
 doing that battle of trying to be ahead of the best hackers

2:01:55.840 --> 2:01:57.440
 in the world that are attacking.

2:01:57.440 --> 2:02:01.680
 But that requires a team that full time is their focus.

2:02:01.680 --> 2:02:03.400
 And then you still get in trouble.

2:02:03.400 --> 2:02:04.160
 Correct, yeah.

2:02:04.160 --> 2:02:07.240
 So what I've seen as the norm, well, what I've seen

2:02:07.240 --> 2:02:11.160
 is the cutting edge standard for corporations

2:02:11.160 --> 2:02:16.880
 and the ultra wealthy and even intelligence organizations

2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:19.240
 is that we have tripwires.

2:02:19.240 --> 2:02:22.760
 It's better if you can't prevent from being hacked.

2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:26.520
 The next best thing is to know as soon as you get hacked

2:02:26.520 --> 2:02:30.280
 because then you can essentially terminate all the information.

2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:31.880
 If you know it fast enough, you can just

2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:32.880
 destroy the information.

2:02:32.880 --> 2:02:34.320
 This is what the ultra wealthy do.

2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:35.960
 They have multiple phones.

2:02:35.960 --> 2:02:38.720
 So as soon as one phone gets hacked, the tripwire goes off.

2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:40.600
 The operating system is totally deleted along

2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:41.920
 with all data on the phone.

2:02:41.920 --> 2:02:46.080
 And a second phone is turned on with a whole new separate set

2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:47.400
 of metadata.

2:02:47.400 --> 2:02:49.760
 And now for them, there's no break in service.

2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:51.920
 It's just, oh, this phone went black.

2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:54.080
 It's got a warning on it that says it was hacked.

2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:55.440
 So trash it because they don't care

2:02:55.440 --> 2:02:56.560
 about the price of the phone.

2:02:56.560 --> 2:02:58.680
 Pick up the next phone, and we move on.

2:02:58.680 --> 2:03:01.520
 That's the best thing that you can do essentially outside

2:03:01.520 --> 2:03:04.000
 of trying to out hack the hackers.

2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.520
 And then even in your intelligence and military

2:03:06.520 --> 2:03:09.480
 worlds where cyber warfare is active,

2:03:09.480 --> 2:03:12.120
 the people who are aggressing are not

2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:16.400
 trying to create aggression that beats security.

2:03:16.400 --> 2:03:19.240
 They're trying to find aggressive techniques,

2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:22.440
 offensive techniques that have no security built around them

2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:23.200
 yet.

2:03:23.200 --> 2:03:25.960
 Because it's too cost and time intensive

2:03:25.960 --> 2:03:28.760
 to protect against what you know is coming,

2:03:28.760 --> 2:03:30.840
 it's so much more efficient and cost effective

2:03:30.840 --> 2:03:32.760
 to go after new vectors.

2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:37.760
 So it just becomes like, it becomes almost a silly game

2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:41.240
 of your neighbor gets a guard dog.

2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:43.040
 So you get a bigger guard dog.

2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:45.040
 And then your neighbor gets a fence.

2:03:45.040 --> 2:03:46.320
 So you're just constantly outdoing each other.

2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:48.560
 It's called the security paradigm.

2:03:48.560 --> 2:03:50.660
 People just, they just one up each other

2:03:50.660 --> 2:03:53.060
 because it's never worth it to just get to the same level.

2:03:53.060 --> 2:03:54.600
 You're always trying to outdo each other.

2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:58.100
 Yeah, then maybe like banks have to fight that fight,

2:03:58.100 --> 2:03:59.820
 but not everybody can.

2:03:59.820 --> 2:04:00.660
 Right.

2:04:00.660 --> 2:04:01.480
 Yeah, no.

2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:03.280
 So you're saying I operated at the state of the art

2:04:03.280 --> 2:04:04.120
 with the trip wires.

2:04:04.120 --> 2:04:04.960
 This is good to know.

2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:06.200
 Absolutely, man.

2:04:06.200 --> 2:04:10.080
 And also just not using anybody else's services,

2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:12.600
 doing everything myself.

2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:14.340
 So that's harder to figure out what the heck

2:04:14.340 --> 2:04:15.180
 this person is doing.

2:04:15.180 --> 2:04:17.040
 Because if I'm using somebody else's service,

2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:19.900
 like I did with QNAP,

2:04:21.680 --> 2:04:24.480
 I have a QNAP NAS I use for cold storage

2:04:24.480 --> 2:04:27.280
 of unimportant things, but a large videos.

2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:29.700
 And I don't know if you know, but QNAP is a company

2:04:29.700 --> 2:04:34.000
 that does NAS storage devices, and they got hacked.

2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:38.800
 And everybody that didn't update as of a week ago

2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:42.520
 from the point of the zero day hack, everybody got hacked.

2:04:42.520 --> 2:04:46.180
 It's several thousand machines, and they asked,

2:04:48.020 --> 2:04:50.560
 you can get your data back if you pay,

2:04:50.560 --> 2:04:53.000
 I forget what it was, but it was,

2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:55.360
 it was about a couple thousand dollars.

2:04:55.360 --> 2:04:59.080
 And QNAP can get all the data back for their customers

2:04:59.080 --> 2:05:01.080
 if they pay, I think, two million dollars.

2:05:01.080 --> 2:05:01.960
 Wow.

2:05:01.960 --> 2:05:04.560
 But that came from me relying on the systems

2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:05.600
 of others for security.

2:05:05.600 --> 2:05:10.600
 I assumed this company would have their security handled,

2:05:10.600 --> 2:05:13.200
 but then that was a very valuable lesson to me.

2:05:13.200 --> 2:05:18.200
 I now have layers of security and also an understanding

2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:22.720
 which data is really important, which is somewhat important,

2:05:22.720 --> 2:05:26.360
 which is not that important, and layering that all together.

2:05:26.360 --> 2:05:28.880
 So just so you know, the US government, the military,

2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:31.800
 woke up to that exact same thing about two years ago.

2:05:31.800 --> 2:05:33.280
 It's still very new.

2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:35.240
 I mean, they were sourcing,

2:05:35.240 --> 2:05:37.400
 take night vision goggles, for example.

2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:39.880
 They were sourcing components and engineering

2:05:39.880 --> 2:05:41.560
 and blueprints for night vision goggles

2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:43.880
 from three, four, five different subcontractors

2:05:43.880 --> 2:05:47.040
 all over the country, but they never asked themselves

2:05:47.040 --> 2:05:50.520
 what the security status was of those subcontractors.

2:05:50.520 --> 2:05:55.520
 So fast forward a few years, and all of a sudden,

2:05:55.920 --> 2:05:57.760
 they start getting faulty components.

2:05:57.760 --> 2:05:59.920
 They start having night vision goggles that don't work.

2:05:59.920 --> 2:06:01.960
 They start having supply chain issues

2:06:01.960 --> 2:06:04.360
 where they have to change their provider,

2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:07.640
 and the army doesn't know that the provider is changing.

2:06:07.640 --> 2:06:09.180
 I mean, this is a strategy.

2:06:09.180 --> 2:06:12.720
 The idea of going through third party systems

2:06:12.720 --> 2:06:15.360
 is identifying the vulnerability in the supply chain.

2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:20.000
 That's a savvy offensive practice

2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:24.280
 for more than just cyber hackers.

2:06:24.280 --> 2:06:26.560
 Let me ask you about physical hacking.

2:06:26.560 --> 2:06:29.200
 So I'm now, like I'm an introvert,

2:06:29.200 --> 2:06:31.360
 so I'm paranoid about all social interaction,

2:06:31.360 --> 2:06:35.700
 but how much truth is there?

2:06:35.700 --> 2:06:37.480
 It's kind of a funny question.

2:06:37.480 --> 2:06:40.440
 How suspicious should I be when I'm traveling in Ukraine

2:06:40.440 --> 2:06:42.000
 or different parts of the world

2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.320
 when an attractive female walks up to me

2:06:44.320 --> 2:06:46.880
 and shows any kind of attention?

2:06:46.880 --> 2:06:49.900
 Is that like this kind of James Bond spy movie stuff,

2:06:49.900 --> 2:06:54.020
 or is that kind of stuff used by intelligence agencies?

2:06:54.020 --> 2:06:55.800
 I don't think it's used.

2:06:55.800 --> 2:06:56.700
 It's absolutely used.

2:06:56.700 --> 2:06:58.880
 It's called sexpionage.

2:06:58.880 --> 2:07:02.680
 That's the term that we jokingly call it, is sexpionage.

2:07:02.680 --> 2:07:05.940
 But yeah, the art of attraction, appeal,

2:07:05.940 --> 2:07:10.940
 the manifestation of feelings through sexual manipulation,

2:07:11.380 --> 2:07:14.320
 all of that is a super powerful tool.

2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:15.740
 The Chinese use it extremely well.

2:07:15.740 --> 2:07:18.020
 The Russians use it extremely well.

2:07:18.020 --> 2:07:19.280
 In the United States,

2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:23.100
 we actively train our officers not to use it

2:07:23.100 --> 2:07:26.680
 because in the end it leads to complications

2:07:26.680 --> 2:07:28.380
 in how you professionally run a case.

2:07:28.380 --> 2:07:30.100
 So we train our officers not to use it.

2:07:30.100 --> 2:07:33.340
 However, you can't control what other people think.

2:07:33.340 --> 2:07:34.700
 So if you're an attractive male

2:07:34.700 --> 2:07:36.060
 or an attractive female officer,

2:07:36.060 --> 2:07:40.420
 and you're trying to talk to an older general

2:07:40.420 --> 2:07:43.300
 who just happens to be gay or happens to be straight

2:07:43.300 --> 2:07:44.620
 and is attracted to you,

2:07:44.620 --> 2:07:45.940
 of course they're gonna be that much more willing

2:07:45.940 --> 2:07:48.840
 to talk to an American who is also attractive.

2:07:48.840 --> 2:07:50.740
 So it's hard to walk that back.

2:07:50.740 --> 2:07:51.620
 In all definitions.

2:07:51.620 --> 2:07:54.300
 So it could be all elements of charisma.

2:07:56.220 --> 2:08:00.940
 So attractiveness in a dynamic sense of the word.

2:08:00.940 --> 2:08:02.140
 So it's visual attractiveness,

2:08:02.140 --> 2:08:05.660
 but the smile, the humor, the wit, the flirting,

2:08:05.660 --> 2:08:07.720
 all that kind of stuff that could be used

2:08:07.720 --> 2:08:10.740
 to the art of conversation.

2:08:10.740 --> 2:08:12.500
 There's also elements of sexuality

2:08:12.500 --> 2:08:14.740
 that people underestimate, right?

2:08:14.740 --> 2:08:17.220
 So physical sexuality, physical attraction

2:08:17.220 --> 2:08:18.060
 is the most obvious one.

2:08:18.060 --> 2:08:20.560
 It's the one that everybody talks about and thinks about.

2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:23.180
 But then there's also sapiosexuality,

2:08:23.180 --> 2:08:27.140
 which is being sexually attracted to thoughts,

2:08:27.140 --> 2:08:28.500
 to intelligence.

2:08:28.500 --> 2:08:31.140
 And then you've got all the various varieties

2:08:31.140 --> 2:08:34.060
 of personal preferences.

2:08:34.060 --> 2:08:36.660
 Some people like people of a certain color skin,

2:08:36.660 --> 2:08:39.100
 or they like big noses, they like small noses,

2:08:39.100 --> 2:08:40.740
 they like big butts, they like small butts,

2:08:40.740 --> 2:08:42.220
 they like tall guys, they like bald guys,

2:08:42.220 --> 2:08:43.900
 whatever it might be.

2:08:43.900 --> 2:08:47.220
 You can't ever predict what someone's preferences,

2:08:47.220 --> 2:08:50.940
 sexual arousal preferences are going to be.

2:08:50.940 --> 2:08:53.500
 So then you end up walking into a situation

2:08:53.500 --> 2:08:56.540
 where then you discover, and just imagine,

2:08:56.540 --> 2:09:01.140
 imagine being an unattractive, overweight, married guy,

2:09:01.140 --> 2:09:04.780
 and you're walking into an asset or a target meeting

2:09:04.780 --> 2:09:06.540
 with like a middle aged female

2:09:06.540 --> 2:09:09.020
 who is also not very attractive and also married.

2:09:09.020 --> 2:09:11.700
 But then it turns out that that person is a sapiosexual

2:09:11.700 --> 2:09:14.580
 and gets extremely turned on by intelligent conversation.

2:09:14.580 --> 2:09:16.860
 That's exactly what you're there to do.

2:09:16.860 --> 2:09:20.100
 Your mission is to have intelligent conversation

2:09:20.100 --> 2:09:22.300
 with this person to find out if they have access to secrets.

2:09:22.300 --> 2:09:24.600
 And by virtue of you carrying out your mission,

2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:26.740
 they become extremely aroused and attracted to you.

2:09:26.740 --> 2:09:29.380
 That is a very complicated situation.

2:09:29.380 --> 2:09:30.740
 It's hard to know who to trust.

2:09:30.740 --> 2:09:32.700
 Like, how do you know your wife,

2:09:32.700 --> 2:09:33.620
 or how does your wife know

2:09:33.620 --> 2:09:36.120
 that you're not a double agent from Russia?

2:09:37.420 --> 2:09:42.040
 There's a large element of experience and time

2:09:42.040 --> 2:09:43.140
 that goes into that.

2:09:43.140 --> 2:09:44.340
 She's also trained.

2:09:45.260 --> 2:09:47.100
 And I think my wife and I also.

2:09:47.100 --> 2:09:48.420
 Actually you think.

2:09:48.420 --> 2:09:50.380
 My wife and I also have the benefit

2:09:50.380 --> 2:09:55.380
 of being recruited young and together where.

2:09:56.660 --> 2:09:58.740
 So over time you can start to figure out things

2:09:58.740 --> 2:10:00.500
 that are very difficult to.

2:10:02.060 --> 2:10:03.400
 So you form the baseline,

2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:04.780
 you start to understand the person's very,

2:10:04.780 --> 2:10:06.100
 it becomes very difficult to lie.

2:10:06.100 --> 2:10:08.340
 The most difficult thing in the world is consistency.

2:10:08.340 --> 2:10:10.460
 It's the most difficult thing in the world.

2:10:10.460 --> 2:10:12.900
 Some people say that discipline or self discipline,

2:10:12.900 --> 2:10:14.780
 what they're really talking about is consistency.

2:10:14.780 --> 2:10:17.240
 When you have someone who performs consistently

2:10:17.240 --> 2:10:20.500
 over long periods of time, under various levels of stress,

2:10:20.500 --> 2:10:21.940
 you have high, high confidence

2:10:21.940 --> 2:10:23.620
 that that is the person that you can trust.

2:10:23.620 --> 2:10:25.700
 You can trust, again,

2:10:25.700 --> 2:10:30.220
 you can trust them to behave within a certain pattern.

2:10:30.220 --> 2:10:33.160
 You can trust an asshole to be an asshole

2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:34.780
 without trusting the asshole

2:10:34.780 --> 2:10:36.700
 to take care of your kids, right?

2:10:36.700 --> 2:10:40.020
 So I don't ever wanna mix up the idea of personal trust

2:10:40.020 --> 2:10:42.380
 versus trusting the outcome.

2:10:42.380 --> 2:10:44.020
 You can always trust a person

2:10:44.020 --> 2:10:45.700
 to operate within their pattern of behavior.

2:10:45.700 --> 2:10:49.340
 It just takes time for you to get a consistent,

2:10:49.340 --> 2:10:50.500
 to get consistent feedback

2:10:50.500 --> 2:10:52.220
 as to what that baseline is for them.

2:10:52.220 --> 2:10:55.260
 To form a good model, predictive model

2:10:55.260 --> 2:10:57.060
 of what their behavior is going to be like.

2:10:57.060 --> 2:10:59.420
 Right, and you know, it's fascinating is I think

2:10:59.420 --> 2:11:02.400
 the challenge is building that model quickly.

2:11:03.260 --> 2:11:05.820
 So technology is one of those tools

2:11:05.820 --> 2:11:07.020
 that will be able in the future

2:11:07.020 --> 2:11:10.140
 to very quickly create a model of behavior

2:11:10.140 --> 2:11:13.620
 because technology can pull in multiple data points

2:11:13.620 --> 2:11:15.260
 in a very short period of time

2:11:15.260 --> 2:11:17.820
 that the human brain simply can't pull in

2:11:17.820 --> 2:11:20.500
 at the same space, at the same speed.

2:11:20.500 --> 2:11:22.300
 That's actually what I did my PhD on.

2:11:22.300 --> 2:11:23.460
 That's what I did at Google

2:11:23.460 --> 2:11:25.980
 is forming a good representation,

2:11:25.980 --> 2:11:29.300
 unique representation in the entire world

2:11:29.300 --> 2:11:31.220
 based on the behavior of the person.

2:11:31.220 --> 2:11:33.020
 The specific task there is

2:11:33.020 --> 2:11:35.780
 so that you don't have to type in the password.

2:11:35.780 --> 2:11:38.100
 The idea was to replace the password.

2:11:38.100 --> 2:11:40.700
 But it also allows you to actually study human behavior

2:11:40.700 --> 2:11:41.700
 and to think, all right,

2:11:41.700 --> 2:11:44.360
 what is the unique representation of a person?

2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:48.780
 How, because we have very specific patterns

2:11:48.780 --> 2:11:51.280
 and a lot of humans are very similar in those patterns,

2:11:51.280 --> 2:11:52.940
 what are the unique identifiers

2:11:52.940 --> 2:11:55.140
 within those patterns of behavior?

2:11:55.140 --> 2:11:57.540
 And I think that's, from a psychology perspective,

2:11:57.540 --> 2:11:59.060
 a super fascinating question.

2:11:59.060 --> 2:12:00.940
 And from a machine learning perspective,

2:12:00.940 --> 2:12:02.260
 it's something that you can,

2:12:02.260 --> 2:12:04.460
 as the systems get better and better and better,

2:12:04.460 --> 2:12:07.140
 and as we get more and more digital data

2:12:07.140 --> 2:12:09.580
 about each individual, you start to get,

2:12:09.580 --> 2:12:11.740
 you start to be able to do that kind of thing effectively.

2:12:11.740 --> 2:12:13.160
 And it's, I mean, when I think of the fact

2:12:13.160 --> 2:12:14.960
 that you could create a dossier on somebody

2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:16.900
 in a matter of 24 or 48 hours,

2:12:16.900 --> 2:12:21.100
 if you could wire them for two days, right?

2:12:21.100 --> 2:12:22.300
 Internet of Things style,

2:12:22.300 --> 2:12:23.740
 you put it in their underwear or whatever, right?

2:12:23.740 --> 2:12:26.380
 Some chip that just reads everything.

2:12:26.380 --> 2:12:27.540
 How heavy are they walking?

2:12:27.540 --> 2:12:28.900
 How much time do they sleep?

2:12:28.900 --> 2:12:30.540
 How many times do they open the refrigerator?

2:12:30.540 --> 2:12:32.500
 When they log into their computer, how do they do it?

2:12:32.500 --> 2:12:34.940
 Like, which hand do they use when they log in?

2:12:34.940 --> 2:12:36.860
 What's their most common swipe?

2:12:36.860 --> 2:12:38.380
 What's their most visited website?

2:12:38.380 --> 2:12:42.680
 You could collect an enormous amount of normative data

2:12:42.680 --> 2:12:45.940
 in a short period of time where otherwise we're stuck.

2:12:45.940 --> 2:12:48.860
 The way that we do it now, once or twice a week,

2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:51.100
 we go out for a coffee for two hours.

2:12:51.100 --> 2:12:53.420
 And two hours at a time over the course of six,

2:12:53.420 --> 2:12:57.500
 eight weeks, 12 weeks, you're coming up with a 50%

2:12:57.500 --> 2:13:00.820
 assessment on how you think this person is going to behave.

2:13:00.820 --> 2:13:02.740
 Just that time savings is immense.

2:13:03.660 --> 2:13:06.300
 Something you've also spoken about is private intelligence

2:13:06.300 --> 2:13:10.580
 and the power and the reach and the scale

2:13:10.580 --> 2:13:12.300
 and the importance of private intelligence

2:13:12.300 --> 2:13:13.480
 versus government intelligence.

2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:16.980
 Can you elaborate on the role of what is private intelligence

2:13:16.980 --> 2:13:19.500
 and what's the role of private intelligence

2:13:19.500 --> 2:13:22.300
 in the scope of all the intelligence

2:13:22.300 --> 2:13:26.340
 that is gathered and used in the United States?

2:13:26.340 --> 2:13:27.180
 Yeah, absolutely.

2:13:27.180 --> 2:13:30.620
 It's something that so few people know about.

2:13:30.620 --> 2:13:33.920
 And it became a more mainstream topic

2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:35.780
 with the Trump administration.

2:13:35.780 --> 2:13:39.020
 Because Trump made it no secret that he was going to hire

2:13:39.020 --> 2:13:40.320
 private intelligence organizations

2:13:40.320 --> 2:13:42.140
 to run his intelligence operations.

2:13:42.140 --> 2:13:43.140
 And fund them.

2:13:43.140 --> 2:13:44.940
 So that really brought it to the mainstream.

2:13:44.940 --> 2:13:46.860
 But going all the way back to 9 11,

2:13:46.860 --> 2:13:48.900
 going all the way back to 2001,

2:13:48.900 --> 2:13:51.980
 when the 9 11 attacks happened,

2:13:51.980 --> 2:13:56.140
 there was a commission that was formed

2:13:56.140 --> 2:14:00.700
 to determine the reasons that 9 11 happened.

2:14:00.700 --> 2:14:02.460
 And among the lists that they determined,

2:14:02.460 --> 2:14:04.180
 of course they found out that the intelligence community

2:14:04.180 --> 2:14:06.320
 wasn't coordinating well with each other.

2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:08.320
 There were fiefdoms and there was infighting

2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:10.340
 and there wasn't good intel sharing.

2:14:10.340 --> 2:14:11.920
 But more than that, they identified

2:14:11.920 --> 2:14:16.140
 that we were operating at Cold War levels,

2:14:16.140 --> 2:14:18.260
 even though we were living in a time

2:14:18.260 --> 2:14:20.460
 when terrorism was the new biggest threat

2:14:20.460 --> 2:14:22.020
 to national security.

2:14:22.020 --> 2:14:25.540
 So the big recommendation coming out of the 9 11 commission

2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:27.420
 was that the intelligence organizations,

2:14:27.420 --> 2:14:30.100
 the intelligence community significantly increased

2:14:30.100 --> 2:14:33.060
 the presence of intelligence operators overseas

2:14:33.060 --> 2:14:36.140
 and in terms of analytical capacity

2:14:36.140 --> 2:14:38.180
 here in the United States.

2:14:38.180 --> 2:14:40.440
 When they made that decision,

2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:44.760
 it completely destroyed, it totally was incongruent

2:14:44.760 --> 2:14:46.360
 with the existing hiring process

2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:48.740
 because the existing hiring process for CIA or NSA

2:14:48.740 --> 2:14:51.060
 is a six to nine month process.

2:14:51.060 --> 2:14:55.180
 The only way they could plus up their sizes fast enough

2:14:55.180 --> 2:14:57.820
 was to bypass their own hiring

2:14:57.820 --> 2:15:00.760
 and instead go direct to private organizations.

2:15:00.760 --> 2:15:04.940
 So naturally the government contracted with the companies

2:15:04.940 --> 2:15:07.680
 that they already had secure contracts with,

2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:12.680
 Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Khaki, you name it.

2:15:12.820 --> 2:15:15.380
 And then over time from 2001 to now,

2:15:15.380 --> 2:15:17.520
 or I guess that started really in 2004

2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:19.820
 when they started significantly increasing

2:15:19.820 --> 2:15:22.020
 the presence of private intelligence officers.

2:15:22.900 --> 2:15:26.540
 From then until now, it's become a budgetary thing.

2:15:26.540 --> 2:15:30.240
 It's become a continuity of operations thing.

2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:33.820
 And now the reason Northern Virginia

2:15:33.820 --> 2:15:37.620
 has become one of the wealthiest zip codes in America

2:15:37.620 --> 2:15:40.180
 is because of the incredible concentration

2:15:40.180 --> 2:15:43.400
 of private intelligence that is supporting CIA, NSA,

2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:46.900
 DIA, FBI, and all the slew of IC partners.

2:15:46.900 --> 2:15:49.260
 By the way, does Palantir play a role in this?

2:15:49.260 --> 2:15:51.160
 Palantir is one of those organizations

2:15:51.160 --> 2:15:54.100
 that was trying to pitch their product

2:15:54.100 --> 2:15:57.420
 to an intelligence community because they have,

2:15:57.420 --> 2:15:59.920
 it's a fantastic product on paper.

2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:05.260
 But the challenge was the proprietary services,

2:16:05.260 --> 2:16:08.100
 the proprietary systems that we current that we used

2:16:08.100 --> 2:16:13.100
 in CIA prior to Palantir continued to outperform Palantir.

2:16:13.460 --> 2:16:16.380
 So just like any other business decision,

2:16:16.380 --> 2:16:18.660
 if you've got homegrown systems

2:16:18.660 --> 2:16:20.220
 that outperform external systems,

2:16:20.220 --> 2:16:23.380
 then it's not worth it to share the internal information.

2:16:23.380 --> 2:16:24.260
 Got it.

2:16:24.260 --> 2:16:29.260
 So what the close connection between Peter Thiel

2:16:29.660 --> 2:16:33.100
 and Donald Trump, did that have a role to play

2:16:33.100 --> 2:16:38.100
 in Donald Trump's leveraging of private intelligence

2:16:38.860 --> 2:16:40.620
 or is that completely disjoint?

2:16:40.620 --> 2:16:45.520
 I think that they're related but only circumstantially.

2:16:45.520 --> 2:16:46.700
 Because remember, Donald Trump

2:16:46.700 --> 2:16:48.980
 wasn't really investing in CIA.

2:16:48.980 --> 2:16:51.080
 So the last thing he wanted to do

2:16:51.080 --> 2:16:54.420
 was spend his network, WASTA,

2:16:54.420 --> 2:16:56.220
 WASTA is a term that we call influence,

2:16:56.220 --> 2:16:58.080
 it's an Arabic term for influence.

2:16:58.080 --> 2:17:02.060
 Trump didn't wanna use his WASTA putting Thiel into CIA

2:17:02.060 --> 2:17:03.740
 only to lose Thiel's contract

2:17:03.740 --> 2:17:04.900
 as soon as Trump left office.

2:17:04.900 --> 2:17:08.040
 So instead, it was more valuable to put Peter Thiel's tool

2:17:08.040 --> 2:17:09.420
 to use in private intelligence.

2:17:09.420 --> 2:17:11.360
 And then of course, I think he nominated Peter Thiel

2:17:11.360 --> 2:17:15.420
 to be his Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State.

2:17:15.420 --> 2:17:17.180
 At some point in time, he tried to present,

2:17:17.180 --> 2:17:19.100
 like presidentially appoint Peter Thiel

2:17:19.100 --> 2:17:23.140
 into a position of government authority.

2:17:23.140 --> 2:17:27.740
 What do you think of figures like Peter Thiel?

2:17:27.740 --> 2:17:30.860
 Do they wield, and I'm sure there's figures

2:17:30.860 --> 2:17:35.260
 of similar scale and reach and power

2:17:35.260 --> 2:17:37.140
 in private intelligence.

2:17:37.140 --> 2:17:40.660
 What do you think about their role and power

2:17:40.660 --> 2:17:44.460
 in this whole, like without public accountability

2:17:44.460 --> 2:17:47.220
 that you would think directors of CIA perhaps have?

2:17:47.220 --> 2:17:49.920
 So this is where private intelligence

2:17:49.920 --> 2:17:51.980
 has both a strength and a weakness.

2:17:53.100 --> 2:17:56.180
 The ultimate law overriding,

2:17:56.180 --> 2:17:58.140
 that's overseeing private intelligence

2:17:58.140 --> 2:18:03.140
 is not government legislation.

2:18:03.600 --> 2:18:05.560
 It's the law of economics.

2:18:05.560 --> 2:18:07.520
 If they produce a superior product,

2:18:07.520 --> 2:18:09.320
 then they will have a buyer.

2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:11.300
 If they do not produce a superior product,

2:18:11.300 --> 2:18:13.460
 they will not have a buyer.

2:18:13.460 --> 2:18:16.300
 And that's a very simple business principle.

2:18:16.300 --> 2:18:20.800
 Whereas in the current national security infrastructure,

2:18:20.800 --> 2:18:22.900
 you can create a crap product,

2:18:22.900 --> 2:18:25.700
 but the taxpayer dollars are always going to be spent.

2:18:25.700 --> 2:18:28.100
 So it's really thrown things for a loop.

2:18:28.100 --> 2:18:29.760
 Especially during the Trump administration.

2:18:29.760 --> 2:18:32.240
 And this is one of the things that I will always say

2:18:32.240 --> 2:18:34.660
 I liked about the Trump administration.

2:18:34.660 --> 2:18:38.700
 It shown, it put a big blazing bright light

2:18:38.700 --> 2:18:41.720
 on all of the flaws within our system.

2:18:41.720 --> 2:18:45.680
 One of those flaws being this executive power

2:18:45.680 --> 2:18:47.400
 over the intelligence organizations

2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:50.460
 and the lack of accountability

2:18:50.460 --> 2:18:53.460
 for intelligence organizations to produce a superior product.

2:18:53.460 --> 2:18:58.460
 When that light got shown down,

2:18:59.080 --> 2:19:01.640
 that's when you also saw Trump start to go after,

2:19:01.640 --> 2:19:02.960
 if you remember, there was a period

2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:04.680
 where he was taking security clearances away

2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:06.480
 from retiring officers.

2:19:06.480 --> 2:19:08.760
 That became a big hot issue.

2:19:08.760 --> 2:19:11.600
 That became something that people were very opposed to

2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:14.880
 when they didn't realize that that process

2:19:14.880 --> 2:19:17.160
 of taking security clearances away,

2:19:17.160 --> 2:19:19.960
 that incentivized seasoned senior officers

2:19:19.960 --> 2:19:21.800
 to stay in service.

2:19:21.800 --> 2:19:23.260
 Because with private intelligence

2:19:23.260 --> 2:19:25.320
 paying a premium during the Trump administration,

2:19:25.320 --> 2:19:26.980
 because Trump was paying a premium

2:19:26.980 --> 2:19:29.220
 to the private intelligence world,

2:19:29.220 --> 2:19:33.060
 when senior officers found that it was more profitable

2:19:33.060 --> 2:19:35.600
 to retire early, keep their clearance,

2:19:35.600 --> 2:19:38.440
 and go work for Raytheon, Trump saw that

2:19:38.440 --> 2:19:41.500
 as bypassing service to the American people.

2:19:41.500 --> 2:19:44.040
 You've made a career in CIA, you've made a career in NSA,

2:19:44.040 --> 2:19:44.960
 you should stay there.

2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:46.760
 If you leave, you lose your clearance

2:19:46.760 --> 2:19:49.280
 because you no longer have a need to know.

2:19:49.280 --> 2:19:51.920
 He upset the apple cart with that.

2:19:51.920 --> 2:19:54.200
 And unfortunately, the narrative that came out

2:19:54.200 --> 2:19:56.400
 in many ways was a negative narrative against Trump,

2:19:56.400 --> 2:20:00.120
 when in fact, he was actually doing quite a service

2:20:00.120 --> 2:20:03.520
 to the American people, trying to take away

2:20:03.520 --> 2:20:07.800
 the incentive of senior officials leaving their service

2:20:07.800 --> 2:20:10.280
 in order to just profiteer in the private intelligence.

2:20:10.280 --> 2:20:15.280
 So in that way, he was kind of supporting the CIA

2:20:15.500 --> 2:20:19.860
 in making sure that competent people

2:20:19.860 --> 2:20:22.720
 and experienced people stay in CIA,

2:20:22.720 --> 2:20:24.000
 are incentivized to stay there.

2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:27.520
 Correct, I think that there was definitely,

2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:29.040
 he understood incentives.

2:20:29.040 --> 2:20:31.240
 I mean, Donald Trump understands incentives.

2:20:32.280 --> 2:20:34.200
 So he was trying to incentivize them to stay,

2:20:34.200 --> 2:20:36.840
 but I think he was also playing a safety card

2:20:36.840 --> 2:20:40.200
 because he didn't want former CIA officials

2:20:40.200 --> 2:20:42.160
 who were not listening to him

2:20:42.160 --> 2:20:44.180
 to then move into private intel organizations

2:20:44.180 --> 2:20:47.800
 that he may be hiring, only to then have them undermine him

2:20:47.800 --> 2:20:49.480
 from both sides of the coin.

2:20:49.480 --> 2:20:53.200
 So there was a little bit of offensive calculation

2:20:53.200 --> 2:20:54.040
 in there as well.

2:20:54.040 --> 2:20:56.720
 But do the dynamics and the incentives of economics

2:20:56.720 --> 2:20:58.820
 that you referred to that the private intelligence

2:20:58.820 --> 2:21:01.920
 operates under, is that more or less ethical

2:21:01.920 --> 2:21:06.920
 than the forces that maybe government agencies operate under?

2:21:07.560 --> 2:21:08.560
 What's your intuition?

2:21:08.560 --> 2:21:12.760
 Is capitalism lead, so you mentioned it leads

2:21:12.760 --> 2:21:16.900
 to maximizations of efficiency and performance,

2:21:16.900 --> 2:21:19.920
 but is that correlated with ethical behavior

2:21:19.920 --> 2:21:24.080
 when we're talking about such hairy activities

2:21:24.080 --> 2:21:26.180
 like collection of intelligence?

2:21:26.180 --> 2:21:27.920
 The question of ethics is a great question.

2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:31.640
 So let me start this whole thing out by saying,

2:21:31.640 --> 2:21:36.640
 CIA hires people on a spectrum

2:21:36.640 --> 2:21:41.640
 of our ability to be morally flexible, ethically flexible.

2:21:41.880 --> 2:21:45.340
 All people at their heart are ethically flexible.

2:21:45.340 --> 2:21:48.080
 I would never punch somebody in the face, right?

2:21:48.080 --> 2:21:49.040
 Some people out there would say,

2:21:49.040 --> 2:21:51.160
 I would never hurt another human being.

2:21:51.160 --> 2:21:53.720
 But as soon as a human being posed a direct threat

2:21:53.720 --> 2:21:56.840
 to their daughter or their son or their mother,

2:21:56.840 --> 2:21:58.100
 now all of a sudden they're gonna change

2:21:58.100 --> 2:22:01.520
 their ethical stance in self defense, right?

2:22:01.520 --> 2:22:02.340
 But at the end of the day,

2:22:02.340 --> 2:22:05.280
 it's still hurting another person.

2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:07.520
 So what CIA looks for is people who are able

2:22:07.520 --> 2:22:12.520
 to swing across that spectrum for lesser offenses, right?

2:22:12.520 --> 2:22:13.600
 More flexibility.

2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:18.880
 I do not believe that private intelligence

2:22:18.880 --> 2:22:21.520
 and the laws of economics lend themselves

2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:25.640
 to increased ethics or increased ethical behavior

2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:26.960
 in the short term.

2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:31.280
 But what ends up happening is that in the long term,

2:22:31.280 --> 2:22:34.560
 in order to scale economic benefits,

2:22:34.560 --> 2:22:39.560
 you are forced to act within norms of your customer base.

2:22:39.560 --> 2:22:42.040
 So as the norms of that customer base

2:22:42.040 --> 2:22:44.240
 dictate certain requirements,

2:22:44.240 --> 2:22:46.680
 the company has to adapt to those requirements

2:22:46.680 --> 2:22:49.040
 in order to continue to scale.

2:22:49.040 --> 2:22:54.040
 So if a company tries to ostracize LGBTQ

2:22:54.680 --> 2:22:58.680
 or if they try to ostracize men or ostracize women,

2:22:58.680 --> 2:23:01.640
 they're limiting their ability to grow economically.

2:23:01.640 --> 2:23:05.720
 They have to adapt to whatever is the prevailing

2:23:05.720 --> 2:23:09.480
 ethical requirement of their customer base.

2:23:09.480 --> 2:23:10.320
 That's such an interesting question

2:23:10.320 --> 2:23:13.520
 because you look at big pharma and pharmaceutical companies,

2:23:14.400 --> 2:23:19.400
 and they have quite a poor reputation in the public eye.

2:23:20.080 --> 2:23:23.920
 And some of it, maybe much of it is deserved,

2:23:23.920 --> 2:23:26.160
 at least historically speaking.

2:23:26.160 --> 2:23:28.560
 And so you start to wonder, well,

2:23:28.560 --> 2:23:33.560
 can intelligence agencies use some of the same methods

2:23:33.560 --> 2:23:36.520
 or can these use some of the same technique

2:23:36.520 --> 2:23:38.880
 to manipulate the public,

2:23:40.160 --> 2:23:42.920
 like what they believe about those agencies

2:23:42.920 --> 2:23:45.040
 in order to maximize profit as well?

2:23:45.040 --> 2:23:49.920
 Sort of finding shortcuts or unethical paths

2:23:49.920 --> 2:23:52.720
 that allow you to not be ultimately

2:23:53.600 --> 2:23:55.040
 responsible to the customer.

2:23:55.040 --> 2:23:56.040
 Absolutely.

2:23:56.040 --> 2:23:58.800
 And I would go a step further to say that

2:23:58.800 --> 2:24:01.880
 the covert nature of intelligence operations

2:24:01.880 --> 2:24:06.400
 is really attractive when it comes to the private sector,

2:24:06.400 --> 2:24:08.960
 because now they have all the same money

2:24:08.960 --> 2:24:10.880
 with none of the oversight,

2:24:10.880 --> 2:24:13.240
 and all they have to do is deliver.

2:24:13.240 --> 2:24:17.440
 So without the oversight, what's holding you back?

2:24:17.440 --> 2:24:20.520
 And for anybody who's ever run a business,

2:24:20.520 --> 2:24:21.760
 anybody who's ever started a startup

2:24:21.760 --> 2:24:23.080
 or tried to make something succeed,

2:24:23.080 --> 2:24:25.360
 we all know that there come those times

2:24:25.360 --> 2:24:28.840
 where you have to skirt the boundaries

2:24:28.840 --> 2:24:33.840
 of propriety or morality or commitments

2:24:34.280 --> 2:24:35.720
 or promises to other people,

2:24:35.720 --> 2:24:37.640
 because at the end of the day,

2:24:37.640 --> 2:24:39.960
 if your business fails, it's on you.

2:24:39.960 --> 2:24:43.880
 So if you promise to deliver something to a client,

2:24:43.880 --> 2:24:44.960
 you've got to deliver it to the client,

2:24:44.960 --> 2:24:47.320
 even if that means you stay up late

2:24:47.320 --> 2:24:49.920
 or if you lie on your taxes, whatever it might be,

2:24:49.920 --> 2:24:52.280
 there's a certain level of do or die.

2:24:52.280 --> 2:24:55.360
 Yeah, I personally have a sort of optimistic view

2:24:55.360 --> 2:25:00.200
 that ultimately the best way is to stay

2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:02.720
 within the ethical bounds, kind of like what you suggested.

2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:05.800
 If you want to be a company that's extremely successful,

2:25:05.800 --> 2:25:09.800
 is win with competence, not with cheating,

2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:14.100
 because cheating won't, I believe, win in the long term.

2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:20.160
 But in terms of being publicly responsible

2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:24.840
 to your decisions, I mean, I've already been supposed

2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:27.160
 to talk to Peter Thiel twice on this podcast,

2:25:27.160 --> 2:25:28.660
 and it's just been complicated.

2:25:28.660 --> 2:25:32.140
 If I were to put myself into his shoes,

2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:35.400
 why do podcasts?

2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:40.000
 The risk is too high to be a public person at all.

2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.240
 And so I totally understand that.

2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:47.120
 At the same time, I think if you're doing things

2:25:47.120 --> 2:25:55.120
 by the book and you're the best in the world at your job,

2:25:55.120 --> 2:25:56.680
 then you have nothing to worry about.

2:25:56.680 --> 2:25:59.120
 And you can advertise that and you recruit,

2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:02.800
 you help recruit, I mean, that's the work of capitalism

2:26:02.800 --> 2:26:07.160
 is you want to advertise that this is the place

2:26:07.160 --> 2:26:10.440
 where the best people in the world at this thing work.

2:26:10.440 --> 2:26:14.160
 True, I think that your point of view is accurate.

2:26:14.160 --> 2:26:19.160
 I would also say that the complexities

2:26:19.160 --> 2:26:21.080
 of what makes somebody make a decision

2:26:22.200 --> 2:26:26.160
 can only really be properly calculated with a baseline.

2:26:26.160 --> 2:26:27.600
 So because there is no baseline

2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:29.400
 that you or I have on Peter Thiel,

2:26:29.400 --> 2:26:33.040
 it's difficult to really ascertain why he does

2:26:33.040 --> 2:26:35.400
 or doesn't accept invites or why he does or doesn't appear.

2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:40.400
 Well, let me ask your opinion on the NSA,

2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:42.600
 and then maybe you could mention

2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:46.440
 about bulk collection in general in the CIA,

2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:51.160
 but let's look at some history with the NSA and Snowden.

2:26:51.160 --> 2:26:55.880
 What's your opinion on the mass surveillance

2:26:55.880 --> 2:27:00.880
 that is reported to have been conducted by the NSA?

2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:04.720
 We've talked about ethics.

2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:09.720
 Are you troubled by the, from a public perception,

2:27:09.720 --> 2:27:14.720
 the unethical nature of mass surveillance

2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:17.920
 of especially American citizens?

2:27:18.880 --> 2:27:21.920
 This is a topic that I never get tired of talking about,

2:27:21.920 --> 2:27:25.320
 but it's very rare that anyone ever really agrees with me,

2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:26.160
 just so you know.

2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:30.680
 I see where you're, well, I think there's a nuance thing

2:27:30.680 --> 2:27:32.440
 here and maybe we'll find some agreement.

2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:37.440
 The truth is that the American experience after 9 11

2:27:37.440 --> 2:27:40.600
 is nothing like the American experience now.

2:27:40.600 --> 2:27:45.040
 So all the terminology, all the talk about privacy

2:27:45.040 --> 2:27:47.080
 and privacy laws and mass surveillance

2:27:47.080 --> 2:27:48.200
 and all this other stuff,

2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:50.480
 it was a completely different time then.

2:27:50.480 --> 2:27:52.000
 And that's not to say it was an excuse,

2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:57.000
 because to this day, I will still say mass collection,

2:27:57.080 --> 2:28:00.160
 bulk collection of data that allows

2:28:00.160 --> 2:28:02.800
 for an expedient identification of a threat

2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:06.560
 to national security benefits all of us,

2:28:06.560 --> 2:28:09.520
 but people don't understand what they want.

2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:11.080
 Like people don't understand what the value

2:28:11.080 --> 2:28:13.200
 of their own privacy is.

2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:14.280
 First of all, the fact that people think

2:28:14.280 --> 2:28:17.520
 they have personal privacy is laughable.

2:28:17.520 --> 2:28:19.080
 You have no privacy.

2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:20.560
 The cell phone that you carry in your pocket,

2:28:20.560 --> 2:28:22.520
 you're giving permission to those apps constantly.

2:28:22.520 --> 2:28:24.240
 You're giving commercial organizations,

2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:25.560
 what you and I have already said,

2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:28.680
 are less tied to ethical responsibility.

2:28:28.680 --> 2:28:31.760
 You're giving them permission to collect enormous amounts

2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:34.160
 of private data from you all the time.

2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:37.480
 And do you know what happens if AT&T or Verizon

2:28:37.480 --> 2:28:40.800
 sees some nefarious activity on your account?

2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:42.080
 They do nothing.

2:28:42.080 --> 2:28:45.520
 They might send a note to FBI because they have to,

2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:47.160
 according to some checklist.

2:28:47.160 --> 2:28:49.600
 But when NSA was collecting intelligence

2:28:49.600 --> 2:28:51.800
 on metadata from around the United States,

2:28:51.800 --> 2:28:54.960
 they were very specifically looking for terrorist threats

2:28:54.960 --> 2:28:56.600
 that would harm American lives.

2:28:58.200 --> 2:29:00.440
 Man, NSA can clone my phone.

2:29:00.440 --> 2:29:01.960
 I will give them my children's phone.

2:29:01.960 --> 2:29:04.800
 I will give them the passwords to every one of my accounts

2:29:04.800 --> 2:29:07.080
 if it means that there's a likelihood

2:29:07.080 --> 2:29:09.920
 that my family will be safer from a nefarious actor

2:29:09.920 --> 2:29:12.240
 who's intent on hurting us.

2:29:13.240 --> 2:29:15.000
 NSA doesn't care about your affair.

2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:17.120
 NSA doesn't care if you're cheating on your taxes.

2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:20.800
 NSA doesn't care if you talk shit about your boss

2:29:20.800 --> 2:29:22.720
 or if you hate the US president.

2:29:22.720 --> 2:29:24.560
 Nobody cares about that.

2:29:24.560 --> 2:29:26.000
 Your intelligence community is there

2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:29.440
 to find threats to national security.

2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:31.800
 That's what they're there to do.

2:29:31.800 --> 2:29:35.640
 What Snowden did when he outed that whole program,

2:29:36.680 --> 2:29:38.920
 the fact that the court, the justice system,

2:29:38.920 --> 2:29:41.360
 the civilian justice system went back

2:29:41.360 --> 2:29:44.280
 and essentially overruled the ruling

2:29:44.280 --> 2:29:47.000
 of the intelligence courts before them

2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:51.680
 just goes to show how the general mass community

2:29:51.680 --> 2:29:53.520
 really shouldn't have a say

2:29:53.520 --> 2:29:55.680
 in what happens in the intelligence community.

2:29:55.680 --> 2:29:56.840
 They really shouldn't.

2:29:56.840 --> 2:30:00.760
 You have politicians and you have the opportunity

2:30:00.760 --> 2:30:03.760
 to elect people to a position and then you trust them.

2:30:03.760 --> 2:30:05.840
 That's what a representative republic is.

2:30:05.840 --> 2:30:07.280
 You vote the people in,

2:30:07.280 --> 2:30:09.040
 you trust them to work on your behalf.

2:30:09.040 --> 2:30:11.680
 They make decisions without running them by you.

2:30:11.680 --> 2:30:14.520
 They make decisions that they believe

2:30:14.520 --> 2:30:16.240
 are in the best interest of their constituency

2:30:16.240 --> 2:30:19.760
 and that's how our form of democracy works.

2:30:21.240 --> 2:30:23.520
 It worked, we were safer.

2:30:23.520 --> 2:30:25.360
 Now that we don't have that information

2:30:25.360 --> 2:30:27.240
 and now that there's this giant looming question

2:30:27.240 --> 2:30:28.880
 of whether or not NSA is there to serve people

2:30:28.880 --> 2:30:31.200
 or is collecting mass surveillance

2:30:31.200 --> 2:30:33.400
 against all American people,

2:30:33.400 --> 2:30:35.600
 that's not really a true accurate representation

2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:36.880
 of what they were ever doing.

2:30:36.880 --> 2:30:39.280
 They were looking for the needle in a haystack

2:30:39.280 --> 2:30:42.680
 of the series of transactions in metadata

2:30:42.680 --> 2:30:45.560
 that was going to lead to American deaths.

2:30:45.560 --> 2:30:48.880
 We are now less secure because they can't do that

2:30:48.880 --> 2:30:50.760
 and that bothers me.

2:30:50.760 --> 2:30:53.800
 So you said a few really interesting things there.

2:30:53.800 --> 2:30:56.600
 So because you are kind of an insider,

2:30:56.600 --> 2:30:59.480
 or were for a time an insider, meaning you were able

2:30:59.480 --> 2:31:03.040
 to build up an intuition about the good, the bad,

2:31:03.040 --> 2:31:07.240
 and the ugly of these institutions, specifically the good.

2:31:07.240 --> 2:31:09.560
 A lot of people don't have a good sense of the good.

2:31:09.560 --> 2:31:11.400
 They know the bad and the ugly

2:31:11.400 --> 2:31:14.000
 or can infer the bad and the ugly.

2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:18.240
 You mentioned that the one little key little thing there

2:31:18.240 --> 2:31:22.560
 at the end saying the NSA doesn't care

2:31:22.560 --> 2:31:24.880
 about whether you hate the president or not.

2:31:24.880 --> 2:31:28.640
 Now that's what people really worry about

2:31:28.640 --> 2:31:32.400
 is they're not sure they can trust the government

2:31:32.400 --> 2:31:36.280
 to not go into full dictatorial mode

2:31:36.280 --> 2:31:40.020
 and basing your political preference, your oppositions,

2:31:40.020 --> 2:31:43.100
 your, basically one of the essential powers,

2:31:46.120 --> 2:31:48.040
 the freedom of speech in the United States

2:31:48.040 --> 2:31:49.680
 is the ability to criticize your government.

2:31:49.680 --> 2:31:50.520
 Exactly.

2:31:50.520 --> 2:31:55.520
 And that, they worry, well, can't the government

2:31:56.200 --> 2:31:59.720
 get a hold of the NSA and start to ask the basic question,

2:31:59.720 --> 2:32:02.320
 well, can you give me a list of people

2:32:02.320 --> 2:32:03.840
 that are criticizing the government?

2:32:03.840 --> 2:32:06.080
 Think about, so let's just walk through that exact example,

2:32:06.080 --> 2:32:08.760
 right, because this is, it's a preponderance,

2:32:08.760 --> 2:32:12.400
 it's a preponderance fear, it's a ridiculous fear

2:32:12.400 --> 2:32:15.560
 because you would have to tap on multiple elements

2:32:15.560 --> 2:32:16.880
 of government for anything to happen.

2:32:16.880 --> 2:32:20.440
 So for example, let's just say that somebody goes

2:32:20.440 --> 2:32:22.560
 to the NSA and says, hey, can you give us a readout

2:32:22.560 --> 2:32:25.380
 on all the people who are tweeting terrible things

2:32:25.380 --> 2:32:26.400
 about the president?

2:32:26.400 --> 2:32:28.940
 Okay, cool, here's your hundred million people,

2:32:28.940 --> 2:32:30.200
 whatever it is, right?

2:32:30.200 --> 2:32:31.400
 Here's all the people saying negative things

2:32:31.400 --> 2:32:32.680
 about the government.

2:32:32.680 --> 2:32:35.480
 So now they have a list, what do they do next?

2:32:35.480 --> 2:32:37.100
 Well, let's just make it simple.

2:32:37.100 --> 2:32:40.240
 They stay with NSA and they say, surveil them even more,

2:32:40.240 --> 2:32:42.580
 tap their phones, tap their computers,

2:32:42.580 --> 2:32:43.480
 I wanna know even more.

2:32:43.480 --> 2:32:46.280
 So then they get this preponderance of evidence.

2:32:46.280 --> 2:32:47.920
 What do you do with evidence?

2:32:47.920 --> 2:32:49.920
 You take it to a court.

2:32:49.920 --> 2:32:52.760
 Well, guess what no court is going to support?

2:32:52.760 --> 2:32:56.920
 Anything that goes against the freedom of speech.

2:32:56.920 --> 2:32:58.900
 So the court is not going to support

2:32:58.900 --> 2:33:01.120
 what the executive is asking them to do.

2:33:01.120 --> 2:33:03.080
 Even before you take somebody to court,

2:33:03.080 --> 2:33:05.240
 you have to involve law enforcement.

2:33:05.240 --> 2:33:08.100
 Essentially, you have to send some sort of police force

2:33:08.100 --> 2:33:11.520
 to go apprehend the individual who's in question.

2:33:11.520 --> 2:33:13.600
 Well, guess what doesn't meet criteria

2:33:13.600 --> 2:33:16.440
 for any police force anywhere in the United States?

2:33:16.440 --> 2:33:20.780
 Arresting people who say negative things

2:33:20.780 --> 2:33:21.620
 about the president.

2:33:21.620 --> 2:33:25.120
 Now, if somebody poses a threat to the life

2:33:25.120 --> 2:33:27.800
 of a public figure or the threat to life of a politician,

2:33:27.800 --> 2:33:29.320
 that's a completely different case,

2:33:29.320 --> 2:33:31.280
 which means the standards of evidence are much higher

2:33:31.280 --> 2:33:32.720
 for them to arrest that person.

2:33:32.720 --> 2:33:36.160
 So unless you create a secret police force,

2:33:36.160 --> 2:33:37.920
 then your actual public police force

2:33:37.920 --> 2:33:39.240
 is never gonna take action.

2:33:39.240 --> 2:33:42.680
 So all these people who are afraid of this exact situation

2:33:42.680 --> 2:33:43.680
 that you're outlying,

2:33:43.680 --> 2:33:46.660
 they need the creation of a secret police force,

2:33:46.660 --> 2:33:48.080
 the creation of a secret court

2:33:48.080 --> 2:33:50.120
 that operates outside the judicial system,

2:33:50.120 --> 2:33:52.080
 the creation of a secret intelligence service

2:33:52.080 --> 2:33:54.880
 that operates outside of foreign intelligence collection,

2:33:54.880 --> 2:33:57.080
 all so that a handful of people

2:33:57.080 --> 2:34:00.220
 who don't like the president get what?

2:34:00.220 --> 2:34:04.440
 Whisked away, assassinated, put in prison, who knows what?

2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:06.160
 Think about the resources that would be,

2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:08.320
 the amount of money and time

2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:10.840
 and how hard would it be to keep that secret,

2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:13.000
 to have all of those things in motion.

2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:15.840
 The reason it worked in Russia and Soviet Germany

2:34:15.840 --> 2:34:17.480
 or Russia and communist Germany

2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:21.080
 was because everybody knew there was a secret police.

2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:23.740
 Everybody knew that there was a threat

2:34:23.740 --> 2:34:25.480
 to work to speaking out against the government.

2:34:25.480 --> 2:34:26.800
 It's completely different here.

2:34:26.800 --> 2:34:28.680
 Well, so there's a lot to say.

2:34:28.680 --> 2:34:32.120
 So one is yes, if I was a dictator

2:34:32.120 --> 2:34:35.380
 and I wanted to, and just looking at history,

2:34:36.320 --> 2:34:38.380
 let me take myself out of it,

2:34:38.380 --> 2:34:41.000
 but I think one of the more effective ways

2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:43.000
 is you don't need the surveillance.

2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:45.440
 You can pick out a random person

2:34:45.440 --> 2:34:49.360
 and in a public display, semi public display,

2:34:50.800 --> 2:34:54.400
 basically put them in jail for opposing the government,

2:34:54.400 --> 2:34:56.040
 whether they oppose it or not,

2:34:56.040 --> 2:34:59.440
 and the fear, that sends a message to a lot of people.

2:34:59.440 --> 2:35:02.080
 That's exactly what you see happening in China.

2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:03.480
 That's what you just light out.

2:35:03.480 --> 2:35:06.160
 It's genius, and that is the standard.

2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:07.720
 You don't need the surveillance for that.

2:35:07.720 --> 2:35:09.040
 Yep.

2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:12.600
 But that said, if you did do the surveillance,

2:35:13.460 --> 2:35:15.400
 so that's the support, the sort of,

2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:17.220
 the incentives aren't aligned.

2:35:17.220 --> 2:35:18.600
 It seems like a lot of work to do

2:35:18.600 --> 2:35:20.600
 for the thing you could do without the surveillance.

2:35:20.600 --> 2:35:21.440
 Right.

2:35:21.440 --> 2:35:25.680
 But yes, the courts wouldn't,

2:35:25.680 --> 2:35:29.400
 if you were to be able to get a list of people,

2:35:29.400 --> 2:35:31.400
 which I think that part you could do.

2:35:31.400 --> 2:35:32.980
 Correct.

2:35:32.980 --> 2:35:34.160
 That oppose the government.

2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:36.920
 You could do that just like you said on Twitter publicly.

2:35:36.920 --> 2:35:38.540
 You could make a list.

2:35:38.540 --> 2:35:41.240
 And with that, you can start to,

2:35:41.240 --> 2:35:43.100
 especially if you have a lot of data on those people,

2:35:43.100 --> 2:35:46.400
 find ways in which they did violate the law.

2:35:46.400 --> 2:35:48.840
 Not because they oppose the government,

2:35:48.840 --> 2:35:50.240
 but because in some other way.

2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:53.880
 They'll park your tickets or didn't pay the taxes.

2:35:53.880 --> 2:35:55.160
 That's probably a common one,

2:35:55.160 --> 2:35:57.900
 or like screwed up something about the taxes.

2:35:57.900 --> 2:36:00.600
 I just happen to know Russia and Ukraine,

2:36:00.600 --> 2:36:03.020
 they're very good at this kind of stuff.

2:36:03.020 --> 2:36:06.400
 Knowing how the citizens screwed everything up,

2:36:06.400 --> 2:36:08.720
 because especially in those countries,

2:36:08.720 --> 2:36:10.960
 everybody's breaking the law.

2:36:10.960 --> 2:36:13.100
 Because in a corrupt nation,

2:36:13.100 --> 2:36:16.160
 you have to bend the law to operate the war.

2:36:16.160 --> 2:36:18.840
 The number of people that pay taxes fully

2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:22.560
 in those nations is just very low, not zero.

2:36:22.560 --> 2:36:26.440
 And so they then use that breaking of the law

2:36:26.440 --> 2:36:29.400
 to come up with an excuse to actually put you in jail

2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:31.040
 based on that.

2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:33.080
 So it's possible to imagine.

2:36:33.080 --> 2:36:34.360
 But yes, I think,

2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:39.360
 I think that's the ugly part of surveillance.

2:36:39.880 --> 2:36:41.960
 But I do think, just like you said,

2:36:41.960 --> 2:36:43.560
 the incentives aren't correct.

2:36:43.560 --> 2:36:47.480
 Like you really don't need to get all of the secret police

2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:49.920
 and all of these kinds of organizations working.

2:36:49.920 --> 2:36:53.640
 If you do have a charismatic, powerful leader

2:36:53.640 --> 2:36:55.840
 that built up a network that's able to control

2:36:55.840 --> 2:37:00.360
 a lot of organizations to a level of authoritarianism

2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:03.820
 in a government, they're just able to do the usual thing.

2:37:03.820 --> 2:37:06.800
 One, have propaganda machine to tell narratives.

2:37:06.800 --> 2:37:10.860
 Two, pick out people that they can put in jail

2:37:10.860 --> 2:37:12.340
 for opposing the state.

2:37:12.340 --> 2:37:15.040
 And maybe loud members of the press

2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:16.200
 start silencing the press.

2:37:16.200 --> 2:37:19.040
 There's a playbook to this thing.

2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:21.160
 It doesn't require the surveillance.

2:37:21.160 --> 2:37:24.680
 The surveillance, you know what is useful

2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:27.920
 for the surveillance is the thing you mentioned in China,

2:37:27.920 --> 2:37:32.920
 which is encourage everybody in the citizenry

2:37:34.240 --> 2:37:35.440
 to watch each other,

2:37:35.440 --> 2:37:38.080
 to say there's enemies of the state everywhere.

2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:40.880
 And then you start having children reporting

2:37:40.880 --> 2:37:42.880
 on their appearance and that kind of stuff.

2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:46.040
 Again, don't need a surveillance state for that.

2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:49.420
 Now the good of a surveillance system,

2:37:49.420 --> 2:37:53.040
 if it's operating within ethical bounds,

2:37:53.040 --> 2:37:55.600
 is that yes, it could protect the populace.

2:37:55.600 --> 2:37:59.720
 So you're saying like the good given on your understanding

2:37:59.720 --> 2:38:03.620
 of these institutions, the good outweighs the bad.

2:38:03.620 --> 2:38:06.080
 Absolutely, so let me give you just a practical example.

2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:07.800
 So people don't realize this,

2:38:07.800 --> 2:38:10.440
 but there's multiple surveillance states that are out there.

2:38:10.440 --> 2:38:12.080
 There are surveillance states that are close allies

2:38:12.080 --> 2:38:13.560
 with the United States.

2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:14.720
 One of those surveillance states

2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:18.680
 is the United Arab Emirates, the UAE.

2:38:18.680 --> 2:38:23.320
 Now I lived in the UAE from 2019 to 2020,

2:38:23.320 --> 2:38:26.720
 came back on a repatriation flight after COVID broke out.

2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:28.160
 And, but we were there for a full year.

2:38:28.160 --> 2:38:31.880
 We were residents, we had IDs, we had everything.

2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:35.200
 Now, when you get your national ID in the Emirates,

2:38:35.200 --> 2:38:39.180
 you get a chip and that chip connects you to everything.

2:38:39.180 --> 2:38:41.100
 It connects you to cameras,

2:38:41.100 --> 2:38:44.080
 it connects you to your license plate on your car,

2:38:44.080 --> 2:38:46.800
 to your passport, to your credit card, everything.

2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:49.520
 Everything is intertwined, everything is interlinked.

2:38:49.520 --> 2:38:51.060
 When you drive, there are no police.

2:38:51.060 --> 2:38:52.520
 There are no police on the roads.

2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:56.440
 Every 50 to 100 meters, you cross a camera

2:38:56.440 --> 2:38:59.240
 that reads your license plate, measures your speed.

2:38:59.240 --> 2:39:00.780
 And if you're breaking the speed limit,

2:39:00.780 --> 2:39:02.800
 it just immediately charges your credit card

2:39:02.800 --> 2:39:04.520
 because it's tied, it's all tied together.

2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:05.760
 Totally surveillance.

2:39:05.760 --> 2:39:08.760
 That technology was invented by the Israelis

2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:10.960
 who use it in Israel.

2:39:13.080 --> 2:39:17.100
 When I was in Abu Dhabi and I was rear ended at high speed

2:39:17.100 --> 2:39:19.760
 by what turned out to be an Emirati official,

2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:23.260
 a senior ranking official of one of the Emirates.

2:39:23.260 --> 2:39:25.080
 It was caught on camera.

2:39:25.080 --> 2:39:27.380
 His ID was registered, my ID was registered.

2:39:27.380 --> 2:39:28.960
 Everything was tied back to our IDs.

2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:31.760
 The proof and the evidence was crystal clear.

2:39:31.760 --> 2:39:34.620
 Even still, he was Emirati, I was not.

2:39:34.620 --> 2:39:37.580
 So when I went to the police station to file the complaints,

2:39:37.580 --> 2:39:39.920
 it was something that nobody was comfortable with

2:39:39.920 --> 2:39:41.160
 because generally speaking,

2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:45.080
 Emiratis don't accept legal claims

2:39:45.080 --> 2:39:46.800
 against their own from foreigners.

2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:48.800
 But the difference was that I was an American

2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:50.120
 and I was there on a contract

2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:51.720
 supporting the Emirati government.

2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:54.640
 So I had these different variances, right?

2:39:54.640 --> 2:39:57.160
 Long story short, in the end,

2:39:57.160 --> 2:39:59.800
 the surveillance state is what made sure

2:39:59.800 --> 2:40:01.840
 that justice was played

2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:06.280
 because the proof was incontrovertible.

2:40:07.120 --> 2:40:09.320
 There was so much evidence collected

2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:11.340
 because of the surveillance nature of their state.

2:40:11.340 --> 2:40:12.920
 Now, why do they have a surveillance state?

2:40:12.920 --> 2:40:14.400
 It's not for people like me.

2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:16.660
 It's because they're constantly afraid

2:40:16.660 --> 2:40:21.360
 of extremist terrorist activity happening inside Abu Dhabi

2:40:21.360 --> 2:40:22.860
 or inside the UAE

2:40:22.860 --> 2:40:25.200
 because they're under constant threat from Islam

2:40:25.200 --> 2:40:26.980
 and they're from extremists

2:40:26.980 --> 2:40:28.640
 and they're under constant threat from Iran.

2:40:28.640 --> 2:40:32.080
 So that's what drives the people to want a police state,

2:40:32.080 --> 2:40:33.680
 to want a surveillance state.

2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:36.480
 For them, their survival is paramount

2:40:36.480 --> 2:40:38.760
 and they need the surveillance to have that survival.

2:40:38.760 --> 2:40:43.400
 For us, we haven't tasted that level of desperation and fear

2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:45.160
 yet or hopefully never,

2:40:45.160 --> 2:40:46.260
 but that's what makes us feel

2:40:46.260 --> 2:40:48.920
 like there's something wrong with surveillance.

2:40:48.920 --> 2:40:50.560
 Surveillance is all about the purpose.

2:40:50.560 --> 2:40:52.140
 It's all about the intent.

2:40:52.140 --> 2:40:53.980
 Well, and like you said,

2:40:53.980 --> 2:40:56.680
 companies do a significant amount of surveillance

2:40:56.680 --> 2:41:00.440
 to provide us with services that we take for granted.

2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:04.200
 For example, just one of the things to give props

2:41:04.200 --> 2:41:06.160
 to the digital efforts

2:41:06.160 --> 2:41:08.480
 of the Zelensky administration in Ukraine.

2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:09.740
 I don't know if you're aware,

2:41:09.740 --> 2:41:12.880
 but they have this digital transformation efforts

2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:17.880
 where you could put, there's an, it's laughable to say

2:41:19.620 --> 2:41:20.460
 in the United States,

2:41:20.460 --> 2:41:22.020
 but they actually did a really good job

2:41:22.020 --> 2:41:25.760
 by having a government app that has your passport on it.

2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:27.120
 It's all the digital information.

2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:28.960
 You can get a doctor.

2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:31.720
 It's like everything that you would think America

2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:35.740
 would be doing, like license, like all that kind of stuff,

2:41:35.740 --> 2:41:36.800
 it's in an app.

2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:39.600
 You could pay, there's payment to each other.

2:41:39.600 --> 2:41:41.440
 And that's all coming, I mean,

2:41:41.440 --> 2:41:43.280
 there's probably contractors somehow connected

2:41:43.280 --> 2:41:44.160
 to the whole thing,

2:41:44.160 --> 2:41:46.800
 but that's like under the flag of government.

2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:49.320
 And so that's an incredible technology.

2:41:49.320 --> 2:41:53.040
 And I didn't, I guess, hear anybody talk about surveillance

2:41:53.040 --> 2:41:56.240
 in that context, even though it is, but they all love it.

2:41:56.240 --> 2:41:57.200
 And it's super easy.

2:41:57.200 --> 2:42:00.760
 And they, frankly already, it's so easy and convenient.

2:42:00.760 --> 2:42:02.720
 They've already taken for granted that,

2:42:02.720 --> 2:42:04.440
 of course, this is what you do.

2:42:04.440 --> 2:42:06.680
 Of course, your passport is on your phone.

2:42:06.680 --> 2:42:09.180
 For everybody to have housed in a server

2:42:09.180 --> 2:42:10.640
 that you have no idea where it's at,

2:42:10.640 --> 2:42:13.240
 that could be hacked at any time by a third party.

2:42:13.240 --> 2:42:14.720
 They don't ask these kinds of questions

2:42:14.720 --> 2:42:16.040
 because it's so convenient,

2:42:16.040 --> 2:42:21.040
 as we do for Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple,

2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:27.080
 Microsoft products we use.

2:42:27.080 --> 2:42:29.280
 Security and convenience are on two opposite sides

2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:30.840
 of another spectrum.

2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:33.240
 The more convenient something is, the less secure.

2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:36.240
 And the more secure something is, the less convenient.

2:42:36.240 --> 2:42:39.580
 And that's a battle that we're always working

2:42:39.580 --> 2:42:41.280
 with as individuals, and then we're trying

2:42:41.280 --> 2:42:43.440
 to outsource that battle to our politicians.

2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:44.560
 And our politicians are, frankly,

2:42:44.560 --> 2:42:46.820
 just more interested in being politicians.

2:42:46.820 --> 2:42:49.120
 Yeah, that said, I mean, people are really worried

2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:54.120
 about giving any one institution a large amount of power,

2:42:54.800 --> 2:42:59.800
 especially when it's a federal government institution,

2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:02.000
 given some history.

2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:04.980
 First of all, just history of the corruption,

2:43:04.980 --> 2:43:08.640
 of power corrupting individuals and institutions.

2:43:08.640 --> 2:43:13.640
 And second of all, myth or reality of certain institutions

2:43:15.300 --> 2:43:17.760
 like the CIA misbehaving.

2:43:17.760 --> 2:43:20.720
 Well, let me actually ask you about the Edward Snowden.

2:43:20.720 --> 2:43:25.720
 So you, outside of the utility that you're arguing for

2:43:26.340 --> 2:43:29.160
 of the NSA surveillance program,

2:43:29.160 --> 2:43:34.160
 do you think Edward Snowden is a criminal or a hero?

2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:38.180
 In terms, in the eyes of the law, he's a criminal.

2:43:38.180 --> 2:43:41.120
 He broke the law, he broke the confidence,

2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:43.760
 he made us, he was under security obligation.

2:43:43.760 --> 2:43:45.500
 And then when he ran away, he ran away

2:43:45.500 --> 2:43:47.760
 to all of the worst villains in the world

2:43:47.760 --> 2:43:52.620
 from the US perspective to basically seek protection.

2:43:53.580 --> 2:43:58.580
 That's how you act in the face of accusation

2:43:59.560 --> 2:44:03.400
 is in essence part of the case that you build for yourself.

2:44:03.400 --> 2:44:07.120
 So running away to China, Russia, Cuba,

2:44:07.120 --> 2:44:09.920
 there was a Latin Ecuador, I think,

2:44:09.920 --> 2:44:11.880
 that just paints a very negative picture

2:44:11.880 --> 2:44:13.600
 that does not suggest that you were doing anything

2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:14.720
 that was ethical and upright

2:44:14.720 --> 2:44:16.200
 and in favor of the American people

2:44:16.200 --> 2:44:19.480
 if you're gonna run to American enemies to support yourself.

2:44:19.480 --> 2:44:22.580
 So for sure, in the eyes of law, he's a criminal.

2:44:22.580 --> 2:44:26.240
 In the eyes of a group of people

2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:30.920
 who are largely ignorant to what they lost,

2:44:30.920 --> 2:44:32.720
 to them, he's a hero.

2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:35.320
 To me, he's just kind of a sad case.

2:44:35.320 --> 2:44:40.320
 I personally look at Snowden as a sad, unfortunate case.

2:44:41.240 --> 2:44:45.160
 His life is ruined, his family name is tarnished.

2:44:46.220 --> 2:44:50.140
 He's forever going to be a desperate pawn.

2:44:51.920 --> 2:44:54.400
 And that's all because of the decisions that he made

2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:55.600
 and the order that he made them.

2:44:55.600 --> 2:44:57.220
 I'm not sure his name is tarnished.

2:44:57.220 --> 2:45:01.480
 I think the case you're making is a difficult case to make.

2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:06.480
 And so I think his name represents fighting one man,

2:45:08.360 --> 2:45:11.400
 it's like Tiananmen Square standing before the tank,

2:45:11.400 --> 2:45:15.760
 is like one man fighting the government.

2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:18.120
 And I think that there is some aspect

2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:21.680
 which, taking that case aside,

2:45:21.680 --> 2:45:24.760
 that is the American spirit,

2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:28.960
 which is hold the powerful accountable.

2:45:28.960 --> 2:45:31.400
 So whenever there's somebody in power,

2:45:31.400 --> 2:45:34.620
 one individual can change.

2:45:38.200 --> 2:45:39.440
 One man can make a difference.

2:45:39.440 --> 2:45:40.720
 Can make a difference, yeah.

2:45:40.720 --> 2:45:42.320
 Very Knight Rider of you.

2:45:42.320 --> 2:45:45.240
 I mean, that's the American individualism.

2:45:45.240 --> 2:45:46.720
 And so he represents that.

2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:49.640
 And I think there's a huge skepticism

2:45:49.640 --> 2:45:52.960
 against large federal institutions.

2:45:52.960 --> 2:45:56.560
 And I think if you look at the long arc of history,

2:45:56.560 --> 2:45:58.960
 that actually is a forcing function

2:45:58.960 --> 2:46:01.920
 for the institutions to behave their best.

2:46:01.920 --> 2:46:06.120
 So basically hold them accountable.

2:46:08.160 --> 2:46:11.280
 What's nice about this is that we can agree to disagree

2:46:11.280 --> 2:46:13.680
 and history will be the one that decides.

2:46:13.680 --> 2:46:18.680
 But there's a reason that Edward Snowden

2:46:18.680 --> 2:46:23.120
 needs to do something new every 16 or 18 months

2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:25.800
 to remain relevant, right?

2:46:25.800 --> 2:46:28.560
 Because if he didn't, he would just be forgotten.

2:46:28.560 --> 2:46:30.640
 Because he was not a maverick

2:46:30.640 --> 2:46:32.760
 who changed history for the better.

2:46:32.760 --> 2:46:37.480
 He was a man who broke a law and now he's on the run.

2:46:37.480 --> 2:46:41.060
 And to some people, he is a hero.

2:46:41.060 --> 2:46:42.880
 To other people, he is a criminal.

2:46:42.880 --> 2:46:46.560
 But to the vast majority, he's just a blip

2:46:46.560 --> 2:46:48.320
 on a radar of their everyday life

2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:50.680
 that really makes no difference to them at all.

2:46:50.680 --> 2:46:51.980
 So actually let's linger on that.

2:46:51.980 --> 2:46:54.420
 So just to clarify, do you think,

2:46:54.420 --> 2:46:57.620
 are you making the difficult case

2:46:57.620 --> 2:47:00.780
 that the NSA mass surveillance program

2:47:00.780 --> 2:47:04.980
 was one, ethical and two, made a better world for Americans?

2:47:04.980 --> 2:47:08.260
 I am making the case that at the time,

2:47:08.260 --> 2:47:13.100
 it was exactly what we needed to feel safe in our own homes.

2:47:13.100 --> 2:47:16.500
 But what about to be safe, actually be safe?

2:47:16.500 --> 2:47:19.080
 So this is what's difficult because any proof

2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:20.920
 that was that they collected

2:47:20.920 --> 2:47:23.500
 that actually prevented an attack from happening

2:47:23.500 --> 2:47:24.900
 is proof we'll never know about.

2:47:24.900 --> 2:47:27.480
 This is the really unfortunate side

2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:28.500
 of intelligence operations.

2:47:28.500 --> 2:47:30.500
 And I've been at the front end of this.

2:47:30.500 --> 2:47:32.220
 You work your ass off.

2:47:32.220 --> 2:47:33.700
 You take personal risk.

2:47:33.700 --> 2:47:35.740
 You make personal sacrifice to make sure

2:47:35.740 --> 2:47:38.260
 that something terrible doesn't happen.

2:47:38.260 --> 2:47:39.980
 Nobody knows that that ever happens.

2:47:39.980 --> 2:47:41.620
 Does that have to be that way?

2:47:41.620 --> 2:47:44.800
 Does it have to remain secret

2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:49.800
 every time the NSA or the CIA saves the lives of Americans?

2:47:50.980 --> 2:47:52.140
 It does for two reasons.

2:47:52.140 --> 2:47:52.980
 It has to be secret.

2:47:52.980 --> 2:47:55.540
 First, the mythos.

2:47:55.540 --> 2:47:58.940
 The same thing we were talking about with General Petraeus.

2:47:58.940 --> 2:48:01.560
 You can't brag about your victories

2:48:01.560 --> 2:48:05.300
 if you want to let the myth shape itself.

2:48:05.300 --> 2:48:06.240
 You can't do that.

2:48:06.240 --> 2:48:11.240
 The second thing is once a victory is claimed,

2:48:14.300 --> 2:48:17.460
 the danger comes from letting your enemy know

2:48:17.460 --> 2:48:19.060
 that you claimed the victory

2:48:19.060 --> 2:48:20.260
 because they can reverse engineer

2:48:20.260 --> 2:48:22.540
 and they can start to change how they did things.

2:48:22.540 --> 2:48:25.020
 If a terrorist act, if a terrorist cell tries

2:48:25.020 --> 2:48:27.620
 to execute an operation and the operation fails,

2:48:27.620 --> 2:48:29.600
 from their point of view, they don't know why it failed.

2:48:29.600 --> 2:48:30.780
 They just know that it failed.

2:48:30.780 --> 2:48:33.580
 But then if the US or if the American government comes in

2:48:33.580 --> 2:48:37.760
 and says, we took apart this amazing attack,

2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:39.940
 now they have more information, right?

2:48:39.940 --> 2:48:41.860
 The whole power of secrets, like we talked about before,

2:48:41.860 --> 2:48:43.500
 the power of secrets is in knowing

2:48:43.500 --> 2:48:44.660
 that not everybody has them.

2:48:44.660 --> 2:48:46.700
 There's only a shelf life.

2:48:46.700 --> 2:48:48.340
 So take advantage of the shelf life.

2:48:48.340 --> 2:48:49.820
 You get space.

2:48:49.820 --> 2:48:51.340
 So you gotta keep it a secret.

2:48:51.340 --> 2:48:56.140
 There is no tactical advantage from sharing a secret

2:48:56.140 --> 2:48:59.980
 unless you are specifically trying to achieve

2:48:59.980 --> 2:49:01.940
 a certain tactical advantage from sharing that secret,

2:49:01.940 --> 2:49:03.100
 which is what we've seen so much of

2:49:03.100 --> 2:49:05.180
 with US intel sharing with Ukraine.

2:49:05.180 --> 2:49:07.340
 There's a tactical advantage from sharing a secret

2:49:07.340 --> 2:49:10.740
 about Russian military movements or weaknesses in tanks

2:49:10.740 --> 2:49:14.100
 or supply chain challenges, whatever it might be.

2:49:14.100 --> 2:49:16.340
 Well, let me argue that there might be an advantage

2:49:16.340 --> 2:49:19.820
 to share information with the American public

2:49:19.820 --> 2:49:24.820
 when a terrorist attack or is averted

2:49:25.700 --> 2:49:28.460
 or the lives of Americans are saved,

2:49:28.460 --> 2:49:30.060
 because what that does.

2:49:30.060 --> 2:49:33.120
 Is make every American think that they're not that safe.

2:49:34.080 --> 2:49:36.420
 There is no tactical advantage there.

2:49:36.420 --> 2:49:37.260
 You think so?

2:49:37.260 --> 2:49:38.100
 Absolutely.

2:49:38.100 --> 2:49:38.920
 What about?

2:49:38.920 --> 2:49:43.920
 If the Austin PD started telling you every day

2:49:44.060 --> 2:49:48.140
 about these crazy crimes that they prevented,

2:49:48.140 --> 2:49:49.860
 would that make you feel more safe?

2:49:49.860 --> 2:49:51.460
 It would make you feel like they're doing their job.

2:49:51.460 --> 2:49:53.620
 Is that obvious to you, make us feel less safe?

2:49:53.620 --> 2:49:55.620
 Because if we see competence,

2:49:55.620 --> 2:49:59.900
 that there is extremely competent defenders

2:49:59.900 --> 2:50:02.940
 of this territory of these people,

2:50:02.940 --> 2:50:05.060
 wouldn't that make us feel more safe or no?

2:50:05.060 --> 2:50:08.880
 The human nature is not to assign competence.

2:50:08.880 --> 2:50:13.880
 So empirically, humans overvalue losses

2:50:14.980 --> 2:50:17.140
 and undervalue gains.

2:50:17.140 --> 2:50:19.220
 That's something that we've seen from finance

2:50:19.220 --> 2:50:20.480
 to betting and beyond.

2:50:21.500 --> 2:50:23.580
 If the Austin Police Department starts telling you

2:50:23.580 --> 2:50:26.780
 about all these heinous crimes that were avoided

2:50:26.780 --> 2:50:28.960
 because of their hard work,

2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:30.740
 the way that your brain is actually going

2:50:30.740 --> 2:50:33.620
 to process that information is you are going to say,

2:50:33.620 --> 2:50:36.860
 if this is all the stuff that they've stopped,

2:50:36.860 --> 2:50:39.700
 how bad must this place be?

2:50:39.700 --> 2:50:41.940
 How much more haven't they stopped?

2:50:41.940 --> 2:50:45.380
 I take your point, it's a powerful psychological point,

2:50:45.380 --> 2:50:49.200
 but looking at the other picture of it,

2:50:49.200 --> 2:50:52.640
 looking at the police force, looking at the CIA, the NSA,

2:50:53.720 --> 2:50:56.680
 those people, now with the police,

2:50:56.680 --> 2:51:00.020
 they're seeing, there's such a negative feeling

2:51:00.020 --> 2:51:03.460
 amongst Americans towards these institutions.

2:51:03.460 --> 2:51:06.620
 Who the hell wants to work for the CIA now

2:51:06.620 --> 2:51:07.940
 and the police force?

2:51:07.940 --> 2:51:12.540
 Like, you're gonna be criticized,

2:51:12.540 --> 2:51:16.980
 like that's a, I mean, that's really bad for the CIA.

2:51:16.980 --> 2:51:18.100
 It's terrible.

2:51:18.100 --> 2:51:20.500
 Like, as opposed to being seen as a hero,

2:51:20.500 --> 2:51:25.060
 like for example, currently soldiers are for the most part

2:51:25.060 --> 2:51:27.380
 seen as heroes that are protecting this nation.

2:51:30.220 --> 2:51:32.700
 That's not the case for the CIA.

2:51:32.700 --> 2:51:36.840
 Soldiers weren't seen as heroes in the Vietnam War, right?

2:51:36.840 --> 2:51:39.480
 You've got to remember that when you,

2:51:39.480 --> 2:51:43.580
 so first of all, public service is a sacrifice.

2:51:43.580 --> 2:51:45.260
 We oftentimes forget that.

2:51:45.260 --> 2:51:47.300
 We start to think, oh, government jobs are cushy

2:51:47.300 --> 2:51:49.360
 and they're easy, and it must be so easy

2:51:49.360 --> 2:51:50.200
 to be the president,

2:51:50.200 --> 2:51:52.980
 because then you're basically a celebrity overnight.

2:51:52.980 --> 2:51:56.720
 Public service is a sacrifice, it's a grind.

2:51:57.700 --> 2:52:02.300
 For all of the soldiers, the submariners,

2:52:02.300 --> 2:52:05.020
 the missileers, the police officers,

2:52:05.020 --> 2:52:06.540
 intelligence specialists,

2:52:06.540 --> 2:52:09.020
 they all know what it's like to give things up,

2:52:09.020 --> 2:52:12.620
 to serve a public that can turn its opinion

2:52:12.620 --> 2:52:14.620
 at any given time.

2:52:14.620 --> 2:52:16.900
 And history is what defines it.

2:52:16.900 --> 2:52:19.060
 The more important thing is to understand that

2:52:19.060 --> 2:52:22.300
 if you want a true open and fair democracy,

2:52:22.300 --> 2:52:25.300
 you cannot control a narrative.

2:52:25.300 --> 2:52:27.580
 And starting to share all of your victories

2:52:27.580 --> 2:52:29.460
 or starting to share your biggest victories

2:52:29.460 --> 2:52:31.620
 with the intent of shaping public opinion

2:52:31.620 --> 2:52:35.380
 to be supportive of the police force or supportive of CIA

2:52:35.380 --> 2:52:39.180
 or supportive of you name it, is shaping a narrative

2:52:39.180 --> 2:52:43.280
 that is intentional operational use of influence

2:52:43.280 --> 2:52:45.540
 to drive public opinion.

2:52:45.540 --> 2:52:47.660
 That is something nobody wants to get into.

2:52:47.660 --> 2:52:50.400
 It is much more professional to be a silent sentinel,

2:52:50.400 --> 2:52:54.140
 a silent servant, humbly carrying the burden

2:52:54.140 --> 2:52:56.040
 of public service in the United States

2:52:56.040 --> 2:52:59.220
 where we are a fair and open democracy.

2:52:59.220 --> 2:53:04.220
 Why, why not celebrate the killing of Bin Laden?

2:53:04.220 --> 2:53:05.060
 We did.

2:53:05.060 --> 2:53:06.840
 The search, discovery, and the capture

2:53:06.840 --> 2:53:08.380
 and the killing of Bin Laden.

2:53:08.380 --> 2:53:10.640
 Wasn't that, actually the details of that,

2:53:10.640 --> 2:53:12.520
 how much of the details of that,

2:53:12.520 --> 2:53:15.440
 how he was discovered were made public?

2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:17.520
 I think some of it was made public enough.

2:53:17.520 --> 2:53:19.080
 Why not do that?

2:53:19.080 --> 2:53:21.500
 Doesn't that make heroes out of the people

2:53:21.500 --> 2:53:23.480
 that are servants?

2:53:23.480 --> 2:53:28.480
 Or do people who serve to do service for this nation,

2:53:28.800 --> 2:53:30.840
 do they always have to operate

2:53:30.840 --> 2:53:34.600
 in a thankless manner in the shadows?

2:53:34.600 --> 2:53:36.920
 I think that's a very good question.

2:53:36.920 --> 2:53:41.840
 The folks who I left behind when I left CIA,

2:53:41.840 --> 2:53:45.720
 who continue to serve as faceless,

2:53:45.720 --> 2:53:50.100
 nameless heroes every day, I am grateful to them.

2:53:51.800 --> 2:53:56.760
 The truth is that if they were motivated by something else,

2:53:56.760 --> 2:53:59.800
 they wouldn't be as good as they are at doing what they do.

2:53:59.800 --> 2:54:03.980
 And I see your point about,

2:54:03.980 --> 2:54:07.020
 shouldn't we be celebrating our victories?

2:54:07.020 --> 2:54:09.040
 But when celebrating our victories

2:54:09.040 --> 2:54:14.040
 runs the risk of informing our enemies how we operate,

2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:17.020
 giving away our informational advantage,

2:54:17.020 --> 2:54:19.220
 giving away our tactical battlefield advantage,

2:54:19.220 --> 2:54:22.280
 and running the risk of shaping a narrative intentionally

2:54:22.280 --> 2:54:24.100
 among our own American people,

2:54:24.100 --> 2:54:27.440
 now all of a sudden we're turning into exactly the thing

2:54:27.440 --> 2:54:30.320
 that the American people trust us not to become.

2:54:31.960 --> 2:54:34.200
 Yeah, but then you operate in the secrecy,

2:54:34.200 --> 2:54:39.040
 and then there's corrupt and douchebag people everywhere.

2:54:39.040 --> 2:54:42.960
 So when they, even inside the CIA and criminals,

2:54:42.960 --> 2:54:45.940
 inside the CIA there's criminals in all organizations,

2:54:45.940 --> 2:54:48.680
 in all walks of life, human nature as such,

2:54:48.680 --> 2:54:50.460
 that this is always the case,

2:54:50.460 --> 2:54:53.240
 then it breeds conspiracy theories.

2:54:53.240 --> 2:54:54.760
 It does.

2:54:54.760 --> 2:54:56.340
 And sometimes those conspiracy theories

2:54:56.340 --> 2:54:57.560
 turn out to be true.

2:54:57.560 --> 2:54:59.780
 But most times they don't.

2:54:59.780 --> 2:55:02.680
 That's just part of the risk of being a myth.

2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:05.880
 Can you speak to some of the myths?

2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:08.840
 So MKUltra, so.

2:55:08.840 --> 2:55:09.800
 Not a myth.

2:55:09.800 --> 2:55:10.820
 Not a myth.

2:55:10.820 --> 2:55:14.520
 So this is a fascinating human experimentation program

2:55:14.520 --> 2:55:17.400
 undertaken by the CIA to develop procedures

2:55:17.400 --> 2:55:20.820
 for using drugs like LSD to interrogate people

2:55:20.820 --> 2:55:23.960
 through, let's say, psychological manipulation

2:55:23.960 --> 2:55:25.900
 and maybe even torture.

2:55:25.900 --> 2:55:28.520
 The scale of the program is perhaps not known.

2:55:29.520 --> 2:55:32.000
 How do you make sense that this program existed?

2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:33.780
 Again, you've gotta look through the lens of time.

2:55:33.780 --> 2:55:35.480
 You've gotta look at where we were historically

2:55:35.480 --> 2:55:36.320
 at that time.

2:55:36.320 --> 2:55:38.480
 There was the peak of the Cold War.

2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:41.880
 Our enemies were doing the same kind of experimentation.

2:55:41.880 --> 2:55:44.440
 It was essentially another space race.

2:55:44.440 --> 2:55:49.000
 What if they broke through a new weapon technology

2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:50.240
 faster than we did?

2:55:50.240 --> 2:55:52.240
 What would that mean for the safety and security

2:55:52.240 --> 2:55:54.760
 of the American people?

2:55:54.760 --> 2:55:57.400
 So right decision or wrong decision,

2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:00.040
 it was guided by and informed

2:56:00.040 --> 2:56:02.160
 by national security priorities.

2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:06.640
 So from this program that was designed to use drugs

2:56:06.640 --> 2:56:08.800
 to drive interrogation and torture people

2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:12.600
 was born something very productive, Operation Stargate,

2:56:12.600 --> 2:56:17.480
 which was a chance to use remote viewing and metaphysics

2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:19.200
 to try to collect intelligence.

2:56:19.200 --> 2:56:23.600
 Now, even though in the end, the outcome of MKUltra

2:56:23.600 --> 2:56:25.540
 and the outcome of Stargate were mixed,

2:56:25.540 --> 2:56:27.040
 nobody really knows if they did or didn't do

2:56:27.040 --> 2:56:28.480
 what they were supposed to do,

2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:30.400
 we still know that to this day,

2:56:30.400 --> 2:56:34.080
 there's still a demand in the US government and in CIA

2:56:34.080 --> 2:56:38.080
 for people who have sensitivities to ethereal energies.

2:56:39.080 --> 2:56:40.680
 By the way, is there any proof

2:56:40.680 --> 2:56:41.800
 that that kind of stuff works?

2:56:41.800 --> 2:56:46.320
 Or it just shows that there's interest.

2:56:46.320 --> 2:56:47.960
 It shows that there's openness

2:56:47.960 --> 2:56:49.700
 to consider those kinds of things.

2:56:49.700 --> 2:56:51.720
 But is there any evidence that that kind of stuff works?

2:56:51.720 --> 2:56:53.620
 If there's evidence, I haven't seen it.

2:56:54.800 --> 2:56:58.880
 Speaking from a science based point of view only,

2:56:58.880 --> 2:57:03.000
 if energy and matter can always be exchanged,

2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:05.880
 then a person who can understand

2:57:05.880 --> 2:57:09.040
 and become sensitive to energy

2:57:09.040 --> 2:57:11.520
 is a person who could become sensitive

2:57:11.520 --> 2:57:13.680
 to what does become matter.

2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:17.460
 Yeah, I mean, the basics of the physics might be there,

2:57:17.460 --> 2:57:20.000
 but a lot of people probably are skeptical.

2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:21.640
 I'm skeptical too, but I'm just trying to look at it.

2:57:21.640 --> 2:57:23.040
 You should be open minded, right?

2:57:23.040 --> 2:57:26.320
 I mean, that's actually, you know,

2:57:26.320 --> 2:57:28.680
 that's what science is about, is remain open minded,

2:57:28.680 --> 2:57:30.560
 even for the things that are long shots,

2:57:30.560 --> 2:57:31.520
 because those are the things

2:57:31.520 --> 2:57:34.400
 that actually define scientific revolutions.

2:57:34.400 --> 2:57:37.600
 What about Operation Northwoods?

2:57:37.600 --> 2:57:41.600
 It was a proposed 1962 false flag operation

2:57:41.600 --> 2:57:46.600
 by the DOD and the CIA to be carried out by the CIA

2:57:46.960 --> 2:57:50.400
 to commit acts of terrorism on Americans

2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:52.280
 and blame them on Cuba.

2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:55.760
 So JFK, the president, rejected the proposal.

2:57:55.760 --> 2:57:58.080
 What do you make that this was on the table,

2:57:58.080 --> 2:57:59.360
 Operation Northwoods?

2:57:59.360 --> 2:58:00.760
 So it's interesting.

2:58:00.760 --> 2:58:02.920
 First, I'm glad that JFK rejected it.

2:58:02.920 --> 2:58:05.440
 That's a good sign.

2:58:05.440 --> 2:58:09.120
 So we have to understand that good ideas

2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:12.100
 are oftentimes born from bad ideas.

2:58:12.100 --> 2:58:14.240
 I had a really good friend of mine

2:58:14.240 --> 2:58:16.920
 who actually went on to become a pastor,

2:58:16.920 --> 2:58:18.560
 and he used to say all the time

2:58:18.560 --> 2:58:20.440
 that he wanted all the bad ideas on the table.

2:58:20.440 --> 2:58:21.880
 Like, give me all your bad ideas

2:58:21.880 --> 2:58:23.920
 every time we had any kind of conversation.

2:58:23.920 --> 2:58:25.400
 And I was always one of those people who was like,

2:58:25.400 --> 2:58:28.000
 isn't a bad idea just a waste of time?

2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:28.840
 And he was like, no,

2:58:28.840 --> 2:58:31.360
 because the best ideas oftentimes come from bad ideas.

2:58:31.360 --> 2:58:35.040
 So again, Cuban missile crisis,

2:58:35.040 --> 2:58:36.960
 mass hysteria in the United States

2:58:36.960 --> 2:58:38.520
 about nuclear war from Cuba,

2:58:38.520 --> 2:58:41.160
 missiles blowing up American cities faster

2:58:41.160 --> 2:58:43.040
 than we could even see them coming.

2:58:43.040 --> 2:58:45.960
 It makes sense to me that a president would go to,

2:58:45.960 --> 2:58:48.520
 especially the part of CIA,

2:58:48.520 --> 2:58:51.440
 which is the Special Activities Division,

2:58:51.440 --> 2:58:52.280
 it makes perfect sense to me

2:58:52.280 --> 2:58:54.040
 that the president would go to a division

2:58:54.040 --> 2:58:55.320
 called Special Activities,

2:58:55.320 --> 2:58:59.560
 whose job it is to create crazy ideas

2:58:59.560 --> 2:59:02.460
 that have presidential approval,

2:59:02.460 --> 2:59:04.600
 but nobody knows they exist.

2:59:04.600 --> 2:59:07.080
 So it makes sense that he would challenge a group like that

2:59:07.080 --> 2:59:09.320
 to come up with any wacky idea, right?

2:59:09.320 --> 2:59:10.140
 Come up with anything.

2:59:10.140 --> 2:59:11.440
 Just let's start with something,

2:59:11.440 --> 2:59:13.820
 because we can't bring nothing to the table.

2:59:13.820 --> 2:59:15.760
 We have to do something about this Cuban issue.

2:59:15.760 --> 2:59:17.720
 And then that's how an operation like that

2:59:17.720 --> 2:59:19.200
 could reasonably be born.

2:59:19.200 --> 2:59:20.860
 Not because anybody wants to do it,

2:59:20.860 --> 2:59:22.480
 but because they were tasked by the president

2:59:22.480 --> 2:59:24.820
 to come up with five ideas.

2:59:24.820 --> 2:59:26.520
 And it was one of the ideas.

2:59:27.600 --> 2:59:29.560
 That still happens to this day.

2:59:29.560 --> 2:59:31.120
 The president will still come in,

2:59:31.120 --> 2:59:33.000
 but it'll basically send out a notice

2:59:33.000 --> 2:59:34.840
 to his covert action arm.

2:59:34.840 --> 2:59:38.080
 And he will say, I need this.

2:59:38.080 --> 2:59:39.600
 And I need it on Wednesday.

2:59:39.600 --> 2:59:41.920
 And people have to come back with options

2:59:41.920 --> 2:59:44.400
 for the thing he asked for, a finding.

2:59:44.400 --> 2:59:46.440
 He will issue a presidential finding.

2:59:46.440 --> 2:59:48.640
 And then his covert action arms have to come back and say,

2:59:48.640 --> 2:59:49.840
 here's how we would do this

2:59:49.840 --> 2:59:51.640
 and hide the hands of the Americans.

2:59:53.000 --> 2:59:55.520
 How gangster was it of JFK to reject it though?

2:59:55.520 --> 2:59:56.520
 His baller, right?

2:59:57.480 --> 3:00:00.040
 That's like, that is a mic drop right there.

3:00:00.040 --> 3:00:01.520
 Nope, not doing that.

3:00:01.520 --> 3:00:02.360
 Yep, doing that.

3:00:03.680 --> 3:00:07.440
 A thing that crosses an ethical line,

3:00:07.440 --> 3:00:10.880
 even in a time where the human,

3:00:10.880 --> 3:00:13.640
 the entirety of human civilization hangs in a balance,

3:00:13.640 --> 3:00:16.160
 still forfeit that power.

3:00:16.160 --> 3:00:20.560
 That's a beautiful thing about the American experiment.

3:00:20.560 --> 3:00:22.560
 That's a few times throughout the history

3:00:22.560 --> 3:00:23.840
 that this has happened,

3:00:23.840 --> 3:00:27.000
 including with our first president, George Washington.

3:00:28.160 --> 3:00:30.280
 Well, let me ask about JFK.

3:00:30.280 --> 3:00:35.280
 25 times two, and they still keep that stuff classified.

3:00:35.280 --> 3:00:40.280
 So do you think the CIA had a hand

3:00:40.880 --> 3:00:43.680
 in the assassination of JFK?

3:00:43.680 --> 3:00:48.680
 I cannot imagine in any reasonable point of view

3:00:48.680 --> 3:00:51.560
 that the organization of CIA had anything to do

3:00:51.560 --> 3:00:53.120
 with the assassination of JFK.

3:00:53.120 --> 3:00:57.160
 So it's not possible to infiltrate the CIA,

3:00:57.160 --> 3:01:02.160
 a small part of the CIA in order to attain political

3:01:02.160 --> 3:01:07.160
 or criminal gains, or financial.

3:01:07.840 --> 3:01:10.840
 Yeah, absolutely it's possible to infiltrate CIA.

3:01:10.840 --> 3:01:14.640
 There's a long history of foreign intelligence services

3:01:14.640 --> 3:01:17.480
 infiltrating CIA, from Aldrich Ames

3:01:17.480 --> 3:01:20.520
 to Jerry Lee recently with China.

3:01:20.520 --> 3:01:22.680
 So we know CIA can be infiltrated,

3:01:24.400 --> 3:01:25.960
 even if they are infiltrated,

3:01:25.960 --> 3:01:29.640
 and even if that's interlocutor execution

3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:34.640
 that interlocutor executes on their own agenda

3:01:35.320 --> 3:01:39.480
 or the agenda as directed by their foreign adversary,

3:01:39.480 --> 3:01:41.000
 their foreign handler,

3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:45.120
 that's different than organizational support for an event.

3:01:45.120 --> 3:01:47.760
 So I do think it's possible

3:01:47.760 --> 3:01:49.280
 they could have been infiltrated at the time,

3:01:49.280 --> 3:01:52.720
 especially it was a major priority

3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:54.440
 for the Cubans and the Russians

3:01:54.440 --> 3:01:58.560
 to infiltrate some aspect of US intelligence,

3:01:58.560 --> 3:02:03.400
 multiple moles were caught in the years following.

3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:05.480
 So it's not surprising

3:02:05.480 --> 3:02:07.240
 that there would be a priority for that.

3:02:07.240 --> 3:02:09.480
 But to say that the organization of CIA

3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:12.240
 was somehow in cahoots with,

3:02:12.240 --> 3:02:15.160
 to independently assassinate their own executive,

3:02:15.160 --> 3:02:16.680
 that's a significant stretch.

3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:18.680
 I've seen no evidence to support that.

3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:21.520
 And it goes contrary to everything I learned

3:02:21.520 --> 3:02:22.640
 from my time at CIA.

3:02:24.600 --> 3:02:26.120
 Well, let me ask you,

3:02:26.120 --> 3:02:29.840
 do you think CIA played a part in enabling drug cartels

3:02:29.840 --> 3:02:31.240
 and drug trafficking,

3:02:31.240 --> 3:02:33.520
 which is another big kind of

3:02:35.680 --> 3:02:37.920
 shadow that hangs over the CIA?

3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:39.280
 At the beginning of the drug war,

3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:41.040
 I would imagine the answer is yes.

3:02:42.320 --> 3:02:45.200
 CIA has its own counter narcotics division,

3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:47.640
 a division that's dedicated to fighting

3:02:47.640 --> 3:02:49.440
 and preventing narcotics

3:02:49.440 --> 3:02:51.320
 from coming into the United States.

3:02:51.320 --> 3:02:53.440
 So when you paint a picture for me,

3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:56.160
 like do you think the CIA was complicit

3:02:56.160 --> 3:02:59.920
 in helping drug trafficking or drug use?

3:02:59.920 --> 3:03:01.360
 When I say yes,

3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:03.360
 my exception is I don't think they did that

3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:05.640
 for Americans inside the United States.

3:03:05.640 --> 3:03:07.720
 If the CIA can basically set it up

3:03:07.720 --> 3:03:10.480
 so that two different drug cartels shoot each other

3:03:10.480 --> 3:03:13.520
 by assisting in the transaction

3:03:13.520 --> 3:03:17.960
 of a sale to a third country

3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:20.120
 and then leaking that that sale happened

3:03:20.120 --> 3:03:21.680
 to a competing cartel,

3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:23.800
 that's just letting cartels do what they do.

3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:25.640
 That's them doing the dirty work for us.

3:03:25.640 --> 3:03:27.200
 So especially at the beginning of the drug war,

3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:28.680
 I think there was tons of space,

3:03:28.680 --> 3:03:31.080
 lots of room for CIA to get involved

3:03:31.080 --> 3:03:33.720
 in the economics of drugs

3:03:33.720 --> 3:03:35.400
 and then let the inevitable happen.

3:03:35.400 --> 3:03:36.880
 And that was way more efficient,

3:03:36.880 --> 3:03:40.840
 way more productive than us trying to send our own troops

3:03:40.840 --> 3:03:43.960
 in to kill a bunch of cartel warlords.

3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:45.280
 So that makes a ton of sense to me.

3:03:45.280 --> 3:03:46.120
 It just seems efficient.

3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:47.280
 It seems very practical.

3:03:47.280 --> 3:03:49.480
 I do not believe that CIA would like,

3:03:49.480 --> 3:03:50.880
 I don't think all the accusations out there

3:03:50.880 --> 3:03:53.640
 about how they would buy drugs and sell drugs

3:03:53.640 --> 3:03:55.280
 and somehow make money on the side from it.

3:03:55.280 --> 3:03:56.880
 That's not how it works.

3:03:56.880 --> 3:03:59.680
 So do you think there's, on that point,

3:03:59.680 --> 3:04:01.640
 a connection between Barry Seal,

3:04:02.960 --> 3:04:05.760
 the great governor and then President Bill Clinton,

3:04:05.760 --> 3:04:08.680
 Oliver North and Vice President and former CIA Director

3:04:08.680 --> 3:04:11.800
 George H.W. Bush and the little town

3:04:11.800 --> 3:04:14.920
 with a little airport called Mena, Arkansas?

3:04:14.920 --> 3:04:17.120
 So I am out of my element now.

3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:19.840
 This is one I haven't heard many details about.

3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:24.840
 Okay, so your sense is any of the drug trafficking

3:04:25.960 --> 3:04:28.880
 has to do with criminal operations

3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:30.800
 outside of the United States and the CIA

3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:35.240
 just leveraging that to achieve its ends

3:04:35.240 --> 3:04:37.520
 but nothing to do with American citizens

3:04:37.520 --> 3:04:39.840
 and American politicians.

3:04:39.840 --> 3:04:43.320
 With American citizens, again, speaking organizationally.

3:04:43.320 --> 3:04:45.620
 So that would be my sense, yes.

3:04:45.620 --> 3:04:50.500
 Let me ask you about, so back to Operation Northwoods

3:04:50.500 --> 3:04:55.500
 because it's such a powerful tool,

3:04:55.580 --> 3:04:59.980
 sadly powerful tool used by dictators throughout history,

3:04:59.980 --> 3:05:01.940
 the false flag operation.

3:05:04.940 --> 3:05:09.140
 So I think there's, and you said the terrorist attacks

3:05:09.140 --> 3:05:14.140
 in 9 11 were, it changed a lot for us,

3:05:14.140 --> 3:05:18.580
 for the United States, for Americans.

3:05:18.580 --> 3:05:19.860
 It changed the way we see the world.

3:05:19.860 --> 3:05:22.020
 It woke us up to the harshness of the world.

3:05:22.020 --> 3:05:25.000
 I think there's, to my eyes at least,

3:05:25.000 --> 3:05:27.340
 there's nothing that shows evidence

3:05:27.340 --> 3:05:30.500
 that 9 11 was a quote inside job.

3:05:30.500 --> 3:05:35.500
 But is the CIA or the intelligence agencies

3:05:37.020 --> 3:05:41.300
 or the US government capable of something like that?

3:05:41.300 --> 3:05:42.820
 But that's the question.

3:05:42.820 --> 3:05:46.020
 So there's a bunch of shadiness

3:05:46.020 --> 3:05:47.860
 about how it was reported on.

3:05:47.860 --> 3:05:51.580
 I just can't, that's the thing I struggle with.

3:05:53.860 --> 3:05:57.100
 While there's no evidence that there was an inside job,

3:05:57.100 --> 3:05:59.340
 it raises the question to me,

3:05:59.340 --> 3:06:02.980
 well, could something like this be an inside job?

3:06:02.980 --> 3:06:06.620
 Because it sure as heck, now looking back 20 years,

3:06:06.620 --> 3:06:09.500
 the amount of money that was spent on these wars,

3:06:09.500 --> 3:06:11.700
 the military industrial complex,

3:06:11.700 --> 3:06:15.320
 the amount of interest in terms of power and money involved,

3:06:17.580 --> 3:06:22.580
 organizationally, can something like that happen?

3:06:22.580 --> 3:06:24.180
 You know Occam's razor.

3:06:24.180 --> 3:06:28.140
 So the harem's razor is that you can never prescribe

3:06:28.140 --> 3:06:32.560
 to conspiracy what could be explained through incompetence.

3:06:34.060 --> 3:06:37.300
 That is one of, those are two fundamental guidelines

3:06:37.300 --> 3:06:38.860
 that we follow all the time.

3:06:38.860 --> 3:06:40.700
 The simplest answer is oftentimes the best

3:06:40.700 --> 3:06:43.300
 and never prescribe to conspiracy

3:06:43.300 --> 3:06:44.740
 what can be explained through incompetence.

3:06:44.740 --> 3:06:47.540
 Can you elaborate what you mean by we?

3:06:47.540 --> 3:06:50.860
 We as intelligence professionals.

3:06:50.860 --> 3:06:55.140
 So you think there's a deep truth to that second razor?

3:06:55.140 --> 3:06:57.660
 There is more than a deep truth.

3:06:57.660 --> 3:07:01.900
 There's ages of experience for me and for others.

3:07:01.900 --> 3:07:04.620
 So in general, people are incompetent.

3:07:04.620 --> 3:07:09.060
 If left to their own means they're more incompetent

3:07:09.060 --> 3:07:13.740
 than they are malevolent at a large organizational scale.

3:07:13.740 --> 3:07:17.380
 People are more incompetent of executing a conspiracy

3:07:18.500 --> 3:07:22.440
 than they are of competently, yeah,

3:07:22.440 --> 3:07:25.180
 than they are of competently executing a conspiracy.

3:07:25.180 --> 3:07:28.700
 That's really what it means is that it's so difficult

3:07:28.700 --> 3:07:30.780
 to carry out a complex lie

3:07:30.780 --> 3:07:33.220
 that most people don't have the competency to do it.

3:07:33.220 --> 3:07:36.360
 So it doesn't make any sense to lead thinking of conspiracy.

3:07:36.360 --> 3:07:40.260
 It makes more sense to lead assuming incompetence.

3:07:40.260 --> 3:07:41.880
 When you look at all of the outcomes,

3:07:41.880 --> 3:07:45.060
 all the findings from 9 11, it speaks to incompetence.

3:07:45.060 --> 3:07:48.860
 It speaks brashly and openly to incompetence

3:07:48.860 --> 3:07:50.980
 and nobody likes talking about it.

3:07:50.980 --> 3:07:53.780
 FBI and CIA to this day hate hearing about it.

3:07:53.780 --> 3:07:56.300
 The 9 11 commission is gonna go down in history

3:07:56.300 --> 3:07:58.680
 as this painful example of the incompetence

3:07:58.680 --> 3:08:01.020
 of the American intelligence community.

3:08:01.020 --> 3:08:02.900
 And it's going to come back again and again.

3:08:02.900 --> 3:08:04.180
 Every time there's an intel flap,

3:08:04.180 --> 3:08:06.780
 it's gonna come back again and again.

3:08:06.780 --> 3:08:07.620
 What are you seeing?

3:08:07.620 --> 3:08:12.100
 Even right now, we miss the US intelligence infrastructure,

3:08:12.100 --> 3:08:16.380
 misjudged Afghanistan, misjudged Hong Kong,

3:08:16.380 --> 3:08:20.140
 misjudged Ukraine's and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

3:08:20.140 --> 3:08:22.900
 Those were three massive misjudgments in a few years.

3:08:24.420 --> 3:08:27.360
 That speaks, it's just embarrassing.

3:08:27.360 --> 3:08:28.200
 Exactly right.

3:08:28.200 --> 3:08:33.200
 So all the sort of cover up looking things around 9 11

3:08:33.200 --> 3:08:36.880
 is just people being embarrassed by their failures.

3:08:36.880 --> 3:08:39.240
 If they're taking steps to cover anything up,

3:08:39.240 --> 3:08:43.740
 it's just their own, it's a painful reminder

3:08:43.740 --> 3:08:46.180
 of their lack of competency at the time.

3:08:46.180 --> 3:08:48.680
 Now, I understand that conspiracy theorists

3:08:48.680 --> 3:08:51.900
 want to take inklings of information

3:08:51.900 --> 3:08:55.760
 and put them together in a way that is the most damning,

3:08:55.760 --> 3:08:59.240
 but that goes back to our point about overvaluing losses

3:08:59.240 --> 3:09:00.800
 and undervaluing gains.

3:09:00.800 --> 3:09:03.340
 It's just predictable human behavior.

3:09:03.340 --> 3:09:07.100
 Let me ask you about this because it comes up often.

3:09:07.960 --> 3:09:10.880
 So I'm from MIT and there's a guy by the name

3:09:10.880 --> 3:09:15.000
 of Jeffrey Epstein that still troubles me to this day

3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:17.480
 that some of the people I respect

3:09:17.480 --> 3:09:20.840
 were interacted with this individual

3:09:20.840 --> 3:09:23.840
 and fell into his influence.

3:09:23.840 --> 3:09:28.840
 The charm, charisma, whatever the hell he used

3:09:31.960 --> 3:09:36.960
 to delude these people, he did so successfully.

3:09:36.960 --> 3:09:38.680
 I'm very open minded about this thing.

3:09:38.680 --> 3:09:40.400
 I just, I would love to learn more,

3:09:40.400 --> 3:09:44.640
 but a lot of people tell me, a lot of people I respect,

3:09:44.640 --> 3:09:47.880
 that there's intelligence agencies behind this individual.

3:09:47.880 --> 3:09:50.240
 So they were using Jeffrey Epstein

3:09:50.240 --> 3:09:54.120
 for getting access to powerful people

3:09:54.120 --> 3:09:57.360
 and then to control and manipulate those powerful people.

3:09:57.360 --> 3:10:00.920
 The CIA, I believe, is not brought up as often as Mossad.

3:10:01.840 --> 3:10:04.360
 And so this goes back to the original aspect

3:10:04.360 --> 3:10:06.960
 of our conversation is how much each individual

3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:10.280
 intelligence agency is willing to go to control,

3:10:10.280 --> 3:10:13.500
 to manipulate, to achieve its means.

3:10:13.500 --> 3:10:16.400
 Do you think there is, can you educate me?

3:10:16.400 --> 3:10:21.360
 If, obviously you don't know, but you can bet,

3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:23.960
 what are the chances the intelligence agencies

3:10:23.960 --> 3:10:26.800
 are involved with the character of Jeffrey Epstein?

3:10:26.800 --> 3:10:29.320
 In some way, shape, or form with the character of Epstein,

3:10:29.320 --> 3:10:33.920
 it's 100% guaranteed that some intelligence organization

3:10:33.920 --> 3:10:36.320
 was involved, but let's talk about why.

3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:37.720
 Let's talk about why, okay?

3:10:38.600 --> 3:10:40.940
 There's multiple types of intelligence assets,

3:10:41.840 --> 3:10:43.400
 just like we were talking earlier.

3:10:43.400 --> 3:10:47.200
 There's foreign intelligence reporting assets,

3:10:47.200 --> 3:10:50.040
 there's access agents,

3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:51.920
 and then there's agents of influence.

3:10:51.920 --> 3:10:54.920
 Three different categories of intelligence, right?

3:10:54.920 --> 3:10:58.200
 One is when you talk about foreign intelligence reporters,

3:10:58.200 --> 3:10:59.720
 these are people who have access to secrets

3:10:59.720 --> 3:11:02.000
 and their job is to give you their secrets

3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:04.600
 in exchange for gold or money or alcohol or prostitution

3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:05.440
 or whatever else, right?

3:11:05.440 --> 3:11:07.080
 Their job is to give you secrets

3:11:07.080 --> 3:11:09.120
 and then you pay them for the secrets.

3:11:09.120 --> 3:11:13.440
 Access agents, their job is to give you physical access

3:11:13.440 --> 3:11:17.640
 or digital access to something of interest to you.

3:11:17.640 --> 3:11:19.840
 So maybe they're the ones that open a door

3:11:19.840 --> 3:11:21.320
 that should have been locked and let you come in

3:11:21.320 --> 3:11:23.080
 and stick your thumb drive in the computer.

3:11:23.080 --> 3:11:25.560
 Or maybe they're the ones that share a phone number

3:11:25.560 --> 3:11:27.480
 with somebody and then they're just like,

3:11:27.480 --> 3:11:29.080
 just don't tell them you got the phone number from me.

3:11:29.080 --> 3:11:31.200
 Their job is to give you access.

3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:33.600
 Then you have these agents of influence.

3:11:33.600 --> 3:11:38.600
 An agent of influence's job is to be part of your effort

3:11:38.600 --> 3:11:42.440
 to influence the outcomes in some way

3:11:42.440 --> 3:11:45.760
 that benefits your intelligence requirements, right?

3:11:45.760 --> 3:11:48.080
 Of these three types of people,

3:11:48.080 --> 3:11:52.480
 the least scrupulous and the most shady

3:11:52.480 --> 3:11:54.400
 is your agent of influence.

3:11:54.400 --> 3:11:55.520
 Because your agent of influence

3:11:55.520 --> 3:11:57.120
 understands exactly what they're doing.

3:11:57.120 --> 3:11:59.480
 They know they're working with one guy

3:11:59.480 --> 3:12:02.000
 and they know they're using the influence

3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:03.920
 to manipulate some other guy.

3:12:04.920 --> 3:12:06.960
 When it comes to powerful people,

3:12:06.960 --> 3:12:09.160
 especially wealthy, powerful people,

3:12:10.560 --> 3:12:13.760
 the only thing that interests them is power.

3:12:13.760 --> 3:12:16.040
 Money is not a challenge anymore.

3:12:16.040 --> 3:12:19.120
 Prestige, notoriety, none of those things are a challenge.

3:12:19.120 --> 3:12:21.000
 The rest of us, we're busy trying to make money.

3:12:21.000 --> 3:12:22.720
 We're busy trying to build a reputation.

3:12:22.720 --> 3:12:25.280
 We're busy trying to build a career, keep a family afloat.

3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:27.040
 At the highest levels, they're bored.

3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:28.440
 They don't need any of that.

3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:30.080
 The only thing that they care about

3:12:30.080 --> 3:12:31.960
 is being able to wield power.

3:12:31.960 --> 3:12:35.240
 So a character like Jeffrey Epstein

3:12:35.240 --> 3:12:37.920
 is exactly the kind of character

3:12:37.920 --> 3:12:41.240
 that the Chinese would want, the Russians would want,

3:12:41.240 --> 3:12:43.960
 Mossad would want, the French would want.

3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:47.640
 It's too easy because the man had access

3:12:47.640 --> 3:12:52.160
 to a wide range of American influential people.

3:12:52.160 --> 3:12:54.320
 For corporate espionage uses,

3:12:54.320 --> 3:12:56.880
 for economic espionage uses,

3:12:56.880 --> 3:12:59.400
 for national security espionage uses,

3:12:59.400 --> 3:13:01.360
 it doesn't make any sense

3:13:01.360 --> 3:13:03.600
 that a person like that wouldn't be targeted.

3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:04.520
 It doesn't.

3:13:04.520 --> 3:13:05.960
 So the question is.

3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:07.440
 Who?

3:13:07.440 --> 3:13:12.440
 Who, and whether, I think the really important distinction

3:13:14.320 --> 3:13:18.120
 here is was this person, was Jeffrey Epstein created,

3:13:18.120 --> 3:13:21.640
 or once he's achieved and built his network,

3:13:21.640 --> 3:13:23.520
 was he then infiltrated?

3:13:23.520 --> 3:13:26.800
 And that's a really sort of important difference.

3:13:26.800 --> 3:13:29.480
 Like at which stage do you connect a person like that?

3:13:29.480 --> 3:13:32.240
 You start to notice maybe they're effective

3:13:32.240 --> 3:13:36.040
 at building a network, and then you start making,

3:13:36.040 --> 3:13:39.040
 building a relationship to where at some point

3:13:39.040 --> 3:13:41.040
 it's a job, they're working for you.

3:13:41.040 --> 3:13:43.800
 Or do you literally create a person like that?

3:13:43.800 --> 3:13:45.720
 Yeah, so intelligence organizations

3:13:45.720 --> 3:13:47.120
 have different strategies here.

3:13:47.120 --> 3:13:49.760
 In the United States, we never create.

3:13:49.760 --> 3:13:53.320
 We don't have a budget cycle that allows us to create.

3:13:53.320 --> 3:13:55.280
 I mean, the maximum budget cycle

3:13:55.280 --> 3:13:57.120
 in the United States is five years.

3:13:57.120 --> 3:14:00.480
 So even if we were to try to invest in some seed operation

3:14:00.480 --> 3:14:03.080
 or create some character of influence,

3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:06.080
 essentially every year you have to justify

3:14:06.080 --> 3:14:07.680
 why you're spending budget.

3:14:07.680 --> 3:14:10.080
 And that becomes very difficult in a democracy like ours.

3:14:10.080 --> 3:14:13.760
 However, Russia and China are extremely adept

3:14:13.760 --> 3:14:17.200
 at seed operations, longterm operations.

3:14:17.200 --> 3:14:20.880
 They are willing to invest and develop

3:14:20.880 --> 3:14:25.880
 and create an agent that serves their purposes.

3:14:25.880 --> 3:14:30.400
 Now, to create someone from scratch like Jeffrey Epstein,

3:14:31.400 --> 3:14:33.520
 the probabilities are extremely low.

3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:34.480
 They would have had to start

3:14:34.480 --> 3:14:36.720
 with like a thousand different targets

3:14:36.720 --> 3:14:38.800
 and try to grow a thousand different,

3:14:38.800 --> 3:14:41.200
 if you will, influencers, and then hope

3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:42.120
 that one of them hits,

3:14:42.120 --> 3:14:44.040
 kind of like a venture capital firm, right?

3:14:44.040 --> 3:14:46.480
 Invest in many, hope that a few hits.

3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:50.720
 More likely, they observed him at some point

3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:52.760
 in his own natural rise.

3:14:52.760 --> 3:14:54.960
 They identified his personal vulnerability,

3:14:54.960 --> 3:14:57.040
 very classic espionage technique.

3:14:57.040 --> 3:15:00.560
 And then they stepped in, introduced themselves mid career

3:15:00.560 --> 3:15:03.560
 and said, hey, we know you have this thing that you like

3:15:03.560 --> 3:15:06.440
 that isn't really frowned upon by your own people,

3:15:06.440 --> 3:15:07.640
 but we don't frown upon it.

3:15:07.640 --> 3:15:10.000
 And we can help you both succeed

3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:14.360
 and have an endless supply of ladies along the way.

3:15:14.360 --> 3:15:17.640
 I recently talked to Ryan Graves, who's a lieutenant.

3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:20.920
 Ryan Graves, who's a fighter jet pilot,

3:15:20.920 --> 3:15:22.960
 about many things.

3:15:22.960 --> 3:15:26.120
 He also does work on autonomous weapon systems,

3:15:26.120 --> 3:15:27.760
 drones, and that kind of thing,

3:15:27.760 --> 3:15:29.480
 including quantum computing.

3:15:29.480 --> 3:15:33.840
 But he also happens to be one of the very few pilots

3:15:33.840 --> 3:15:35.680
 that were willing to go on record

3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:37.880
 and talk about UFO sightings.

3:15:39.880 --> 3:15:42.400
 Does the CIA and the federal government

3:15:42.400 --> 3:15:44.640
 have interest in UFOs?

3:15:44.640 --> 3:15:47.360
 In my experience at CIA, that is,

3:15:47.360 --> 3:15:51.320
 an area that remains very compartmented.

3:15:51.320 --> 3:15:54.320
 And that could be one of two reasons.

3:15:54.320 --> 3:15:56.280
 It could be because there is significant interest

3:15:56.280 --> 3:15:58.600
 and that's why it's so heavily compartmented.

3:15:58.600 --> 3:16:02.440
 Or it could be because it's an area that's non,

3:16:02.440 --> 3:16:03.600
 that's just not important.

3:16:03.600 --> 3:16:04.920
 It's a distraction.

3:16:04.920 --> 3:16:08.040
 So they compartment it so it doesn't distract

3:16:08.040 --> 3:16:09.440
 from other operations.

3:16:10.400 --> 3:16:15.400
 One of the areas that I've been quite interested in

3:16:15.400 --> 3:16:17.360
 and where I've done a lot of research and I've done some work

3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:19.520
 in the private intelligence and private investigation side

3:16:19.520 --> 3:16:20.600
 is with UFOs.

3:16:22.480 --> 3:16:25.120
 The place where UFOs really connect

3:16:25.120 --> 3:16:26.920
 with the federal government is when it comes

3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:30.760
 to aviation safety and predominance of power.

3:16:30.760 --> 3:16:34.600
 So FAA and the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. military

3:16:34.600 --> 3:16:36.520
 are very invested in knowing what's happening

3:16:36.520 --> 3:16:38.520
 in the skies above the United States.

3:16:38.520 --> 3:16:41.120
 And that's of primary interest to them.

3:16:41.120 --> 3:16:45.000
 When they can rule out the direct threat to national security

3:16:45.000 --> 3:16:47.880
 of UFOs, then they become less interested.

3:16:47.880 --> 3:16:52.160
 That said, when you have unexplained aerial phenomenon

3:16:52.160 --> 3:16:56.680
 that are unexplained, that can't directly be tied

3:16:56.680 --> 3:17:01.200
 to anything that is known of the terrestrial world,

3:17:02.240 --> 3:17:05.560
 then they're left without an answer to their question.

3:17:05.560 --> 3:17:08.360
 They don't know if it's a threat or not a threat.

3:17:08.360 --> 3:17:10.720
 But I think that's a very important question.

3:17:10.720 --> 3:17:12.600
 But I think the scarier concern

3:17:12.600 --> 3:17:13.840
 for the U.S. national government

3:17:13.840 --> 3:17:15.320
 or for the U.S. federal government,

3:17:15.320 --> 3:17:17.000
 the scarier concern that nobody talks about

3:17:17.000 --> 3:17:20.360
 is what if the UFO isn't alien?

3:17:20.360 --> 3:17:25.360
 What if it is actually a cutting edge war machine

3:17:25.920 --> 3:17:29.320
 that we are eons behind ever being able to replicate?

3:17:29.320 --> 3:17:34.240
 Or the other concern is that it's a system,

3:17:34.240 --> 3:17:36.880
 it's a machine from a foreign power

3:17:36.880 --> 3:17:38.760
 that's doing intelligence collection.

3:17:38.760 --> 3:17:39.600
 Correct.

3:17:39.600 --> 3:17:43.800
 Not just military purposes, it's actually collecting data.

3:17:43.800 --> 3:17:46.240
 Well, they fall, a lot of times the federal government

3:17:46.240 --> 3:17:47.200
 will see the two as the same.

3:17:47.200 --> 3:17:50.200
 It's a hostile tool from a foreign government.

3:17:50.200 --> 3:17:53.680
 So collection of information is a hostile act.

3:17:53.680 --> 3:17:56.600
 Absolutely, that's why the Espionage Act exists.

3:17:56.600 --> 3:17:58.160
 That's why it's a criminal offense

3:17:58.160 --> 3:18:00.360
 if you're committing espionage in the United States

3:18:00.360 --> 3:18:03.320
 as a U.S. citizen or a foreign citizen.

3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:04.680
 So I guess they keep digging

3:18:04.680 --> 3:18:07.000
 until they can confirm it's not a threat.

3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:10.640
 But it just, and you're saying that there's not,

3:18:10.640 --> 3:18:12.840
 from your understanding, much evidence that they're doing.

3:18:12.840 --> 3:18:17.040
 So it could be because they're compartmentalized.

3:18:17.040 --> 3:18:21.520
 But you're saying private intelligence institutions

3:18:21.520 --> 3:18:24.540
 are trying to make progress on this.

3:18:25.560 --> 3:18:29.600
 Yeah, it's really difficult to know the scale.

3:18:29.600 --> 3:18:31.480
 Yeah, there's an economic interest

3:18:31.480 --> 3:18:33.880
 in the private intelligence world.

3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:36.000
 Because, for example, if you understand

3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:40.000
 why certain aerial phenomenon are happening over a location,

3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:43.360
 then you can use that to inform investors,

3:18:43.360 --> 3:18:44.960
 whether to invest in that location

3:18:44.960 --> 3:18:47.080
 or avoid investment in that location.

3:18:47.080 --> 3:18:48.680
 But that's not a national security concern.

3:18:48.680 --> 3:18:51.500
 So it doesn't matter to the federal government.

3:18:52.600 --> 3:18:54.560
 Could these UFOs be aliens?

3:18:54.560 --> 3:18:57.320
 Now I'm going into a territory of you as a human being

3:18:57.320 --> 3:19:00.080
 wondering about all the alien civilizations

3:19:00.080 --> 3:19:01.640
 that are out there.

3:19:01.640 --> 3:19:03.980
 The humbling question.

3:19:03.980 --> 3:19:05.560
 We are not alone.

3:19:05.560 --> 3:19:07.040
 You think we're not alone.

3:19:07.040 --> 3:19:10.360
 It's an improbability that we are alone.

3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:15.120
 If by virtue of the fact that sentient human life exists,

3:19:15.120 --> 3:19:17.440
 intelligent human life exists,

3:19:17.440 --> 3:19:19.360
 all the probabilities that would have to be destroyed

3:19:19.360 --> 3:19:22.860
 for that to be true simply speak over the galaxies

3:19:22.860 --> 3:19:26.240
 that exist that there's no possible way we're alone.

3:19:26.240 --> 3:19:27.800
 It's a mathematical equation.

3:19:27.800 --> 3:19:30.320
 It's a one or a zero, right?

3:19:30.320 --> 3:19:32.600
 And for me, it has to exist.

3:19:32.600 --> 3:19:35.480
 It's impossible otherwise rationally for me to think

3:19:35.480 --> 3:19:37.960
 that we are truly the only intelligent life form

3:19:37.960 --> 3:19:39.360
 in all of the universe.

3:19:40.320 --> 3:19:44.000
 But to think that an alien life form

3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:49.000
 is anything like us at all is equally as inconceivable.

3:19:49.840 --> 3:19:53.360
 To think that they're carbon based bipedal humanoid

3:19:54.320 --> 3:19:57.120
 alien species that just happened to fly around

3:19:57.120 --> 3:20:01.120
 in metal machines and visit alien planets

3:20:01.120 --> 3:20:03.840
 in a way that they become observed

3:20:03.840 --> 3:20:07.080
 is, it's just silly, it's the world of sci fi.

3:20:07.080 --> 3:20:08.000
 Well, let me push.

3:20:08.000 --> 3:20:09.880
 Every good scientist,

3:20:09.880 --> 3:20:11.580
 because we always assume that they're superior

3:20:11.580 --> 3:20:12.880
 to us in intelligence.

3:20:12.880 --> 3:20:13.720
 Yes.

3:20:13.720 --> 3:20:16.440
 When any scientist carries out an experiment,

3:20:16.440 --> 3:20:19.520
 the whole objective of the experiment is to observe

3:20:19.520 --> 3:20:23.400
 without being disclosed or being discovered.

3:20:23.400 --> 3:20:26.320
 So why on earth would we think that the superior species

3:20:26.320 --> 3:20:29.220
 makes the mistake of being discovered over and over again?

3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:32.680
 So to push back on that idea,

3:20:32.680 --> 3:20:35.680
 if we were to think about us humans trying to communicate

3:20:35.680 --> 3:20:39.440
 with ants, first we observe for a while.

3:20:39.440 --> 3:20:41.280
 There'll be a bunch of PhDs written,

3:20:41.280 --> 3:20:45.120
 a bunch of people just sort of collecting data,

3:20:45.120 --> 3:20:48.440
 taking notes, trying to understand about this thing

3:20:48.440 --> 3:20:50.960
 that you detected that seems to be a living thing,

3:20:50.960 --> 3:20:52.560
 which is a very difficult thing to define

3:20:52.560 --> 3:20:55.200
 from an alien perspective or from our perspective

3:20:55.200 --> 3:20:57.600
 if we find life on Mars or something like that.

3:20:57.600 --> 3:20:59.720
 Okay, so you observe for a while.

3:20:59.720 --> 3:21:02.320
 But then if you want to actually interact with it,

3:21:02.320 --> 3:21:04.440
 how would you interact with the ants?

3:21:04.440 --> 3:21:06.880
 If I were to interact with the ants,

3:21:06.880 --> 3:21:10.620
 I would try to infiltrate.

3:21:10.620 --> 3:21:15.080
 I would try to figure out what is the language

3:21:15.080 --> 3:21:17.880
 they use to communicate with each other.

3:21:17.880 --> 3:21:21.840
 I would try to operate at their physical scale,

3:21:21.840 --> 3:21:24.620
 like in terms of the physics of their interaction,

3:21:24.620 --> 3:21:28.520
 in terms of the information, methods, mediums

3:21:28.520 --> 3:21:31.400
 of information exchange with pheromones or whatever,

3:21:31.400 --> 3:21:33.040
 however the heck, ants.

3:21:33.040 --> 3:21:36.000
 So I would try to mimic them in some way.

3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:38.400
 So in that sense, it makes sense

3:21:38.400 --> 3:21:43.400
 that the objects we would see, you mentioned bipedal.

3:21:44.480 --> 3:21:46.800
 Yes, of course it's ridiculous that aliens

3:21:46.800 --> 3:21:50.240
 would actually be very similar to us,

3:21:50.240 --> 3:21:54.520
 but maybe they create forms in order to be like,

3:21:54.520 --> 3:21:58.280
 here, the humans will understand it.

3:21:58.280 --> 3:22:00.920
 And this needs to be sufficiently different from humans

3:22:00.920 --> 3:22:02.840
 to know that there's something weird.

3:22:02.840 --> 3:22:05.080
 I don't know, I think it's actually

3:22:05.080 --> 3:22:07.360
 an incredibly difficult problem of figuring out

3:22:07.360 --> 3:22:10.420
 how to communicate with a thing way dumber than you.

3:22:11.920 --> 3:22:14.680
 People assume if you're smart,

3:22:14.680 --> 3:22:16.840
 it's easier to talk to the dumb thing.

3:22:16.840 --> 3:22:19.260
 But I think it's actually extremely difficult

3:22:19.260 --> 3:22:23.740
 when the gap in intelligence is just orders of magnitude.

3:22:23.740 --> 3:22:26.320
 And so of course you can observe,

3:22:26.320 --> 3:22:30.040
 but once you notice the thing is sufficiently interesting,

3:22:30.040 --> 3:22:32.160
 how do you communicate with that thing?

3:22:32.160 --> 3:22:34.320
 So this is where, one of the things

3:22:34.320 --> 3:22:38.720
 I always try to highlight is how conspiracies are born.

3:22:38.720 --> 3:22:41.300
 Because many people don't understand how easy it is

3:22:41.300 --> 3:22:44.360
 to fall into the conspiratorial cycle.

3:22:44.360 --> 3:22:47.560
 So the first step to a conspiracy being born

3:22:47.560 --> 3:22:52.360
 is to have a piece of evidence that is true.

3:22:52.360 --> 3:22:55.360
 And then immediately following the true evidence

3:22:55.360 --> 3:22:57.280
 is a gap in information.

3:22:57.280 --> 3:23:00.720
 And then to fill in the gap of information,

3:23:00.720 --> 3:23:05.720
 people create an idea and then the next logical outcome

3:23:05.920 --> 3:23:08.080
 is based on the idea that they just created,

3:23:08.080 --> 3:23:10.260
 which is an idea that's based on something

3:23:10.260 --> 3:23:12.480
 that was imagined in the first place.

3:23:12.480 --> 3:23:15.520
 So the idea, the factual thing is now two steps away

3:23:15.520 --> 3:23:17.280
 and then three steps away, four steps away

3:23:17.280 --> 3:23:18.120
 as the things go on.

3:23:18.120 --> 3:23:20.340
 And then all of a sudden you have this kernel of truth

3:23:20.340 --> 3:23:23.040
 that turned into this wild conspiracy.

3:23:23.040 --> 3:23:26.100
 So in our example, you talked about humans

3:23:26.100 --> 3:23:27.360
 trying to communicate with ants.

3:23:27.360 --> 3:23:28.880
 Ants are not intelligent.

3:23:28.880 --> 3:23:30.840
 There's no, ants are not intelligent species.

3:23:30.840 --> 3:23:33.860
 They're a drone species that's somehow commanded

3:23:33.860 --> 3:23:36.080
 through whatever technology, whatever.

3:23:36.080 --> 3:23:37.960
 Spoken like a typical human, but yes.

3:23:37.960 --> 3:23:40.160
 Whatever biological thing is in the queen, right?

3:23:40.160 --> 3:23:42.000
 But they're not, it's not a fair equivalent.

3:23:42.000 --> 3:23:43.160
 But let's look at gorillas

3:23:43.160 --> 3:23:45.280
 or let's look at something in the monkey family, right?

3:23:45.280 --> 3:23:48.500
 Where largely we agree that there is some sort

3:23:48.500 --> 3:23:50.080
 of intelligence there or dolphins,

3:23:50.080 --> 3:23:52.220
 some sort of intelligence, right?

3:23:52.220 --> 3:23:57.220
 It is a human thing, a human thing to want to observe

3:23:59.180 --> 3:24:02.300
 and then communicate and integrate.

3:24:02.300 --> 3:24:06.660
 That's a human thing, not an intelligent life thing.

3:24:06.660 --> 3:24:09.080
 So for us to even think that a foreign

3:24:09.080 --> 3:24:12.260
 and intelligent alien species would want to engage

3:24:12.260 --> 3:24:16.940
 and communicate at all is an extremely human assumption.

3:24:16.940 --> 3:24:18.220
 And then from that assumption,

3:24:18.220 --> 3:24:20.220
 then we started going into all the other things you said.

3:24:20.220 --> 3:24:21.780
 If they wanted to communicate,

3:24:21.780 --> 3:24:23.040
 wouldn't they want to mimic?

3:24:23.040 --> 3:24:24.140
 If they wanted to mimic,

3:24:24.140 --> 3:24:26.040
 wouldn't they create devices like ours?

3:24:26.040 --> 3:24:29.320
 So now we're three steps removed from the true fact

3:24:29.320 --> 3:24:32.400
 of there's something unexplainable in the skies.

3:24:34.460 --> 3:24:37.780
 Yeah, so the fact is there's something unexplainable

3:24:37.780 --> 3:24:40.380
 in the skies and then we're filling in the gaps

3:24:40.380 --> 3:24:43.300
 with all our basic human biases and assumptions.

3:24:43.300 --> 3:24:44.140
 Exactly.

3:24:44.140 --> 3:24:45.060
 But the thing is.

3:24:45.060 --> 3:24:47.620
 Now we're getting right back to Project Northwood.

3:24:47.620 --> 3:24:48.800
 We need some plan.

3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:50.440
 I don't care how crazy the idea is, guys.

3:24:50.440 --> 3:24:51.540
 Give me some plan.

3:24:51.540 --> 3:24:53.380
 So that's where we come up with.

3:24:53.380 --> 3:24:55.300
 Maybe it's an alien species trying to communicate

3:24:55.300 --> 3:24:57.940
 or maybe it's an alien, a hostile threat

3:24:57.940 --> 3:25:00.980
 that's trying to take over the world or who knows what.

3:25:00.980 --> 3:25:01.820
 Maybe it's.

3:25:01.820 --> 3:25:06.820
 But you have to somehow construct hypotheses

3:25:07.140 --> 3:25:10.100
 and theories for anomalies.

3:25:10.100 --> 3:25:15.100
 And then from that, amidst giant pile of the ridiculous,

3:25:16.580 --> 3:25:21.100
 emerges perhaps a deeper truth over a period of decades.

3:25:21.100 --> 3:25:24.440
 And at first, that truth is ridiculed

3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:29.260
 and then it's accepted, that whole process.

3:25:29.260 --> 3:25:30.780
 The Earth revolving around the sun?

3:25:30.780 --> 3:25:32.900
 Yeah, the Earth revolving around the sun.

3:25:32.900 --> 3:25:37.380
 But to me, it's interesting because it asks us

3:25:37.380 --> 3:25:41.940
 looking out there with SETI, just looking for alien life,

3:25:41.940 --> 3:25:45.580
 is forcing us to really ask questions about ourselves,

3:25:45.580 --> 3:25:48.380
 about what is life, how special.

3:25:48.380 --> 3:25:49.980
 First of all, what is intelligence?

3:25:49.980 --> 3:25:52.460
 How special is intelligence in the cosmos?

3:25:52.460 --> 3:25:55.820
 And I think it's inspiring and challenging

3:25:55.820 --> 3:25:57.420
 to us as human beings,

3:25:57.420 --> 3:26:00.320
 both on a scientific and engineering level,

3:26:00.320 --> 3:26:01.860
 but also on a philosophical level.

3:26:01.860 --> 3:26:04.460
 I mean, all of those questions that are laid before us

3:26:04.460 --> 3:26:06.540
 when you start to think about alien life.

3:26:06.540 --> 3:26:09.020
 So you interviewed Joe Rogan recently.

3:26:09.020 --> 3:26:09.860
 Yeah.

3:26:09.860 --> 3:26:12.380
 And he said something that I thought was really,

3:26:12.380 --> 3:26:14.780
 really brilliant during the podcast interview.

3:26:14.780 --> 3:26:15.620
 He said that you.

3:26:15.620 --> 3:26:16.940
 He's gonna love hearing that.

3:26:16.940 --> 3:26:18.820
 But go ahead, sorry.

3:26:18.820 --> 3:26:21.980
 But he said that he realized at some point

3:26:22.940 --> 3:26:25.560
 that the turn in his opinion about UFOs happened

3:26:25.560 --> 3:26:29.280
 when he realized how desperately he wanted it to be true.

3:26:30.420 --> 3:26:33.760
 This is the human condition.

3:26:33.760 --> 3:26:35.860
 We are pink matter works the same way

3:26:35.860 --> 3:26:36.980
 as everybody's pink matter.

3:26:36.980 --> 3:26:38.540
 And one of the ways that our pink matter works

3:26:38.540 --> 3:26:41.540
 is with this thing, with what's known as a cognitive bias.

3:26:41.540 --> 3:26:42.940
 It's a mental shortcut.

3:26:42.940 --> 3:26:45.180
 Essentially, your brain doesn't want to process

3:26:45.180 --> 3:26:46.660
 through facts over and over again.

3:26:46.660 --> 3:26:48.980
 Instead, it wants to assume certain facts are in place

3:26:48.980 --> 3:26:50.280
 and just jump right to the conclusion.

3:26:50.280 --> 3:26:52.980
 It saves energy, it saves megabytes.

3:26:52.980 --> 3:26:56.300
 So what Joe or Joe Rogan,

3:26:56.300 --> 3:26:57.820
 I feel weird calling him Joe, I don't know him,

3:26:57.820 --> 3:26:59.660
 but what Joe identified on his own.

3:26:59.660 --> 3:27:00.580
 Mr. Rogan.

3:27:00.580 --> 3:27:03.340
 What Mr. Rogan identified on his own.

3:27:03.340 --> 3:27:04.180
 Yeah.

3:27:04.180 --> 3:27:06.900
 Was his own cognitive loop.

3:27:06.900 --> 3:27:10.340
 And then he immediately grew suspicious of that loop.

3:27:10.340 --> 3:27:11.880
 That is a super powerful tool.

3:27:11.880 --> 3:27:13.340
 That is something that most people

3:27:13.340 --> 3:27:15.620
 never become self actualized enough to realize

3:27:15.620 --> 3:27:17.260
 that they have a cognitive loop,

3:27:17.260 --> 3:27:20.160
 let alone questioning their own cognitive loop.

3:27:20.160 --> 3:27:23.460
 So that was, when it came to this topic specifically,

3:27:23.460 --> 3:27:25.900
 that was just something that I thought was really powerful

3:27:25.900 --> 3:27:30.900
 because you learn to not trust your own mind.

3:27:30.900 --> 3:27:34.620
 Just for the record, after he drinks one whiskey,

3:27:34.620 --> 3:27:36.420
 all that goes out.

3:27:36.420 --> 3:27:40.380
 I think that was just in that moment in time, like, you know.

3:27:40.380 --> 3:27:41.740
 A moment of brilliance.

3:27:41.740 --> 3:27:45.900
 A moment of brilliance is, I think he still is, you know,

3:27:48.420 --> 3:27:50.860
 he's definitely, one of the things that inspires me about Joe

3:27:50.860 --> 3:27:53.420
 is how open minded he is, how curious he is.

3:27:53.420 --> 3:27:55.860
 He refuses to let sort of the conformity

3:27:55.860 --> 3:27:58.900
 and the conventions of any one community,

3:27:58.900 --> 3:28:00.620
 including the scientific community,

3:28:00.620 --> 3:28:04.220
 be a kind of thing that limits his curiosity,

3:28:04.220 --> 3:28:08.760
 of asking what if, like the whole, it's entirely possible.

3:28:08.760 --> 3:28:10.180
 I think that's a beautiful thing.

3:28:10.180 --> 3:28:13.700
 And it actually represents what the best of science is,

3:28:13.700 --> 3:28:15.540
 that childlike curiosity.

3:28:15.540 --> 3:28:18.580
 But, so it's good to sort of balance those two things,

3:28:18.580 --> 3:28:21.220
 but then you have to wake up to it, like,

3:28:21.220 --> 3:28:24.420
 is this, is there a chance this is true,

3:28:24.420 --> 3:28:27.100
 or do I just really want it to be true?

3:28:27.100 --> 3:28:27.940
 And that.

3:28:27.940 --> 3:28:29.820
 Like that hot girl that talks to you overseas?

3:28:29.820 --> 3:28:30.700
 Yeah.

3:28:30.700 --> 3:28:31.540
 Yeah.

3:28:32.980 --> 3:28:34.060
 For a brief moment.

3:28:35.020 --> 3:28:37.940
 There's actually a deeper explanation for it

3:28:37.940 --> 3:28:41.020
 that I'll tell you off the mic that perhaps

3:28:41.020 --> 3:28:42.940
 a lot of people can kind of figure out.

3:28:42.940 --> 3:28:43.780
 Anyway.

3:28:43.780 --> 3:28:44.860
 Just to take it one step further,

3:28:44.860 --> 3:28:45.780
 cause I love this stuff.

3:28:45.780 --> 3:28:48.860
 Personally, I love pink matter stuff.

3:28:48.860 --> 3:28:50.060
 In your interview with Jack Barsky,

3:28:50.060 --> 3:28:52.260
 Jack's a good friend of mine, a good dude.

3:28:52.260 --> 3:28:53.100
 An incredible person.

3:28:53.100 --> 3:28:53.940
 Yeah.

3:28:53.940 --> 3:28:55.780
 In your conversation with Jack Barsky,

3:28:55.780 --> 3:28:58.500
 you guys, he started talking to you about

3:28:58.500 --> 3:29:02.700
 how his recruiters were feeding back to him his own beliefs,

3:29:02.700 --> 3:29:05.660
 his own opinions about himself, how smart he was,

3:29:05.660 --> 3:29:08.340
 how good he was, how uniquely qualified he was.

3:29:08.340 --> 3:29:10.420
 That's all pink matter manipulation.

3:29:10.420 --> 3:29:12.380
 Feeding right back to the person

3:29:12.380 --> 3:29:14.100
 what they already think of themselves

3:29:14.100 --> 3:29:17.660
 is a way to get them to invest and trust you faster

3:29:17.660 --> 3:29:21.180
 because obviously you value them for all the right reasons

3:29:21.180 --> 3:29:22.980
 because that's how they see themselves.

3:29:22.980 --> 3:29:27.980
 So that loop that the KGB was using with Jack,

3:29:28.900 --> 3:29:31.100
 Jack did not wake up to that loop at the time.

3:29:31.100 --> 3:29:32.980
 He woke up to it later.

3:29:32.980 --> 3:29:35.180
 So it happens to all of us.

3:29:35.180 --> 3:29:37.220
 We're all in a loop.

3:29:37.220 --> 3:29:39.620
 It's just whether it's about oat milk

3:29:39.620 --> 3:29:41.140
 or whether it's about aliens

3:29:41.140 --> 3:29:44.740
 or whether it's about the Democrats trying to take your guns,

3:29:44.740 --> 3:29:47.020
 whatever it is, everybody's in a loop

3:29:47.020 --> 3:29:49.060
 and we've got to wake up to ask ourselves,

3:29:49.060 --> 3:29:51.500
 just like you said, is it true

3:29:51.500 --> 3:29:53.820
 or do we just really want it to be true?

3:29:53.820 --> 3:29:55.700
 And until you ask yourself that question,

3:29:55.700 --> 3:29:58.220
 you're just one of the masses trapped in the loop.

3:29:58.220 --> 3:30:03.220
 Yeah, that's the really, the Nietzsche gaze into the abyss.

3:30:03.540 --> 3:30:05.020
 It's a dangerous thing.

3:30:05.020 --> 3:30:08.580
 That's the path to insanity is to ask that question.

3:30:08.580 --> 3:30:10.980
 You want to be doing it carefully,

3:30:10.980 --> 3:30:14.260
 but it's also the place where you can truly discover

3:30:14.260 --> 3:30:15.940
 something fundamental about this world

3:30:15.940 --> 3:30:17.260
 that people don't understand

3:30:17.260 --> 3:30:21.820
 and then that and lay the groundwork for progress,

3:30:21.820 --> 3:30:24.980
 scientific, cultural, all that kind of stuff.

3:30:24.980 --> 3:30:25.820
 Absolutely.

3:30:27.340 --> 3:30:28.860
 What is one spy trick?

3:30:28.860 --> 3:30:31.220
 This is from a Reddit that I really enjoy.

3:30:31.220 --> 3:30:36.220
 What's one spy trick and you're full of a million spy tricks.

3:30:36.900 --> 3:30:37.820
 People should follow you.

3:30:37.820 --> 3:30:39.220
 You did an amazing podcast.

3:30:39.220 --> 3:30:40.460
 You're just an amazing person.

3:30:40.460 --> 3:30:42.020
 Thank you.

3:30:42.020 --> 3:30:45.060
 What is the one spy trick you would teach everyone

3:30:45.060 --> 3:30:47.980
 that they can use to improve their life instantly?

3:30:47.980 --> 3:30:50.820
 Now you already mentioned quite a few,

3:30:50.820 --> 3:30:54.140
 but what else could jump to mind?

3:30:54.140 --> 3:30:56.620
 My go to answer for this has not really changed much

3:30:56.620 --> 3:30:57.660
 over the last few years.

3:30:57.660 --> 3:31:00.020
 So the first, the most important spy trick

3:31:00.020 --> 3:31:01.700
 to change everything immediately

3:31:02.780 --> 3:31:06.220
 is something called perception versus perspective.

3:31:06.220 --> 3:31:09.220
 We all look at the world through our own perception.

3:31:10.300 --> 3:31:11.540
 My dad used to tell me,

3:31:11.540 --> 3:31:13.740
 my stepdad used to tell me that perception is reality.

3:31:13.740 --> 3:31:17.460
 And I was arguing this with him when I was 14 years old.

3:31:17.460 --> 3:31:19.300
 I told you so dad, you're still wrong.

3:31:20.580 --> 3:31:22.660
 But perception is your interpretation

3:31:22.660 --> 3:31:25.460
 of the world around you, but it's unique only to you.

3:31:26.340 --> 3:31:28.860
 There's no advantage in your perception.

3:31:28.860 --> 3:31:30.220
 That's why so many people find themselves

3:31:30.220 --> 3:31:31.540
 arguing all the time,

3:31:31.540 --> 3:31:35.500
 trying to convince other people of their own perception.

3:31:35.500 --> 3:31:37.820
 The way that you win any argument,

3:31:37.820 --> 3:31:39.820
 the way that you get ahead in your career,

3:31:39.820 --> 3:31:44.820
 the way that you outsell or out race anybody

3:31:45.100 --> 3:31:47.500
 is when you move off of perception

3:31:47.500 --> 3:31:49.660
 and move into perspective.

3:31:49.660 --> 3:31:52.340
 Perspective is the act or the art

3:31:52.340 --> 3:31:56.380
 of observing the world from outside of yourself,

3:31:56.380 --> 3:31:59.420
 whether that's outside of yourself as like an entity,

3:31:59.420 --> 3:32:02.420
 just observing in a third from a different point of view,

3:32:02.420 --> 3:32:05.140
 or even more powerful, you sit in the shoes,

3:32:05.140 --> 3:32:07.460
 you sit in the seat of the person opposite you.

3:32:07.460 --> 3:32:10.180
 And you think to yourself, what is their life like?

3:32:10.180 --> 3:32:11.620
 What do they feel right now?

3:32:13.100 --> 3:32:13.940
 Are they comfortable?

3:32:13.940 --> 3:32:14.780
 Are they uncomfortable?

3:32:14.780 --> 3:32:15.620
 Are they afraid?

3:32:15.620 --> 3:32:16.460
 Are they scared?

3:32:16.460 --> 3:32:18.700
 What's the stressor that they woke up to this morning?

3:32:18.700 --> 3:32:20.140
 What's the stressor that they're gonna go to sleep

3:32:20.140 --> 3:32:21.660
 with tonight?

3:32:21.660 --> 3:32:24.700
 When you shift places and get out of your own perception

3:32:24.700 --> 3:32:27.260
 and into someone else's perspective,

3:32:27.260 --> 3:32:29.220
 now you're thinking like them,

3:32:29.220 --> 3:32:31.620
 which is giving you an informational advantage.

3:32:31.620 --> 3:32:33.300
 But you know what they're all doing?

3:32:33.300 --> 3:32:36.940
 Everyone else out there is trapped in their own perception,

3:32:36.940 --> 3:32:39.340
 not thinking about a different perspective.

3:32:39.340 --> 3:32:42.540
 So immediately you have superior information,

3:32:42.540 --> 3:32:44.060
 superior positioning,

3:32:44.060 --> 3:32:46.220
 you have an advantage that they don't have.

3:32:46.220 --> 3:32:48.780
 And if you do that to your boss,

3:32:48.780 --> 3:32:50.100
 it's gonna change your career.

3:32:50.100 --> 3:32:51.420
 If you do that to your spouse,

3:32:51.420 --> 3:32:52.540
 it's gonna change your marriage.

3:32:52.540 --> 3:32:53.980
 If you do that to your kids,

3:32:53.980 --> 3:32:55.780
 it's gonna change your family legacy

3:32:55.780 --> 3:32:58.100
 because nobody else out there is doing it.

3:32:58.100 --> 3:33:01.940
 It's so interesting how difficult empathy is for people

3:33:01.940 --> 3:33:03.780
 and how powerful it is,

3:33:03.780 --> 3:33:05.700
 especially for, like you said,

3:33:05.700 --> 3:33:07.300
 with spouse, like intimacy.

3:33:07.300 --> 3:33:08.140
 Yeah.

3:33:08.140 --> 3:33:10.060
 Like stepping outside of yourself

3:33:10.060 --> 3:33:12.660
 and really putting yourself in the shoes of the other person

3:33:12.660 --> 3:33:14.300
 considering how they see the world.

3:33:14.300 --> 3:33:17.820
 And that's, I really enjoy that

3:33:17.820 --> 3:33:21.940
 because how does that exactly lead to connection?

3:33:21.940 --> 3:33:26.620
 I think when you start to understand

3:33:26.620 --> 3:33:30.020
 the way the other person sees the world,

3:33:30.020 --> 3:33:32.260
 you start to enjoy the world through their eyes

3:33:32.260 --> 3:33:34.260
 and you start to be able to share,

3:33:34.260 --> 3:33:35.700
 in terms of intimacy,

3:33:35.700 --> 3:33:39.100
 share the beauty that they see together

3:33:39.100 --> 3:33:41.060
 because you understand their perspective.

3:33:41.060 --> 3:33:43.740
 And somehow you converge as well.

3:33:43.740 --> 3:33:46.100
 Of course, that allows you to gather information better

3:33:46.100 --> 3:33:47.340
 and all that kind of stuff.

3:33:47.340 --> 3:33:50.420
 And that allows you to work together better,

3:33:50.420 --> 3:33:53.340
 to share in all different kinds of ways.

3:33:53.340 --> 3:33:55.780
 But for intimacy, that's a really powerful thing.

3:33:55.780 --> 3:33:59.060
 And also for, actually,

3:33:59.060 --> 3:34:00.940
 like people you really disagree with

3:34:00.940 --> 3:34:03.180
 or people on the internet you disagree with and so on,

3:34:03.180 --> 3:34:07.420
 I find empathy is such a powerful way

3:34:07.420 --> 3:34:09.740
 to resolve any tensions there.

3:34:09.740 --> 3:34:12.500
 Even like people like trolls or all that kind of stuff,

3:34:12.500 --> 3:34:14.020
 I don't deride them.

3:34:14.020 --> 3:34:15.980
 I just kind of put myself in their shoes

3:34:15.980 --> 3:34:20.980
 and it becomes like an enjoyable comradery with that person.

3:34:21.740 --> 3:34:23.180
 So I wanna draw a pretty hard line

3:34:23.180 --> 3:34:26.660
 between perspective and empathy.

3:34:26.660 --> 3:34:30.420
 Because empathy is, frankly, an overused term

3:34:32.140 --> 3:34:33.740
 by people who don't really know

3:34:33.740 --> 3:34:34.980
 what they're saying sometimes.

3:34:34.980 --> 3:34:35.940
 I think you know what you're saying,

3:34:35.940 --> 3:34:37.380
 but the vast majority of people listening.

3:34:37.380 --> 3:34:39.300
 I would argue that, but that's fine.

3:34:39.300 --> 3:34:40.540
 As soon as you say empathy,

3:34:40.540 --> 3:34:41.380
 they're gonna just be like,

3:34:41.380 --> 3:34:44.460
 oh, yeah, I've heard this a thousand times.

3:34:44.460 --> 3:34:47.820
 Empathy is about feeling what other people feel.

3:34:49.940 --> 3:34:50.780
 Or understanding.

3:34:50.780 --> 3:34:51.700
 It's more about feeling, would you say?

3:34:51.700 --> 3:34:53.060
 Yeah, it's about feelings.

3:34:53.060 --> 3:34:54.860
 It's about understanding someone else's feelings.

3:34:54.860 --> 3:34:58.060
 Feeling, it's not the same as sympathy

3:34:58.060 --> 3:34:59.300
 where you feel their feelings.

3:34:59.300 --> 3:35:01.860
 Empathy is about recognizing that they have feelings

3:35:01.860 --> 3:35:04.380
 and recognizing that their feelings are valid.

3:35:04.380 --> 3:35:07.340
 Perspective is more than just feelings.

3:35:07.340 --> 3:35:09.820
 It's about the brain.

3:35:09.820 --> 3:35:12.540
 It's about the pink matter on the left side

3:35:12.540 --> 3:35:14.540
 and the right side of the brain.

3:35:14.540 --> 3:35:16.460
 Yes, I care about feelings,

3:35:16.460 --> 3:35:18.780
 and this goes directly to your point about connection.

3:35:18.780 --> 3:35:20.260
 Yes, I care about feelings,

3:35:20.260 --> 3:35:22.700
 but I also care about objectives.

3:35:22.700 --> 3:35:25.700
 What is your life, what is your aspirational goal?

3:35:25.700 --> 3:35:27.460
 What was it like to grow up as you?

3:35:27.460 --> 3:35:29.020
 What was it like to experience this

3:35:29.020 --> 3:35:30.820
 and how did this shape your opinion on that?

3:35:30.820 --> 3:35:35.700
 And what is it that you're going to do next?

3:35:35.700 --> 3:35:38.820
 More than just feelings, actual tactical actions.

3:35:38.820 --> 3:35:41.100
 And that becomes extremely valuable

3:35:41.100 --> 3:35:42.700
 in the operational world

3:35:42.700 --> 3:35:45.060
 because if you can get into someone's head,

3:35:45.060 --> 3:35:47.700
 left brain and right brain, feelings and logic,

3:35:47.700 --> 3:35:48.700
 you can start anticipating

3:35:48.700 --> 3:35:50.180
 what actions they're gonna take next.

3:35:50.180 --> 3:35:52.580
 You can direct the actions that they're going to take next

3:35:52.580 --> 3:35:54.180
 because you're basically telling them the story

3:35:54.180 --> 3:35:55.980
 that's in their own head.

3:35:55.980 --> 3:35:58.700
 When it comes to relationships and personal connection,

3:35:58.700 --> 3:36:00.020
 we talked about it earlier,

3:36:00.020 --> 3:36:05.020
 the thing that people want the most is community.

3:36:05.620 --> 3:36:08.140
 They want someone else who understands them.

3:36:08.140 --> 3:36:09.860
 They want to be with people.

3:36:09.860 --> 3:36:11.780
 They don't want to be alone.

3:36:11.780 --> 3:36:15.780
 The more you practice perspective, empathy or no empathy,

3:36:15.780 --> 3:36:19.220
 the more you just validate that a person is there.

3:36:19.220 --> 3:36:22.380
 I am in this time and space with you in this moment.

3:36:22.380 --> 3:36:27.380
 Feelings aside, that is powerful.

3:36:27.460 --> 3:36:29.180
 That is intimate.

3:36:29.180 --> 3:36:31.020
 And whether you're talking about lovers

3:36:31.020 --> 3:36:32.900
 or whether you're talking about a business exchange

3:36:32.900 --> 3:36:35.900
 or whether you're talking about collaborators in a crime,

3:36:35.900 --> 3:36:39.220
 I'm here with you ride or die, let's do it.

3:36:39.220 --> 3:36:41.060
 That's powerful.

3:36:41.060 --> 3:36:45.580
 How much of what you've learned in your role at the CIA

3:36:46.460 --> 3:36:48.620
 transfer over to relationships,

3:36:48.620 --> 3:36:51.420
 the business relationship to other aspects of life?

3:36:51.420 --> 3:36:53.940
 This is something you work closely with powerful people

3:36:53.940 --> 3:36:55.180
 to help them out.

3:36:55.180 --> 3:36:57.940
 What have you learned about the commonalities,

3:36:57.940 --> 3:36:59.940
 about the problems that people face?

3:36:59.940 --> 3:37:04.940
 Man, I would say about a solid 95% of what I learned

3:37:05.460 --> 3:37:07.540
 at CIA carries over to the civilian world.

3:37:07.540 --> 3:37:10.460
 That 5% that doesn't is,

3:37:10.460 --> 3:37:13.060
 it would carry over in a disaster, right?

3:37:13.060 --> 3:37:16.180
 There's knowing how to shoot on target

3:37:16.180 --> 3:37:20.780
 with my non dominant hand really only has one purpose.

3:37:20.780 --> 3:37:23.220
 It's not gonna happen day to day, right?

3:37:23.220 --> 3:37:25.540
 Knowing how to do a dead drop that isn't discoverable

3:37:25.540 --> 3:37:28.540
 by the local police force isn't gonna be useful right now,

3:37:28.540 --> 3:37:30.620
 but it could be useful in disaster.

3:37:30.620 --> 3:37:32.780
 But the 95% of stuff that's useful,

3:37:32.780 --> 3:37:34.540
 it's all tied to the human condition.

3:37:34.540 --> 3:37:38.340
 It's all tied to being able to

3:37:39.620 --> 3:37:41.020
 understand what someone's thinking,

3:37:41.020 --> 3:37:43.020
 understand what someone's feeling,

3:37:43.020 --> 3:37:45.500
 direct their thoughts, direct their emotions,

3:37:45.500 --> 3:37:47.980
 direct their thought process, win their attention,

3:37:47.980 --> 3:37:51.060
 win their loyalty, win influence with them,

3:37:51.060 --> 3:37:54.860
 grow your network, grow your own circle of influence.

3:37:54.860 --> 3:37:58.460
 I mean, all of that is immensely, immensely valuable.

3:37:59.500 --> 3:38:00.860
 As an example, the disguise,

3:38:00.860 --> 3:38:03.260
 the disguise thing that we talked about earlier,

3:38:03.260 --> 3:38:06.580
 disguise in and of itself has mixed utility.

3:38:06.580 --> 3:38:08.020
 If you're Brad Pitt and you don't want anybody

3:38:08.020 --> 3:38:09.860
 to know you're Brad Pitt, you put on a level one disguise

3:38:09.860 --> 3:38:10.700
 and that's great.

3:38:10.700 --> 3:38:12.340
 Or maybe you call me and I walk you through

3:38:12.340 --> 3:38:14.380
 a level two disguise so that you can go to Aruba

3:38:14.380 --> 3:38:16.260
 and nobody's gonna know you're in Aruba, right?

3:38:16.260 --> 3:38:17.100
 Whatever it is.

3:38:18.780 --> 3:38:20.980
 But even there with the 5%

3:38:20.980 --> 3:38:22.860
 that doesn't apply to everyday life,

3:38:22.860 --> 3:38:24.780
 there's still elements that do.

3:38:24.780 --> 3:38:28.780
 For example, when a person looks at a human being's face,

3:38:28.780 --> 3:38:32.260
 the first place they look is the same part of the face

3:38:32.260 --> 3:38:34.180
 as if they were reading a piece of paper.

3:38:34.180 --> 3:38:36.900
 So in English, we start from the top left

3:38:36.900 --> 3:38:38.740
 and we read left to right, top to bottom.

3:38:38.740 --> 3:38:40.860
 So when an English speaking person

3:38:40.860 --> 3:38:42.260
 interacts with another person,

3:38:42.260 --> 3:38:45.500
 the first thing they look at isn't their eyes.

3:38:45.500 --> 3:38:49.220
 It's the upper left from their point of view,

3:38:49.220 --> 3:38:52.060
 corner of their face, right?

3:38:52.060 --> 3:38:54.780
 They look there and the information they get

3:38:54.780 --> 3:38:58.300
 is hair color, hair pattern, skin color, right?

3:38:58.300 --> 3:38:59.140
 That's it.

3:38:59.140 --> 3:39:01.020
 Before they know anything else about the face.

3:39:01.020 --> 3:39:02.740
 This is one of the reasons why somebody can look at you

3:39:02.740 --> 3:39:05.020
 and then you ask them, what color are my eyes?

3:39:05.020 --> 3:39:06.380
 I don't really remember.

3:39:06.380 --> 3:39:07.820
 Because the way they read the face,

3:39:07.820 --> 3:39:10.260
 they read it from left to right, top to bottom.

3:39:10.260 --> 3:39:11.580
 So they're paying a lot of attention

3:39:11.580 --> 3:39:12.940
 to the first few things they see

3:39:12.940 --> 3:39:14.140
 and then they're paying less attention

3:39:14.140 --> 3:39:14.980
 as they go down the face.

3:39:14.980 --> 3:39:17.620
 The same scrolling behavior that you see

3:39:17.620 --> 3:39:18.940
 on the internet, right?

3:39:18.940 --> 3:39:21.420
 So when you understand that through the lens of disguise,

3:39:21.420 --> 3:39:23.260
 it allows you to make a very powerful disguise.

3:39:23.260 --> 3:39:24.900
 The most important part of your disguise

3:39:24.900 --> 3:39:27.420
 is here if you're English speaking, right?

3:39:27.420 --> 3:39:29.380
 Here if you're speaking some foreign languages

3:39:29.380 --> 3:39:31.180
 that read right to left, right?

3:39:31.180 --> 3:39:32.500
 If you're, if it's Chinese,

3:39:32.500 --> 3:39:34.180
 you know that they're gonna look from here down

3:39:34.180 --> 3:39:35.860
 because they read left down.

3:39:35.860 --> 3:39:36.700
 So.

3:39:36.700 --> 3:39:37.540
 So interesting.

3:39:37.540 --> 3:39:39.140
 So yeah, knowing that really helps you

3:39:39.140 --> 3:39:40.460
 sort of configure the things

3:39:40.460 --> 3:39:41.740
 in terms of physical appearance.

3:39:41.740 --> 3:39:42.580
 That's interesting.

3:39:42.580 --> 3:39:43.420
 Correct, correct.

3:39:43.420 --> 3:39:45.300
 So when it comes to how to make a disguise,

3:39:45.300 --> 3:39:47.740
 not so useful to the ultra wealthy usually.

3:39:47.740 --> 3:39:50.060
 But when it comes to how to read a face

3:39:50.060 --> 3:39:52.620
 or more importantly, how people are going to read your face,

3:39:52.620 --> 3:39:55.420
 that's extremely important because now you know

3:39:55.420 --> 3:39:58.100
 where to find the first signs of deception

3:39:58.100 --> 3:39:59.620
 in a baseline or anything else.

3:39:59.620 --> 3:40:04.260
 You mentioned that the idea of having privacy

3:40:04.260 --> 3:40:09.260
 is one that we kind of, we think we can,

3:40:10.300 --> 3:40:12.060
 but we really don't.

3:40:12.060 --> 3:40:14.980
 Is it possible for maybe somebody like me

3:40:14.980 --> 3:40:18.060
 or a regular person to disappear from the grid?

3:40:18.060 --> 3:40:18.900
 Absolutely.

3:40:18.900 --> 3:40:20.420
 Yeah, and it's not as hard as you might think.

3:40:20.420 --> 3:40:21.660
 It's not convenient.

3:40:21.660 --> 3:40:24.700
 Again, convenience and security.

3:40:24.700 --> 3:40:26.460
 You can disappear tomorrow, right?

3:40:26.460 --> 3:40:27.780
 I can walk you through three steps right now

3:40:27.780 --> 3:40:29.180
 that are gonna help you disappear tomorrow,

3:40:29.180 --> 3:40:31.300
 but none of them are convenient.

3:40:31.300 --> 3:40:33.580
 They're all extremely secure, right?

3:40:33.580 --> 3:40:35.180
 The first thing you do is every piece

3:40:35.180 --> 3:40:36.860
 of digital technology you have

3:40:36.860 --> 3:40:41.220
 that is connected to you in any way is now dead.

3:40:41.220 --> 3:40:42.500
 You just let the battery run out.

3:40:42.500 --> 3:40:43.340
 Forever.

3:40:43.340 --> 3:40:44.180
 Forever.

3:40:44.180 --> 3:40:46.420
 You never touch it again, starting at this moment.

3:40:46.420 --> 3:40:50.220
 What you have to do is go out and acquire a new one.

3:40:50.220 --> 3:40:52.900
 Realistically, you will not be able to acquire a new one

3:40:52.900 --> 3:40:55.660
 in the United States by buying it

3:40:55.660 --> 3:40:58.700
 because to do so, you would tie it to your credit card.

3:40:58.700 --> 3:41:00.820
 You would tie it to a location, a time, a place,

3:41:00.820 --> 3:41:02.300
 a registered name, whatever else.

3:41:02.300 --> 3:41:04.820
 So you would have to acquire it essentially by theft

3:41:05.780 --> 3:41:07.460
 or through the black market.

3:41:07.460 --> 3:41:08.700
 So you would want something

3:41:08.700 --> 3:41:11.300
 because you're gonna need the advantage of technology

3:41:11.300 --> 3:41:13.060
 without it being in your name.

3:41:13.060 --> 3:41:16.420
 So you go out and you steal a phone or you steal a laptop.

3:41:16.420 --> 3:41:17.700
 You do whatever you have to do to make sure

3:41:17.700 --> 3:41:19.220
 that you can get on with the password

3:41:19.220 --> 3:41:20.540
 and whatever else that might be.

3:41:20.540 --> 3:41:22.380
 As dirty or as clean as you want that to be,

3:41:22.380 --> 3:41:24.340
 we're all morally flexible here,

3:41:24.340 --> 3:41:27.140
 but now you have a technological device

3:41:27.140 --> 3:41:29.300
 that you can work with.

3:41:29.300 --> 3:41:31.340
 And then from there on,

3:41:31.340 --> 3:41:32.660
 you're just doing whatever you have to do,

3:41:32.660 --> 3:41:35.060
 whether you're stealing every step of the way

3:41:35.060 --> 3:41:38.700
 or whether you run a massive con.

3:41:38.700 --> 3:41:42.300
 Keep in mind that we often talk about con men and cons.

3:41:42.300 --> 3:41:43.500
 Do you know what the root,

3:41:43.500 --> 3:41:46.500
 the word that con is a root word for?

3:41:46.500 --> 3:41:48.020
 Confidence.

3:41:48.020 --> 3:41:49.300
 That's what a con man is.

3:41:49.300 --> 3:41:51.580
 A con man is a confidence man.

3:41:51.580 --> 3:41:54.340
 Just somebody who is so brazenly confident

3:41:54.340 --> 3:41:55.780
 that the people around them

3:41:55.780 --> 3:41:58.620
 living in their own perception, not perspective,

3:41:58.620 --> 3:42:00.340
 and their perception, they're like,

3:42:00.340 --> 3:42:01.980
 well, this guy really knows what he's talking about,

3:42:01.980 --> 3:42:04.020
 so I'm gonna do what he says.

3:42:04.020 --> 3:42:05.580
 So you can run a massive con

3:42:05.580 --> 3:42:07.220
 and that can take care of your finances,

3:42:07.220 --> 3:42:08.500
 that can take care of your lodging,

3:42:08.500 --> 3:42:10.220
 whatever else it is.

3:42:10.220 --> 3:42:13.860
 You are whoever you present yourself to be.

3:42:13.860 --> 3:42:18.300
 So if you wanna go be Bill for the afternoon,

3:42:18.300 --> 3:42:19.820
 just go tell people your name is Bill.

3:42:19.820 --> 3:42:21.500
 They're not gonna question you.

3:42:21.500 --> 3:42:24.060
 So the intelligence,

3:42:24.060 --> 3:42:28.740
 the natural web of intelligence gathering systems

3:42:28.740 --> 3:42:31.980
 we have in the United States and in the world,

3:42:31.980 --> 3:42:35.920
 are they going to believe for long that you're Bill?

3:42:37.020 --> 3:42:37.860
 Are they?

3:42:37.860 --> 3:42:39.900
 Until you do something that makes them think otherwise.

3:42:39.900 --> 3:42:41.040
 If you are consistent,

3:42:41.040 --> 3:42:43.240
 we talked about consistency being the superpower.

3:42:43.240 --> 3:42:46.620
 If you are consistent, they will think you're Bill forever.

3:42:46.620 --> 3:42:49.020
 How difficult is that to do?

3:42:49.020 --> 3:42:50.700
 It's not convenient.

3:42:50.700 --> 3:42:51.900
 It's quite difficult.

3:42:51.900 --> 3:42:53.860
 Does that require training?

3:42:53.860 --> 3:42:55.780
 It does require training.

3:42:55.780 --> 3:42:57.780
 Because why do criminals always get caught?

3:42:57.780 --> 3:42:59.960
 Because they stop being consistent.

3:42:59.960 --> 3:43:02.540
 Criminals, I've...

3:43:04.900 --> 3:43:07.120
 I never hesitate to admit this,

3:43:07.120 --> 3:43:09.020
 but people tell me I should hesitate to admit it.

3:43:09.020 --> 3:43:11.660
 So now I hesitate because of the guidance

3:43:11.660 --> 3:43:13.540
 I've gotten to hesitate, right?

3:43:13.540 --> 3:43:14.380
 I like criminals.

3:43:14.380 --> 3:43:16.420
 I'm friends with a number of criminals

3:43:16.420 --> 3:43:17.940
 because the only people who get me,

3:43:17.940 --> 3:43:20.940
 like right away who get me, are criminals.

3:43:20.940 --> 3:43:23.140
 Because we know what it's like

3:43:23.140 --> 3:43:25.360
 to basically abandon all the rules,

3:43:25.360 --> 3:43:26.660
 do our own thing our own way,

3:43:26.660 --> 3:43:29.080
 and watch the world just keep turning.

3:43:29.080 --> 3:43:33.900
 Most people are so stuck in the trap

3:43:33.900 --> 3:43:36.060
 of normal thought and behavior

3:43:36.060 --> 3:43:37.500
 that when I tell them, they just don't...

3:43:37.500 --> 3:43:39.240
 Just go tell people your name is Bill.

3:43:39.240 --> 3:43:40.340
 Most people are going to say,

3:43:40.340 --> 3:43:42.540
 psh, that's not going to work.

3:43:42.540 --> 3:43:44.680
 But a criminal will be like, oh yeah, I did that once.

3:43:44.680 --> 3:43:46.340
 I just told everybody my name is Nancy,

3:43:46.340 --> 3:43:48.860
 you know, dude, and they still believe me.

3:43:48.860 --> 3:43:50.380
 Criminals just get it, right?

3:43:50.380 --> 3:43:53.540
 So what happens with criminals

3:43:53.540 --> 3:43:56.380
 is they go to the school of hard knocks.

3:43:56.380 --> 3:43:57.220
 They go to...

3:43:57.220 --> 3:44:00.320
 They learn criminal behavior on the job.

3:44:00.320 --> 3:44:02.640
 Spies go to school.

3:44:02.640 --> 3:44:05.020
 We go to the best spy school in the world.

3:44:05.020 --> 3:44:07.860
 We go to Langley's, the farm, right?

3:44:07.860 --> 3:44:10.140
 What's known as Field Tradecraft Course, FTC,

3:44:10.140 --> 3:44:12.420
 in a covert location for a covert period of time

3:44:12.420 --> 3:44:13.520
 and covert, covert, covert.

3:44:13.520 --> 3:44:14.600
 So if anybody from CIA is watching,

3:44:14.600 --> 3:44:16.180
 I'm not breaking any rules.

3:44:16.180 --> 3:44:19.060
 It's all on Wikipedia, but it's not coming from me.

3:44:19.060 --> 3:44:19.900
 But we do...

3:44:19.900 --> 3:44:20.740
 That's how we do it.

3:44:20.740 --> 3:44:24.840
 They train us from a hundred years of experience

3:44:24.840 --> 3:44:27.060
 and the best ways to carry out covert operations,

3:44:27.060 --> 3:44:30.740
 which are all just criminal activities overseas.

3:44:30.740 --> 3:44:32.300
 We learn how to do it the right way

3:44:32.300 --> 3:44:33.300
 so that we don't get caught.

3:44:33.300 --> 3:44:34.420
 We learn how to be consistent.

3:44:34.420 --> 3:44:37.660
 More importantly, we learn how to create an operation

3:44:37.660 --> 3:44:39.900
 that has a limited lifespan

3:44:39.900 --> 3:44:43.120
 because the longer it lives, the more at risk you are.

3:44:43.120 --> 3:44:46.380
 So you want operations to be short, concise,

3:44:46.380 --> 3:44:48.340
 on the X, off the X.

3:44:48.340 --> 3:44:49.740
 Limit your room for mistakes.

3:44:49.740 --> 3:44:52.160
 Criminals want the default

3:44:52.160 --> 3:44:55.020
 to wanting these longterm operations

3:44:55.020 --> 3:44:56.960
 because they don't want to have to recreate a new way

3:44:56.960 --> 3:44:59.000
 to make money every 15 days.

3:45:00.500 --> 3:45:03.940
 You mentioned, if anybody from the CIA is watching,

3:45:03.940 --> 3:45:07.940
 so I've seen you talk about the fact

3:45:07.940 --> 3:45:10.380
 that sort of people that are currently working at the CIA

3:45:10.380 --> 3:45:14.380
 would kind of look down on the people who've left the CIA

3:45:14.380 --> 3:45:16.820
 and they divide them, especially if you go public,

3:45:16.820 --> 3:45:19.880
 especially if there's a book and all that kind of stuff.

3:45:19.880 --> 3:45:22.380
 Do you feel the pressure of that to be quiet,

3:45:23.820 --> 3:45:28.820
 to not do something like this conversation

3:45:30.600 --> 3:45:31.580
 that we're doing today?

3:45:31.580 --> 3:45:33.180
 I feel the silent judgment.

3:45:34.060 --> 3:45:35.380
 That's very real.

3:45:35.380 --> 3:45:36.940
 I feel it for myself and I feel it for my wife

3:45:36.940 --> 3:45:38.600
 who doesn't appear on camera very often,

3:45:38.600 --> 3:45:40.820
 but who's also former CIA.

3:45:40.820 --> 3:45:42.660
 We both feel the judgment.

3:45:42.660 --> 3:45:47.540
 We know that right now, three days after this is released,

3:45:47.540 --> 3:45:50.340
 somebody's gonna send an email on a closed network system

3:45:50.340 --> 3:45:52.900
 inside CIA headquarters and there's a bunch of people

3:45:52.900 --> 3:45:53.840
 who are gonna laugh at it,

3:45:53.840 --> 3:45:56.040
 a bunch of people who are gonna say that who knows what.

3:45:56.040 --> 3:45:56.880
 It's not gonna be good stuff.

3:45:56.880 --> 3:45:58.640
 A bunch of people you respect probably.

3:45:58.640 --> 3:46:01.980
 A bunch of people who I'm trying to bring honor to.

3:46:01.980 --> 3:46:04.780
 Whether I know them or respect them is irrelevant.

3:46:04.780 --> 3:46:08.000
 These are people who are out there doing the deed every day

3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:11.300
 and I wanna bring them honor and I wanna do that in a way

3:46:11.300 --> 3:46:14.120
 that I get to share what they can't share

3:46:14.120 --> 3:46:16.240
 and what they won't share when they leave

3:46:16.240 --> 3:46:18.440
 because they will also feel the silent pressure,

3:46:18.440 --> 3:46:21.720
 the pressure to the shame, the judgment, right?

3:46:22.740 --> 3:46:25.440
 But the truth is that I've done this now long enough.

3:46:25.440 --> 3:46:27.960
 The first few times that I spoke out publicly,

3:46:29.340 --> 3:46:32.160
 the response to being a positive voice

3:46:32.160 --> 3:46:34.960
 for what the sacrifice is that people are making,

3:46:34.960 --> 3:46:39.020
 it's so refreshing to be an honest voice

3:46:39.020 --> 3:46:43.120
 that people don't normally hear that it's too important.

3:46:43.120 --> 3:46:44.280
 One day I'm gonna be gone

3:46:44.280 --> 3:46:46.340
 and my kids are gonna look back on all this

3:46:46.340 --> 3:46:48.360
 and they're gonna see their dad

3:46:48.360 --> 3:46:51.000
 trying to do the right thing for the right reasons

3:46:51.000 --> 3:46:53.480
 and even if my son or daughter ends up at CIA

3:46:53.480 --> 3:46:55.280
 and even if they get ridiculed for being,

3:46:55.280 --> 3:46:57.640
 oh, you're the Bustamante kid, right?

3:46:57.640 --> 3:47:00.080
 Your dad's a total sellout, whatever it might be.

3:47:01.100 --> 3:47:04.700
 Like I want them to know dad was doing what he could

3:47:04.700 --> 3:47:06.560
 to bring honor to the organization

3:47:06.560 --> 3:47:09.480
 even when he couldn't stay in the organization anymore.

3:47:09.480 --> 3:47:11.480
 So you said when you were 27,

3:47:11.480 --> 3:47:13.980
 I think you didn't know what the hell you're doing.

3:47:15.280 --> 3:47:20.280
 So now that you're a few years older and wiser,

3:47:21.240 --> 3:47:24.840
 let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat

3:47:24.840 --> 3:47:27.480
 and give advice to other 27 year olds

3:47:27.480 --> 3:47:30.960
 or even younger 17, 18 year olds

3:47:30.960 --> 3:47:34.200
 that are just out of high school, maybe going to college,

3:47:34.200 --> 3:47:35.520
 trying to figure out this life,

3:47:35.520 --> 3:47:37.640
 this career thing that they're on.

3:47:37.640 --> 3:47:39.840
 What advice would you give them

3:47:39.840 --> 3:47:42.040
 about how to have a career

3:47:42.040 --> 3:47:44.520
 or how to have a life they can be proud of?

3:47:45.800 --> 3:47:47.440
 What's a powerful question, man?

3:47:49.600 --> 3:47:51.160
 Have you figured it out yet yourself?

3:47:51.160 --> 3:47:55.160
 No, I think I'm a grand total of seven days smarter

3:47:55.160 --> 3:47:56.240
 than I was at 27.

3:47:57.120 --> 3:47:57.960
 It's not a good average.

3:47:57.960 --> 3:47:58.800
 Progress.

3:48:00.240 --> 3:48:01.080
 There's still time.

3:48:01.080 --> 3:48:02.680
 There's still time.

3:48:02.680 --> 3:48:07.120
 So for all the young people out there deciding what to do,

3:48:08.480 --> 3:48:10.720
 I would just say the same thing that I do say

3:48:10.720 --> 3:48:12.400
 and I will say to my own kids.

3:48:12.400 --> 3:48:14.360
 You only have one life.

3:48:14.360 --> 3:48:16.600
 You only have one chance.

3:48:16.600 --> 3:48:20.300
 If you spend it doing what other people expect you to do,

3:48:21.240 --> 3:48:25.400
 you will wake up to your regret at some point.

3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:29.200
 I woke up when I was 38 years old.

3:48:29.200 --> 3:48:32.000
 My wife in many ways is still waking up to it

3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:34.760
 as she watches her grandparents pass

3:48:34.760 --> 3:48:37.440
 and an older generation pass away.

3:48:38.480 --> 3:48:42.880
 The folks that really have a blessed life

3:48:42.880 --> 3:48:45.160
 are the people who learn early on

3:48:45.160 --> 3:48:49.280
 to live with their own rules, live their own way

3:48:50.120 --> 3:48:52.920
 and live every day as if it's the last day.

3:48:53.720 --> 3:48:58.080
 Not necessarily to waste it by being wasteful or silly,

3:48:58.080 --> 3:49:00.000
 but to recognize that today is a day

3:49:00.000 --> 3:49:04.560
 to be productive and constructive for yourself.

3:49:04.560 --> 3:49:06.100
 If you don't want a career,

3:49:06.100 --> 3:49:07.840
 today's not the day to start pursuing a career

3:49:07.840 --> 3:49:09.680
 just because someone else told you to do it.

3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:11.160
 If you wanna learn a language,

3:49:11.160 --> 3:49:13.720
 today's a day to find a way to buy a ticket

3:49:13.720 --> 3:49:15.680
 to another country and learn through immersion.

3:49:15.680 --> 3:49:17.920
 If you want a date, if you wanna get married,

3:49:17.920 --> 3:49:19.800
 if you want a business,

3:49:19.800 --> 3:49:21.520
 today is the day to just go out

3:49:21.520 --> 3:49:25.200
 and take one step in that direction.

3:49:25.200 --> 3:49:28.600
 And as long as you, every day you just make one new step,

3:49:28.600 --> 3:49:32.120
 just like CIA recruited me, just do the next thing.

3:49:32.120 --> 3:49:34.520
 If the step seems like it's too big,

3:49:34.520 --> 3:49:36.100
 then there's probably two other steps

3:49:36.100 --> 3:49:37.680
 that you can do before that.

3:49:37.680 --> 3:49:40.440
 Just make constant progress, build momentum,

3:49:40.440 --> 3:49:43.960
 move forward and live on your own terms.

3:49:43.960 --> 3:49:47.040
 That way you don't ever wake up to the regret.

3:49:47.040 --> 3:49:50.000
 And it'll be over before you know it.

3:49:50.000 --> 3:49:52.000
 Whether you regret it or not, it's true.

3:49:52.960 --> 3:49:55.540
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

3:49:55.540 --> 3:49:56.720
 What's the meaning of life?

3:49:56.720 --> 3:50:00.240
 Self respect, that's a fast answer.

3:50:00.240 --> 3:50:01.960
 There's a story behind it if you want the story.

3:50:01.960 --> 3:50:03.720
 I would love to have the story.

3:50:03.720 --> 3:50:08.080
 There's a covert training base in Alabama in the south,

3:50:08.080 --> 3:50:10.200
 far south and like the armpit of America

3:50:10.200 --> 3:50:12.560
 where elite tier one operators

3:50:12.560 --> 3:50:16.100
 go to learn human intelligence stuff.

3:50:16.100 --> 3:50:18.960
 And there's a bar inside this base.

3:50:18.960 --> 3:50:23.960
 And on the wall is just, it's scribbles of opinions.

3:50:23.960 --> 3:50:25.640
 And the question in the middle of the wall

3:50:25.640 --> 3:50:27.400
 says what's the meaning of life?

3:50:27.400 --> 3:50:31.080
 And all these elite operators over the last 25 or 30 years,

3:50:31.080 --> 3:50:33.560
 they all go, they get drunk and they scribble their answer

3:50:33.560 --> 3:50:35.200
 and they circle it with a Sharpie, right?

3:50:35.200 --> 3:50:40.200
 Love, family, America, freedom, right, whatever.

3:50:40.440 --> 3:50:41.560
 And then the only thing they have to do

3:50:41.560 --> 3:50:43.080
 is if they're gonna write something on there,

3:50:43.080 --> 3:50:46.040
 they have to connect it with something else on the wall,

3:50:46.040 --> 3:50:47.040
 at least one other thing.

3:50:47.040 --> 3:50:48.840
 So if they write love, they can't just leave it

3:50:48.840 --> 3:50:51.560
 floating there, they have to write love in a little bubble

3:50:51.560 --> 3:50:53.960
 and connect it to something else, connect it to family,

3:50:53.960 --> 3:50:54.800
 whatever else.

3:50:54.800 --> 3:50:56.160
 When you look at that wall,

3:50:58.080 --> 3:51:00.600
 the word self respect is on the wall

3:51:00.600 --> 3:51:02.400
 and it's got a circle around it.

3:51:02.400 --> 3:51:04.600
 And then you can't see any other word

3:51:04.600 --> 3:51:07.680
 because of all the things that connect to self respect.

3:51:08.720 --> 3:51:11.920
 Just dozens of people have written over,

3:51:11.920 --> 3:51:14.040
 have written their words down and been drawn

3:51:14.040 --> 3:51:15.880
 and scribbled over because of all the lines

3:51:15.880 --> 3:51:17.200
 that connect to self respect.

3:51:17.200 --> 3:51:18.920
 So what's the meaning of life?

3:51:18.920 --> 3:51:19.760
 From my point of view,

3:51:19.760 --> 3:51:22.200
 I've never seen a better answer.

3:51:22.200 --> 3:51:23.040
 It's all self respect.

3:51:23.040 --> 3:51:25.440
 If you don't respect yourself, how can you do anything else?

3:51:25.440 --> 3:51:26.280
 How can you love someone else

3:51:26.280 --> 3:51:27.680
 if you don't have self respect?

3:51:27.680 --> 3:51:28.840
 How can you build a business you're proud of

3:51:28.840 --> 3:51:29.880
 if you don't have self respect?

3:51:29.880 --> 3:51:31.120
 How can you raise kids?

3:51:31.120 --> 3:51:32.280
 How can you make a difference?

3:51:32.280 --> 3:51:33.880
 How can you pioneer anything?

3:51:33.880 --> 3:51:37.080
 How can you just wake up and have a good day

3:51:37.080 --> 3:51:39.160
 if you don't have self respect?

3:51:40.840 --> 3:51:42.240
 The power of the individual,

3:51:42.240 --> 3:51:46.360
 that's what makes this country great.

3:51:46.360 --> 3:51:49.000
 I have to say, after I was born,

3:51:49.000 --> 3:51:52.200
 I have to say after traveling quite a bit in Europe

3:51:52.200 --> 3:51:55.720
 and especially in a place of war,

3:51:55.720 --> 3:51:57.080
 coming back to the United States

3:51:57.080 --> 3:51:58.400
 makes me really appreciate

3:51:58.400 --> 3:52:02.280
 about the better angels of this nation,

3:52:02.280 --> 3:52:04.960
 the ideals it stands for, the values it stands for.

3:52:04.960 --> 3:52:09.960
 And I'd like to thank you for serving this nation for time

3:52:10.040 --> 3:52:11.800
 and humanity for time

3:52:12.640 --> 3:52:16.800
 and for being brave enough and bold enough

3:52:16.800 --> 3:52:19.480
 to still talk about it and to inspire others,

3:52:19.480 --> 3:52:24.480
 to educate others for having many amazing conversations

3:52:25.120 --> 3:52:28.480
 and for honoring me by having this conversation today.

3:52:28.480 --> 3:52:30.080
 You're an amazing human.

3:52:30.080 --> 3:52:31.360
 Thanks so much for talking today.

3:52:31.360 --> 3:52:32.760
 Lex, I appreciate the invite, man.

3:52:32.760 --> 3:52:33.600

 from Sun Tzu in The Art of War.

3:52:47.920 --> 3:52:52.160
 Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night.

3:52:52.160 --> 3:52:55.400
 And when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.
