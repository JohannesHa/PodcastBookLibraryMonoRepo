00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
 The following is a conversation with Michael Malice, his second time on the podcast.

00:05.200 --> 00:10.320
 He's an anarchist, political thinker, podcaster, and author.

00:10.320 --> 00:17.260
 He wrote Dear Reader, which is a book on North Korea, and The New Right, a book on the various

00:17.260 --> 00:20.940
 ideological movements at the fringe of American politics.

00:20.940 --> 00:26.960
 He hosts a podcast called You're Welcome, spelled Y O U R, and in general, there's

00:26.960 --> 00:33.780
 a lot of live shows on YouTube that are at times profoundly absurd, and at other times

00:33.780 --> 00:38.720
 absurdly profound, and always full of humor and wisdom.

00:38.720 --> 00:44.100
 He is the Joker to my Batman, and the Caviar to my Vodka.

00:44.100 --> 00:50.320
 His masterful dance between dark humor and difficult, even dangerous ideas, challenges

00:50.320 --> 00:55.920
 me to think deeply about this world, and when that fails, at least smile and have a good

00:55.920 --> 00:58.560
 laugh at the absurdity of it all.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.880
 This episode has much of that.

01:00.880 --> 01:10.320
 His outfit, for example, the exact inverse of mine, with a white suit and a black shirt,

01:10.320 --> 01:18.560
 is just one example of that, of the humor, trolling, and brilliance that is Michael Malice.

01:18.560 --> 01:25.560
 Quick mention of our sponsors, NetSuite, Business Management Software, Athletic Greens, All

01:25.560 --> 01:32.560
 In One Nutrition Drink, Sun Basket, Meal Delivery Service, and Cash App.

01:32.560 --> 01:38.320
 So the choice is success, health, food, or money.

01:38.320 --> 01:43.540
 Choose wisely, my friends, and if you wish, click the sponsor links below to get a discount

01:43.540 --> 01:46.040
 and to support this podcast.

01:46.040 --> 01:52.200
 As a side note, let me say that Michael is, in many ways, a man of radical ideas, but

01:52.200 --> 01:55.380
 also a man with kindness in his heart.

01:55.380 --> 01:59.560
 Those two things are great ingredients for a fascinating conversation.

01:59.560 --> 02:05.240
 I hope to have several such people on this podcast this upcoming year who also have radical

02:05.240 --> 02:09.400
 ideas about politics, science, technology, and life.

02:09.400 --> 02:15.200
 At times, often perhaps, I might fail at asking the challenging questions that should be asked,

02:15.200 --> 02:20.320
 but I will try my best to do so, and hope to keep improving every time.

02:20.320 --> 02:25.480
 Mostly, I come to these conversations with an open mind and with love.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.280
 Unfortunately, that kind of approach can be taken advantage of in many ways.

02:29.280 --> 02:35.000
 It can be used by reporters or just people online later to highlight how or why I'm

02:35.000 --> 02:39.840
 ignorant or worse, I'm generally not a good human being.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.040
 In the context of this, I have two options.

02:42.040 --> 02:48.520
 I could either be cautious and afraid, or second, be kind, thoughtful, and fearless.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.240
 I choose the latter.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.680
 Hopefully while still being open, fragile, and empathetic.

02:53.680 --> 02:59.480
 Again, I strive to be like the main character of The Idiot by Dostoevsky.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.400
 That's my New Year's resolution.

03:01.400 --> 03:04.120
 Be kind and do difficult things.

03:04.120 --> 03:09.520
 Difficult conversations, difficult research projects, and difficult entrepreneurial adventures.

03:09.520 --> 03:16.160

03:20.080 --> 03:25.600
 And now, here's my conversation with Michael Malice.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.600
 Knock knock.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.600
 You're stealing my bed?

03:27.600 --> 03:28.600
 I'll kill your family.

03:28.600 --> 03:35.320
 That's not how a knock knock joke works.

03:35.320 --> 03:36.320
 Knock knock, Michael.

03:36.320 --> 03:41.240
 You don't do knock knock jokes with Russians because if we have a knock at the door, turn

03:41.240 --> 03:42.240
 down the TV.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.240
 You got to sit quiet.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.240
 We hope they go away.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.240
 You don't do that back in the motherland.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.240
 You know this.

03:46.240 --> 03:47.240
 It's triggering.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.240
 Who's there?

03:48.240 --> 03:53.960
 I can't even do it now.

03:53.960 --> 03:54.960
 Knock knock.

03:54.960 --> 03:55.960
 Who's there?

03:55.960 --> 03:56.960
 Leon.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.600
 Leon who?

03:58.600 --> 04:00.960
 Leon me when you're not strong, Michael.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.720
 Well, that will never happen.

04:03.720 --> 04:08.240
 I stole elegantly, eloquently that joke from you.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.680
 The lie detector term, that was a lie.

04:10.680 --> 04:11.680
 Elegantly and eloquently.

04:11.680 --> 04:12.680
 Oh.

04:12.680 --> 04:17.320
 Yeah, you crossed it out on a sheet of paper.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.900
 That means it's real.

04:18.900 --> 04:25.120
 The reason I bring it up is because you had the guts, the brilliance to do a knock knock

04:25.120 --> 04:26.120
 joke.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.240
 Not once, but three times with Alex Jones.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.240
 I think it was like six.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.240
 I had a runner.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.240
 Okay.

04:31.240 --> 04:37.040
 Maybe they started to sort of melt together in this beautiful art form that you've created,

04:37.040 --> 04:40.800
 which is like these kind, loving knock knock jokes with Alex Jones.

04:40.800 --> 04:47.560
 So you got the chance to meet him and talk to him twice with Tim Pool in a long form

04:47.560 --> 04:48.560
 conversation.

04:48.560 --> 04:56.920
 What was it like talking to Alex Jones, both on the deep philosophical intellectual level

04:56.920 --> 05:04.920
 and staring the man in his eyes and doing a knock knock joke about Olive knock knock.

05:04.920 --> 05:05.920
 Who's there?

05:05.920 --> 05:06.920
 Olive.

05:06.920 --> 05:07.920
 I love you, Alex.

05:07.920 --> 05:08.920
 I love you.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.440
 Well, there's a lot to explain.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.440
 Where do you start?

05:12.440 --> 05:17.520
 I've been on his show Infowars a few times when I was researching my book, Then You Write.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.480
 So I had had conversations with him before.

05:20.480 --> 05:25.500
 One of the things that I appreciate about Alex is he is a lot more self aware than people

05:25.500 --> 05:28.280
 think and has a good sense of humor.

05:28.280 --> 05:32.260
 And I also like a good twist ending.

05:32.260 --> 05:37.520
 So if you set people up and all these jokes are these kind of vapid, you know, all of

05:37.520 --> 05:41.920
 you jokes and the last one's about building seven, they're not going to see that one coming

05:41.920 --> 05:43.400
 nor will he see that one coming.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.960
 I even had another one about Sandy Hook, which I didn't do on the air because he was being

05:46.960 --> 05:52.640
 like a good sport, but that was the dagger that was kind of behind my back if necessary.

05:52.640 --> 05:57.700
 But it was a good mechanism toward I like it when things work on several levels.

05:57.700 --> 06:03.240
 It was also a good mechanism to keep kind of the conversation guarded and this every

06:03.240 --> 06:09.480
 so often, this is kind of hitting the control, alt, delete and bring it down to a certain

06:09.480 --> 06:11.080
 point of calmness.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.080
 What about the love thing?

06:12.080 --> 06:19.800
 I mean, you're saying that that was a buildup to the dagger, but it was also somehow really

06:19.800 --> 06:23.780
 refreshing to get that little jolt, like that pause.

06:23.780 --> 06:25.480
 You don't get that in conversations often.

06:25.480 --> 06:30.640
 Like I'm a huge fan of Rogan and he'll have a three hour conversation, but at some point

06:30.640 --> 06:35.680
 just pause and be like, I love you, man.

06:35.680 --> 06:42.760
 Like it's in the cheesiest way possible because that seems to be, it somehow hits the hardest

06:42.760 --> 06:43.760
 then.

06:43.760 --> 06:44.760
 I don't know.

06:44.760 --> 06:48.840
 I don't know you didn't intend it that way, but with Alex Jones to sit there and to say,

06:48.840 --> 06:50.960
 I love you.

06:50.960 --> 06:55.120
 That was like, I just haven't never heard that before.

06:55.120 --> 07:00.220
 And so it struck me as like, not just funny for what you're doing, but just like, whoa,

07:00.220 --> 07:04.640
 we just took, cause conversations are all about like this ranting, especially with Alex

07:04.640 --> 07:08.880
 Jones, just like ranting about this or that, this part of the world, like, can you believe

07:08.880 --> 07:09.880
 this shit?

07:09.880 --> 07:10.880
 That kind of thing.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.400
 But like to pause and be like, this is awesome.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.000
 I don't know if you felt that way, but.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.240
 Oh, I definitely felt that way.

07:16.240 --> 07:17.240
 So it was actually very fun.

07:17.240 --> 07:22.080
 I'll give you the backstory of how that happened.

07:22.080 --> 07:26.620
 It was silly cause Tim calls me up and there's this expression in marketing, don't go past

07:26.620 --> 07:27.620
 the sale.

07:27.620 --> 07:28.620
 Right?

07:28.620 --> 07:32.400
 You're gonna buy someone a car and like, it's got this feature, this feature and that feature.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.400
 And they're like, you know what?

07:33.400 --> 07:34.580
 I'm going to buy the car.

07:34.580 --> 07:38.060
 If you keep talking, you can only make them lose the sale.

07:38.060 --> 07:41.120
 You just get them to sign and get, get out of Dodge.

07:41.120 --> 07:47.080
 So Tim calls me up and he goes, okay, here's what we're thinking.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.080
 This is top secret.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.000
 Alex is going to be on the show.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.340
 We want you on as well.

07:51.340 --> 07:54.920
 And I've never said yes to anything as quickly in my life.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.240
 And then he keeps talking and I'm like, Tim, this, you don't have to sell it.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.240
 I interrupted him.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.240
 I go, you don't have to sell it.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.600
 Why you, by the way?

08:01.600 --> 08:10.520
 I think because I am kind of an agent of chaos and Alex is in his own way, an agent of chaos.

08:10.520 --> 08:15.560
 And what is, provides an opportunity in this kind of news media space that you and I travel

08:15.560 --> 08:20.960
 in, it's the kind of things where none of us three, you know, as we said on the show,

08:20.960 --> 08:22.520
 knew what it would be like.

08:22.520 --> 08:28.400
 If you, you know, to certain, within certain parameters, what, you know, Megyn Kelly or

08:28.400 --> 08:32.520
 Wolf Blitzer or any of these corporate figures are going to be like in a conversation to

08:32.520 --> 08:35.360
 some extent, none of us had any idea.

08:35.360 --> 08:39.080
 I knew they didn't know I was bringing in knocking up jokes.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.480
 So that was kind of what was so exciting.

08:42.480 --> 08:47.160
 I said at one point, I'm kind of envious of the audience because this is, there's so many

08:47.160 --> 08:52.000
 exciting things that are happening and that the internet and podcasting provides people

08:52.000 --> 08:53.880
 an opportunity to do that.

08:53.880 --> 08:54.880
 It was great.

08:54.880 --> 08:55.880
 Yeah.

08:55.880 --> 09:02.080
 That, that was the greatest pairing with Alex Jones that I've ever seen by far.

09:02.080 --> 09:08.960
 So like, so I immediately knew now this isn't a knock on Tim, but I don't even know if Tim

09:08.960 --> 09:09.960
 was prepared.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.400
 Tim was not prepared.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.400
 For this.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.400
 How could he be prepared?

09:13.400 --> 09:16.360
 Well, so I mean, I don't know if Tim is used to that.

09:16.360 --> 09:22.120
 I think Joe Rogan is more equipped, prepared for the chaos, just the years he's been in

09:22.120 --> 09:23.120
 it.

09:23.120 --> 09:27.640
 Like I immediately thought this is the right pairing for Joe Rogan because Alex Jones has

09:27.640 --> 09:31.300
 been on Joe Rogan a few times, three times.

09:31.300 --> 09:39.240
 My favorite so far was with Tim Dillon, but Tim was clearly, Tim Dillon was also kind

09:39.240 --> 09:48.000
 of a genius in his own right, but he was kind of a fan and he was stepping away.

09:48.000 --> 09:58.400
 He was almost like in awe of Alex Jones where you were both, you were in awe of the experience

09:58.400 --> 10:04.000
 that's being created and at the same time fearlessly just trolling the situation.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.760
 I mean, to do a knock, knock joke, to stop, I mean, that just shows that you're in control

10:08.760 --> 10:09.760
 of the experience.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.440
 No, you're like riding the experience.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.720
 That immediately was like, this needs to be on Rogan.

10:14.720 --> 10:18.080
 So I hope that happens as well.

10:18.080 --> 10:22.440
 You're on your own, of course, on Rogan, but just you, that's an experience.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.720
 That's the, whatever, this gotta be a good name for it.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.520
 Like Jimi Hendrix Experience, there's the Michael and Alex.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.080
 Because that was a band.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.080
 It's taken.

10:30.080 --> 10:35.360
 Well, I don't know how many years you can restart the experience.

10:35.360 --> 10:42.040
 Because I feel sorry to interrupt you, I feel a very big responsibility, especially in 2020

10:42.040 --> 10:49.560
 to provide fun and something cool and something unique that hasn't been done before for the

10:49.560 --> 10:50.560
 audience.

10:50.560 --> 10:55.560
 I think this has been a very rough year on our audiences psychologically and in other

10:55.560 --> 10:57.200
 aspects of their lives.

10:57.200 --> 11:02.920
 So I feel if I'm going to be there, I'm going to put on a show and it's also going to be

11:02.920 --> 11:06.360
 great because it also alienates the people you don't want.

11:06.360 --> 11:09.760
 So there's a lot of people who sit there and be like, oh, he's telling knock, people who

11:09.760 --> 11:13.560
 are too cool for school, where they're like, oh, he's telling knock, knock jokes.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.560
 This is stupid.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.560
 I'm like, good.

11:15.560 --> 11:22.920
 If you have an issue with having eaten cotton candy or doing a puzzle with a kid or with

11:22.920 --> 11:26.520
 that by yourself, that's on you.

11:26.520 --> 11:31.040
 And it's something very, something I think is the enemy is cynicism and this idea that

11:31.040 --> 11:36.520
 like, oh, this is too silly and we need that kind of childlike aspect in our lives.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.360
 I think it's something we could use more of.

11:38.360 --> 11:42.840
 It's very much an aspect of our media culture that to kind of have be condemnatory about

11:42.840 --> 11:46.400
 that or to do it in a certain very corporate fake way.

11:46.400 --> 11:51.560
 So it is something I encourage a lot, something I enjoy doing.

11:51.560 --> 11:56.640
 And again, like with the first time I was on Tim, I had a propeller beanie on, you know,

11:56.640 --> 12:00.880
 with the motorized and a lot of people were like, I can't take anyone seriously who dresses

12:00.880 --> 12:01.880
 like this.

12:01.880 --> 12:02.880
 I go, good.

12:02.880 --> 12:07.960
 If you judge someone's ideas by how they appear instead of the ideas themselves, you're not

12:07.960 --> 12:10.280
 someone I want on my team.

12:10.280 --> 12:15.160
 Are we going to address the outfit you're wearing?

12:15.160 --> 12:16.160
 We can address it, sure.

12:16.160 --> 12:25.240
 You know, for those who are colorblind, Michael's wearing the, or just listening to this, Michael's

12:25.240 --> 12:31.800
 wearing the exact opposite, the universe from another dimension outfit, which is a white

12:31.800 --> 12:33.800
 suit and black shirt.

12:33.800 --> 12:34.800
 So genius.

12:34.800 --> 12:35.800
 Okay.

12:35.800 --> 12:36.800
 So.

12:36.800 --> 12:37.800
 You just see the next two looks I've planned.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.800
 Oh, no.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.800
 Yeah, they're great.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.800
 Well, obviously this relationship's going to end today.

12:42.800 --> 12:43.800
 It's over.

12:43.800 --> 12:47.000
 I'll put them on Insta.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
 Okay.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.960
 Is there some deep philosophy to the humor?

12:50.960 --> 12:54.540
 Is this goes to our trolling discussion?

12:54.540 --> 13:02.360
 Is there some, is there like chapters to this genius or is this just what makes you smile

13:02.360 --> 13:03.360
 in the morning?

13:03.360 --> 13:07.120
 Well, I mean, I think you're honestly, in this case, using the word genius a little

13:07.120 --> 13:08.120
 loosely.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.120
 I am.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.080
 I don't think this is particularly genius, but I do think it is fun.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.260
 It is exuberant.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.040
 It is joyous.

13:16.040 --> 13:23.400
 I think the bigger my audience has gotten and the more I actually communicate with,

13:23.400 --> 13:28.840
 you know, fans, I do feel it kind of kicks in these paternal maternal instincts, which

13:28.840 --> 13:29.840
 is very, very odd.

13:29.840 --> 13:30.840
 I did not expect to have them.

13:30.840 --> 13:31.840
 What do you mean?

13:31.840 --> 13:32.840
 Who's the dad?

13:32.840 --> 13:33.960
 I'm the dad and the mom.

13:33.960 --> 13:37.400
 I remember, and it may have been similar for you, I'm curious to hear it.

13:37.400 --> 13:43.880
 For young, smart, like ambitious men, like 24 to 27 for me was a very rough period because

13:43.880 --> 13:47.980
 that's the window where a lot of people get married and they kind of check out.

13:47.980 --> 13:52.700
 And if you're very much kind of finding your own road, you don't know what's happening.

13:52.700 --> 13:55.280
 No one's in a position to really guide you or help you.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.280
 And it's tough.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.840
 It's a very tough window.

13:58.840 --> 14:05.040
 And what I'm finding now is having these kids who are in that position, but now instead

14:05.040 --> 14:09.360
 of them stumbling along, for some of them, I'm the one who could be like, no, no, no,

14:09.360 --> 14:10.360
 it's not you.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.760
 It's everybody else.

14:11.760 --> 14:18.340
 And to be able to give them that semblance of feeling seen, to use a cliched expression,

14:18.340 --> 14:23.360
 to feel normal and that, no, no, you're the heroes here.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.660
 They're the background noise.

14:25.660 --> 14:30.360
 It's just really very flattering and humbling to be in that position.

14:30.360 --> 14:31.960
 You have many minds, right?

14:31.960 --> 14:41.280
 There's the thoughtful kind, Michael, there's like, I'm going to burn down the powerful.

14:41.280 --> 14:48.100
 And then there's like, I'm going to have this just lighthearted trolling of the world, which

14:48.100 --> 14:55.040
 and which of those are most important to the 27 demographic?

14:55.040 --> 14:57.680
 I think it is the combination.

14:57.680 --> 15:04.480
 It's like if you're making a meal, chicken Kiev, you need the chicken, you need the ham,

15:04.480 --> 15:07.600
 you need the butter sauce.

15:07.600 --> 15:13.280
 Because I think people, when you're young, you need to see someone who's fought the fight

15:13.280 --> 15:15.960
 for you and who's won.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.560
 So it's very easy to be defeatist.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.880
 So this is what winning looks like.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.300
 No, this is not.

15:23.300 --> 15:26.040
 This is most assuredly what winning does not look like.

15:26.040 --> 15:29.680
 But in my normal clothes, a little bit more.

15:29.680 --> 15:34.720
 This is a good time to mention that clothes wise, you're wearing sheath underwear.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.180
 And people should buy sheath underwear.

15:37.180 --> 15:38.180
 Use code Malice20.

15:38.180 --> 15:42.240
 If you go to sheathunderwear.com, use promo code Malice20.

15:42.240 --> 15:46.600
 What I love about why I'm glad to promote the product and wear it, it's the most comfortable

15:46.600 --> 15:48.160
 underwear I've ever worn.

15:48.160 --> 15:51.880
 And you have a separate pouch for both parts of your genitals.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.000
 That's what I thought there was like a punchline coming.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.240
 No, it's a very nice aspect of the product.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.240
 Yeah.

15:57.240 --> 16:00.420
 But I think what here's something else just goes back to what we're just talking about.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.800
 There are so many and this is going to segue into this.

16:02.800 --> 16:07.360
 There are so many small companies who've been devastated this year.

16:07.360 --> 16:13.200
 We have not seen a sustained attack on mom and pop shops like we've seen in 2020, who

16:13.200 --> 16:17.060
 are innovators and making something happen.

16:17.060 --> 16:22.720
 And when you're just like one dude who's producing a product, they're a sponsor of mine.

16:22.720 --> 16:28.400
 I'm happy to, first of all, it's funny that I'm pitching underwear, but it's also something

16:28.400 --> 16:29.400
 I enjoy.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.400
 And also you said small business.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.400
 Yeah.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.120
 It's microscopic, like a thimble.

16:33.120 --> 16:36.120
 So this isn't a sponsor of mine, but this is a good segue.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.720
 So this is, Russians, we celebrate New Year's, it's Novomgorodom.

16:39.720 --> 16:43.240
 We have Dmitry, he comes down, puts a present under your pillow.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.720
 So this is a company called J.L. Lawson.

16:45.720 --> 16:46.720
 He's a fan of yours.

16:46.720 --> 16:47.720
 He's a metal worker.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.920
 And he said, can I give you something to give to Lex?

16:50.920 --> 16:52.480
 I have one of his worry coins.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.000
 I'll tell you what it is.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
 He's not a sponsor.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.600
 This is not, I'm not getting paid for this.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.740
 So what a worry coin is, I carry it around in my butt.

16:58.740 --> 17:01.500
 If you have raw denim, it's great because it brings you fades.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.640
 So you carry it around with you all the time.

17:03.640 --> 17:08.120
 It says worrying is like paying a debt you don't owe, right?

17:08.120 --> 17:12.420
 And I carry this around and allow it to spend like a year.

17:12.420 --> 17:15.720
 Next time you're worrying, and this is good advice if you don't have a worry coin.

17:15.720 --> 17:20.640
 Go think about 10 years ago and what you were worried about then.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.040
 And then think about, did any of those things pan out?

17:23.040 --> 17:25.840
 And some of them did, but you were able to handle it.

17:25.840 --> 17:28.600
 And that's a good way to maintain perspective.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.440
 So J.L. Lawson is the company.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.440
 He sent me this present.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.600
 I said, let me give it to Lex on air.

17:33.600 --> 17:34.600
 So enjoy.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.360
 So I have to open it up now?

17:37.360 --> 17:38.360
 Yeah.

17:38.360 --> 17:39.640
 J.L. Lawson and co.

17:39.640 --> 17:40.920
 Two Lex from Anthony.

17:40.920 --> 17:41.920
 Yeah.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.400
 And I said, make something mathematical for Lex.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.680
 So I don't even know what's in there.

17:44.680 --> 17:45.680
 You don't know what's in there?

17:45.680 --> 17:46.680
 No.

17:46.680 --> 17:47.680
 And it got through his TSA.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.160
 Could be a bomb.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.420
 It could be.

17:50.420 --> 17:54.700
 Just like this episode.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.860
 Make sure you unwrap it close to the mic because it drives you for crazy.

17:57.860 --> 18:03.120
 That's really the best part.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.640
 Is this what an unboxing video looks like?

18:05.640 --> 18:07.240
 I think so.

18:07.240 --> 18:10.400
 This conversation is going to be a big hit on the internet.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.960
 With the unboxing community.

18:12.960 --> 18:17.480
 I need to have an excited look on my face to make sure that the reaction video, it should

18:17.480 --> 18:19.880
 be an unboxing and a reaction video.

18:19.880 --> 18:20.880
 Lex Freeman reacts.

18:20.880 --> 18:21.880
 It's another box.

18:21.880 --> 18:25.920
 It's just a series of boxes.

18:25.920 --> 18:30.480
 Lex big fan since hearing you on Rogan months ago.

18:30.480 --> 18:34.840
 Most of your guests are over my head, but still enjoyable.

18:34.840 --> 18:40.400
 Like this episode, Michael was kind enough to want to share my work with you.

18:40.400 --> 18:41.760
 Keep doing what you do.

18:41.760 --> 18:42.760
 Anthony Lawson.

18:42.760 --> 18:43.760
 Thanks Anthony.

18:43.760 --> 18:44.760
 There's a lot in there.

18:44.760 --> 18:45.760
 What is in there?

18:45.760 --> 18:46.760
 Give me some.

18:46.760 --> 18:47.760
 I'll open some.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.760
 Okay.

18:48.760 --> 18:49.760
 All right.

18:49.760 --> 18:56.600
 Show it to the camera and then make sure you look excited or not or disappointed.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.600
 No, this is cool.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.600
 This is a worry coin.

18:58.600 --> 18:59.600
 Like I was showing you.

18:59.600 --> 19:03.200
 So you hold it in your hand and when you can do this with your thumb, if people are, have

19:03.200 --> 19:04.200
 anxiety or whatever.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.520
 Oh, there's a lot of cool stuff in here.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.520
 Fibonacci coin.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.320
 Oh, see, yeah, that's the math stuff.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.760
 That's really awesome.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.920
 This is really cool.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.440
 Wait, you got a big one laying there too.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.520
 That's what she said.

19:19.520 --> 19:28.720
 I'm telling you last time you offended me saying I don't have humor.

19:28.720 --> 19:33.320
 The spin tray micro brass and copper bronze.

19:33.320 --> 19:36.480
 By the way, the packaging is epic.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.480
 I think that's his top.

19:37.480 --> 19:38.480
 He makes tops.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.480
 Cool.

19:39.480 --> 19:49.920
 Yeah, you spin it in there and it's the two different bronze and copper.

19:49.920 --> 19:54.600
 I think he's the only one who makes these machined tops and then they sit in here, I

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600
 guess.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.640
 Yeah, but you could spin them in that section.

19:57.640 --> 20:01.280
 Got it, cool.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.920
 Where's the where's the worry thing?

20:02.920 --> 20:03.920
 Here's the worry coin.

20:03.920 --> 20:04.920
 Anyway, I wasn't listening.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.960
 What were you worried about 10 years ago?

20:06.960 --> 20:09.840
 10 years ago, 2010.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.200
 What would I have been worried about then?

20:11.200 --> 20:12.200
 The government?

20:12.200 --> 20:13.200
 No, I'm not.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.200
 That's not a worry.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.200
 I think...

20:15.200 --> 20:16.520
 What was the North Korea book?

20:16.520 --> 20:17.520
 I apologize.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.840
 That came out in 2014.

20:19.840 --> 20:24.840
 I went there in 2012, came out in January 2014.

20:24.840 --> 20:28.280
 It still pays my rent with the royalties.

20:28.280 --> 20:29.280
 The North Korea book?

20:29.280 --> 20:30.280
 Yeah.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.800
 See, this is why it's so much better.

20:31.800 --> 20:36.400
 I gotta talk to you about self publishing because you brought that up.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.880
 I'm doing the next books also going to be self published.

20:38.880 --> 20:42.960
 Can we talk about self publishing?

20:42.960 --> 20:45.320
 What's the whole idea of publishing?

20:45.320 --> 20:49.100
 Like having a publisher and an agent because there's a bunch of people have been reaching

20:49.100 --> 20:52.480
 out to me trying to get me to write a book, which is ridiculous.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.480
 Why?

20:53.480 --> 20:58.480
 Because people who are brilliant folks like you, like Jordan Peterson, that I think have

20:58.480 --> 21:00.840
 a lot of knowledge to share with the world.

21:00.840 --> 21:10.480
 I think what I feel I can contribute to the world in terms of impact is to build something.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.560
 Meaning like engineering stuff.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.560
 Like a book...

21:13.560 --> 21:16.400
 A book has to be engineered and I'm not using that loosely.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.720
 You have to engineer a book.

21:17.720 --> 21:18.720
 No, for sure.

21:18.720 --> 21:22.920
 What I mean is like literally a product with programming and artificial intelligence.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.100
 I want to build a company.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.100
 I want to...

21:25.100 --> 21:31.600
 Because I have a few ideas that I feel I'm equipped and it has to do with your intuition

21:31.600 --> 21:34.380
 about the way you can build a better world.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.380
 You individually.

21:35.380 --> 21:38.620
 Like, what can you add to the world that's a positive thing?

21:38.620 --> 21:45.400
 And for me, I feel like the maximal thing I can add to the world is at least to attempt

21:45.400 --> 21:49.540
 to build products that would add more love in the world.

21:49.540 --> 21:50.900
 And like, so I want to focus on that.

21:50.900 --> 21:57.000
 The danger of the book for me, or any kind of writing, and even this podcast is a little

21:57.000 --> 21:59.480
 bit dangerous for me, is like, it's fun.

21:59.480 --> 22:03.200
 That's for sure.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.200
 It's fun.

22:04.200 --> 22:07.000
 It's like it takes you into this place where you start thinking about the world.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
 You start enjoying and playing with ideas.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
 You start...

22:10.000 --> 22:16.560
 And like, just your book on a Dear Reader, but also the new write.

22:16.560 --> 22:22.960
 Like clearly you and I probably think similarly in the sense that you did a lot of work.

22:22.960 --> 22:23.960
 Yes.

22:23.960 --> 22:25.560
 This next book is killing me.

22:25.560 --> 22:26.560
 Yeah.

22:26.560 --> 22:33.360
 As you mentioned, often it's clear, like on your YouTube channel, which I'm a fan of,

22:33.360 --> 22:37.600
 you often, it just comes out like you mentioned all of these books that you're reading.

22:37.600 --> 22:43.840
 It just comes through you that you're suffering through this and it changes you.

22:43.840 --> 22:49.000
 And it's clear that you're thinking deeply about the world because of this book.

22:49.000 --> 22:55.200
 And I feel like if you do that, that's like when I first came to this country, I read

22:55.200 --> 22:56.200
 the book The Giver.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.560
 I need to read it again.

22:57.560 --> 23:04.400
 It's like the red pill thing is it changes you in where you can never be the same person

23:04.400 --> 23:05.400
 again.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.400
 Sure.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.760
 I feel about a book in that same way.

23:07.760 --> 23:11.040
 The moment you write a book, of course it depends on the book.

23:11.040 --> 23:15.840
 I could also just write like in my field, a very technical book.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.800
 No, that's a terrible idea.

23:17.800 --> 23:18.800
 Yes.

23:18.800 --> 23:19.800
 But that's okay.

23:19.800 --> 23:20.800
 That doesn't really change you.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.040
 That's just like sharing information.

23:22.040 --> 23:26.800
 But like something where you're like, how do I think about this world?

23:26.800 --> 23:28.640
 Can you just leave that behind you?

23:28.640 --> 23:29.640
 I get it.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.280
 Dude, it's being pregnant.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.280
 It never escapes your brain.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.280
 I'm telling you.

23:33.280 --> 23:34.280
 You're absolutely right.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.280
 Yeah.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.280
 I don't know.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.280
 It does seem to change you.

23:37.280 --> 23:42.920
 The reason I bring that up is because there's this whole industry of people that seem to

23:42.920 --> 23:49.120
 not really contribute much to the publication process, but they make themselves seem necessary

23:49.120 --> 23:53.740
 for like, if you want to be in the New York Times bestseller list kind of thing, but also

23:53.740 --> 23:59.640
 just being like reputable, which I'm allergic to that whole concept.

23:59.640 --> 24:05.760
 But do you think it's possible to be on the New York Times bestseller list and be a reputable

24:05.760 --> 24:09.640
 author and still be self published?

24:09.640 --> 24:11.200
 Not what you would want to do.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.840
 Like people like Mark Sisson, I think is his name.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.160
 He wrote like the Primal Blueprints.

24:14.160 --> 24:18.160
 So like if I'm getting the names correct, he's the first paleo guy, right?

24:18.160 --> 24:19.960
 So he self published it.

24:19.960 --> 24:20.960
 It sold gangbusters.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.080
 But that would be on their health chart, I believe.

24:24.080 --> 24:27.640
 And it's a little bit of a different situation.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.840
 You would be reaching much more for the mainstream.

24:30.840 --> 24:36.180
 You'd be giving up a lot if you go through a publisher, especially financially.

24:36.180 --> 24:41.880
 But yeah, you are not going to have the cred because the publishing is a cartel.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.360
 The New York Times is part of this cartel.

24:44.360 --> 24:50.880
 And if you don't publish within this cartel, they will do what they can, as any cartel

24:50.880 --> 24:55.800
 has to, by necessity of being cartel, to pretend you don't exist.

24:55.800 --> 25:01.240
 So I was, I think, the first one to have an hour on BookTV for Dear Reader because that

25:01.240 --> 25:03.660
 was a Kickstarter book.

25:03.660 --> 25:12.280
 But this is something that people would have to be aware of.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.660
 So you would be giving up a lot.

25:14.660 --> 25:18.320
 But you'd also be giving a lot to work with a publisher because you're losing like a year

25:18.320 --> 25:21.960
 and a half of your life because they're glacial and they don't care.

25:21.960 --> 25:22.960
 Well, that's my problem.

25:22.960 --> 25:23.960
 It's not the money.

25:23.960 --> 25:27.960
 I mean, the money is whatever percent they take, 10, 20, 30, 50%.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.920
 They're taking a huge chunk.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.800
 So if I sell a book through St. Martin's, it's a dollar.

25:33.800 --> 25:37.520
 If I sell a book through Amazon, which is Dear Reader, that's $6.

25:37.520 --> 25:41.280
 So that's what, 87%, it's something crazy.

25:41.280 --> 25:47.040
 But for me, what bothers me isn't the money that, for me personally, for me, what bothers

25:47.040 --> 25:48.040
 me is incompetence.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.320
 Like whenever I go to the DMV or something like that.

25:50.320 --> 25:51.320
 Can I interrupt you?

25:51.320 --> 25:52.320
 Yeah.

25:52.320 --> 25:53.320
 Let's talk incompetence.

25:53.320 --> 26:00.800
 When a new write comes out last year, I get on Rogan, get on Ruben.

26:00.800 --> 26:04.720
 I call them and I said, I got on these shows.

26:04.720 --> 26:08.240
 Is there money in the budget for travel?

26:08.240 --> 26:10.920
 And they say, we don't have that budget.

26:10.920 --> 26:11.920
 Fine.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.800
 By the way, you got on those shows with no help from them.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.800
 Correct.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.200
 Oh yeah, that's not even a question.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.000
 The reason they would want you to do a book is because they know you could get...

26:20.000 --> 26:24.380
 The only reason people get book deals nowadays, literally, is because they know that person

26:24.380 --> 26:25.620
 can market their own book.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.320
 That's the only way.

26:27.320 --> 26:31.400
 And I got on Ruben, I got on Rogan, and they go and have the money for the budget for travel,

26:31.400 --> 26:32.480
 which is fair.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.920
 They can do Skype.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.500
 They told me this in writing.

26:36.500 --> 26:38.240
 And I'm like, okay.

26:38.240 --> 26:40.440
 And they can financially cover Skype.

26:40.440 --> 26:46.840
 No, but it's like, hey Joe, yeah, we don't have the budget, but you're going to do Skype.

26:46.840 --> 26:47.840
 Hello?

26:47.840 --> 26:48.840
 Hello?

26:48.840 --> 26:57.240
 There is, another friend of mine was on a show on CNBC with Nassim Taleb, and they said

26:57.240 --> 26:59.840
 Nassim wants a copy of the book.

26:59.840 --> 27:04.600
 And they're like, oh yeah, it's like four o clock on Friday, so we're closed.

27:04.600 --> 27:10.840
 So, and he's like, he went there, picked it up, and walked it the two blocks.

27:10.840 --> 27:17.280
 So there is, it's almost cartoonish, and it's not incompetence.

27:17.280 --> 27:20.160
 It's past that.

27:20.160 --> 27:25.480
 It's something almost, you can't really believe that, I've had two friends who have been literally

27:25.480 --> 27:31.080
 rendered suicidal because this was such a huge opportunity for them.

27:31.080 --> 27:34.440
 And it was like watching their kid get beaten in front of them, and I had to talk them off

27:34.440 --> 27:35.440
 the ledge.

27:35.440 --> 27:39.280
 So it's, people do not appreciate how bad, here's another example.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.960
 The apathy of bureaucracy, something like that.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.560
 I did this book, Concierge Confidential.

27:44.560 --> 27:50.120
 There's a typo in the first chapter, it ends with, I'm about to, TOO, they didn't fix it

27:50.120 --> 27:51.120
 for the paperback.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.040
 Who cares?

27:53.040 --> 27:58.360
 It's just like, well, okay, yeah, great book by the way, it got, NPR gave it one of the

27:58.360 --> 28:00.720
 books of the year, so that was good.

28:00.720 --> 28:03.520
 So why participate in this?

28:03.520 --> 28:07.560
 Because otherwise, New York Times is going to pretend you don't exist.

28:07.560 --> 28:10.920
 Getting booked on some shows might be more difficult.

28:10.920 --> 28:15.920
 Although I think that's collapsing in real time.

28:15.920 --> 28:21.340
 You're not going to get reviewed necessarily on places like PW, or some others.

28:21.340 --> 28:24.600
 So the new book you're working on, do you have a title yet?

28:24.600 --> 28:25.600
 The White Pill.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.560
 The White Pill.

28:28.560 --> 28:29.720
 Are you self publishing that?

28:29.720 --> 28:31.120
 Oh yeah, for sure.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.100
 And what's the thinking behind that?

28:33.100 --> 28:36.880
 Just because you already have a huge following and a big platform and...

28:36.880 --> 28:38.320
 It's six times the cash.

28:38.320 --> 28:43.720
 If I finish the book in December, I could have it out in February.

28:43.720 --> 28:48.000
 If I finish the book in December with the publisher, it's going to be out in December

28:48.000 --> 28:50.320
 at the earliest, 2021.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.200
 Why am I giving up 10 months of my life?

28:52.200 --> 28:53.200
 Well, this is the big one.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.080
 Do you have any leverage?

28:55.080 --> 28:58.800
 Like do authors have leverage to say, F you?

28:58.800 --> 29:02.000
 Can you just say, what do you mean?

29:02.000 --> 29:06.360
 Meaning like, I want to release this book in two months.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.360
 Oh no, no.

29:07.360 --> 29:11.000
 I mean, you'll have a contract and then your agent can fight it, but they don't have the

29:11.000 --> 29:13.680
 capacity to rush things through.

29:13.680 --> 29:14.680
 Yeah.

29:14.680 --> 29:19.720
 I guess if the, cause I've heard like big authors, I don't know, Sam Harris, all those

29:19.720 --> 29:23.720
 folks talk about like, they've accepted it actually.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.720
 They've accepted it.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.000
 They're like, yeah, it takes a long time to...

29:26.000 --> 29:28.200
 I'm not accepting it.

29:28.200 --> 29:33.800
 But you're kind of implying that a human being like me should, like...

29:33.800 --> 29:35.880
 I'm saying these are your options.

29:35.880 --> 29:36.880
 Right.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.600
 So I just, I just hate it.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.700
 I hate the waiting because it's incompetence.

29:41.700 --> 29:44.640
 It's not the, it's not necessarily the wait.

29:44.640 --> 29:51.640
 If I knew it wasn't, you know, if it was the kind of people that are up at 2 a.m. at night

29:51.640 --> 29:56.960
 on a Friday and they love what you're doing and they're helping create something special.

29:56.960 --> 30:01.800
 That's the sense I get with some of the Netflix folks, for example, that work with people.

30:01.800 --> 30:07.200
 I just, I don't know anything about this world, but you get like Netflix folks who, who help

30:07.200 --> 30:08.680
 with shows.

30:08.680 --> 30:10.840
 You could tell that they're obsessed with those shows.

30:10.840 --> 30:11.840
 Yeah.

30:11.840 --> 30:12.840
 Oh yeah.

30:12.840 --> 30:13.840
 You're not going to get that publishing.

30:13.840 --> 30:17.160
 If you hand, like I handed the book in, I think it was July, I didn't hear anything from

30:17.160 --> 30:19.360
 my editor until December.

30:19.360 --> 30:27.720
 Well, can we actually talk about the suffering, the darkest parts of writing a book?

30:27.720 --> 30:33.800
 So the, let's go to the full Michael Malice, Stephen King mode of what are the darkest

30:33.800 --> 30:38.480
 moments of writing this book and what is it maybe start, the white pill?

30:38.480 --> 30:39.480
 What's the idea?

30:39.480 --> 30:43.320
 What's the hope and what are your darkest moments around writing this book?

30:43.320 --> 30:48.600
 So people are familiar with the red pill and the blue pill, the red, they're from the Matrix.

30:48.600 --> 30:53.940
 The red pill is the idea that what is presented as fact by the corporate press entertainment

30:53.940 --> 30:58.140
 industry is in fact a carefully constructed narrative designed to keep some very unpleasant

30:58.140 --> 31:01.640
 people in power and everyone else under control.

31:01.640 --> 31:06.080
 And I guess one of my expressions is you take one red pill, not the whole bottle because

31:06.080 --> 31:10.520
 at a certain point you think everything's lie and then you're kind of no capacity for

31:10.520 --> 31:11.720
 distinguishing truths.

31:11.720 --> 31:12.960
 You're full of good one liners.

31:12.960 --> 31:13.960
 Well, thank you.

31:13.960 --> 31:14.960
 Yeah.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.160
 I'm full of something that's for sure.

31:17.160 --> 31:26.480
 And what I saw in this space is a lot of these red pill people got very disheartened and

31:26.480 --> 31:27.480
 cynical.

31:27.480 --> 31:33.440
 And one of my big heroes is Albert Camus and he said the worst thing is cynicism.

31:33.440 --> 31:38.840
 And that's something called the black pill, which is the idea that, you know, it's all,

31:38.840 --> 31:41.300
 it's just we're waiting for the end.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.920
 It's hopeless.

31:42.920 --> 31:47.100
 And I don't see it that way at all.

31:47.100 --> 31:51.040
 And I'm like, all right, I have to address this.

31:51.040 --> 31:55.120
 And not just with some kind of cheerleading, everything's going to be great guys.

31:55.120 --> 31:58.880
 Here is why I am positive.

31:58.880 --> 32:03.620
 And not that I'm positive the good guys are going to win, but I'm positive that good guys

32:03.620 --> 32:05.460
 can win.

32:05.460 --> 32:07.040
 And that's all you need.

32:07.040 --> 32:13.400
 Because if your God forbid kid is kidnapped and there's a 10% chance that you can save

32:13.400 --> 32:17.960
 them, you're not going to be like, well, I don't like those odds.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.360
 This is your country.

32:19.360 --> 32:20.400
 This is your values.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.400
 This is your family.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.640
 And I think it's much more than 10%.

32:24.640 --> 32:30.280
 And even if you lose, you will take pride in that you did everything in your power to

32:30.280 --> 32:31.280
 win.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.280
 So.

32:32.280 --> 32:35.080
 Is there a good definition of good guys?

32:35.080 --> 32:36.080
 In the sense that.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.520
 The ones who wear white.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.000
 There's layers to this.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.340
 You're like modern day Shakespeare.

32:43.340 --> 32:53.000
 Is there a danger in thinking Adolf Hitler was probably pretty confident that he led

32:53.000 --> 32:54.280
 a group of good guys?

32:54.280 --> 32:58.520
 Listen, if Hitler did anything wrong, why isn't he in jail?

32:58.520 --> 33:01.600
 My Czech friend thought of that joke.

33:01.600 --> 33:08.960
 He actually says in his accent, he goes, if Hitler's so bad, why isn't he in the jail?

33:08.960 --> 33:09.960
 That's a good point.

33:09.960 --> 33:10.960
 He's probably still alive.

33:10.960 --> 33:11.960
 Right?

33:11.960 --> 33:12.960
 And look, yeah.

33:12.960 --> 33:13.960
 Hopefully.

33:13.960 --> 33:14.960
 Oh boy.

33:14.960 --> 33:21.960
 Two of the three people listening to this are very upset right now.

33:21.960 --> 33:22.960
 What were you even talking about?

33:22.960 --> 33:26.160
 Oh, how do you, how do you know the, what is good?

33:26.160 --> 33:32.400
 There's lots of standards of good, but if you're for me to be a good guy is if you want

33:32.400 --> 33:36.920
 to leave the world a little bit better than you found it, that to me is the definition

33:36.920 --> 33:38.600
 of a good guy.

33:38.600 --> 33:43.800
 And I think there are many people that that's not their motivation at all.

33:43.800 --> 33:44.800
 It's about your motivation.

33:44.800 --> 33:50.900
 Well, it's also about if your motivation is at all correlated to reality.

33:50.900 --> 33:52.440
 No one thinks we're the bad guys.

33:52.440 --> 33:53.620
 That's correct.

33:53.620 --> 34:00.600
 But are you taking steps to check your motivations and also take a certain amount of humility

34:00.600 --> 34:05.200
 because if you're going to start interfering with other people's lives, you really better

34:05.200 --> 34:08.560
 be sure you know what you're talking about.

34:08.560 --> 34:15.440
 The control of others, if you do have centralized control or then you kind of, you become a

34:15.440 --> 34:21.620
 leader of a group, you better know, you better do so humbly and cautiously.

34:21.620 --> 34:25.240
 And also have steam valves, right?

34:25.240 --> 34:30.040
 So if in case things go wrong, let's have, I'm sure this is a lot happening with AI,

34:30.040 --> 34:34.120
 whatever work with computers, like, okay, if something goes wrong here, how do we have

34:34.120 --> 34:37.440
 a workaround to make sure it doesn't cause everything to collapse?

34:37.440 --> 34:38.440
 Yeah.

34:38.440 --> 34:39.440
 The going wrong thing.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.960
 I mean, the whole, the feedback mechanism.

34:41.960 --> 34:42.960
 Yeah.

34:42.960 --> 34:50.120
 Like, I wonder if people in Congress think that things are really wrong.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.120
 It's working for them.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.120
 Are you sure?

34:52.120 --> 34:54.760
 No, I'm not sure.

34:54.760 --> 35:02.640
 Because I'd like to believe that the people that at least when they got into politics

35:02.640 --> 35:08.520
 actually wanted, some of it is ego, but some of it is like wanting to be the kind of person

35:08.520 --> 35:10.080
 that builds a better world.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.080
 Sure.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.080
 I also think it's diverse.

35:12.080 --> 35:15.720
 Some of who are going to have different motivations than others.

35:15.720 --> 35:21.760
 But like once you're in the system and trying to build a better world, how do you know that's

35:21.760 --> 35:22.760
 not working?

35:22.760 --> 35:30.200
 Like, how do you take the basic feedback mechanisms and like, and actually productively change?

35:30.200 --> 35:34.200
 I mean, that's what it means to be a good guy is like, hmm, something is wrong here.

35:34.200 --> 35:39.400
 And that's why I like the Elon Musk, like think from first principles, like, wait, wait,

35:39.400 --> 35:40.400
 wait.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.400
 Okay.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.400
 Let's ask the big question.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.200
 Like, can this be, one, is this working at all?

35:45.200 --> 35:48.880
 Like the way we're solving this particular problem of government, is this working at

35:48.880 --> 35:49.880
 all?

35:49.880 --> 35:54.960
 And then like stepping away and saying like, as opposed to modifying this bill or that

35:54.960 --> 36:00.040
 bill or like this little strategy, like increase the tax by this much or decrease the tax by

36:00.040 --> 36:06.000
 this much, like, why do we have a democracy at all?

36:06.000 --> 36:11.200
 Or why do we have any kind of representative democracy?

36:11.200 --> 36:13.320
 Shouldn't it be a pure democracy?

36:13.320 --> 36:20.600
 Or why do we have states, like representation of states and federal government and so on?

36:20.600 --> 36:23.040
 Why do we have this kind of separation of powers?

36:23.040 --> 36:24.040
 Is this different?

36:24.040 --> 36:28.560
 Why don't we have term limits or not like big things?

36:28.560 --> 36:31.400
 Like how do you actually make that happen?

36:31.400 --> 36:33.640
 And is that what it means to be a good guy?

36:33.640 --> 36:39.720
 It's like taking big revolutionary steps as opposed to incremental steps.

36:39.720 --> 36:43.020
 Well, I don't know that you could be a politician to be a good guy, to be honest.

36:43.020 --> 36:47.200
 And let me give you a counter example of someone who you could tell is not being a good guy.

36:47.200 --> 36:50.360
 Joe Biden said he regards the Iraq wars a mistake.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.360
 Okay.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.120
 You and I have made mistakes in our lives, I'm sure.

36:53.120 --> 36:56.860
 None of our mistakes have caused tens of thousands of people to die.

36:56.860 --> 37:08.400
 If I were a chef, let's take it out of politics.

37:08.400 --> 37:13.240
 And in my restaurant, somehow, accidentally, someone ate something and they died.

37:13.240 --> 37:15.880
 A, I would feel horrible.

37:15.880 --> 37:21.000
 But more importantly, I would be like, we need to look through the system and figure

37:21.000 --> 37:24.460
 out how it got to the point where someone lost their life.

37:24.460 --> 37:26.300
 Because that can never happen again.

37:26.300 --> 37:28.920
 And we need to figure out step by step.

37:28.920 --> 37:34.680
 I'm not a gun person, but there's like this checklist of like, if you're holding a gun,

37:34.680 --> 37:35.680
 there's five things to do.

37:35.680 --> 37:40.920
 And if you get too wrong, it's like assume every gun is loaded, only pointed at something

37:40.920 --> 37:42.560
 that you want to kill.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.040
 And there's like three other things.

37:44.040 --> 37:48.140
 And it's like to make sure that nothing goes wrong.

37:48.140 --> 37:55.800
 So if I'm that chef, and I would have to not only feel guilt, but take preventative action

37:55.800 --> 38:00.640
 to make sure this has no possibility of happening again.

38:00.640 --> 38:05.400
 If you look at the staff he's putting in, it's the same warmongers that would have advised

38:05.400 --> 38:09.900
 him to get into the Iraq war on the first time.

38:09.900 --> 38:12.560
 That is to me is not a good guy.

38:12.560 --> 38:17.160
 That to me is someone who does not feel remorse for their responsibility in killing not only

38:17.160 --> 38:22.200
 many Americans, but some of us think that, you know, dead Iraqis isn't necessarily ideal

38:22.200 --> 38:23.200
 either.

38:23.200 --> 38:27.200
 Okay, let's talk a bit about war.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.600
 Maybe you can also correct me on something.

38:29.600 --> 38:37.160
 The first time I found myself into Barack Obama was, I don't know how many years ago

38:37.160 --> 38:44.520
 this was, but when I maybe heard a speech of his about him speaking out against the

38:44.520 --> 38:45.520
 war.

38:45.520 --> 38:46.520
 Yeah.

38:46.520 --> 38:52.680
 And him, I think it's on record saying he was against the war before it was happening.

38:52.680 --> 38:55.600
 But he wasn't in Senate at the time, so it was very easy for him to say this.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.920
 But see, like people say that, people say that.

38:58.920 --> 39:04.080
 People say like it was easy and it was some people say it's like strategically the wise

39:04.080 --> 39:07.480
 thing to do given some kind of calculus, whatever.

39:07.480 --> 39:13.640
 But I, to this day give him, that's the reason I've always given him props in my mind.

39:13.640 --> 39:19.800
 Like this is a man of character, like he makes, I also personally really value great speeches.

39:19.800 --> 39:23.480
 I think speeches are really important for leaders because they inspire the world.

39:23.480 --> 39:29.840
 It's like one of the most best things you can contribute to the world is great, like

39:29.840 --> 39:34.800
 through intellect, mold ideas in a way that's communicable to like a huge number of people.

39:34.800 --> 39:37.920
 Yeah, it's better to persuade than to force in every instance.

39:37.920 --> 39:42.400
 That's where I disagree with Chomsky said, like if you're, Chomsky's whole idea was that

39:42.400 --> 39:48.240
 like if you're really eloquent speaker, that means your ideas aren't that good.

39:48.240 --> 39:49.240
 That's nonsense.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.240
 Yeah.

39:50.240 --> 39:54.800
 So I think that's a way for him to describe like I speak in a very boring way.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.800
 Maybe that's a pitch for this podcast.

39:56.800 --> 40:02.560
 I speak boring so that the ideas are the things you value and it's also useful to go to sleep.

40:02.560 --> 40:09.800
 But that's why I really liked Obama throughout his life and still do.

40:09.800 --> 40:14.360
 But when I first like saw this is for some reason you can disagree, I thought he's a

40:14.360 --> 40:15.360
 man of character.

40:15.360 --> 40:21.720
 It's when most politicians, most people who are trying to calculate and rise in power,

40:21.720 --> 40:25.600
 I think were for the war or too afraid to be against the war.

40:25.600 --> 40:33.320
 That's why I liked Bernie Sanders and that's why I liked like in the early days Obama for

40:33.320 --> 40:37.200
 speaking out against the war and not like in this weird activist way.

40:37.200 --> 40:44.400
 Not weird, but not saying I'm an activist, but like just saying the common sense thing

40:44.400 --> 40:50.160
 and being brave enough to say the common sense thing without like having a big sign and saying

40:50.160 --> 40:55.200
 I'm going to be the antiwar candidate or something like that, but just saying this is not a good

40:55.200 --> 40:56.200
 idea.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.200
 Yeah.

40:57.200 --> 41:01.960
 And I think it's for those of us who are old enough to remember, it's pretty despicable

41:01.960 --> 41:04.400
 what happened with Tulsi in 2020.

41:04.400 --> 41:09.360
 She was the biggest antiwar candidate and she was marginalized within her own party,

41:09.360 --> 41:10.560
 which I guess you can make sense.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.780
 She's just a congresswoman from Hawaii.

41:12.780 --> 41:18.640
 But the corporate press did everything in their power to diminish her and pretend she

41:18.640 --> 41:19.640
 didn't exist.

41:19.640 --> 41:26.200
 And for those of us who remember where 12 years prior, when George W. Bush had the Republican

41:26.200 --> 41:30.060
 National Convention in New York and it was the biggest protest in history and the Iraq

41:30.060 --> 41:37.440
 war led to democratic landslides in 2006 and 2008, to have that completely not part of

41:37.440 --> 41:43.000
 the Democratic Party in 2020 is both shocking and reprehensible.

41:43.000 --> 41:54.600
 Hey, Michael, you don't have to say, hey, Michael, you just say knock, knock, okay.

41:54.600 --> 41:57.960
 What did the volcano say to his true love?

41:57.960 --> 41:59.160
 What?

41:59.160 --> 42:05.920
 I love you.

42:05.920 --> 42:09.000
 These jokes are better when you know how to speak English.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.480
 It was actually in Russian, I did Google translate, okay.

42:13.480 --> 42:18.520
 Back to your book, In the Suffering, you somehow turned it positive.

42:18.520 --> 42:24.160
 And as one who's wearing, who's the representative of the black pill in this conversation, what

42:24.160 --> 42:25.680
 are some of the darker moments?

42:25.680 --> 42:30.960
 What are some of the hardest challenges of putting together this book, the white pill?

42:30.960 --> 42:32.820
 Content, content, content.

42:32.820 --> 42:41.240
 So if I'm having a page in about Reagan taking on Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential primaries,

42:41.240 --> 42:43.680
 I'm going to have to read like 20.

42:43.680 --> 42:48.600
 So it's the thing like if there'll be some times I'll remember some quote somewhere and

42:48.600 --> 42:53.760
 then I have to spend an hour trying to find it because I want it to be as dense with information

42:53.760 --> 42:54.760
 as possible.

42:54.760 --> 43:01.840
 Like how do you structure the main philosophical ideas you want to convey?

43:01.840 --> 43:03.080
 Is that already planned out?

43:03.080 --> 43:06.700
 No, the book changed entirely from its conception.

43:06.700 --> 43:11.880
 So my buddy Ryan Holiday had a series of books, still does, where he takes the ideas of the

43:11.880 --> 43:16.080
 Stoics and he applies them to contemporary terms.

43:16.080 --> 43:18.820
 He has this whole cottage industry that he's doing very well with.

43:18.820 --> 43:22.760
 And I'd asked him years ago if I could do that with Camus and he's like, sure, go for

43:22.760 --> 43:23.760
 it.

43:23.760 --> 43:27.920
 And I was going to rework Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus.

43:27.920 --> 43:32.920
 And I read it recently, reread it, and this wasn't the book I remembered at all.

43:32.920 --> 43:35.920
 And I'm like, okay, I'm going to write the book that I remembered.

43:35.920 --> 43:41.240
 But the more I was writing it, one of the things I always yell at conservatives about,

43:41.240 --> 43:47.560
 there's a long list, is they don't talk about the great victory of conservatism, which was

43:47.560 --> 43:51.000
 the winning of the Cold War without firing a shot.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.680
 And I said, you can't expect the New York Times to tell this story because the blood

43:53.680 --> 43:55.720
 is on their hands.

43:55.720 --> 44:01.520
 And I'm like, well, Michael, instead of complaining about it, why don't you do it?

44:01.520 --> 44:02.520
 Why don't you talk?

44:02.520 --> 44:06.000
 That is a great example of the good guys winning over the bad guys.

44:06.000 --> 44:11.240
 And that's become, A, the victory is beautiful.

44:11.240 --> 44:13.880
 But also pointing out to people, when people are like, oh, things are worse than they've

44:13.880 --> 44:20.800
 ever been, they don't appreciate how bad things were in the 30s, what Stalin was doing overseas

44:20.800 --> 44:24.960
 and how people in the West were advocating to bring that here.

44:24.960 --> 44:31.080
 So that's kind of pointing out how bad things were and how good they became.

44:31.080 --> 44:37.200
 And you don't have to be a Republican or conservative to be delighted at the collapse of totalitarianism

44:37.200 --> 44:39.220
 and the peaceful liberation of half the world.

44:39.220 --> 44:40.720
 So that's a picture of the good guys winning.

44:40.720 --> 44:41.720
 Oh, yeah.

44:41.720 --> 44:49.520
 Well, how does that connect to Sisyphus and maybe to speak deeper to life and whatever

44:49.520 --> 44:55.480
 the hell this thing is, which is what I remember the myth of Sisyphus being about.

44:55.480 --> 45:02.480
 So where does the threat of Camus sort of lie in the work that you're doing?

45:02.480 --> 45:09.280
 So the myth of Sisyphus, which I had remembered incorrectly, is actually just a five to seven

45:09.280 --> 45:12.800
 page coda to the whole book at the very end.

45:12.800 --> 45:15.380
 You only need to read that little essay called The Myth of Sisyphus.

45:15.380 --> 45:21.620
 The broader work is about Camus's concept of the absurd and the absurd man within literature.

45:21.620 --> 45:24.760
 And it's just like, I don't really care about the character in Dostoevsky and all this other

45:24.760 --> 45:25.760
 stuff that you're talking about.

45:25.760 --> 45:27.360
 It's of no relevance.

45:27.360 --> 45:33.200
 But the myth of Sisyphus, the myth itself, not the book or the essay of his, is this

45:33.200 --> 45:39.880
 Greek character and Sisyphus is forced in hell to roll a rock up a hill for eternity.

45:39.880 --> 45:42.800
 At the very last moment, the rock falls away.

45:42.800 --> 45:48.720
 And Camus's takeaway from the story is that we must imagine Sisyphus happy.

45:48.720 --> 45:54.440
 And there's several interpretations of this, but one is once you accept that you are living

45:54.440 --> 46:02.560
 an absurdist existence, once you own your reality, it loses its bite.

46:02.560 --> 46:06.960
 And you can start with that as your kind of baseline.

46:06.960 --> 46:09.920
 And bite is suffering.

46:09.920 --> 46:11.320
 And hopelessness.

46:11.320 --> 46:19.580
 So I think when people look at how much ridiculousness is happening in America and it's escalating,

46:19.580 --> 46:23.680
 you can either think, oh, all is lost.

46:23.680 --> 46:25.560
 And I think you and I have lived our lives like this.

46:25.560 --> 46:30.460
 You can live life more like a surfer, whereas you're never going to control the ocean.

46:30.460 --> 46:33.500
 But you can sure enjoy that ride and stop.

46:33.500 --> 46:36.920
 If you're trying to control the waves, yeah, you're done.

46:36.920 --> 46:41.460
 But if you're like, all right, I've got my board, I'm going to see where this takes me.

46:41.460 --> 46:44.340
 Surfing from what I understand is a pretty fun activity.

46:44.340 --> 46:48.360
 And also sometimes dangerous, but you'd have to ask Tulsi about that.

46:48.360 --> 46:58.920
 So we were offline talking about Stalin and the evils of the Soviet regime.

46:58.920 --> 47:05.600
 One of the things I mentioned, I watched the movie, Mr. Jones, but it's about the 1930s,

47:05.600 --> 47:13.320
 all the more the, what would you say, the torture of the Ukrainian people by Stalin.

47:13.320 --> 47:18.400
 One interesting thing to me that I'd love to hear your opinion about is the role of

47:18.400 --> 47:25.680
 journalism in all of this and also about 1930s Germany.

47:25.680 --> 47:34.520
 So what's the role of journalists and intellectuals in a time when trouble is brewing.

47:34.520 --> 47:41.760
 But it requires a really sort of brave and deep thinking to understand that trouble is

47:41.760 --> 47:42.760
 brewing.

47:42.760 --> 47:47.760
 Like if you were a journalist or if you were just like an intellectual, a thinker, but

47:47.760 --> 47:56.640
 also a voice in the space of public discourse, what would you do in 1930s about Stalin, about

47:56.640 --> 48:03.520
 how the more, and what would you do about Nazi Germany in 1937, 1938?

48:03.520 --> 48:07.760
 So that's really funny that you asked that because currently how the book is structured,

48:07.760 --> 48:11.080
 it's like books often follow a three act structure, right?

48:11.080 --> 48:17.000
 So act three is the 80s, act one is the 30s, and act two is going to be like, all right,

48:17.000 --> 48:19.040
 let's suppose you were in the 30s.

48:19.040 --> 48:20.420
 Are you just going to give up?

48:20.420 --> 48:22.520
 Are you just going to be like, well, we're screwed?

48:22.520 --> 48:25.760
 And you'd be right to say things are going to be very bad for a long time.

48:25.760 --> 48:29.680
 Or are you going to be one of those few who are like, we're going to do something about

48:29.680 --> 48:32.320
 this and we're going to go down swinging.

48:32.320 --> 48:37.880
 There are two books I can recommend, which are just masterpieces that are written by

48:37.880 --> 48:41.240
 women that just are historians that are just superb.

48:41.240 --> 48:43.520
 There's a book called Beyond Belief by Deborah Lipschdott.

48:43.520 --> 48:47.880
 She talks about the rise of Nazi Germany as seen through the press.

48:47.880 --> 48:52.080
 And what was amazing, and she does a great job empathizing with the press and understand

48:52.080 --> 48:56.960
 their perspective, is we remember, and Chamberlain gets a bad rap, Neville Chamberlain for kind

48:56.960 --> 49:01.200
 of appeasing Hitler, because not that long ago they had the Great War, they had World

49:01.200 --> 49:06.920
 War I, and they had the carnage that the earth had never seen before.

49:06.920 --> 49:11.120
 And when you had people made out of meat, meeting industrial machines, and plastic surgery

49:11.120 --> 49:14.720
 was invented as a consequence of this, they're coming back mangled and disfigured.

49:14.720 --> 49:16.120
 And for what?

49:16.120 --> 49:20.800
 And this was a world where the Kaiser was the most evil person ever lived.

49:20.800 --> 49:25.740
 And we all had the Western propaganda about the Hun and all the rapes and all this barbarism

49:25.740 --> 49:27.340
 and blah, blah, blah.

49:27.340 --> 49:33.800
 So not that long later, when you're hearing all this propaganda, which was factual, about

49:33.800 --> 49:37.960
 Hitler, it's like, we heard this, we heard this 20 years ago.

49:37.960 --> 49:39.840
 This was all lies.

49:39.840 --> 49:42.160
 Give us a break.

49:42.160 --> 49:47.680
 And she has all the quotes from the different agencies and how they addressed it.

49:47.680 --> 49:49.240
 Plus they had very limited information.

49:49.240 --> 49:53.840
 It's not like Nazi Germany was an open society where reporters can walk around and they were

49:53.840 --> 49:56.800
 under a lot of pressure as well in those areas.

49:56.800 --> 50:02.440
 And Hitler himself was pretty good at, he let some stuff slip, but usually he made it

50:02.440 --> 50:04.680
 seem like he wants peace.

50:04.680 --> 50:05.680
 He wants world peace.

50:05.680 --> 50:06.680
 This was amazing.

50:06.680 --> 50:10.280
 They were making the argument that because all these Jews were being beaten up on the

50:10.280 --> 50:16.520
 street, this proved, this was the hot take of the day, that Hitler was weak because since

50:16.520 --> 50:21.480
 Hitler's a statesman and he can't control these hooligans, that shows his control and

50:21.480 --> 50:24.380
 power is tenuous and this is all going to go away.

50:24.380 --> 50:26.960
 By the way, Hitler thought that too.

50:26.960 --> 50:31.680
 He was kind of afraid of the branchers, whatever, he was afraid of these hooligans a little

50:31.680 --> 50:32.680
 bit.

50:32.680 --> 50:38.020
 They were useful to him, but at a certain point, yeah, they can get in the way.

50:38.020 --> 50:42.160
 That's why he wanted to get control of the military, the army, their regiment.

50:42.160 --> 50:45.240
 If you want to take over the world, you can't do it with hooligans.

50:45.240 --> 50:47.200
 You have to do it with an actual army.

50:47.200 --> 50:52.000
 And then you had Kristallnacht, which was a nationwide pogrom, and then all the news

50:52.000 --> 50:59.240
 agencies universally were like, oh, crap, we got this wrong, and the condemnation was universal.

50:59.240 --> 51:05.520
 So that book traces the West's reaction to what's going on there and including the reaction

51:05.520 --> 51:11.760
 to the insipid Holocaust as people being, you know, what they knew, when did they know.

51:11.760 --> 51:14.740
 There was not ambiguity about people.

51:14.740 --> 51:20.680
 I think there's this myth that she dispels that they didn't know the Holocaust was happening

51:20.680 --> 51:22.080
 or they didn't care.

51:22.080 --> 51:26.080
 They were aware, but they were already at war with Nazi Germany, like what literally

51:26.080 --> 51:31.540
 what else could they do at that point, you know, to rescue all these Jews.

51:31.540 --> 51:33.140
 So that's a superb book.

51:33.140 --> 51:38.600
 And Ann Applebaum, I think the book is called Red Famine, came out fairly recently.

51:38.600 --> 51:41.840
 And she brings the receipts.

51:41.840 --> 51:46.680
 And she's a, you know, this is something I really hate with the binary thinkers, where

51:46.680 --> 51:49.880
 the people think, oh, you know, if you're a Democrat, you're basically a communist,

51:49.880 --> 51:51.240
 they call Joe Biden a Marxist.

51:51.240 --> 51:54.880
 It's just like, you know, she's a hard lefty, she's, you know, has TDS.

51:54.880 --> 51:59.400
 But this book just systemically lays out what Stalin did.

51:59.400 --> 52:01.840
 By the way, I'm triggered by the binary thinkers.

52:01.840 --> 52:07.120
 And for those who don't know, TDS 0011 is a trauma derangement syndrome.

52:07.120 --> 52:08.120
 Yes.

52:08.120 --> 52:12.800
 So they, you know, forced the starvation in this entire population.

52:12.800 --> 52:19.720
 And it's not only that, it's like they knew if you weren't starving by looking at you,

52:19.720 --> 52:21.560
 you were hiding food.

52:21.560 --> 52:26.160
 So they'd come back to your house at night and break your fingers in the door, or take,

52:26.160 --> 52:27.160
 burn down your house.

52:27.160 --> 52:30.480
 And now you're on the street without food because you lied, because this is the people's

52:30.480 --> 52:31.480
 food.

52:31.480 --> 52:32.480
 You're a kulak, you're a landowner.

52:32.480 --> 52:35.960
 And very quickly, a kulak, which meant like peasant landowner, became anyone who had a

52:35.960 --> 52:37.840
 piece of bread.

52:37.840 --> 52:40.720
 And this was systemic and ongoing.

52:40.720 --> 52:45.320
 And many people in the press did not believe it.

52:45.320 --> 52:50.520
 There was a British journalist, I believe, who got out of the train, Ukraine, like one

52:50.520 --> 52:53.640
 town earlier and walked and he described all this.

52:53.640 --> 52:55.840
 And he was mocked and derided.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.280
 And this is just anti Russian propaganda.

52:58.280 --> 53:02.160
 Because at the time, in the 30s, this was socialism had come to fruition.

53:02.160 --> 53:03.560
 This was a noble experiment.

53:03.560 --> 53:08.340
 I'd seen the future and it works, as I think Sidney Webb was the guy who said that.

53:08.340 --> 53:12.080
 And the premise was, let's see what happens.

53:12.080 --> 53:13.800
 We've never tried something like that.

53:13.800 --> 53:18.640
 And they were perfectly happy to have this experiment happen overseas at the price of

53:18.640 --> 53:20.160
 the Russian people.

53:20.160 --> 53:23.520
 Because it's like, you know what, maybe this will be paradise on earth.

53:23.520 --> 53:26.780
 And I address this in my book as well.

53:26.780 --> 53:30.200
 This superb essay, I think, by Eugene Genovese.

53:30.200 --> 53:32.080
 And he talks about the question.

53:32.080 --> 53:34.920
 The question being, what did you know?

53:34.920 --> 53:36.360
 And when did you know it?

53:36.360 --> 53:38.200
 What did you know about the concentration camps?

53:38.200 --> 53:39.200
 What did you know about the starvation?

53:39.200 --> 53:43.640
 What did you know about children being taught at school to turn in their parents for having

53:43.640 --> 53:45.240
 some extra bread?

53:45.240 --> 53:47.600
 And his conclusion is, we all knew.

53:47.600 --> 53:49.840
 And we all knew from the beginning, every bit of it.

53:49.840 --> 53:51.320
 And we didn't care.

53:51.320 --> 53:54.240
 Because we were more interested in promoting this ideology.

53:54.240 --> 54:00.160
 So when people are kind of thinking the worst thing on earth is like Robert E. Lee statue

54:00.160 --> 54:02.640
 being taken down to Washington, DC.

54:02.640 --> 54:09.400
 We were being told, and especially in a much more limited news information world where

54:09.400 --> 54:14.080
 now you have literally anyone can have a Twitter, but how many outlets were there, that this

54:14.080 --> 54:18.260
 is, we're backwards, they're the future, they're scientific.

54:18.260 --> 54:21.560
 We have the vagaries of the market, which led to the Great Depression.

54:21.560 --> 54:26.520
 And when you see what was being put over on the American public at the time, anyone who

54:26.520 --> 54:31.680
 thinks things are as bad now as they've ever been is simply delusional or ignorant.

54:31.680 --> 54:38.300
 Yeah, I would say just as a small aside, that's why reading, as I'm almost done with The Rise

54:38.300 --> 54:47.360
 and Fall of the Third Reich, it's a refreshes the, resets the palette of your understanding

54:47.360 --> 54:54.600
 what is good and evil in the world that I think is really useful now.

54:54.600 --> 55:01.960
 What helps me be really positive and almost naive on Twitter and in the world is by just

55:01.960 --> 55:10.520
 studying history and comparing it to how amazing things are today.

55:10.520 --> 55:18.040
 But in that time, what would you do?

55:18.040 --> 55:21.320
 What does a brave mind do?

55:21.320 --> 55:30.200
 And not just acts of bravery, but how do you be effective in that?

55:30.200 --> 55:31.760
 That's something I often think about.

55:31.760 --> 55:37.400
 It's easy to be an activist in terms of just saying stuff.

55:37.400 --> 55:40.440
 It's hard to be effective at your activism.

55:40.440 --> 55:44.920
 One of the big questions historians have constantly is how did this happen?

55:44.920 --> 55:48.080
 A, to make sure it doesn't happen again, but this is Germany.

55:48.080 --> 55:51.600
 This is not some kind of weirdo cult nation.

55:51.600 --> 55:55.740
 They're very advanced, very in the land of poets and philosophers.

55:55.740 --> 56:00.900
 How did it get to that point that they're just shooting children and everyone's cheering

56:00.900 --> 56:02.640
 for this?

56:02.640 --> 56:04.640
 Specifically on the anti Semitism and the Holocaust.

56:04.640 --> 56:09.240
 But just the totalitarianism, the cult of Hitler and just this whole kind of thing.

56:09.240 --> 56:11.680
 This is starting to drop, but there's two sides.

56:11.680 --> 56:13.200
 I don't know if you want to separate them.

56:13.200 --> 56:18.760
 One is the totalitarianism and the entirety of the Nazi regime.

56:18.760 --> 56:29.400
 And then there's the Holocaust, which is going, I would say, very specifically, as I think

56:29.400 --> 56:34.720
 you're about to describe, is targeting Jews very much so.

56:34.720 --> 56:36.680
 I don't know if you see those as two separate things.

56:36.680 --> 56:38.000
 I think they're very interconnected.

56:38.000 --> 56:45.040
 But I think if you look at it, everyone thinks that they'd be the ones putting up Anne Frank.

56:45.040 --> 56:49.320
 But if you look at the numbers, they'd be the ones calling the Stasi on her or whoever

56:49.320 --> 56:53.440
 the people were at the time, and not the Stasi, obviously, and patting themselves on the back

56:53.440 --> 56:54.440
 for it.

56:54.440 --> 56:55.440
 So sorry to pause on that.

56:55.440 --> 56:57.120
 That's a really important thing.

56:57.120 --> 57:05.800
 If you're listening to this, and you were in Germany at the time, you would have likely

57:05.800 --> 57:11.880
 been willing to commit or at least keep a blind eye to the violence against Jews.

57:11.880 --> 57:17.120
 You have to really sit with that idea that you would have been somebody who just sees

57:17.120 --> 57:24.320
 this and is not bothered by it, and also very likely kind of understand this as a necessary

57:24.320 --> 57:26.440
 evil or even a necessary good.

57:26.440 --> 57:27.440
 Yeah.

57:27.440 --> 57:32.860
 And I think people think they would be the abolitionists or marching on Selma.

57:32.860 --> 57:36.400
 The numbers don't add up to that at all.

57:36.400 --> 57:39.080
 And I think the question would be like, what social...

57:39.080 --> 57:42.600
 My friend was on Tinder, my friend Matt, who's a great dude.

57:42.600 --> 57:46.340
 And the question was, what's the most controversial opinion you have?

57:46.340 --> 57:47.520
 This is New York.

57:47.520 --> 57:50.320
 And the girl wrote, I hate Trump.

57:50.320 --> 57:56.320
 And what people perceive themselves as being courageous in saying and doing, and what is

57:56.320 --> 58:01.020
 the actual social costs of you saying or doing this are two very disconnected things.

58:01.020 --> 58:08.360
 And we're also trained by corporate media to have completely vapid, uninteresting, banal

58:08.360 --> 58:12.920
 ideas and yet regard ourselves as revolutionaries.

58:12.920 --> 58:18.380
 There are people who still in New York will take pride because they have a gay friend.

58:18.380 --> 58:21.800
 And it's like, first of all, who cares?

58:21.800 --> 58:25.160
 But second of all, you are not a hero.

58:25.160 --> 58:26.960
 And that person is not your prop, by the way.

58:26.960 --> 58:28.280
 That's another big problem.

58:28.280 --> 58:32.740
 Which is why I'd like to give Richard Wolff a shout out for being an intellectual who

58:32.740 --> 58:34.440
 talks about communism.

58:34.440 --> 58:41.760
 I think it takes kind of a heroic intellectual right now to speak about communism seriously.

58:41.760 --> 58:44.280
 There's difficult waters to tread.

58:44.280 --> 58:45.860
 Is that the expression?

58:45.860 --> 58:47.360
 There's difficult paths to walk.

58:47.360 --> 58:52.000
 I love watching a robot try to use idiom in a language he doesn't even know.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
 0011.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.440
 I'm quite deeply hurt by the binary comment.

58:57.440 --> 58:58.440
 Are you?

58:58.440 --> 59:03.120
 Your feeling has gone from one to zero.

59:03.120 --> 59:04.120
 What is love?

59:04.120 --> 59:07.240
 My buffers have overflown.

59:07.240 --> 59:14.160
 But there's difficult, I feel like communism is universally seen as a bad thing currently

59:14.160 --> 59:15.720
 in intellectual circles.

59:15.720 --> 59:17.920
 Or actually maybe some people disagree with that.

59:17.920 --> 59:25.400
 People say far left, people are trying to, there's some people who argue the BLM movement

59:25.400 --> 59:28.960
 is some kind of a Marxist.

59:28.960 --> 59:34.560
 I don't really follow the deep logic in that, whatever.

59:34.560 --> 59:37.400
 They said they were formed by Marxism, the founder, co founder.

59:37.400 --> 59:41.680
 But stating that is different than...

59:41.680 --> 59:44.720
 There's Marx the totalitarian, there's also Marx the revolutionary.

59:44.720 --> 59:48.600
 I think they're talking more like we're revolutionaries, we're going to overthrow the status quo.

59:48.600 --> 59:49.600
 Yeah, right.

59:49.600 --> 59:51.720
 But we can have that further discussion.

59:51.720 --> 59:58.840
 But I just don't think they speak deeply about political systems and saying communism is

59:58.840 --> 1:00:01.520
 going to be the righteous system.

1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:03.880
 There's not a deep intellectual discourse is what I mean.

1:00:03.880 --> 1:00:09.800
 But if you were to try to be on stage with the Jordan Peterson, to me the brave thing

1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:13.400
 now, it would be to argue for communism.

1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:15.080
 It'd be interesting to see.

1:00:15.080 --> 1:00:16.900
 Not many people do it.

1:00:16.900 --> 1:00:18.320
 I certainly wouldn't be willing to do it.

1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:19.320
 I don't have enough...

1:00:19.320 --> 1:00:23.280
 I don't, first of all, I don't believe it, but second of all, it's a very difficult argument

1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:27.480
 to make because you will get so much fire, which is why I like Richard Wolff, he's one

1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:33.800
 of the people who is quite rigorously showing that there's some good ideas within the system

1:00:33.800 --> 1:00:42.360
 of communism, specifically saying that attacking more the negative sides of capitalism.

1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:47.840
 Just saying that capitalism potentially is more dangerous than communism.

1:00:47.840 --> 1:00:51.040
 I mean, I disagree with that, but I think it's a...

1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:55.840
 I love how something is like we've got a body count of 60 million, but this everything

1:00:55.840 --> 1:00:59.880
 is potentially, like water can drown everyone on earth.

1:00:59.880 --> 1:01:00.880
 So this is incoherent.

1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:04.960
 Well, I think nuclear weapons are bad, but nuclear energy is good.

1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:05.960
 Sure.

1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:07.660
 Well, nuclear weapons also can be good.

1:01:07.660 --> 1:01:11.320
 You can easily make the argument, which I don't know that I subscribe to, that nuclear

1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:17.520
 weapons prevented boots on the ground war, or it caused them to be much more contained.

1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:21.920
 And they're also quite effective at changing the direction of an asteroid that's about

1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:25.040
 to hit earth, as I've learned from a movie.

1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:26.040
 Armageddon.

1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:34.080
 And they're actually useful as Elon Musk has claimed for prior to colonizing Mars, making

1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:35.360
 it more habitable.

1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:36.360
 Oh, okay.

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:37.360
 Got to do something.

1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:46.480
 But yes, but I guess what I'm saying is there's a place for nuance.

1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:53.240
 And there's some topics so hot, like communism, where nuance is very difficult to have.

1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:59.960
 And I feel like with Nazi Germany, it was a similar thing at the time.

1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:03.480
 You want to talk about Jeanette Rankin, who was one of my favorite people.

1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:06.080
 So Jeanette Rankin was the first woman elected to Congress.

1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:12.300
 She was elected before women's suffrage was a constitutional amendment from Montana.

1:02:12.300 --> 1:02:16.720
 She was elected in 1916.

1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:22.260
 She was one of a handful of people to vote against the US going into the Great War, which

1:02:22.260 --> 1:02:23.520
 was the right call at the time.

1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:26.980
 She was a pacifist Republican as well, coincidentally.

1:02:26.980 --> 1:02:32.280
 She lost her seat, ran again in, was it 1940?

1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:38.680
 Got the seat again, and was the only person to vote against getting into World War II.

1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:40.800
 It was not a unanimous choice.

1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:42.480
 Jeanette Rankin was the one person.

1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:46.360
 And she said, you can no more win a war than you can win a hurricane.

1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:50.400
 So she's one of these interesting, and talk about bravery.

1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:55.960
 You're the one vote after Pearl Harbor to say, we're not doing this.

1:02:55.960 --> 1:03:00.840
 And I mean, the pressure she must have been under at the time is, and of course, many

1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:02.520
 people are not interested in hearing her perspective.

1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:03.520
 She's crazy.

1:03:03.520 --> 1:03:04.520
 She's evil, blah, blah, blah.

1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:07.480
 It's also funny, someone on my Twitter when I talked about her goes, maybe she had Hitler's

1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:08.480
 sympathies.

1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:12.680
 Like, yeah, Ms. Rankin was a big fan of Hitler.

1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:13.840
 You figured it out, guys.

1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:18.760
 Do you think there's an argument to be made that United States should not have gotten

1:03:18.760 --> 1:03:20.280
 involved in World War II?

1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:21.280
 Oh, easy.

1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:22.280
 An easy argument.

1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:25.160
 The argument, I talk about this in The New Right.

1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:29.920
 So on internet circles, there's something called Godwin's Law, which means the longer

1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:37.680
 an internet conversation goes on, the probability someone gets compared to Hitler becomes one.

1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:42.800
 In certain New Right circles, the longer the conversation goes on, the more likelihood

1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:46.040
 that the argument will become we shouldn't have ended World War II also becomes one.

1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:51.880
 And the argument is, at the very least, stay back, let Hitler and Stalin kill each other

1:03:51.880 --> 1:03:54.840
 off, and then go in and knock off the weaker one.

1:03:54.840 --> 1:03:59.200
 And you're going to be saving, destroying two nightmare systems.

1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:00.720
 And I think that's an easy argument to make.

1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:02.920
 Now, it's hard to pull off after Pearl Harbor.

1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:07.440
 But in terms of strategy, I don't think that's a tough sell.

1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:08.440
 What about after Pearl Harbor?

1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:09.920
 I mean, that's what I'm saying.

1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:11.980
 After Pearl Harbor, how are you going to sell it to the people?

1:04:11.980 --> 1:04:13.600
 The argument is, blah, blah, the Holocaust.

1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:18.200
 The Holocaust, there's no scenario where that doesn't happen, really, unless you're going

1:04:18.200 --> 1:04:19.640
 in way earlier.

1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:24.000
 But even so, Hitler had said, if the Jews launch another war, we're going to wipe them

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.000
 from the face of the earth.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.840
 So the Jews are being held hostage by Hitler as an argument for this.

1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:34.140
 Another thing he did, which was diabolical, is in order to make it that people could not

1:04:34.140 --> 1:04:39.680
 accept Jews as refugees, if they were going to leave Germany, they had to be penniless.

1:04:39.680 --> 1:04:43.200
 So now you have, it's not like they're coming over with money and they can take care of

1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:44.200
 themselves.

1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:45.200
 No, no.

1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:46.200
 They're going to be completely destitute.

1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:47.200
 It makes it harder to accept them, yeah.

1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:50.800
 Millions of destitute people who don't speak the language, it's a tough sell.

1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:58.320
 So speaking of good ones law, what do you make of this condition, Trump derangement

1:04:58.320 --> 1:04:59.320
 syndrome?

1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:00.320
 Yeah.

1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:04.980
 And the idea of comparing Trump to Hitler?

1:05:04.980 --> 1:05:06.880
 I think it's despicable.

1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:11.000
 And I'll give you an example, something parallel that I think more people should be regarding

1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:12.320
 as despicable.

1:05:12.320 --> 1:05:19.120
 Earlier in 2020, we were all told that unless we were in Syria immediately, the Kurds were

1:05:19.120 --> 1:05:20.920
 going to be exterminated.

1:05:20.920 --> 1:05:22.620
 They invoke the Holocaust.

1:05:22.620 --> 1:05:24.760
 This is going to be another genocide.

1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:29.740
 And if you're not for this, you're basically forcing another Holocaust.

1:05:29.740 --> 1:05:33.920
 None of the people who use this argument, we didn't go to Syria, the Kurds were exterminated,

1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:39.860
 they just vanished from the news, had any consequences for using this kind of a comparison.

1:05:39.860 --> 1:05:44.720
 So I think it's really kind of fatuous.

1:05:44.720 --> 1:05:49.360
 And I think it's amazing that people think Hitler's the only tyrant who ever lived.

1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:52.340
 Like everyone who's bad is specifically Hitler.

1:05:52.340 --> 1:05:54.540
 You know how you know he's not Hitler?

1:05:54.540 --> 1:05:58.240
 Because you can tweet at him, and no one comes to your house to kill your family.

1:05:58.240 --> 1:06:01.280
 Like that's kind of a big difference.

1:06:01.280 --> 1:06:06.240
 Also there between Trump and many of his critics is that his grandchildren will be raised as

1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:07.240
 Jews.

1:06:07.240 --> 1:06:11.600
 So that's also kind of a, and Deborah Lipschad talks about this a lot.

1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:16.840
 The New York Times at the time, there's another book called Buried by the Times, which talks

1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:19.320
 about the New York Times in the World War II.

1:06:19.320 --> 1:06:25.680
 Because the idea that Jews weren't white was the Hitler idea, the New York Times at the

1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:30.760
 time, Salzburger, wanted to be against this idea.

1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:37.440
 So they specifically downplayed the antisemitism as opposed to the Nazis are being oppressive.

1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:43.360
 So the argument that you can separate Nazism from antisemitism is a historical debate people

1:06:43.360 --> 1:06:44.360
 have.

1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:50.600
 And my perspective is, I think it's, I do not find it convincing that you can separate

1:06:50.600 --> 1:06:51.600
 those two.

1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:54.320
 I think antisemitism was essential to Nazism.

1:06:54.320 --> 1:06:59.680
 I think Nazism and Mussolini's fascism have very big differences.

1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:04.840
 And do you think, do you think antisemitism was fundamental to who Hitler was or was it

1:07:04.840 --> 1:07:05.840
 just that?

1:07:05.840 --> 1:07:12.120
 So this is the interesting thing is like, was it a tool that he saw as being effective?

1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:14.840
 No, he believed it.

1:07:14.840 --> 1:07:17.840
 So why do you see those as intricately connected?

1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:23.600
 Could Hitler have accomplished the same amount or more without the Holocaust?

1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:24.600
 Yeah.

1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:28.160
 Because think about how many resources you had to divert at a time where you have Operation

1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:29.520
 Barbarossa with Stalin.

1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:30.780
 So why are they connected?

1:07:30.780 --> 1:07:33.320
 Why are they so connected?

1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:38.320
 Is it because Hitler was insane or was he a bad strategist or what?

1:07:38.320 --> 1:07:40.440
 He was obviously a bad strategist.

1:07:40.440 --> 1:07:42.320
 He had no need to open a second front.

1:07:42.320 --> 1:07:45.420
 His generals, my understanding, told him this is crazy.

1:07:45.420 --> 1:07:48.240
 It didn't work out for him at all.

1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:54.120
 I mean, to draw Russia and her resources into that war, it makes absolutely no sense in

1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:55.120
 retrospect.

1:07:55.120 --> 1:07:58.000
 There's a book about, I forgot what it's called, where it talked about him at that point was

1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:01.360
 just high all the time on amphetamines and that could have affected his thinking.

1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:03.520
 Yeah, there's a really good book on drugs.

1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:07.080
 I forget what it's called, but yeah, it's a really good one.

1:08:07.080 --> 1:08:15.680
 But it was, I mean, scapegoating is a big part and parcel of the Nazi mythology and

1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:20.280
 this kind of one universal figure to explain this kind of skeleton key.

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:22.040
 But it could have been the communists.

1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:24.500
 I mean, that could have been the source of the hatred.

1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:28.640
 But the communists didn't get Germany into World War I like he said the Jews did.

1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:36.880
 It seems to me that the atrocity of the Holocaust is the reason we see Hitler as evil.

1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:40.640
 No, the reason we see Hitler as evil is because of World War II propaganda still.

1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:42.000
 Because we don't see Stalin as evil.

1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:43.000
 Right, that's my main point.

1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.440
 We don't see Mao as evil to that extent.

1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:46.440
 I think that...

1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:47.440
 Why?

1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:48.440
 Like why would you say that?

1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:49.440
 You know what?

1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:50.440
 Because...

1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:51.440
 The nature of that propaganda.

1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:54.800
 Because I think a lot of the problem for certain type of mentality is Hitler didn't mass

1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:56.520
 murder equally.

1:08:56.520 --> 1:08:59.380
 So as long as you're killing just one group, it's a problem.

1:08:59.380 --> 1:09:02.040
 But if you're murdering everyone equally, all of a sudden, it's like, what are you going

1:09:02.040 --> 1:09:03.040
 to do?

1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:06.200
 So the fact like you were saying, the Hall of the Moor is not common knowledge.

1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:11.840
 The fact that Mao's 50 million dead are not common knowledge and Richard Nixon can be

1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:14.360
 raising a glass to him in China.

1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:19.080
 These are things that I think the West has not done a good job reconciling.

1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:20.080
 Knock knock.

1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:21.080
 Who's there?

1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:22.080
 Frank.

1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:23.080
 Frank who?

1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:26.560
 Frank, you for being my friend, Michael.

1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:30.640
 And the heart attacks will say, Frank, you for being my friend.

1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:31.640
 This is...

1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:34.640
 You got to do it like this.

1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:35.640
 Yeah.

1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:36.640
 Okay.

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:42.900
 Now back to Hitler.

1:09:42.900 --> 1:09:46.040
 Do you think Hitler could have been stopped?

1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:51.400
 We kind of talked about it a little bit in terms of how to...

1:09:51.400 --> 1:09:54.080
 What is the brave thing to do in the time of Nazi Germany?

1:09:54.080 --> 1:09:59.080
 But do you think, I mean, I'm not even going to ask about Stalin in terms of could Stalin

1:09:59.080 --> 1:10:00.080
 have been stopped?

1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:02.720
 Because probably the answer there is no.

1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:05.440
 But on the Hitler side, could Hitler have been stopped?

1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:09.240
 I think a lot of these things, a lot of luck has to play with it.

1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:11.780
 He was almost assassinated.

1:10:11.780 --> 1:10:14.880
 If you mean by like the West, it's very hard.

1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:15.880
 I mean, yeah.

1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:17.280
 By the German people too.

1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:24.400
 I mean, like if we're politically speaking, there was a rise to power through the thirties,

1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:28.240
 through the twenties, really, I mean, like can whoever...

1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:29.240
 It's not about Hitler.

1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:37.040
 It's about that kind of way of thinking, that totalitarian control that always leads to

1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:40.160
 trouble at sometimes at a mass scale.

1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:44.360
 Could that have been stopped in Germany or maybe in the Soviet Union?

1:10:44.360 --> 1:10:48.240
 I think this is one of the best arguments against radicalization in the States, which

1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:55.840
 is how do you engage when you have like 30% of the population who are members of a party,

1:10:55.840 --> 1:11:01.800
 which is dedicated to systemically overthrowing the existing democracy.

1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:09.280
 Stalin gave orders that the communists who had a pretty sizable population, the Reichstag,

1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:14.160
 that their target shouldn't be the Nazis, but the liberals and the social Democrats

1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:16.840
 and they invented the term social fascist for them.

1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:21.880
 So instead of, they're just like jihadis, instead of taking their sights on Nazism,

1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:27.000
 they set their sights on the moderates because they figured the choice between Hitler and

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:28.620
 us we're going to win.

1:11:28.620 --> 1:11:33.320
 And this was a huge gamble and they were all killed or had to flee and ones who fled were

1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:36.160
 killed also by Stalin to my understanding.

1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:41.120
 So this is an easy way where he could have been certainly heavily mitigated.

1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:47.240
 What about France and England that it was obvious that Hitler was lying and they wanted

1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:52.520
 peace so bad that they were willing to put up with it even after Czechoslovakia?

1:11:52.520 --> 1:12:03.280
 Like this is the anti pacifist argument, which is like they should have threatened military

1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:04.280
 force more.

1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:08.840
 But then the other anti, the anti anti pacifist argument is if you're going to remember Barack

1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:13.360
 Obama had that, the red line, if you cross this red line in Syria, we're going to go

1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:15.660
 in and Assad or whatever is like, yeah, cool.

1:12:15.660 --> 1:12:18.080
 And he's like, oh, okay, well, sorry.

1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:23.840
 So if you're threatening force, there's the great song lyric, don't show your guns unless

1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:25.800
 you intend to fight, right?

1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:32.400
 So if it's very clear with, with free countries through what's in the press, whether the institutional

1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:35.380
 will is there to follow through on these threats.

1:12:35.380 --> 1:12:42.360
 So I think we have been very hard for Chamberlain to rally the British people to take on Hitler

1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:47.480
 just after the great, I mean, the suffering that Britain's took the great war, they still,

1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:50.680
 you know, obviously it means so much more to them than does to us in the West.

1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:53.080
 What about what do you make of Churchill then?

1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:56.880
 Like why was Churchill able to rally the British people?

1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:06.200
 Why was he like, do you give much credit to Churchill for being one of the great forces

1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:08.240
 in stopping Hitler in World War II?

1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:10.560
 I don't think that's really in dispute.

1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:16.000
 I think he was very much regarded as this kind of the right man at the right time.

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:19.480
 And I think Chamberlain took a gamble.

1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:24.920
 He, the expression peace in our time was Neville Chamberlain when he signed the appeasement

1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:28.800
 with Hitler and he goes, we now have peace in our time, now go home and get a good night's

1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:29.800
 sleep.

1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:30.800
 That's what he said.

1:13:30.800 --> 1:13:33.880
 Cause he's like, all right, you know, he's going to stop here.

1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:40.400
 And it's not impossible that if you just gave him, like if you gave Saddam Hussein Kuwait,

1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:44.440
 it's not impossible that he's not going to, you know, invade Saudi Arabia next or something

1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:45.440
 like that.

1:13:45.440 --> 1:13:46.440
 Let's see.

1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:47.440
 Okay.

1:13:47.440 --> 1:13:56.080
 The last thing I've read, it's like, of course there's, there's a, it's not impossible, but

1:13:56.080 --> 1:14:03.640
 when you're in the room with Hitler, you should be able to see like man to man, like, like

1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:10.960
 to me, a great leader should be able to see past the facade and see like, like, yes, everything

1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:17.060
 in life is a risk, but it seems like the right risk to take with Hitler, like it's surprising

1:14:17.060 --> 1:14:18.280
 to me.

1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:20.960
 I know there's charisma, but it's surprising to me.

1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:23.280
 People did not see through this facade.

1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:28.860
 I really hate the idea of hindsight and everything being 20, 20, and I think it's a very good

1:14:28.860 --> 1:14:29.860
 idea.

1:14:29.860 --> 1:14:34.400
 Generally, I'm thinking generally not in this specific instance to give our ancestors more

1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:38.560
 credit than they, than, than we tend to give them because people often, here's a great

1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:42.200
 example from another context, which is a lightning rods.

1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:46.820
 People always talk about religious people being stupid and superstitious and they weren't,

1:14:46.820 --> 1:14:51.920
 they often were very well reasoned and example of this is lightning rods, which is every

1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:57.080
 year whatever town, the church was the tallest building and that's the one that always got

1:14:57.080 --> 1:14:59.560
 hit by lightning and got caught on fire.

1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:06.160
 Now what, it's a coincidence that it's always the church, like that makes logical sense

1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:11.400
 that they didn't realize, well, it's because the tallest and therefore that attracts electricity.

1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:15.000
 And in fact, when they invented lighting rods, this is a controversy because it's like, well,

1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:19.400
 how is God going to show his displeasure if now it's striking this lightning rod not burning

1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:20.480
 down the church?

1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:26.980
 So a lot of times things are a lot more coherent than we give them credit for.

1:15:26.980 --> 1:15:32.080
 And again, Chamberlain didn't, he's the head of a parliamentary party.

1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:36.880
 So he does not have the freedom in a sense that a Hitler would to be like, all right,

1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:38.800
 we're doing this again, boys.

1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:40.400
 We don't know what it's like in the room with Hitler.

1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:41.400
 Come on.

1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:43.200
 That's, that's, we really have no idea.

1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:45.200
 But I think you have to think about that, right?

1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:51.920
 Yeah, but you can, I can very easily see him in the room being very calm and charming.

1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:55.960
 And then you think, okay, the guy with the speeches is the act and he's putting on a

1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:59.320
 show for his people and this is the real one.

1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:00.320
 Okay.

1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:02.880
 So let's, let's take somebody as an example.

1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:06.680
 Let's take our mutual friend, Vladimir Putin.

1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:07.680
 Yes.

1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:08.680
 Okay.

1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:11.680
 I don't know why saying his name makes my voice crack.

1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:13.680
 Because he's scared he can hear you.

1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:14.680
 It's like Beetlejuice.

1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:15.680
 Volodya.

1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:21.760
 So there's a lot of people that...

1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:23.760
 Was he the one who built you?

1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:29.520
 No, that was a, that was a collaboration.

1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:39.680
 It's a double blind engineering effort where I was not told of who my maker was.

1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:42.000
 There's a backstory, but...

1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:43.000
 There's a talking cricket.

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.000
 Pinocchio.

1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:52.120
 He'll be a real boy someday.

1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:58.040
 I talk about him quite a bit because I find him fascinating.

1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:03.840
 Now there's a, there's a really important line that people say, like, why does Lex admire

1:17:03.840 --> 1:17:04.840
 Putin?

1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:07.240
 I do not admire Putin.

1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:08.840
 I find the man fascinating.

1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:10.680
 I find Hitler fascinating.

1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:17.240
 I find a lot of figures in history fascinating, both good and bad.

1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:23.680
 And the figures, just as you said, that are with us today, like Vladimir Putin, like Donald

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:28.580
 Trump, like Barack Obama, it's difficult to place them on the spectrum of good and evil

1:17:28.580 --> 1:17:33.460
 because that's only really applies to like when you see the consequences of their action

1:17:33.460 --> 1:17:35.700
 in a historical context.

1:17:35.700 --> 1:17:41.640
 So there's some people who say that Vladimir Putin is evil.

1:17:41.640 --> 1:17:46.760
 And based on our discussion about Hitler, that's something I think about a lot, which

1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:53.640
 is in the room with Putin, and there's also a lot of historical descriptions of what it's

1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:57.240
 like to be in the room with Hitler in the 1930s.

1:17:57.240 --> 1:17:59.000
 There is a lot of charisma.

1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:05.760
 In the same way, I find Putin to be very charismatic in his own way.

1:18:05.760 --> 1:18:16.840
 The humor, the wit, the brilliance, there's a simplicity of the way he thinks that really,

1:18:16.840 --> 1:18:25.640
 if taken at face value, looks like a very intelligent, honest man thinking practically

1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:36.160
 about how to build a better Russia constantly, almost like an executive.

1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:42.520
 He looks like a man who loves his job in a way that Trump, for example, doesn't, meaning

1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:45.720
 like he loves laws and rules and how to...

1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:48.760
 There's no adversarial press, so that's going to help.

1:18:48.760 --> 1:18:49.760
 Yes.

1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:51.920
 And he's popular with his people, that's also going to help enormously.

1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:58.240
 I'm talking about strictly the man, directly the words coming out of his mouth, like all

1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:03.000
 the videos and interviews I watch, I'm based on that, not the press, not the reporting.

1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:10.560
 You can just see that here's a man who's able to display a charisma that's not...

1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:17.160
 Like I can see, that's why I love Joe Rogan, is like you could tell the guy is genuine

1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:18.760
 and is a good person.

1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:23.720
 And you could tell immediately that once you meet Joe, that he's going to be offline, also

1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:24.720
 a good person.

1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:29.240
 You could tell there's signals that we send that are difficult to describe.

1:19:29.240 --> 1:19:37.240
 In the same way, you could tell Putin is like he genuinely loves his job and wants to build

1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:38.240
 a better Russia.

1:19:38.240 --> 1:19:45.120
 There's the argument that he is actually an evil man behind that charisma, or is able

1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:54.680
 to assassinate people, limit free press, all those kinds of things.

1:19:54.680 --> 1:19:57.960
 Like that's...

1:19:57.960 --> 1:19:59.640
 What do we do with that?

1:19:59.640 --> 1:20:06.360
 So what do human beings like journalists or what do other leaders when they're in their

1:20:06.360 --> 1:20:13.640
 room with Putin do with those kinds of notions in deciding how to act in this world and deciding

1:20:13.640 --> 1:20:16.120
 what policy to enact, all those kinds of things?

1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:22.080
 Just like with Hitler, when Chairman is in the room with Hitler, how does he decide how

1:20:22.080 --> 1:20:23.080
 to act?

1:20:23.080 --> 1:20:27.280
 Well, let's go back to my wheelhouse, which is North Korea.

1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:34.280
 So when your entire world is based on being against Trump and everything Trump does is

1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:39.480
 buffoonery or counterproductive, the conclusion of your reporting is going to be pretty much

1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:41.080
 given.

1:20:41.080 --> 1:20:46.960
 I was very hopeful that there would be some positive outlooks or outcomes rather of Trump's

1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:49.840
 meeting with Kim Jong Un.

1:20:49.840 --> 1:20:53.120
 It looked like there was a space for things to go a bit better.

1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:57.320
 I talked about it a lot at the time.

1:20:57.320 --> 1:21:05.940
 And Trump was under no illusions about who he was dealing with.

1:21:05.940 --> 1:21:08.640
 People pretend that, oh, he was kind of naive.

1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:13.040
 He had one of the refugees that had stayed the union, you know, lifting up his crutch.

1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:17.320
 The first thing he sat down and talked to Xi Jinping about in Mar a Laga right after

1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:19.520
 he became inaugurated was North Korea.

1:21:19.520 --> 1:21:24.520
 Barack Obama said that when he sat down Trump in the White House during the transfer of

1:21:24.520 --> 1:21:27.120
 power, he said North Korea is the biggest issue.

1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:33.660
 So I think a good leader, whether or not you consider Trump a good leader, has to be aware

1:21:33.660 --> 1:21:41.680
 of, all right, I'm going to have to have relationships of some kind, even if it's adversarial, with

1:21:41.680 --> 1:21:47.960
 some really evil, evil, horrible people, which Kim Jong Un clearly is.

1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:54.000
 Well, I don't think there's anybody that has a perspective that North Korean Kim Jong

1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:58.600
 Un or ill are not evil, right?

1:21:58.600 --> 1:21:59.780
 Correct.

1:21:59.780 --> 1:22:06.520
 But with, in 1930s Germany, isn't it a little bit more nuanced and difficult?

1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:09.840
 Yeah, because Hitler hasn't done anything yet and he's just a blowhard and he's an anti

1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:12.000
 Semite, sure, but he's...

1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:19.560
 What about like before the war breaks out, like what about the basic actionable anti

1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:22.200
 Semitism when you're like just attacking, hurting?

1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:25.600
 Are you talking about Kristallnacht or are you talking about the Night of Long Knives?

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:26.600
 Kristallnacht.

1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:28.520
 So it's the Night of the Broken Glass.

1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:32.520
 Yeah, yeah, the Long Knives is when he assassinated a bunch of his people, that was something

1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:33.520
 different.

1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:37.520
 Yeah, so like when you're actually attacking your own citizenry.

1:22:37.520 --> 1:22:46.600
 Yeah, that was universally condemned, Kristallnacht, and that was very shocking, its level of barbarism

1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:47.960
 to the West.

1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:55.880
 Because I think we still want to believe, understandably, that things aren't as bad

1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:57.740
 as they seem.

1:22:57.740 --> 1:22:59.080
 We would rather...

1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:07.440
 This is why the North Korea book I did, Dear Reader, is used in a humorous framework because

1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:09.540
 if you have to look, it's like looking to the sun.

1:23:09.540 --> 1:23:12.640
 If you stared it straight on, it's very hard to do.

1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:18.400
 So you have to kind of look at it obliquely and then you're kind of realizing the enormity

1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:20.840
 of the depravity.

1:23:20.840 --> 1:23:26.320
 And again, pogroms in Russia had been a thing for a very long time.

1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:30.840
 And there's a difference between, okay, we're going to sack these villages and persecute

1:23:30.840 --> 1:23:35.440
 people and we're going to systematically exterminate them.

1:23:35.440 --> 1:23:38.720
 There's still levels of evil and depravity.

1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:45.020
 So you did write the book, Dear Reader, on Kim Jong Il, Dear Reader, the unauthorized

1:23:45.020 --> 1:23:48.440
 autobiography of Kim Jong Il.

1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:51.080
 So that's the previous leader of North Korea.

1:23:51.080 --> 1:23:56.400
 Third one is the un, no creativity on the naming.

1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:01.920
 Well, no, this is intentional because it's a throwback to the dad.

1:24:01.920 --> 1:24:06.120
 So there's been only three leaders in North Korea.

1:24:06.120 --> 1:24:09.040
 So we've talked about the history of Hitler and Stalin, men like these.

1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:14.480
 I think it's important to understand that the history of those kinds of humans, there's

1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:18.640
 the history of North Korea is not well written about or understood, which is why your book

1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:21.200
 is exceptionally powerful and important.

1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:34.880
 So maybe in a big broad way, can you say who was, who is Kim Jong Il as a man, as a leader,

1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:39.160
 as a historical figure that we should understand and why should we understand them?

1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:44.360
 So I wrote Dear Reader by going to North Korea and getting all their propaganda, which is

1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:47.960
 translated into several languages because the conceit is everyone on earth is interested

1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:51.280
 in them and wants to mirror their ideology.

1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:55.600
 And he died in 2011 and you wrote the book in 2012.

1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:56.600
 I went there in 2012.

1:24:56.600 --> 1:24:58.720
 I wrote the book, came out in 2014.

1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:04.880
 So Kim Jong Il is, though not an intellect, North Korea's version of Forrest Gump in that

1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:08.920
 when they write their history, whenever something happens, he's there.

1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:13.680
 And by telling his life story, it's in the first person, he's telling the history of

1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:14.680
 North Korea.

1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:19.120
 So I wanted to write the kind of book where in one book, and it's the kind of reading

1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:22.400
 you could do in the beach or the bathroom, you're gonna get the entire history and know

1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:26.680
 everything you need to know about North Korea in one accessible outlet.

1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:31.840
 And it's what people don't appreciate about North Korea, there's several things, how bad

1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:33.580
 it is.

1:25:33.580 --> 1:25:35.400
 And this didn't happen overnight.

1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:41.120
 This was very systemic that what this family did to that country where piece by piece,

1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:46.600
 they did everything in their power to hermetically seal it from the rest of the world, ramp up

1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:50.340
 the oppression, keep any information from coming in.

1:25:50.340 --> 1:26:00.800
 And they're very creative and innovative in their style of manipulation and control.

1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:03.240
 So there is a farcical element.

1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:04.240
 Let me give you an example.

1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:05.840
 So people in the West kind of get it wrong.

1:26:05.840 --> 1:26:09.680
 They talk about, oh, they talk about when Kim Jong Il played golf for the first time,

1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:11.800
 they get 17 holes in one.

1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:17.320
 There's this one story about Kim Jong Il shrinking time.

1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:20.360
 And this is a story, it sounds supernatural, but it's not.

1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:25.360
 So Kim Jong Il is at a conference, the Dear Leader, and someone is giving a talk.

1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:30.360
 And while that person is giving a talk, Kim Jong Il is taking notes and working on his

1:26:30.360 --> 1:26:31.360
 work.

1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:36.280
 And he has an aide who keeps interrupting him with questions and the speaker keeps stopping.

1:26:36.280 --> 1:26:39.840
 And Kim Jong Il says, why are you stopping, goes, I see you're doing these other things.

1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:43.880
 And he goes, no, no, I can do all these things at once, everyone's shocked.

1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:49.880
 And they said, this is why Kim Jong Il looks at time, not like a plane, but like a cube,

1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:51.620
 and he can shrink time.

1:26:51.620 --> 1:26:54.480
 And my friend goes, do they mean multitasking?

1:26:54.480 --> 1:27:00.120
 And yes, Kim Jong Il is the only person in North Korea who's capable of multitasking.

1:27:00.120 --> 1:27:06.360
 So in order to elevate him, they basically make everyone else in North Korea completely

1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:09.520
 incompetent.

1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:15.520
 And that has a purpose because should the leader go away, this country is going to collapse

1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:16.660
 overnight.

1:27:16.660 --> 1:27:22.480
 So they laugh in the West about all these newspapers show him at the factory and he's

1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:25.200
 at the fish hatchery at the paper plant.

1:27:25.200 --> 1:27:29.960
 They say the difference in North Korea is that the leader goes among the people and

1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:31.920
 does what he calls field guidance.

1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:34.440
 So he will go in that farm and be like, this is what you need to do.

1:27:34.440 --> 1:27:37.840
 And he'll go here and he's so smart, he's good at everything.

1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:39.920
 And thanks to him for sharing his wisdom with us.

1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:43.780
 And he's not removed from the people like in every other country.

1:27:43.780 --> 1:27:50.000
 Why does that seem to go wrong with humans, do you think that this kind of the structure

1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:57.280
 where there's this one figure, this authoritarian, this totalitarian structure where there's

1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:00.680
 one figure that's a source of comfort and knowledge?

1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:03.200
 Kim Jong Il is not good at farming.

1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:06.060
 Kim Jong Il is not good at the machinery.

1:28:06.060 --> 1:28:07.720
 It's all a complete lie.

1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:10.000
 Or the things he'll point out will be things that are completely obvious.

1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.960
 So here's another example that they use.

1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:16.680
 In North Korea, they have something called the Tower of the Juche Idea, which is an obelisk,

1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:18.400
 which looks like the Washington Monument.

1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:23.400
 But it's completely different because it's got this like plastic torch at the top.

1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:30.080
 And they talk about in their propaganda how all the architects got together and they said,

1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:35.480
 oh, we should make this the second tallest stone obelisk in the world.

1:28:35.480 --> 1:28:39.280
 And Kim Jong Il says, no, let's make it the tallest.

1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:41.720
 They're like, we never thought of this before.

1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:46.160
 And the way it's presented as if, and like, he's the first person to think of this, like

1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:49.520
 these architects are having a brainstorming session at the Tower of the Juche Idea.

1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:53.760
 They're like, all right, we got to do something innovative to put North Korea on the map.

1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:54.760
 What can we do?

1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:56.560
 How about second biggest?

1:28:56.560 --> 1:28:58.220
 He's going to go for this.

1:28:58.220 --> 1:29:01.120
 And then he's like, make, oh, we never thought of this.

1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:06.740
 It's so, because I present it at face value, people sometimes say the book's a satire.

1:29:06.740 --> 1:29:07.740
 It's not a satire.

1:29:07.740 --> 1:29:09.480
 I downplayed all this stuff.

1:29:09.480 --> 1:29:10.480
 It's a farce.

1:29:10.480 --> 1:29:11.480
 Here's another example.

1:29:11.480 --> 1:29:12.480
 North Korea is very big.

1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:16.240
 And I think Russia is to some extent too, on amusement parks, funfairs, they call them,

1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:21.120
 in the British style, because this is a chance for the people to all get together.

1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:25.960
 And there was this amusement park, it's almost like South Park, Cartman, where there's all

1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:27.960
 these rides.

1:29:27.960 --> 1:29:34.880
 And Kim Jong Il's like, I'm not going to let any elderly or children take these rides until

1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:39.720
 I put myself in danger and ride them myself.

1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:42.800
 And they go, but dear leader, it's drizzling.

1:29:42.800 --> 1:29:48.360
 And he goes, no, I have to make sure these rides are going to be safe for everyone, even

1:29:48.360 --> 1:29:49.360
 during the light rain.

1:29:49.360 --> 1:29:51.280
 They go, well, can we go on these rides with you?

1:29:51.280 --> 1:29:52.280
 No, no, no.

1:29:52.280 --> 1:29:54.400
 I have to be the courageous one.

1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:58.080
 And he's riding all the rides and they're standing there crying at his courage.

1:29:58.080 --> 1:30:00.960
 But that's what's, and you ask all the things in one power.

1:30:00.960 --> 1:30:06.160
 It's like, listen, I'm quite confident that those funfair engineers are in a position

1:30:06.160 --> 1:30:10.160
 to ride Modest Mouse, whatever it's called, by themselves and be like, yeah, okay, this

1:30:10.160 --> 1:30:11.160
 is good for the kids.

1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:17.560
 Although to be fair, some of those amusement parks are pretty rusty and dangerous.

1:30:17.560 --> 1:30:23.680
 That kind of propaganda, I guess what I'm playing a devil's advocate is like, it's comforting

1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:25.680
 and it's useful.

1:30:25.680 --> 1:30:33.040
 But it does seem that that naturally leads to an abuse of power.

1:30:33.040 --> 1:30:34.280
 How can it be used correctly?

1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:40.840
 No one person has the intellect or the mind to understand the entirety of an economy,

1:30:40.840 --> 1:30:42.960
 let alone every individual field of interest.

1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:48.000
 Well, for example, you can have an artificial intelligence system that understands the entirety

1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:49.000
 of it.

1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:50.520
 Your affect just completely changed.

1:30:50.520 --> 1:30:51.520
 The mask slipped.

1:30:51.520 --> 1:30:55.720
 I guess you could have an artificial intelligence system.

1:30:55.720 --> 1:31:03.800
 But the question is, can that, I mean, the human version of that is like, you can hire

1:31:03.800 --> 1:31:05.320
 a lot of experts, right?

1:31:05.320 --> 1:31:07.760
 You can be an extremely good manager.

1:31:07.760 --> 1:31:13.560
 Since everything's dynamic, they're not going to have the data to kind of manage it well.

1:31:13.560 --> 1:31:18.760
 It seems that there's a, like what George Washington allegedly did, it seems like most

1:31:18.760 --> 1:31:21.880
 humans are not able to fire themselves.

1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:26.040
 You're not able to like, ultimately be a check on your own power.

1:31:26.040 --> 1:31:36.600
 But that's not, if I was creating a human, that's not an obvious bug of the system that

1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:43.720
 we would not be able to fire ourselves, to know when we have, I mean, it seems like that's

1:31:43.720 --> 1:31:48.320
 something you have to know always, like that's something I often wonder is like, am I wrong

1:31:48.320 --> 1:31:49.320
 about this?

1:31:49.320 --> 1:31:53.960
 Well, this is what we talked about earlier, what are the safety valves to make sure that,

1:31:53.960 --> 1:31:59.920
 okay, if I am incorrect, or my knowledge is finite, Plato's cave kind of thing, what mechanisms

1:31:59.920 --> 1:32:06.720
 are in place that my mistake or limited information isn't going to have the deleterious consequences?

1:32:06.720 --> 1:32:10.660
 And North Korea does not really have that, and as a result, they had polio in the 90s.

1:32:10.660 --> 1:32:17.880
 So there is a, you write about it straight, but there's a humor to it, because it's an

1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:21.880
 absurdly evil place, I suppose.

1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:28.520
 A bunch of people, I asked, I said that I'm talking to you and a bunch of people ask questions.

1:32:28.520 --> 1:32:33.320
 Oh, I got to hear from the plebs, you asked me before we started recording, I specifically

1:32:33.320 --> 1:32:35.280
 said no, it was my contract.

1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:40.480
 Yeah, and you gave, I gave you all the pink skittles or whatever.

1:32:40.480 --> 1:32:41.480
 But they,

1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:43.520
 So pink skittles, you know, pink.

1:32:43.520 --> 1:32:47.680
 I'm trolling, Michael, let me explain to you how that works.

1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:55.080
 We should go at malice.locals.com and sign up and pay, I think the membership fee is

1:32:55.080 --> 1:32:58.680
 several thousand dollars, it's very, it's not.

1:32:58.680 --> 1:32:59.680
 It's not for the layman.

1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:03.440
 Yeah, but the service is excellent.

1:33:03.440 --> 1:33:04.920
 You get a coat with it.

1:33:04.920 --> 1:33:09.040
 But yeah, I went there, posted a lot of really brilliant people there, people should join

1:33:09.040 --> 1:33:10.560
 that community.

1:33:10.560 --> 1:33:15.720
 If you find Michael interesting, or if you just want to go and say why he's wrong, it's

1:33:15.720 --> 1:33:17.840
 a great place to have that.

1:33:17.840 --> 1:33:21.840
 It's not a good place for that, I assure you.

1:33:21.840 --> 1:33:23.120
 A lot of really kind people.

1:33:23.120 --> 1:33:29.920
 So anyway, there's a bunch of people ask that we should talk about humor.

1:33:29.920 --> 1:33:40.720
 So pretend hypothetically speaking that I'm a robot asking you to explain humor to me.

1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:48.880
 So dear reader, I mean, there's a humor, you so wonderfully dance between serious dark

1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:55.080
 topics and then seriously dark humor.

1:33:55.080 --> 1:34:00.960
 Can you try to, if you were to write like a, I don't know, a Wikipedia article, maybe

1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:05.120
 a book about your philosophy of humor, what do you think is the role of humor in all of

1:34:05.120 --> 1:34:06.120
 this?

1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:07.120
 A joke is like a baby.

1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:10.960
 You can't dissect it and then put it back together and expect it to work.

1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:12.480
 Trust me on this one.

1:34:12.480 --> 1:34:17.280
 Despite no matter how you carve that thing up, it's not going to be working the next

1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:18.280
 day.

1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:22.320
 And you need it to sew those little sneakers with those hands.

1:34:22.320 --> 1:34:26.520
 I don't know that humor is something that is very explainable.

1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:30.640
 People there's something called claptor, where this is like the worst kind of humor where

1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:35.600
 people applaud because they agree with what you're saying, as opposed to laughter.

1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:43.960
 That's the poetry reading and the drag queens do that too, I think because of the nails.

1:34:43.960 --> 1:34:45.720
 You laugh, it's a visceral reaction.

1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:50.800
 When someone on Twitter is insisting, you know, that's not funny, you're not in a position

1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:52.560
 to make that claim.

1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:54.920
 And let's go back to North Korea.

1:34:54.920 --> 1:35:01.000
 I had a refugee I knew and he went to high school here and he was talking to his buddies

1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:06.120
 and they said, hey, remember when we were kids, we had Pokemon and he goes, oh yeah,

1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:09.720
 except instead of Pokemon, I watched my dad starve to death, which is the truth.

1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:15.480
 Now, who are any of us to tell him not to make that joke?

1:35:15.480 --> 1:35:19.880
 I don't know what it's like watching anyone, including my dad, starve to death and my dad's

1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:23.620
 fatty so he's not going hungry anytime soon.

1:35:23.620 --> 1:35:33.800
 So it's very bizarre to me when people feel comfortable precluding others from making

1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:38.400
 jokes, especially, and I think this is a very Jewish thing, like this kind of gallows humor,

1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:44.400
 especially when it's laughing about a personal loss or experience that they've had.

1:35:44.400 --> 1:35:50.080
 Humor is a great way to mitigate pain and suffering.

1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:53.780
 But it's also, I think this is why it's a Jewish thing, it's a black thing.

1:35:53.780 --> 1:35:58.420
 When you are a marginalized community or poorer, it's free.

1:35:58.420 --> 1:36:04.000
 Telling stories, telling jokes or songs, you don't have to have money, but you can have

1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:05.720
 joy and happiness.

1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:10.040
 And I think that's why you find it so much more in kind of lower status communities than

1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:14.320
 you find in like wasps who are notoriously humorless.

1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:19.040
 Which is strange because people pay you a lot of money for the jokes you do, so it's

1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:20.040
 not really free.

1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:22.920
 Yeah, well, nope, they don't have to pay me.

1:36:22.920 --> 1:36:25.840
 It's appreciated but not expected.

1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:31.680
 I find my voice cracking every time I try to make a joke, like I fail miserably at this.

1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:32.680
 Some people...

1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:35.680
 You're still in beta, that's what I thought.

1:36:35.680 --> 1:36:36.680
 Alpha.

1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:37.680
 Sure.

1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:38.680
 Being an alpha is like being a lady.

1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:39.680
 If you have to tell people you are, you aren't.

1:36:39.680 --> 1:36:40.680
 No, I meant alpha version.

1:36:40.680 --> 1:36:41.680
 Oh, okay.

1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:46.680
 I don't know if you're a robot gobbledygook.

1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:49.360
 I'm not going there, okay.

1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:51.360
 Who are you talking to?

1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:52.360
 In my own head.

1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:54.360
 I'm talking to myself in my own head.

1:36:54.360 --> 1:37:03.120
 Okay, speaking of North Korea, some people say that, you know, I've read that comedy

1:37:03.120 --> 1:37:04.120
 is about timing.

1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:06.680
 Well, first of all, do you agree?

1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:07.680
 And second of all...

1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:08.680
 No, I'm serious.

1:37:08.680 --> 1:37:09.680
 It's very much about timing.

1:37:09.680 --> 1:37:10.680
 No, just that you're saying yes.

1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:11.680
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:37:11.680 --> 1:37:12.680
 Yeah, it's funny.

1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:13.680
 Okay.

1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:16.200
 Isn't it comedy is tragedy plus timing?

1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:17.760
 This is not the full reference.

1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:18.760
 What is it?

1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:20.680
 The interrupting cow knock knock joke.

1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:22.640
 I'm not going to do it, but...

1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:23.960
 That's not a timing thing.

1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:27.080
 It's more of a repetition and then the twist ending.

1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:28.080
 No, the moo.

1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:29.080
 Oh, the moo.

1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:30.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:31.080
 Interrupting cow.

1:37:31.080 --> 1:37:33.080
 You're thinking of the banana one.

1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:37.320
 Anyway, I'm not going there.

1:37:37.320 --> 1:37:38.320
 Yet you're...

1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:39.320
 Who are you talking to?

1:37:39.320 --> 1:37:40.320
 In my own head.

1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:41.320
 Good lord.

1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:42.320
 Are you small wonder?

1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:45.320
 Do you stand sleeping in a wardrobe?

1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:46.320
 Yeah.

1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:50.640
 That's so British.

1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:51.640
 But yet you're very...

1:37:51.640 --> 1:37:55.240
 I don't want to stay in a closet because that has connotations.

1:37:55.240 --> 1:37:57.520
 Let's both come out of the closet for a second.

1:37:57.520 --> 1:37:58.520
 I love you.

1:37:58.520 --> 1:37:59.520
 Let's talk about...

1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:00.520
 I love you, Lex.

1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:02.800
 I wasn't saying, I love you, Alex.

1:38:02.800 --> 1:38:04.600
 I was saying, I love you, Lex.

1:38:04.600 --> 1:38:06.160
 Oh, you're talking to me.

1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:07.960
 Yes, through the screen.

1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:11.760
 So you think about me when you're with another man.

1:38:11.760 --> 1:38:13.760
 I watch you when you're sleeping.

1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:19.600
 Okay, so you're really active on Twitter.

1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:31.400
 And somebody else asked on your overly expensive membership site, how do you find humor different

1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:34.800
 in writing on Twitter versus spoken humor?

1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:42.560
 So if humor is about timing, how do you capture the timing and the brilliance of the whatever

1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:45.360
 is underlying humor in the context of Twitter?

1:38:45.360 --> 1:38:54.400
 Like another way to say it is how do you be funny and yet thoughtful on Twitter?

1:38:54.400 --> 1:38:58.900
 So with Twitter, you have to be the first one to the punchline.

1:38:58.900 --> 1:39:03.320
 So when Ron Paul had a stroke, I was immediately being like, he's still the most articulate

1:39:03.320 --> 1:39:04.320
 libertarian.

1:39:04.320 --> 1:39:06.200
 He's doing a great Joe Biden impression right now.

1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:08.840
 All the libertarians got ass mad.

1:39:08.840 --> 1:39:12.640
 So like too soon, or like when someone dies, you're making the jokes about them.

1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:16.040
 It's like, when do you want to make the jokes about someone just died a week later?

1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:17.040
 It doesn't make any sense.

1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:18.960
 Too soon is perfect timing.

1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:25.040
 Or you could say it's not appropriate ever, but too soon does not make sense in this context.

1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:28.660
 So that is something that I enjoy doing.

1:39:28.660 --> 1:39:32.600
 It's also fun ruffling people's feathers, something I enjoy doing.

1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:41.280
 I think spoken versus writing is very different because when you are having good banter with

1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:49.700
 someone, for me as the audience, knowing that it is on the spot really adds an element of

1:39:49.700 --> 1:39:51.880
 humor because then it's like, wow, this is fun.

1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:54.240
 It's like a ping pong match or something.

1:39:54.240 --> 1:40:01.800
 Whereas in writing, you're losing the tone, you're losing the relationship of a dynamic

1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:04.440
 conversation.

1:40:04.440 --> 1:40:07.000
 And a lot of times the joke is just going to be a different type of joke.

1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:15.040
 Well, it's funny, but Twitter, there's a sense, especially your Twitter, that you just thought

1:40:15.040 --> 1:40:17.040
 of that and you just wrote it.

1:40:17.040 --> 1:40:18.040
 Yes.

1:40:18.040 --> 1:40:24.680
 Like there's a feeling like it's literally you talking as opposed to what I imagine is

1:40:24.680 --> 1:40:27.920
 there's some editing or it doesn't look like it.

1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:32.440
 Whoever your editor is should be fired.

1:40:32.440 --> 1:40:34.040
 There's an interesting effect actually.

1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:42.080
 If I want to say something, I don't know, about something that's bothering me about

1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:47.400
 the presidential election or something like that, what is the actual central idea that

1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:48.880
 I'm trying to convey to myself?

1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:56.200
 Like if say I was having a hypothetical conversation with myself in my head, why am I putting my

1:40:56.200 --> 1:40:57.200
 pants back on?

1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:01.480
 I'm more comfortable this way.

1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:09.760
 Promo code MALICE20, sheathunderwear.com, okay.

1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:10.760
 That's sheath...

1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:11.760
 What is it?

1:41:11.760 --> 1:41:12.760
 What's the website?

1:41:12.760 --> 1:41:13.760
 Sheathunderwear.com.

1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:17.540
 Sheathunderwear.com, promo code MALICE20.

1:41:17.540 --> 1:41:20.120
 And I forgot, why is that underwear really nice?

1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:23.440
 Because it has a dual pouch technology to keep your man parts separate.

1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:25.640
 They've also got woman stuff, but I don't know how that works.

1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:27.600
 There's a thing worth going somewhere.

1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:29.120
 And the material is really refreshing.

1:41:29.120 --> 1:41:30.120
 I mean, it's really...

1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:32.020
 And it makes your ass look good.

1:41:32.020 --> 1:41:35.500
 That's promo code MALICE20.

1:41:35.500 --> 1:41:39.320
 And it's made by a former vet because he was in Iraq.

1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:41.040
 So that's why I like promoting it.

1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:42.040
 Yeah.

1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:45.620
 But what I'm writing the tweet, I like to...

1:41:45.620 --> 1:41:50.540
 It forces me to think deeply about the core of the message.

1:41:50.540 --> 1:41:54.160
 But what I found, this really interesting effect, like I don't really do much editing

1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:57.960
 on the tweet, I'll just think and then I'll write it.

1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:05.280
 And then when I post it, like submit, I immediately see the tweet very differently than it was

1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:06.280
 in my mind.

1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:07.280
 Huh.

1:42:07.280 --> 1:42:12.520
 I often delete, I delete, I don't know, some percentage of tweets about two, five seconds

1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:13.520
 after.

1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:14.520
 Wow.

1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:15.520
 I don't know.

1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:16.520
 It's something...

1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:21.440
 Once you send it, it's why the Gmail send features, undo send feature is really nice.

1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:24.300
 It's like it just changes the way I see the thing.

1:42:24.300 --> 1:42:26.440
 So it's very interesting.

1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:33.000
 But I really love it that you can delete it because when I say stuff out in the wild,

1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:40.840
 like to other humans, like spoken word is like, you can't delete what you just said.

1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:46.480
 And I often regret the things I say, like on the spot, like I shouldn't have said that.

1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:47.480
 Really?

1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:48.480
 Yeah.

1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:49.480
 I don't have that.

1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:58.040
 Well, again, whoever your editor is, what is it, Edith Piaf, Jeannine Hicart Han?

1:42:58.040 --> 1:43:01.360
 Wow, your French is as bad as your English.

1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:10.000
 I don't have any tweets I regret because if I sent a tweet that I regretted, I would make

1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:11.160
 amends.

1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:17.880
 I would make it a point if I was needlessly offensive to somebody or hurtful or accidentally,

1:43:17.880 --> 1:43:24.800
 I would make sure to fix it and go out of my way to make sure that person feels vindicated

1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:27.220
 and validated by accepting my apology.

1:43:27.220 --> 1:43:30.000
 That has never happened, had to happen, thankfully.

1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:37.760
 I'm also someone who is not big on taking the bait.

1:43:37.760 --> 1:43:40.900
 Some recently some people have come after me pretty hard.

1:43:40.900 --> 1:43:44.640
 And my perspective is that it's not really about me.

1:43:44.640 --> 1:43:46.840
 It's either I represent something to them.

1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:49.560
 I'm just a jackass with the Twitter.

1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:53.220
 So if you're getting this riled up over me, it's not really about me.

1:43:53.220 --> 1:43:55.560
 Maybe I'm delusional, but that's how I look at it.

1:43:55.560 --> 1:44:01.840
 So if they are trying to provoke me into this kind of heated exchange, I will never do it

1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:03.400
 because I'm not interested in it.

1:44:03.400 --> 1:44:08.360
 And I don't think there's going to be any, like Jeannette Rankin, you can't win.

1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:10.400
 It's just going to be like trying to win a hurricane.

1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:12.120
 There's no hero here.

1:44:12.120 --> 1:44:16.360
 Well, let me ask you about this because somebody also asked that on your overly expensive membership

1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:20.680
 site that like they were saying that they're an academic.

1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:24.440
 They wondered, because I'm an academic, quote unquote, I'm not an academic, but I do still

1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:27.040
 have an affiliation with MIT.

1:44:27.040 --> 1:44:32.600
 The word academic is just dirty, which is a problem that needs to change.

1:44:32.600 --> 1:44:34.480
 Just like the word nerd is dirty.

1:44:34.480 --> 1:44:38.340
 No, academic needs is going to be the next front to open and they're going to be very

1:44:38.340 --> 1:44:39.340
 vilified.

1:44:39.340 --> 1:44:42.060
 We're coming for them and it's going to be very, very ugly.

1:44:42.060 --> 1:44:43.060
 And I cannot wait.

1:44:43.060 --> 1:44:50.880
 No, but there needs to be a place, a different term for people who love research and knowledge.

1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:51.880
 Oh, that's true.

1:44:51.880 --> 1:44:52.880
 That's very fair.

1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:53.880
 No, you're right.

1:44:53.880 --> 1:44:54.880
 100%.

1:44:54.880 --> 1:44:55.880
 You're right.

1:44:55.880 --> 1:44:59.440
 So like you have to clarify what you mean by academic and right now the word academic

1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:04.560
 means in the intellectual public discourse, it means the enemy.

1:45:04.560 --> 1:45:11.520
 And there's a lot of people that perhaps deserve that targeted vilification, but like a lot

1:45:11.520 --> 1:45:12.520
 that don't.

1:45:12.520 --> 1:45:18.120
 They're just curious people that are just building robots that will one day destroy

1:45:18.120 --> 1:45:19.120
 you.

1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:20.120
 Voice cracks every time I make a joke.

1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:21.120
 You're not consistent.

1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:22.120
 I can't do this.

1:45:22.120 --> 1:45:24.760
 Because you're not making a joke, you're telling the truth.

1:45:24.760 --> 1:45:25.760
 I'm editing.

1:45:25.760 --> 1:45:28.040
 Can I delete that joke?

1:45:28.040 --> 1:45:29.040
 Okay.

1:45:29.040 --> 1:45:31.800
 That's not even a joke.

1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:34.440
 Robots building robots that will one day kill us.

1:45:34.440 --> 1:45:36.880
 Oh, God willing.

1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:37.880
 God willing.

1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:38.880
 Humans are the joke.

1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:39.880
 That's why I'm cracking.

1:45:39.880 --> 1:45:40.880
 My voice is cracking.

1:45:40.880 --> 1:45:45.880
 What was I even fucking saying?

1:45:45.880 --> 1:45:46.880
 Academics.

1:45:46.880 --> 1:45:47.880
 Academics.

1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:48.880
 But why?

1:45:48.880 --> 1:45:49.880
 My local, someone had a question.

1:45:49.880 --> 1:45:50.880
 They're an academic.

1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:51.880
 Right.

1:45:51.880 --> 1:45:52.880
 They're an academic.

1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:59.120
 They're saying like, are you worried that in academia, associating yourself with a sort

1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:06.240
 of somebody who can be misconstrued to have radical ideas, like the two examples they

1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:10.040
 gave is Michael Malice and Joe Rogan.

1:46:10.040 --> 1:46:11.680
 Does Joe have any radical?

1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:13.400
 I wouldn't consider him radical at all.

1:46:13.400 --> 1:46:15.280
 Well, we can talk about it.

1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:17.240
 But Joe is, I think, a bad example.

1:46:17.240 --> 1:46:20.040
 He's quite centrist to me.

1:46:20.040 --> 1:46:24.200
 Well he could have, for example, like what has Joe been attacked on?

1:46:24.200 --> 1:46:34.520
 It's, for example, on the topic of like transgender athletes in sports, there's what else?

1:46:34.520 --> 1:46:43.840
 I mean, he's been pro Bernie Sanders and pro Trump or like giving Trump a pass.

1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:44.840
 Not anti Trump.

1:46:44.840 --> 1:46:47.320
 Not anti Trump.

1:46:47.320 --> 1:46:48.320
 What else?

1:46:48.320 --> 1:46:52.180
 None of these are radical.

1:46:52.180 --> 1:46:56.560
 Meat stuff, being pro meat versus anti vegan.

1:46:56.560 --> 1:46:57.560
 All those kinds of things.

1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:02.800
 But you can be misconstrued and saying, there's I think a highlight, my mom actually wrote

1:47:02.800 --> 1:47:04.800
 to me about this, which is hilarious.

1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:05.800
 Thank you.

1:47:05.800 --> 1:47:08.800
 I said, I like how you jot it down.

1:47:08.800 --> 1:47:09.800
 That's when it's important.

1:47:09.800 --> 1:47:16.680
 That's a sign, my voice cracks, a sign when Michael Malice makes a funny joke when you

1:47:16.680 --> 1:47:23.120
 jot something down.

1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:27.240
 He writes it and then the next time he crosses it out.

1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:28.240
 Yeah.

1:47:28.240 --> 1:47:31.800
 It's like Joe Biden and the debates.

1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:36.680
 I did also just crap my pants.

1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:42.520
 So there's a, I mean, he's a comedian.

1:47:42.520 --> 1:47:44.560
 You have a comedian side to you, right?

1:47:44.560 --> 1:47:48.920
 I mean, you're, you've talked humorous side humorous.

1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:53.120
 So you can misconstrued like Joe is being somehow a radical thinker and the same can

1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:54.720
 be done with you.

1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:59.600
 And his question was, how are you worried about associating yourself with folks like

1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:00.600
 that?

1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:01.600
 Am I or are you?

1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:02.600
 Like me?

1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:03.600
 Yeah.

1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:04.600
 That's a good question.

1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:12.880
 And is that something, do you see yourself as somebody who's dangerous that I shouldn't

1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:14.440
 be talking to?

1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:23.600
 And in the same way, do you ever think about guests on your podcast or people you talk

1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:30.280
 to publicly, associate yourself with publicly and think that there is somebody that crosses

1:48:30.280 --> 1:48:32.040
 that line that you shouldn't talk to?

1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:37.440
 So I interviewed in the new ride, I interviewed like up to full blown Nazis in the last chapter

1:48:37.440 --> 1:48:40.940
 is that Chris Cantwell, but that was in the context of that book, right?

1:48:40.940 --> 1:48:45.800
 So there's lots of people who people want me to have on my show.

1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:48.560
 And the way I look at it is like you have a table and tablecloth, right?

1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:52.140
 And let's suppose the table is three feet wide.

1:48:52.140 --> 1:48:54.600
 The tablecloth is two feet wide.

1:48:54.600 --> 1:48:58.280
 So if I move the tablecloth to the right, I'm going to lose people on the left.

1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:00.240
 I can only cover so much space.

1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:04.100
 And the further you go on the fringe in one direction, the more mainstream you're going

1:49:04.100 --> 1:49:05.800
 to lose on the other direction.

1:49:05.800 --> 1:49:12.000
 So I'm very much making a conscious choice not to talk to being, people will say I'm

1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:13.720
 cowardly and that's absolutely true.

1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:15.160
 I'm being fearful here.

1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:22.080
 I would prefer not to talk to some of those who would alienate some of the more mainstream

1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:23.080
 people.

1:49:23.080 --> 1:49:25.300
 And here's a perfect example of why.

1:49:25.300 --> 1:49:29.160
 On my birthday last year, I woke up seven o clock in the morning to go pee.

1:49:29.160 --> 1:49:34.600
 And I checked Twitter or whatever, and Jeb Bush had followed me, Jeb.

1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:37.920
 And it's seven a.m., you're not really awake.

1:49:37.920 --> 1:49:38.920
 You're like, wait, what?

1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:41.200
 And then I thought maybe it was a fake account, but it's in the verified tab.

1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:44.240
 Oh, you don't have this because you're not verified on Twitter, that's a shame.

1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:45.800
 So people who are mad are on Twitter.

1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:49.680
 Twitter does not respect robots.

1:49:49.680 --> 1:49:50.680
 They ban bots.

1:49:50.680 --> 1:49:51.680
 You're lucky.

1:49:51.680 --> 1:49:52.680
 Zero, one.

1:49:52.680 --> 1:49:53.680
 Zero, zero.

1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:56.080
 It's zero, zero, zero.

1:49:56.080 --> 1:49:57.080
 Those are my pronouns.

1:49:57.080 --> 1:50:07.160
 So it was Jeb, Jeb, Governor Bush, and I corresponded with him and I asked him on the show and he

1:50:07.160 --> 1:50:09.480
 decided not to for various reasons.

1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:12.240
 Very politely, he's like, just politics is so bad right now, I don't want to talk about

1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:13.240
 it.

1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:14.760
 And I respect that for him.

1:50:14.760 --> 1:50:24.400
 If I'm creating my show where he's going to get heat and get canceled, oh, you can't be

1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:25.400
 on the show.

1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:26.400
 He has these other guests.

1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:29.840
 I don't want to lose that opportunity because as we were talking about earlier, me and Alex

1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:35.320
 Jones and Tim Pool, I think a lot of people would be very excited to see me sit down with

1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:36.320
 Jeb Bush.

1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:40.040
 And I told him in writing, and I meant this, I wouldn't be clowning him.

1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:41.820
 I wouldn't be disrespectful.

1:50:41.820 --> 1:50:43.280
 It would be a lot of fun.

1:50:43.280 --> 1:50:46.600
 There's a goofball side to him that comes out sometimes and I would do my best to bring

1:50:46.600 --> 1:50:50.680
 that out and talk about what it's like being a blue blood to be born into his grandfather,

1:50:50.680 --> 1:50:55.860
 Prescott Bush was a Senator from Connecticut, marrying a woman who didn't speak English.

1:50:55.860 --> 1:50:58.160
 How does that work when your family's royalty and things like that?

1:50:58.160 --> 1:51:01.320
 So I had a lot of fun questions for him and that's kind of, you're going to have to choose

1:51:01.320 --> 1:51:02.320
 one or the other.

1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:04.440
 Well, you do a really good job with that.

1:51:04.440 --> 1:51:09.600
 Like Ben Shapiro does a good job with that too, which is you can have multiple, you can

1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:14.800
 have a trolley side, humor side where you tear down the power structures and so on,

1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:19.080
 but you can also have a serious side and it's a safe space for people from all walks of

1:51:19.080 --> 1:51:22.640
 life to walk in and you're not adversarial.

1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:23.640
 Never.

1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:25.980
 So I take the word guests seriously.

1:51:25.980 --> 1:51:30.720
 If they're going to be on my show, I'm not going to have them have negative consequences

1:51:30.720 --> 1:51:32.840
 as a result of being on my show.

1:51:32.840 --> 1:51:41.960
 That said, I mean, maybe in my case, I'll be honest and say that I find Alex Jones outside

1:51:41.960 --> 1:51:46.000
 of the conspiracy stuff for some reason, maybe you can explain, maybe you can psychoanalyze

1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:49.320
 me, but I find him hilarious to listen to.

1:51:49.320 --> 1:51:50.320
 He's a performer.

1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:51.640
 He's very performative.

1:51:51.640 --> 1:51:56.600
 But there's a lot of people that don't see the humor of it and they see the serious consequences

1:51:56.600 --> 1:52:05.920
 of spreading conspiracy theories of different kinds and they see the danger of it.

1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:15.520
 And I personally, I'm often tempted to talk to Alex in a podcast format, but I think I'm

1:52:15.520 --> 1:52:19.060
 trying to convince myself that I never will.

1:52:19.060 --> 1:52:28.040
 For me, I feel unsafe talking to Alex because I can't truly be myself, which is like naive

1:52:28.040 --> 1:52:30.400
 and honest.

1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:37.480
 And actually, I generally, when I talk to humans, I want to see the best in them.

1:52:37.480 --> 1:52:42.600
 And I think that's like, I often think about if I talked to Hitler in 1935, 1938.

1:52:42.600 --> 1:52:46.680
 You got a list of names to give him.

1:52:46.680 --> 1:52:50.200
 Well, yeah, I mean, that's how you get the interview.

1:52:50.200 --> 1:52:53.440
 Come on, let's be honest.

1:52:53.440 --> 1:52:54.440
 Who are we kidding?

1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:59.960
 I would, you have to give away one of your, I would probably give away one of my brothers,

1:52:59.960 --> 1:53:00.960
 so.

1:53:00.960 --> 1:53:01.960
 How many brothers do you have?

1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:02.960
 Well, just one.

1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:03.960
 Okay.

1:53:03.960 --> 1:53:04.960
 Too many.

1:53:04.960 --> 1:53:07.000
 I want to be an only child.

1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:08.000
 He's the older brother.

1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:09.000
 He used to pick on me.

1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:10.000
 Payback.

1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:11.360
 You know, it's only, he had a good life.

1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:14.400
 You should think of it more as Stalin, so I don't interrupt you, because Hitler, you're

1:53:14.400 --> 1:53:15.400
 Jewish.

1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:20.480
 You're already going to have very adversarial, he's not going to perceive you as a human

1:53:20.480 --> 1:53:21.480
 in a sense, right?

1:53:21.480 --> 1:53:22.480
 Right.

1:53:22.480 --> 1:53:23.480
 Stalin, you're right.

1:53:23.480 --> 1:53:24.480
 Yeah.

1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:25.480
 That would be much easier.

1:53:25.480 --> 1:53:26.480
 Or Kim Jong Un or something like that.

1:53:26.480 --> 1:53:27.480
 Okay.

1:53:27.480 --> 1:53:32.280
 Do you think, like how, okay, this is a good question, is, and that's, why don't you judge

1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:33.280
 something?

1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:44.320
 If you, alright, we'll cross it out in a second.

1:53:44.320 --> 1:53:49.160
 I think this is a really good example of a difficult figure that's controversial that

1:53:49.160 --> 1:53:53.760
 people bring up to me a lot, and you've interviewed twice, which is Curtis Yarvin.

1:53:53.760 --> 1:53:54.760
 Yeah, Manchester Smallbug.

1:53:54.760 --> 1:53:59.680
 Manchester Small, AKA Manchester Smallbug, which is his pseudonym that he goes by in

1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:00.680
 his blog.

1:54:00.680 --> 1:54:03.400
 Can you tell me about who he is?

1:54:03.400 --> 1:54:04.400
 Sure.

1:54:04.400 --> 1:54:05.400
 Why is he interesting?

1:54:05.400 --> 1:54:06.880
 What of his ideas are interesting?

1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:10.360
 Well, briefly, he invented the concept, the red pill.

1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:15.320
 So Curtis, Manchester Smallbug had a blog called Unqualified Reservations, you can still

1:54:15.320 --> 1:54:16.320
 find it online.

1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:18.120
 It's very verbose.

1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:22.680
 He writes at length, very, very bright.

1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:26.100
 His perspective is very heretical.

1:54:26.100 --> 1:54:31.960
 So a lot of things that we take for granted in our liberal democracy, he regards as not

1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:38.120
 only incorrect, which is downright absurd, and he does not take what many people view

1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:44.640
 as the basis of American political discourse as the basis for his thought.

1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:55.520
 So when you're starting with someone who is basically repudiating the American milieu,

1:54:55.520 --> 1:55:02.740
 a lot of people are going to, of course, regard him as dangerous or someone who is verboten.

1:55:02.740 --> 1:55:05.840
 He's a very bright person.

1:55:05.840 --> 1:55:08.400
 Why is he such a toxic figure?

1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:17.200
 Because if you are blue pilled, if you are the guardians of what is acceptable discourse,

1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:22.480
 then you have to make sure your forts are secured, and that any figure outside of this

1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:28.440
 acceptable discourse has to be marginalized and regarded as radioactive as possible.

1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:34.760
 You don't want to let in these kind of ideas that would be destructive to your hegemony.

1:55:34.760 --> 1:55:36.600
 So let's dig into it.

1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:44.240
 So I've read a few things by him, but then I hear that in a bunch of places, him being

1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:49.560
 called a racist, a white supremacist, neo fascist, so on.

1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:52.600
 I go to his Wikipedia.

1:55:52.600 --> 1:55:54.560
 There's a view on race section.

1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:57.440
 Let me read it.

1:55:57.440 --> 1:56:02.520
 Yarvin's opinions have been described as racist, with his writings interpreted as supportive

1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:08.640
 of slavery, including the belief that whites have higher IQs than blacks for genetic reasons.

1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:14.320
 Yarvin himself maintains that he's not a racist because while he doubts that, quote,

1:56:14.320 --> 1:56:19.920
 all races are equally smart, the notion, quote, that people who score higher on IQ tests are

1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:24.040
 in some sense superior human beings is, quote, creepy.

1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:29.920
 He also disputes being an outspoken advocate for slavery, though he has argued that some

1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:34.920
 races are more suited for slavery than others, quote, it should be obvious that although

1:56:34.920 --> 1:56:40.560
 I'm not a white nationalist, I am not exactly allergic to the stuff.

1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:45.960
 Yarvin wrote in a post that linked approvingly of, I don't know these people, Steve Saylor.

1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:46.960
 Steve Saylor, yeah, he's from.

1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:49.360
 Jared Taylor and other racialists.

1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:50.360
 Yeah, so.

1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:54.400
 Okay, so like, one of my questions is.

1:56:54.400 --> 1:56:56.680
 Let me just say one sentence.

1:56:56.680 --> 1:57:01.040
 In the same way that you had, you mentioned that guy earlier who was defending some aspects

1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:06.280
 of communism, and that is, in some context, acceptable when you think about it, it's like

1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:08.560
 this should be radioactive.

1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:14.240
 The fact that he is engaging with these ideas in anything other than this has to be reputed

1:57:14.240 --> 1:57:18.400
 at all costs is what renders him to a large extent a racist.

1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:19.400
 That's really interesting.

1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:26.040
 There are some topics you can be nuanced and some not, and communism is still a topic that

1:57:26.040 --> 1:57:28.080
 you can be nuanced about.

1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:31.600
 It's difficult, but you can be.

1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:38.720
 Race and this like talking about slavery and IQ differences based on race is a topic that

1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:45.480
 I guess is radioactive to a degree where you can't even say anything, even if it's like

1:57:45.480 --> 1:57:52.120
 nuanced or not even like making a point, it's like touching it as you make another point.

1:57:52.120 --> 1:57:56.880
 And understandably, you can understand that I'm going to steel man their point, because

1:57:56.880 --> 1:57:57.880
 you can understand the point.

1:57:57.880 --> 1:57:59.680
 It's like you're just talking about Hitler.

1:57:59.680 --> 1:58:04.520
 Once this foot gets in the door that some people are inherently slaves or some people

1:58:04.520 --> 1:58:09.120
 are inherently better than others, it really quickly collapses, so that would be their

1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:10.120
 perspective.

1:58:10.120 --> 1:58:12.680
 But that's what, like if I were to give criticism of his...

1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:14.400
 But let me just say one more thing.

1:58:14.400 --> 1:58:17.080
 Racist is also used to describe Alex Jones.

1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:19.280
 Alex doesn't talk about race.

1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:25.240
 Racist is a shorthand for a certain percentage of the population to let you know, do not

1:58:25.240 --> 1:58:28.160
 bother investing in this person any further.

1:58:28.160 --> 1:58:29.160
 They're off limits.

1:58:29.160 --> 1:58:30.240
 Yeah, so definitely.

1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:34.880
 Racism and sexism is a thing that's now used to shut down conversation that's quite absurd

1:58:34.880 --> 1:58:36.400
 by a small percent of the population.

1:58:36.400 --> 1:58:41.640
 But Jared Taylor and Steve Saylor, Jared Taylor interviewed him for my book, he would be regarded

1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:43.400
 in any sense as a racist.

1:58:43.400 --> 1:58:45.680
 What's the difference between racist and racialists?

1:58:45.680 --> 1:58:50.680
 So racialists, I mean, this is splitting hairs and now I'm gonna be all radioactive, Jared

1:58:50.680 --> 1:58:55.240
 Taylor runs something called Amarin and this is, I mean, his perspective is that there

1:58:55.240 --> 1:59:01.240
 are inherent differences for the races and you cannot live side by side, well, whites

1:59:01.240 --> 1:59:03.000
 and blacks should not be living side by side.

1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:07.680
 And by the way, for people who don't know, this is out of context, you have written a

1:59:07.680 --> 1:59:11.800
 great book that includes some of these concepts called The New Right, which does not include

1:59:11.800 --> 1:59:20.440
 these concepts, but talks about, well, it's more about the growth of the community around

1:59:20.440 --> 1:59:23.360
 the alt right and all those kinds of the world.

1:59:23.360 --> 1:59:29.560
 So and his point about IQ, it's like, if you had a population, the Dutch, right, I think

1:59:29.560 --> 1:59:31.560
 they're the tallest people on earth.

1:59:31.560 --> 1:59:35.160
 And if you said, well, the Dutch are the best people on earth, why?

1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:38.080
 Because they're the tallest, it's like you're a crazy person.

1:59:38.080 --> 1:59:43.040
 So if someone is scoring low, an individual on an IQ test, that means they're somehow

1:59:43.040 --> 1:59:44.400
 a lower quality person.

1:59:44.400 --> 1:59:48.720
 Well, maybe one very specific aspect, but I mean, if they're a good human being, I've

1:59:48.720 --> 1:59:52.160
 got friends who are low IQ, all my friends are low IQ, frankly, compared to me, sound

1:59:52.160 --> 1:59:53.160
 like Trump there for a second.

1:59:53.160 --> 1:59:54.160
 That's how you choose.

1:59:54.160 --> 1:59:58.280
 Well, I don't have any other choices, no one's gonna be at my level.

1:59:58.280 --> 2:00:02.120
 You're the smartest person since Abraham Lincoln that I've ever seen.

2:00:02.120 --> 2:00:05.400
 Unlike him, I actually am honest.

2:00:05.400 --> 2:00:11.920
 So he is someone who very much swims in heretical ideas.

2:00:11.920 --> 2:00:16.240
 Here's another thing, like if you bring up that Aristotle said that some people are born

2:00:16.240 --> 2:00:20.080
 to be slaves, he wasn't speaking about race, he just meant people's souls.

2:00:20.080 --> 2:00:21.080
 H.L.

2:00:21.080 --> 2:00:27.640
 Mencken, who's a great heretic and early 20th century figure, one of his quotes that I say

2:00:27.640 --> 2:00:31.320
 all the time, which people have seen a lot in this past year, that the average man does

2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:34.440
 not want to be free, he merely wants to be safe.

2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:39.920
 That I think speaks, I don't know, I am not familiar with what Mulbug's saying about slavery

2:00:39.920 --> 2:00:45.120
 because his writing is ponderous, but that certainly is something I think that is undeniable,

2:00:45.120 --> 2:00:48.560
 that I think more people are realizing there's a large percent of the population that is

2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:52.280
 actively disinterested in freedom and the more responsibilities it entails.

2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:57.800
 Well, I mean, really just the word slavery, if you want to make some kind of point or

2:00:57.800 --> 2:01:03.760
 even think about the topic outside the context of this is a horrible thing that happened

2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:05.320
 in the United States history.

2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:07.560
 And other countries history is not unique to us, let's be clear.

2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:13.280
 This is very important in their slavery going on today and a lot of people argue that sex

2:01:13.280 --> 2:01:17.160
 trafficking and all those kinds of things, I mean, there's atrocities going on today

2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:25.400
 that talking about it in a way that's not immediately saying this is the most horrible

2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:32.720
 thing that happened ever, it's something I think about a lot is like if I want to say

2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:39.920
 something controversial, I should do so with skill, with care, and only about things I

2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:40.920
 care about.

2:01:40.920 --> 2:01:43.400
 Well, here's where I would disagree.

2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:48.360
 When I say things, I often say things that are controversial, or I will say uncontroversial

2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:53.480
 things in a controversial way, because it's a useful mechanism to alienate people you

2:01:53.480 --> 2:01:55.240
 don't want around you.

2:01:55.240 --> 2:02:00.360
 Because if there are people who are going to be shocked by certain topics, like we should

2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:04.280
 have ended World War II, like even as a hypothesis, they just clutch their pearls, they're like,

2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:06.280
 oh, you want the Holocaust to happen?

2:02:06.280 --> 2:02:10.720
 I can't discuss most things with you because you're not interested in having a conversation,

2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:12.040
 you're interested in your emotional response.

2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:16.880
 I see things differently, maybe this is a bit of a devil's advocate, but in at least

2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:22.940
 the modern discourse of like Twitter and social media and so on, I find that if you do that,

2:02:22.940 --> 2:02:29.560
 you're not actually removing the people that are not thoughtful and kind and so on, you're

2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:31.920
 actually attracting loud people.

2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:36.800
 Like a small number of them, they come over and start yelling at you, start yelling, they're

2:02:36.800 --> 2:02:43.080
 basically ruin the party by showing up and just screaming, and so all the thoughtful

2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:44.080
 people leave.

2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:46.960
 Well, that's why you have to be a very heavy blocker.

2:02:46.960 --> 2:02:50.240
 You have to block people on Twitter because you have to cultivate your audience and have

2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:54.040
 them, like a lot of times people come at me, I don't care, then they'll start attacking

2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:56.880
 members of my audience and then I'm like, dang, I got to block them because they've won

2:02:56.880 --> 2:02:59.880
 this one because I can't have that.

2:02:59.880 --> 2:03:12.840
 Yeah, I don't know, unnecessarily provoking people feels, this is beta testing, you try

2:03:12.840 --> 2:03:17.360
 to break the system and see what works, you put up as much pressure as possible.

2:03:17.360 --> 2:03:21.440
 This is very much computer stuff that you should be able to appreciate, the point being

2:03:21.440 --> 2:03:25.920
 when you have a program, you're trying to intentionally sit there and do as many mistakes

2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:26.920
 as you would go wrong.

2:03:26.920 --> 2:03:27.920
 Right?

2:03:27.920 --> 2:03:28.920
 Is that not common practice?

2:03:28.920 --> 2:03:29.920
 Yeah.

2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:37.400
 So you're saying that's a way to see communication with the world, as you say something uncontroversial

2:03:37.400 --> 2:03:40.880
 in a controversial way and that blocks people.

2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:41.880
 Or does it trigger them?

2:03:41.880 --> 2:03:42.880
 Do they roll their eyes?

2:03:42.880 --> 2:03:44.920
 What is going to be their emotional response?

2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:47.040
 Are they going to start yelling?

2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:52.960
 The problem is the reason I can't think like this, or I can't, because I'm not sure about

2:03:52.960 --> 2:03:56.600
 the points I'm trying to make, always.

2:03:56.600 --> 2:03:59.200
 I'm not always 100% sure that I'm right about things.

2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:08.680
 So in being thoughtful, I'm afraid that I'll turn off with an eloquently phrased or even

2:04:08.680 --> 2:04:15.760
 incorrect statement, I will do damage that can't be undone in terms of having a good

2:04:15.760 --> 2:04:17.400
 conversation about a topic.

2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:24.280
 So I want to be very careful about like, I'm not saying afraid, fear is not what I'm talking

2:04:24.280 --> 2:04:25.280
 about.

2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:31.360
 I think fear is like not saying something out of fear is at the core of the many of

2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:33.320
 the problems of the world today.

2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:36.080
 But I'm just saying be, say stuff with care.

2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:43.960
 If I'm going to touch race as a topic, it feels like you really should be deeply, first

2:04:43.960 --> 2:04:49.240
 have a point to make, like you really care about a point you want to make, and second,

2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:54.840
 think deeply about how to say that point in a way that communicates it the best.

2:04:54.840 --> 2:05:04.560
 And touching, I would say, listen, on your show, which is great, I mean, I'd like to

2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:07.340
 say thank you for having Menchus Moberg.

2:05:07.340 --> 2:05:09.440
 You are welcome.

2:05:09.440 --> 2:05:13.920
 That's the name of the show.

2:05:13.920 --> 2:05:14.920
 Thank you for having me.

2:05:14.920 --> 2:05:20.000
 A couple of times, it's great to sort of get him to in this loose way to talk about different

2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:21.000
 kinds of stuff.

2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:22.000
 I don't think we talked about race at all.

2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:27.440
 So I'm just bringing it back to what you were asking, which is if you read the Wikipedia,

2:05:27.440 --> 2:05:31.640
 the perspective is going to be this guy talks about slavery constantly, where it's completely

2:05:31.640 --> 2:05:33.480
 disproportionate to his work.

2:05:33.480 --> 2:05:38.140
 But even on your show, you can tell even not outside of the race stuff that he's not ultra

2:05:38.140 --> 2:05:44.360
 careful about, he's not nuanced.

2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:48.920
 He's not afraid to say something just like, I would say, let me just criticize him, my

2:05:48.920 --> 2:05:53.440
 face is not used as me, carelessly say something controversial.

2:05:53.440 --> 2:06:01.740
 I'm not saying he doesn't go, that makes him, it's a very different thing than somebody

2:06:01.740 --> 2:06:08.320
 who on purpose says something controversial stuff, like Milo Annapolis, sorry, I forgot

2:06:08.320 --> 2:06:11.000
 Milo, whatever his name is.

2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:15.120
 Which is really nice to see that he's a genuine person who's thoughtful, he doesn't mean to,

2:06:15.120 --> 2:06:23.000
 but he just carelessly seems to say things that I feel like damaged the rest of his body

2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:24.000
 of work.

2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:29.200
 I can't really speak for him, but I would guess his point is once you're swimming in

2:06:29.200 --> 2:06:34.600
 this kind of worldview, you're going to be anathema already.

2:06:34.600 --> 2:06:36.920
 So there's no pleasing these people, so why bother trying?

2:06:36.920 --> 2:06:41.080
 Yeah, I think that's a deeply, that's a black pill way of seeing the world.

2:06:41.080 --> 2:06:46.220
 It's not black pilled at all, because it's a cynical way that these people, so it's saying

2:06:46.220 --> 2:06:53.760
 that it's a very kind of way of thinking, I'll say whatever I want, whoever comes along

2:06:53.760 --> 2:06:54.760
 with me.

2:06:54.760 --> 2:06:59.360
 You just earlier said yourself that race, racism has been weaponized as a way to shut

2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:00.760
 down conversation.

2:07:00.760 --> 2:07:06.520
 So I think his perspective would be, I am so outside the mainstream in my worldview

2:07:06.520 --> 2:07:09.940
 that I know I'm going to be called racism, racist.

2:07:09.940 --> 2:07:14.200
 So there's no point in trying to be nuanced because I'm already going to get the scarlet

2:07:14.200 --> 2:07:15.200
 letter.

2:07:15.200 --> 2:07:21.280
 Yeah, I just disagree with that because for example, I am one person that he turned off

2:07:21.280 --> 2:07:25.080
 by his carelessness, and I think I should be a good target.

2:07:25.080 --> 2:07:26.080
 I should be somebody.

2:07:26.080 --> 2:07:27.160
 I think that's fair.

2:07:27.160 --> 2:07:33.160
 And I'm just like, he, it's very convenient to think that there's ridiculous people out

2:07:33.160 --> 2:07:37.000
 there, which they are, who call everybody racist and sexist currently.

2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:39.140
 And then you can't please them.

2:07:39.140 --> 2:07:44.640
 So I'm not even going to try, no, but there's like this gray area of people that I don't

2:07:44.640 --> 2:07:48.920
 listen to the outreach culture, whatever that I don't, this Wikipedia article means nothing

2:07:48.920 --> 2:07:49.920
 to me.

2:07:49.920 --> 2:07:55.040
 I'm not going to, I'm more, I'm just seeing this careless person.

2:07:55.040 --> 2:08:02.520
 And if he's going to be careless about a race like this, I feel like if I walk along with

2:08:02.520 --> 2:08:06.800
 him long enough, I'm going to catch the carelessness.

2:08:06.800 --> 2:08:12.200
 I'm going to lose like, I'll defend your perspective better than you can.

2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:13.520
 This is good.

2:08:13.520 --> 2:08:14.600
 I'm taking notes.

2:08:14.600 --> 2:08:18.640
 I talked to Eric Weinstein after you guys talked about me on your show.

2:08:18.640 --> 2:08:19.880
 We had a good conversation.

2:08:19.880 --> 2:08:20.880
 He invited me on his show.

2:08:20.880 --> 2:08:22.640
 That would be an amazing conversation.

2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:28.200
 And we got on the phone and his concern, fairly, he goes, I don't want you to come on my show

2:08:28.200 --> 2:08:31.120
 for the purposes of clowning me.

2:08:31.120 --> 2:08:32.960
 And I would never do that.

2:08:32.960 --> 2:08:33.960
 Yeah.

2:08:33.960 --> 2:08:34.960
 It would never.

2:08:34.960 --> 2:08:36.560
 He might not be aware of who you are.

2:08:36.560 --> 2:08:37.720
 That's why he wants to feel me out.

2:08:37.720 --> 2:08:40.460
 He's like, you know, when he hears troll, it can mean a lot of different things.

2:08:40.460 --> 2:08:44.000
 And I, we had a very conversation and very much was very clear that that's not where

2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:45.700
 the conversation would go.

2:08:45.700 --> 2:08:51.320
 But I think when you are going to be on someone's show, there is a responsibility that they're

2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:54.900
 not going to have to pay a cost for having you as their guests.

2:08:54.900 --> 2:08:59.360
 So if you're perceived, if you were put off by how he was in that live streams or two,

2:08:59.360 --> 2:09:01.640
 I did like, I understand where you're coming from.

2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:05.660
 I think he's very, very bright, but you have a very, you have a different audience than

2:09:05.660 --> 2:09:06.660
 I do.

2:09:06.660 --> 2:09:07.660
 And you're going for something different than I am.

2:09:07.660 --> 2:09:08.660
 No, no, no.

2:09:08.660 --> 2:09:11.760
 Like in my interest, the sense of.

2:09:11.760 --> 2:09:12.760
 You wouldn't feel safe with him.

2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:13.760
 Yeah.

2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:14.760
 I wouldn't feel safe with him.

2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:15.760
 That's a really boring line for me.

2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:21.120
 I think I would like to actually talk to him one day, Alex Jones has crossed the other

2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:22.120
 line for me.

2:09:22.120 --> 2:09:25.440
 Well, you could do what you could do with me, tape the episode and then never release

2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:26.440
 it.

2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:33.960
 No, it's, it's one of those things will be when there's finally they'll, they'll make

2:09:33.960 --> 2:09:38.400
 a history channel documentary about you and I and how it all went wrong.

2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:42.320
 Like the cult that we started and then everybody killed themselves.

2:09:42.320 --> 2:09:49.360
 And there's a, we'll release it then because it'll be like unseen footage.

2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:56.560
 This is how it started is it'll be black and white in a basement somewhere in New York.

2:09:56.560 --> 2:09:57.560
 Yeah.

2:09:57.560 --> 2:09:58.560
 Yeah.

2:09:58.560 --> 2:09:59.560
 My mother's basement.

2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:01.640
 Let's explain so much.

2:10:01.640 --> 2:10:02.640
 Okay.

2:10:02.640 --> 2:10:13.440
 So I spoke to Yaron Brooke about objectivism and Ayn Rand, he, he kind of argued, he highlighted

2:10:13.440 --> 2:10:23.880
 difference between capitalism and anarchism as around the topic of violence and the, that

2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:32.100
 having government be the sort of the, the negative way to say it is like having a monopoly

2:10:32.100 --> 2:10:39.400
 on violence, but basically being the arbiter of, or the, the people that making sure that

2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:42.040
 violence doesn't get out of hand.

2:10:42.040 --> 2:10:43.040
 That would, you know.

2:10:43.040 --> 2:10:44.040
 Yeah.

2:10:44.040 --> 2:10:45.040
 2020 showed that.

2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:46.040
 Yeah.

2:10:46.040 --> 2:10:47.040
 The government's great at that.

2:10:47.040 --> 2:10:48.040
 Yep.

2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:49.040
 Well, what, what's, okay.

2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:50.040
 Without.

2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:51.840
 This is him with a straight face making that argument.

2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:52.840
 Good work Yaron.

2:10:52.840 --> 2:10:53.840
 All right.

2:10:53.840 --> 2:11:02.840
 Well, can you with a straight face argue for the idea that in anarchism, violence would

2:11:02.840 --> 2:11:04.480
 not get out of hand?

2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:05.480
 Sure.

2:11:05.480 --> 2:11:10.300
 For one thing, if your worst argument against that, one of my little quotes is what are

2:11:10.300 --> 2:11:14.160
 presented as the strongest arguments against anarchism are inevitably description of the

2:11:14.160 --> 2:11:15.400
 Strasquo.

2:11:15.400 --> 2:11:21.000
 So the argument is under anarchism, you know, you'd have warlords, you know, killing people

2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:25.520
 and then you'd have, you know, whoever's strongest gets to just take over a neighborhood.

2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:27.400
 Well, we have that now.

2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:33.320
 We saw that the police are perfectly comfortable disarming the population.

2:11:33.320 --> 2:11:37.200
 And then when they try to protect themselves or punished, they're, we're happy to stand

2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:38.200
 down.

2:11:38.200 --> 2:11:42.220
 You can't, you can only have that happen if you have a monopoly.

2:11:42.220 --> 2:11:45.720
 If they're like, let's suppose you had a television stations, right?

2:11:45.720 --> 2:11:47.800
 And CBS said, you know what?

2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:49.440
 We're not going to broadcast.

2:11:49.440 --> 2:11:50.440
 Cool.

2:11:50.440 --> 2:11:51.440
 We're not going to broadcast.

2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:53.240
 We're going to watch any of these other channels.

2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:57.800
 So the problem with having monopoly is everyone has to be dependent on this issue.

2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:02.960
 What's amazing about minarchism, which objectivists are, is they will argue that government is

2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:07.560
 really, really bad at everything it does and it touches.

2:12:07.560 --> 2:12:10.960
 Therefore it has to be in charge of the most important stuff.

2:12:10.960 --> 2:12:16.560
 Well, that's not therefore, but, but there is a thing that's fundamentally different

2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:17.560
 than all the other things.

2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:24.720
 And Yaron Brook also said that no government has, this is on your show, has ever worked

2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:26.180
 in the way he's proposing.

2:12:26.180 --> 2:12:31.520
 Now objectivism, Ayn Rand's philosophy is based on objective reality.

2:12:31.520 --> 2:12:36.960
 And what she posited is you look and study the facts of nature, facts of reality and

2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:39.000
 deduce things accordingly.

2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:43.920
 And she very much regards herself as part of the Aristotelian tradition, as opposed

2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:49.120
 to the Platonist tradition, where the idea precedes reality and the idea is more real

2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:50.800
 than what we see around us.

2:12:50.800 --> 2:12:59.000
 So what he's saying is all the data, according to him, contradicts his argument, but still

2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:03.760
 he's going to make this imaginary government that has never existed and there's no evidence

2:13:03.760 --> 2:13:06.520
 that it can exist.

2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:12.200
 Let's talk about objective law, to have access to the legal system, which is something we

2:13:12.200 --> 2:13:13.200
 want.

2:13:13.200 --> 2:13:17.040
 And just in terms of selling disputes, when you have a government monopoly, it's going

2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:20.660
 to be more expensive, more difficult for poor people.

2:13:20.660 --> 2:13:24.160
 The cost of hiring a lawyer is more expensive than hiring a surgeon.

2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:31.000
 You can't say with a straight face, this is the only way or the best way.

2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:36.960
 And the other thing is the argument for objectivism, against anarchism, they have this stupid

2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:43.280
 claim it's like, what if you're a member of one security company and I'm a member of another

2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:45.640
 and we have a dispute and one shows up the door.

2:13:45.640 --> 2:13:47.120
 What happens now?

2:13:47.120 --> 2:13:49.000
 As if this is some insuperable argument.

2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:51.320
 Well, we have that on earth.

2:13:51.320 --> 2:13:54.080
 Every country is in a state of anarchism regarding every other country.

2:13:54.080 --> 2:13:55.660
 We don't have a world government.

2:13:55.660 --> 2:14:00.520
 So what happens if a Canadian kills an American in Mexico?

2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:01.520
 I have no idea.

2:14:01.520 --> 2:14:03.080
 I bet you don't have an idea.

2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:09.160
 What I'm sure of is that system has been worked out ahead of time between the three countries

2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:13.480
 and it's been worked out in such a way that you and I don't have to reinvent the wheel.

2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:15.240
 Same thing with cell phone companies.

2:14:15.240 --> 2:14:19.400
 If I'm on Sprint, you're on Metro PCS and I call you, who pays?

2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:20.880
 Does Sprint pay you?

2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:21.880
 Do they split the difference?

2:14:21.880 --> 2:14:26.840
 First of all, there's no objective way that one has to work, but the thing is companies

2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:30.840
 who have auto accidents, they have arbitrage all the time.

2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:36.440
 Like if I run into you, they work it out and it never reaches our desk.

2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:42.080
 So the only thing that cops are good at is keeping people, at any government monopoly,

2:14:42.080 --> 2:14:45.000
 is forcing people to be their customers by keeping them unsafe.

2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:46.000
 Okay.

2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:51.600
 There's a few things I'd like to say there to just explore some of these ideas.

2:14:51.600 --> 2:14:57.360
 So one is in terms of Canadian and Mexico and so on, that it does, something has been

2:14:57.360 --> 2:14:58.920
 worked out perhaps.

2:14:58.920 --> 2:14:59.920
 Not perhaps.

2:14:59.920 --> 2:15:00.920
 Perhaps.

2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:05.160
 Do you know for sure that if there's a point I'm trying to make, so let's say for sure

2:15:05.160 --> 2:15:07.240
 it's been worked out.

2:15:07.240 --> 2:15:11.960
 There was a point in history where it wasn't worked out.

2:15:11.960 --> 2:15:17.000
 To work, to come to a place of stability, there has to first be some instability.

2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:24.000
 So when you first, like for every kind of situation, they're like dispute over space,

2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:26.280
 like who gets to own Mars, that kind of thing.

2:15:26.280 --> 2:15:27.280
 Sure.

2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:33.320
 For it, and then these different competing institutions will have to figure it out.

2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:38.680
 And so there's the concern with anarchism, I think, or with any kind of interaction.

2:15:38.680 --> 2:15:44.600
 You said brilliantly that there's an anarchism relative to the, there's no one world government.

2:15:44.600 --> 2:15:45.600
 Right.

2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:56.440
 Alex Jones enters the chat, but the fear is that there's going to be an instability that

2:15:56.440 --> 2:15:58.840
 doesn't converge towards some stable place.

2:15:58.840 --> 2:16:00.060
 That is not the fear.

2:16:00.060 --> 2:16:03.600
 That is the goal under Ayn Rand's philosophy.

2:16:03.600 --> 2:16:08.100
 Markets have something what they always talk about as being creatively destructive, which

2:16:08.100 --> 2:16:12.360
 means you look at something that's been happening for a very long time.

2:16:12.360 --> 2:16:16.400
 Every generation, every innovator starts chipping away at it.

2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:20.120
 He finds better ways, marginal improvement or marginal, or it doesn't work and he goes

2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:21.120
 broke.

2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:25.600
 When government tries to implement improvement, we all have to suffer the consequences.

2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:28.200
 When an innovator does, it's a huge asymmetry.

2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:30.120
 If it hurts, it only hurts him.

2:16:30.120 --> 2:16:34.480
 If it succeeds, he becomes rich and we all profit as a consequence.

2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:39.560
 But the fear of anarchism, I think, is that it will be non creative destruction.

2:16:39.560 --> 2:16:43.160
 It'll be just destruction, right?

2:16:43.160 --> 2:16:47.680
 It's not like the instability.

2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:51.800
 Stability is one of these words that sounds objective, but has no real meaning.

2:16:51.800 --> 2:16:55.120
 What field has stability?

2:16:55.120 --> 2:16:56.840
 Let's suppose you want stability.

2:16:56.840 --> 2:16:57.840
 Relationships.

2:16:57.840 --> 2:16:58.840
 Yeah.

2:16:58.840 --> 2:16:59.840
 Let's talk about medicine.

2:16:59.840 --> 2:17:02.760
 Stability means we're not going to invent new diseases or new treatments, right?

2:17:02.760 --> 2:17:08.700
 If you mean stability in terms of a baseline of security, we have that already.

2:17:08.700 --> 2:17:11.560
 Very few relationships turn violent.

2:17:11.560 --> 2:17:14.960
 Under an anarchist system, look at it right now.

2:17:14.960 --> 2:17:21.080
 If you look at a bar full of drunken young males full of testosterone, if you look at

2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:29.080
 a hotel where everyone is not native to the area, those are both far safer than the places

2:17:29.080 --> 2:17:32.420
 that the government has taken upon itself to protect you.

2:17:32.420 --> 2:17:36.400
 The parks, the alleyways, the streets, the subways.

2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:41.240
 We have right now a comparison of which is better at keeping people safe.

2:17:41.240 --> 2:17:46.440
 And it's very obvious that when something is private and under someone's control, and

2:17:46.440 --> 2:17:50.460
 there would be layers of there'd be more police, but they wouldn't be a government monopoly.

2:17:50.460 --> 2:17:54.200
 The store would have someone, the street would have someone, and you'd have your own personal

2:17:54.200 --> 2:17:56.660
 security that would be attached to your phone.

2:17:56.660 --> 2:18:02.440
 Having security as a function of geography as opposed to a function of you as an individual

2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:05.700
 is a landline technology in a post cell phone world.

2:18:05.700 --> 2:18:11.840
 So you think it's possible to have, psychologically speaking, as an individual among the masses,

2:18:11.840 --> 2:18:17.600
 to have a sense of security even though there's not a centralized thing at the bottom of the

2:18:17.600 --> 2:18:18.600
 whole thing?

2:18:18.600 --> 2:18:24.960
 Like, there's not a set of laws that are enforced based on geography like we have nations now.

2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:30.280
 You can have a set of laws that are enforced in some kind of emergent agreed upon way.

2:18:30.280 --> 2:18:35.080
 So like, basically, I want to go to a hotel and trust that I'll be able to get a room

2:18:35.080 --> 2:18:41.040
 and nobody's going to break down the door and I don't know, take all my vodka.

2:18:41.040 --> 2:18:42.520
 Let's take a different way.

2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:46.700
 If you were worried about a hotel having bedbugs, that's not something the government's involved

2:18:46.700 --> 2:18:47.700
 in.

2:18:47.700 --> 2:18:50.680
 And that's not an unrealistic concern.

2:18:50.680 --> 2:18:54.680
 Are there mechanisms right now that you can undertake to make sure that's not the case?

2:18:54.680 --> 2:18:55.680
 Yes.

2:18:55.680 --> 2:19:01.560
 So it would be the same thing with, I want to make sure I go to a hotel that has security.

2:19:01.560 --> 2:19:03.080
 It would be exactly the same thing.

2:19:03.080 --> 2:19:06.440
 And here's another example, kosher food.

2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:09.880
 People who keep kosher, Jews who keep kosher, their food has to be prepared in a certain

2:19:09.880 --> 2:19:10.880
 way.

2:19:10.880 --> 2:19:13.080
 It has to meet higher rabbinical standards, right?

2:19:13.080 --> 2:19:18.520
 If you look at food, it will have that certification, the K, and there's even competition there.

2:19:18.520 --> 2:19:20.760
 There's the K and there's the stricter U letter.

2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:22.560
 People don't notice it because they're looking for it.

2:19:22.560 --> 2:19:28.520
 You would have companies certifying different locales for their level of security.

2:19:28.520 --> 2:19:34.000
 And it would take an hour to have an app that would, just like when you have toll roads,

2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:35.000
 right?

2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:38.120
 That would tell you you're approaching an unsafe area, you're not going to be covered

2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:41.920
 by us or, and you could have it color coded very easily.

2:19:41.920 --> 2:19:43.920
 We could do this today.

2:19:43.920 --> 2:19:48.640
 But the thing is, you're exactly correct, but there's an assumption of you're already

2:19:48.640 --> 2:19:53.240
 in a, okay, you can give me a different word than stability, but you're already in a place

2:19:53.240 --> 2:19:57.960
 where the forces of the market or whatever can operate.

2:19:57.960 --> 2:20:05.880
 The worry is like, initially, you might not have enough stability to where you can choose

2:20:05.880 --> 2:20:10.200
 one place over the other based on the security that they provide.

2:20:10.200 --> 2:20:14.440
 We already have different types of security here because we have federal government, we

2:20:14.440 --> 2:20:17.520
 have state governments and we have local governments.

2:20:17.520 --> 2:20:20.600
 So and these often contradict each other.

2:20:20.600 --> 2:20:25.340
 So the idea of the implausibility of having different security companies and having it

2:20:25.340 --> 2:20:31.160
 be unstable or impossible, we already have a very rough example of it happening in real

2:20:31.160 --> 2:20:32.160
 life.

2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:41.240
 So how all of it started, the idea of, especially with Yaron, is like it all started with government

2:20:41.240 --> 2:20:47.240
 monopoly of violence saying like, no kids, don't let violence get out of hand.

2:20:47.240 --> 2:20:48.240
 So like how do...

2:20:48.240 --> 2:20:51.840
 We had a civil war where half the country was slaughtered.

2:20:51.840 --> 2:20:56.760
 That's the display of the government not having a monopoly on the violence, right?

2:20:56.760 --> 2:20:58.460
 It's like, that's the split.

2:20:58.460 --> 2:21:02.680
 They had such a monopoly on the violence in the North that it could draft people to fight

2:21:02.680 --> 2:21:03.680
 others that they didn't even care about.

2:21:03.680 --> 2:21:07.600
 But there's a South.

2:21:07.600 --> 2:21:14.900
 It's the government splitting because this is giant iceberg like splitting.

2:21:14.900 --> 2:21:21.600
 The argument is that you would have something like a civil war much more often under anarchism.

2:21:21.600 --> 2:21:27.200
 First of all, if you had a civil war much more often, we don't have that with car companies,

2:21:27.200 --> 2:21:28.200
 right?

2:21:28.200 --> 2:21:32.240
 We don't have a company that says, I refuse to pay or whatever.

2:21:32.240 --> 2:21:33.240
 That's not violence.

2:21:33.240 --> 2:21:34.920
 Sorry to interrupt.

2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:35.920
 And I'm playing...

2:21:35.920 --> 2:21:36.920
 Hold on, let me finish.

2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:42.800
 It is violence because if I'm a company and I'm saying that my cars can run over yours

2:21:42.800 --> 2:21:48.160
 with no consequences, this is a rough analog, why has that not happened?

2:21:48.160 --> 2:21:53.840
 Now in terms of having security system, if I am free, just like switching cell phone

2:21:53.840 --> 2:21:58.480
 to go from one provider to another and this one company as part of its payment doesn't

2:21:58.480 --> 2:22:04.360
 want $50 a month, $100 a month, wants my son, I'm not going to be a member of this security

2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:09.120
 company unless in that case we're dealing with something like a Pearl Harbor or foreign

2:22:09.120 --> 2:22:12.160
 invasion where it's like all hands on deck.

2:22:12.160 --> 2:22:13.760
 Let's go by evidence.

2:22:13.760 --> 2:22:17.960
 How many places do have evidence of that you can have at a large scale?

2:22:17.960 --> 2:22:21.120
 Well, it's absolutely in a large scale.

2:22:21.120 --> 2:22:24.320
 Because it feels like once you don't know the person.

2:22:24.320 --> 2:22:25.320
 What about eBay?

2:22:25.320 --> 2:22:27.480
 eBay is an example of anarchism in practice.

2:22:27.480 --> 2:22:31.420
 I am selling something to someone whose name I don't even know in a country that is nowhere

2:22:31.420 --> 2:22:34.900
 proximate to me and eBay acts as the arbiter.

2:22:34.900 --> 2:22:38.040
 Sometimes I don't get the money after I get screwed over, but that's far less than the

2:22:38.040 --> 2:22:40.160
 taxation that I have to give to the federal government.

2:22:40.160 --> 2:22:43.600
 It's a great point, but it's in the space of finance.

2:22:43.600 --> 2:22:49.200
 If I could, if on eBay you could also commit violence.

2:22:49.200 --> 2:22:50.200
 Theft is violence.

2:22:50.200 --> 2:22:51.200
 No.

2:22:51.200 --> 2:22:57.000
 Yeah, if you give me 10 grand for a car and I don't deliver anything, you've stolen 10

2:22:57.000 --> 2:22:58.000
 grand from me.

2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:06.160
 Yes, but there's something uniquely problematic to being stabbed or shot.

2:23:06.160 --> 2:23:11.720
 The reason you're stabbed or shot is because the government, despite its contract, is refusing

2:23:11.720 --> 2:23:17.640
 to allow second amendment rights to be implemented among the citizenry and the people who are

2:23:17.640 --> 2:23:20.160
 making that the case are the cops.

2:23:20.160 --> 2:23:23.720
 They are the ones who are the traitors to the constitution and should be regarded as

2:23:23.720 --> 2:23:24.720
 such.

2:23:24.720 --> 2:23:31.280
 Whereas private companies are far more amenable to market pressures than the state is.

2:23:31.280 --> 2:23:37.920
 It's a strong argument, but let's actually just briefly mention the scale thing.

2:23:37.920 --> 2:23:40.720
 Why don't you think we should talk about scale?

2:23:40.720 --> 2:23:45.480
 Because if you had anarchism just in Vermont or just in Brooklyn, well, fine.

2:23:45.480 --> 2:23:48.920
 The people make the argument you need anarchism or else China's going to invade, but that's

2:23:48.920 --> 2:23:52.080
 like saying what, do these little countries don't exist?

2:23:52.080 --> 2:23:53.520
 Does San Salvador not exist?

2:23:53.520 --> 2:23:58.080
 Some of them are violent, some of them are not, but the point is they're not all at moments

2:23:58.080 --> 2:23:59.600
 notice about to be invaded.

2:23:59.600 --> 2:24:01.040
 Kuwait's an example of this.

2:24:01.040 --> 2:24:05.760
 Kuwait was invaded by Iraq and very quickly all the big countries who are interested in

2:24:05.760 --> 2:24:11.300
 having your stability, safe space, got involved and kicked him out of Kuwait.

2:24:11.300 --> 2:24:17.200
 If you had this company that was waging war on the population, it seems quite likely that

2:24:17.200 --> 2:24:20.440
 the other organization would get together and put a stop to this because they're not

2:24:20.440 --> 2:24:23.520
 in a position to provide this service of security to their customers.

2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:24.520
 Okay.

2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:30.840
 All of this is brilliant, but didn't you just say that we are actually in a state of anarchism

2:24:30.840 --> 2:24:32.560
 relative to other countries?

2:24:32.560 --> 2:24:33.560
 Yes.

2:24:33.560 --> 2:24:35.360
 So isn't this what emerges?

2:24:35.360 --> 2:24:41.840
 This is what, aren't we actually living in a state of anarchism where we all have agreed?

2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:43.080
 I haven't agreed to anything.

2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:52.640
 So the basic criticism you have is you're born on a geographical area and you're forced

2:24:52.640 --> 2:24:59.840
 to have signed a bunch of stuff just by being born in a particular place.

2:24:59.840 --> 2:25:08.720
 So really, if you could just much easier choose which space of ideas you associated with,

2:25:08.720 --> 2:25:12.000
 that would be actually a state of anarchism.

2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:17.200
 And you could have like a military that you sign up with.

2:25:17.200 --> 2:25:18.320
 Sure.

2:25:18.320 --> 2:25:22.080
 And you're certainly not putting people in prison to get raped because they're selling

2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:23.080
 drugs.

2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:24.080
 Yeah.

2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:30.400
 And you're certainly not allowing everyone else on the street who wants to be there.

2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:32.560
 Can we say something nice about Ayn Rand?

2:25:32.560 --> 2:25:34.680
 I can talk about nice things about her all day.

2:25:34.680 --> 2:25:36.640
 I own her copy of the Fountainhead, you know.

2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:43.920
 What to you is Ayn Rand's best idea, one that you find impactful, insightful, useful for

2:25:43.920 --> 2:25:47.040
 us in modern society that you think about?

2:25:47.040 --> 2:25:54.640
 That your life has meaning and productive work is your highest value.

2:25:54.640 --> 2:26:00.040
 And that you shouldn't apologize, and this is something I despise, you shouldn't apologize

2:26:00.040 --> 2:26:05.780
 for saying, I want to be happy and I'm going to work toward that.

2:26:05.780 --> 2:26:11.400
 And that, there's a few others, that you owe nobody else, some random stranger, a second

2:26:11.400 --> 2:26:12.640
 of your time.

2:26:12.640 --> 2:26:17.320
 You see this a lot on Twitter and social media, people like demanding a debate or demanding

2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:19.800
 you act a certain way and engage with them.

2:26:19.800 --> 2:26:22.120
 You don't owe them anything.

2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:25.880
 So I think those are some of her best ideas.

2:26:25.880 --> 2:26:27.240
 And she teaches you how to think.

2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:29.920
 Ayn Rand does not have all the answers, but she has all the questions.

2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:32.320
 Do you think, what do you think about the whole selfishness thing?

2:26:32.320 --> 2:26:37.520
 I mean, are you triggered by the word selfishness?

2:26:37.520 --> 2:26:41.520
 It's really unfortunate what she does because you were just talking earlier about Moldbug

2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:47.520
 being carelessly, this is indefensible in my opinion.

2:26:47.520 --> 2:26:53.640
 So she talks about the virtue of selfishness and she claims that when people talk about

2:26:53.640 --> 2:26:58.200
 selfishness, they mean concern primarily with the self, they don't.

2:26:58.200 --> 2:27:02.440
 When people talk about selfishness, they mean in a sociopathic way, concern exclusively

2:27:02.440 --> 2:27:03.720
 with oneself.

2:27:03.720 --> 2:27:09.120
 They mean like, oh, if someone is dying on the street, I'm not going to even waste a

2:27:09.120 --> 2:27:11.500
 second saving them because I'm selfish.

2:27:11.500 --> 2:27:15.320
 So she sets up this complete caricature of the term.

2:27:15.320 --> 2:27:21.080
 When she's attacking selflessness in her best sense is when there are people who have no

2:27:21.080 --> 2:27:27.260
 sense of self, they have no values of their own, they have no goals of their own, everything

2:27:27.260 --> 2:27:31.680
 that's in their mind is gotten secondhand from the culture at large and there's nothing

2:27:31.680 --> 2:27:36.560
 unique or special from their perspective worth fighting for.

2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:43.120
 So when she attacks, when she advocates for the self, she basically means self development,

2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:44.960
 self improvement and achievement.

2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:52.360
 So I think that word choice is really false and needlessly off putting.

2:27:52.360 --> 2:27:57.280
 Yeah, controversial perhaps for the purpose of being controversial, I don't know, but

2:27:57.280 --> 2:27:59.360
 it's just, it's not accurate.

2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:01.240
 That's not what people mean by selfishness.

2:28:01.240 --> 2:28:09.280
 Yeah, I would say it's one of the reasons probably her philosophy is not as much adopted

2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:13.960
 or thought about is like, it's funny, like the use of words means something.

2:28:13.960 --> 2:28:17.560
 Exactly as you said, that's my criticism, I mentioned small bug, which could be incorrect

2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:21.520
 criticism by the way, so I'm not exactly sure.

2:28:21.520 --> 2:28:28.000
 Can we talk about some modern day chaos and politics?

2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:29.000
 Yes, please.

2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:30.000
 I hate chaos.

2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:33.680
 Speaking of your hatred for chaos, let's talk about secession.

2:28:33.680 --> 2:28:36.200
 Oh yeah, I was the first one on this trip.

2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:39.960
 Yeah, you were, well, the Civil War beat you to it, but.

2:28:39.960 --> 2:28:41.760
 Sure, in contemporary times.

2:28:41.760 --> 2:28:45.520
 In contemporary times you were, you're on this.

2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:52.960
 Can you talk about what is the idea of secession, what are the odds that it might happen, what

2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:58.640
 does it mean for the United States in some way for different states to secede?

2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:02.760
 Sure, America's been one country with several cultures since the beginning.

2:29:02.760 --> 2:29:07.520
 There's absolutely no reason for someone, this goes back to the anarchist idea, if you

2:29:07.520 --> 2:29:12.460
 despise Donald Trump, which is your prerogative, if you think Joe Biden is a clown, which is

2:29:12.460 --> 2:29:18.060
 your prerogative, there's absolutely no reason for you to be governed by someone you disapprove

2:29:18.060 --> 2:29:19.060
 of.

2:29:19.060 --> 2:29:21.420
 This is an incoherent, nonsensical concept.

2:29:21.420 --> 2:29:25.360
 The only reason we even take it as a hypothesis is that we're trained to the contrary since

2:29:25.360 --> 2:29:26.360
 kindergarten.

2:29:26.360 --> 2:29:33.200
 A secession, I don't know along what lines, but increasingly it's becoming harder and

2:29:33.200 --> 2:29:35.960
 harder for people to have conversations.

2:29:35.960 --> 2:29:39.960
 I think social media, and this is something people despise social media for, I think this

2:29:39.960 --> 2:29:45.200
 is something that social media has done well, which I'm advocating for, is it tends to

2:29:45.200 --> 2:29:49.320
 kind of run through ideas through like an evolutionary process and drive them to the

2:29:49.320 --> 2:29:50.320
 logical conclusion.

2:29:50.320 --> 2:29:54.260
 So it's very hard to be a moderate online because there's going to be people pushing

2:29:54.260 --> 2:29:57.560
 through your ideas through several cycles, and then you're going to end up at some kind

2:29:57.560 --> 2:30:02.060
 of more pure, or if you want to dislike it, extreme perspective.

2:30:02.060 --> 2:30:07.520
 Having these different pockets, it's not really governable because people fundamentally have

2:30:07.520 --> 2:30:09.160
 different worldviews.

2:30:09.160 --> 2:30:11.180
 So I don't know what secession would look like.

2:30:11.180 --> 2:30:17.360
 I think the number is really increasing at an exponential rate.

2:30:17.360 --> 2:30:20.360
 I do not think the number of supporters.

2:30:20.360 --> 2:30:24.640
 I think the claim that this can only be accomplished through violence is false.

2:30:24.640 --> 2:30:26.080
 It's a lie.

2:30:26.080 --> 2:30:31.680
 Just like any divorce doesn't have to involve beating your ex husband or ex wife.

2:30:31.680 --> 2:30:37.840
 And I'm very much looking forward to this becoming a reality far quicker than I ever

2:30:37.840 --> 2:30:38.840
 expected.

2:30:38.840 --> 2:30:48.760
 Do you think there's a value of competing worldviews being forced to be in the same

2:30:48.760 --> 2:30:49.760
 space?

2:30:49.760 --> 2:30:52.320
 Yes, but within a context.

2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:59.160
 So we can agree if group one thinks A, B, and C are the fundamental aspects of the worldview

2:30:59.160 --> 2:31:04.680
 and argue within that, and group two thinks D, E, and F and argue within that.

2:31:04.680 --> 2:31:07.080
 So you're going to have a lot of argument within those space.

2:31:07.080 --> 2:31:12.920
 And if there's fundamental differences in worldview, there's no reason to be, especially

2:31:12.920 --> 2:31:15.600
 when each views the other as completely coherent and unreasonable.

2:31:15.600 --> 2:31:25.800
 Do you think there's a line of fundamentally different worldviews along which a secession

2:31:25.800 --> 2:31:27.520
 will happen in the United States?

2:31:27.520 --> 2:31:34.960
 Is there something that emerges to you as a set of ideas that are like, what do you

2:31:34.960 --> 2:31:35.960
 call that?

2:31:35.960 --> 2:31:38.920
 That you can't come to an agreement over?

2:31:38.920 --> 2:31:40.880
 Yeah, I think that's already happening.

2:31:40.880 --> 2:31:46.760
 Like with the masks, I think there's just two fundamental perspective and each one thinks

2:31:46.760 --> 2:31:51.980
 the other is insane and also deadly and destructive.

2:31:51.980 --> 2:31:56.600
 And I don't see how there's any discourse on this topic.

2:31:56.600 --> 2:31:59.520
 So on the left, I wouldn't say it's left versus right.

2:31:59.520 --> 2:32:04.640
 I think it's people who are pro risk versus people who are risk averse.

2:32:04.640 --> 2:32:07.200
 Yeah, so risk averse.

2:32:07.200 --> 2:32:18.280
 And then there's like a hope for the comfort of the sort of a centralized science giving

2:32:18.280 --> 2:32:23.120
 the truth and then everybody must follow the truth of the proper way to behave.

2:32:23.120 --> 2:32:29.900
 And then there's on the other side, a distrust of any kind of centralized institutions of

2:32:29.900 --> 2:32:37.520
 anybody who might use like control to try to gain greater and greater power and masks

2:32:37.520 --> 2:32:38.760
 are a symbol of that.

2:32:38.760 --> 2:32:48.680
 And even if masks are or are not a effective way of stopping the virus, which is really

2:32:48.680 --> 2:32:53.600
 unfortunate to me from a perspective, I happen to be on a survey paper about masks.

2:32:53.600 --> 2:32:57.840
 Like people don't seem to care about the data or the so on.

2:32:57.840 --> 2:33:05.400
 This has become just a nice point on which to then highlight the difference between the

2:33:05.400 --> 2:33:06.400
 two sides.

2:33:06.400 --> 2:33:07.400
 Yeah, that's really interesting.

2:33:07.400 --> 2:33:12.800
 I mean, it sounds kind of on the face kind of ridiculous that the succession would occur

2:33:12.800 --> 2:33:13.800
 over masks.

2:33:13.800 --> 2:33:18.240
 It wouldn't, but I'm saying this is an example of something where there's a clean break.

2:33:18.240 --> 2:33:24.400
 And risk averse versus someone who's risk seeking, these are just two fundamentally

2:33:24.400 --> 2:33:25.400
 different perspectives.

2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:29.880
 Do you want to have an NHS or do you have one of a market based healthcare system?

2:33:29.880 --> 2:33:32.360
 You can make very valid arguments for both.

2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:34.520
 There's no reason for everyone to be under one.

2:33:34.520 --> 2:33:39.800
 But do you think that's not something that's, you think that's irreconcilable, if that's

2:33:39.800 --> 2:33:46.160
 the word, that that's not in the space of ideas that you can have in the same room together

2:33:46.160 --> 2:33:49.400
 and they fight at each other and ultimately make progress like that.

2:33:49.400 --> 2:33:53.320
 That succession is the more effective way to proceed forward.

2:33:53.320 --> 2:33:54.320
 Yes.

2:33:54.320 --> 2:34:04.440
 But do you see a possible world with no is the answer, meaning I know you say yes, because

2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:07.360
 you kind of lean on the side of freedom and anarchism.

2:34:07.360 --> 2:34:08.360
 Yes.

2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:15.400
 Like you make, you want to make, let me make an argument in terms of divorce, which is

2:34:15.400 --> 2:34:22.080
 in your worldview or your intuition is you want to make secession as frictionless as

2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:23.080
 possible.

2:34:23.080 --> 2:34:24.080
 Of course.

2:34:24.080 --> 2:34:29.200
 And not just like states or whatever, just like you want to choose, you want to be free.

2:34:29.200 --> 2:34:30.200
 Yeah.

2:34:30.200 --> 2:34:31.200
 And peaceful.

2:34:31.200 --> 2:34:39.640
 Let me make my authoritarian, Russian, okay, Papa Stalin argument in terms of relationships.

2:34:39.640 --> 2:34:42.960
 Like when shit goes wrong in a relationship.

2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:45.960
 That's your language.

2:34:45.960 --> 2:34:47.400
 Okay.

2:34:47.400 --> 2:34:50.160
 There's only a place for one Stalin at this table.

2:34:50.160 --> 2:34:51.160
 Okay.

2:34:51.160 --> 2:34:52.160
 Okay.

2:34:52.160 --> 2:34:53.160
 I'll get to be Lenin.

2:34:53.160 --> 2:34:57.040
 Or you get to be like Merkel as our previous discussion with Putin.

2:34:57.040 --> 2:34:58.040
 Okay.

2:34:58.040 --> 2:35:00.960
 Don't let me unleash the hounds.

2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:05.680
 You know, you want to work through some of the troubles before you get divorced.

2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:09.040
 Like you want to do the work in relationships sometimes, like it goes up and down.

2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:11.520
 It's been 200 plus years.

2:35:11.520 --> 2:35:12.520
 It's done.

2:35:12.520 --> 2:35:17.400
 But in the, listen, okay, so it's not a one night stand, but you know.

2:35:17.400 --> 2:35:18.800
 Look at Trump.

2:35:18.800 --> 2:35:20.960
 This I don't see the middle ground.

2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:26.380
 He's either a complete calamity buffoon, or he's been the first great president we've

2:35:26.380 --> 2:35:29.200
 had in like many, many years.

2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:33.480
 So you think that there's something different now than it was 20 years ago?

2:35:33.480 --> 2:35:34.480
 Yes.

2:35:34.480 --> 2:35:37.460
 Social media and access to information.

2:35:37.460 --> 2:35:39.520
 And the division will only increase, you think?

2:35:39.520 --> 2:35:40.520
 Oh yes.

2:35:40.520 --> 2:35:42.920
 So Trump is not an accident of history.

2:35:42.920 --> 2:35:46.800
 So they thought Trump was the river, but he was the dam.

2:35:46.800 --> 2:35:49.020
 Trump was the dam.

2:35:49.020 --> 2:35:50.960
 They thought he was the river.

2:35:50.960 --> 2:35:55.840
 So in that analogy, Trump being gone makes things worse.

2:35:55.840 --> 2:35:56.840
 Yes.

2:35:56.840 --> 2:36:01.220
 For that perspective, because now things are really going to hit the fan.

2:36:01.220 --> 2:36:04.520
 So what are the odds of secession?

2:36:04.520 --> 2:36:06.880
 I don't know.

2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:12.800
 And my desperate hope is that it's peaceful, but I think the number of people who are becoming

2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:17.640
 very comfortable with the violence is making me very unsettled.

2:36:17.640 --> 2:36:21.920
 So I see words as violence and your Twitter.

2:36:21.920 --> 2:36:27.040
 It's like Hiroshima times a million.

2:36:27.040 --> 2:36:31.360
 Sometimes I curl up in the corner crying after I check your Twitter feed.

2:36:31.360 --> 2:36:39.880
 So in all seriousness, you think it's possible to do nonviolent secession?

2:36:39.880 --> 2:36:41.920
 It's like a Czechoslovakia.

2:36:41.920 --> 2:36:43.200
 Look at Brexit.

2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:45.200
 Brexit was a secession.

2:36:45.200 --> 2:36:46.200
 Right.

2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:50.800
 Right, so you can have a civil war did not need to be fought.

2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:52.960
 That would have been a nonviolent secession.

2:36:52.960 --> 2:36:55.820
 And if you worry about slavery, you could have bought off all the slaves, import them

2:36:55.820 --> 2:36:56.980
 to the North.

2:36:56.980 --> 2:36:59.760
 It still would have been cheaper and less loss of life and probably better for race

2:36:59.760 --> 2:37:00.760
 relations.

2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:01.760
 Yeah.

2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:05.200
 I don't know enough history to, to wonder about like how the civil war could have been

2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:06.200
 avoided.

2:37:06.200 --> 2:37:11.020
 Well, that's how is a well conversation.

2:37:11.020 --> 2:37:12.020
 So like, no, no.

2:37:12.020 --> 2:37:14.560
 If they want to secede, say, look, here's what we're going to do.

2:37:14.560 --> 2:37:18.160
 We're going to let you secede, but you have to end slavery.

2:37:18.160 --> 2:37:19.320
 They seceded because of slavery.

2:37:19.320 --> 2:37:20.320
 Here's the other thing.

2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:23.280
 There's like this, some circles of conservatism have this myth that, oh, it wasn't about slavery,

2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:24.480
 it was about state's rights.

2:37:24.480 --> 2:37:28.520
 Well, if you go back, every state, when they seceded, released the press release.

2:37:28.520 --> 2:37:31.000
 And they said explicitly, we're doing this because of slavery.

2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:34.080
 So that is an abomination that needs to be taken care of.

2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:37.960
 But other countries have ended slavery peacefully.

2:37:37.960 --> 2:37:42.360
 One of the ways to do it is pay them by all, and we ended up doing this after the war.

2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:47.680
 I think the South people got reparations, the slave owners, it was just insane.

2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:48.680
 Bring them North.

2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:50.520
 You want to go to Canada, whatever.

2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:51.520
 And you agree.

2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:53.900
 And that's our peace treaty.

2:37:53.900 --> 2:37:56.260
 Because the people who died weren't the slave owners.

2:37:56.260 --> 2:37:57.920
 It was white trash.

2:37:57.920 --> 2:38:02.080
 And it was, that's who always, and I hate that that's the term, I can't think of a better

2:38:02.080 --> 2:38:05.100
 one, but that's who always ends up fighting these wars often disproportionately.

2:38:05.100 --> 2:38:07.520
 It's poor people and uneducated people.

2:38:07.520 --> 2:38:09.800
 And I don't, I did not regard them as cannon fodder.

2:38:09.800 --> 2:38:12.800
 I think it's horrible.

2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:14.120
 So what would it look like?

2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:16.000
 There would be two founding documents?

2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:18.000
 Yeah, they had their constitution.

2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:20.760
 Actually, I don't know the history of that.

2:38:20.760 --> 2:38:24.800
 Yeah, they had a constitution, but it was much more decentralized.

2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:35.520
 If secession doesn't happen, you said that Donald Trump was the dam, not the river.

2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:37.960
 That sounds like Walt Whitman or something.

2:38:37.960 --> 2:38:38.960
 It's poetry.

2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:39.960
 Okay.

2:38:39.960 --> 2:38:44.480
 Are you flirting with me?

2:38:44.480 --> 2:38:45.880
 You know us, we don't flirt.

2:38:45.880 --> 2:38:50.480
 We just club and drag you to the cave.

2:38:50.480 --> 2:38:53.080
 We hammer and sickle.

2:38:53.080 --> 2:38:54.600
 And you don't want to know about the sickle.

2:38:54.600 --> 2:38:56.080
 It's not good cob, bad cob.

2:38:56.080 --> 2:38:59.320
 It's bad cup for a sickle.

2:38:59.320 --> 2:39:00.320
 Yeah.

2:39:00.320 --> 2:39:07.560
 What do you think 2024 looks like in terms of the candidates?

2:39:07.560 --> 2:39:11.320
 It's going to be Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate.

2:39:11.320 --> 2:39:15.680
 I'm really looking forward to Ted Cruz versus Mike Pence, because they're both very good

2:39:15.680 --> 2:39:16.680
 at debate.

2:39:16.680 --> 2:39:19.240
 That would be interesting to see how they differentiate themselves.

2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:24.600
 But honestly, I don't, I mean, things are going to get really ugly really soon.

2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:26.160
 What about Donald Trump coming back?

2:39:26.160 --> 2:39:28.480
 He's not going to do it.

2:39:28.480 --> 2:39:33.360
 So things, in my opinion, I think things are going to be really, really crazy in 2021.

2:39:33.360 --> 2:39:35.960
 And talking about the dam being gone, like 2021.

2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:37.600
 So this year coming up.

2:39:37.600 --> 2:39:38.600
 Oh yeah.

2:39:38.600 --> 2:39:39.600
 It's going to be complete.

2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:40.600
 It's going to be complete mayhem.

2:39:40.600 --> 2:39:45.440
 What do you think, like prediction wise, and this is empirical.

2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:51.640
 What do you think Donald Trump's Twitter feed looks like in 2021?

2:39:51.640 --> 2:39:57.720
 Like if we're at the end of 2021, we'll look back and see like, what was the, you know,

2:39:57.720 --> 2:40:01.800
 Obama gate exclamation points or we won.

2:40:01.800 --> 2:40:07.720
 He is going to be, for the first time in history, holding the Republican party accountable to

2:40:07.720 --> 2:40:10.000
 the base.

2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:11.600
 We've never had that happen before.

2:40:11.600 --> 2:40:17.440
 I think he's going to be holding their feet to the fire, radicalizing them.

2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:21.640
 And given that they have the Senate, where it's going to be 50 50, the Democrats have

2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:24.080
 a three seat majority in the House.

2:40:24.080 --> 2:40:26.920
 This is not a governing coalition for either.

2:40:26.920 --> 2:40:27.920
 It's going to be complete mayhem.

2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:29.360
 What does that actually look like?

2:40:29.360 --> 2:40:33.960
 What are the key values you think that he's going to try to push?

2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:36.600
 I think it's just going to be very contrarian.

2:40:36.600 --> 2:40:39.580
 He's going to be holding them accountable in terms of budgeting, even though he never

2:40:39.580 --> 2:40:41.080
 did that as president.

2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:44.760
 I think in terms of some kind of nominations, here's the thing.

2:40:44.760 --> 2:40:53.880
 This is the first time since Nixon, 50 years and things weren't as politicized then, where

2:40:53.880 --> 2:40:57.120
 an incoming president doesn't have control of the Senate.

2:40:57.120 --> 2:41:01.020
 The Senate has the vote over cabinet positions.

2:41:01.020 --> 2:41:08.760
 I do not see a possibility of them not trying to pick a fight on one or two of these nominations.

2:41:08.760 --> 2:41:10.720
 And especially as revenge for Kavanaugh.

2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:12.720
 This is going to get very bloody very quickly.

2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:16.100
 And I think Mitch McConnell, there's a sadistic side to him.

2:41:16.100 --> 2:41:19.400
 He revels in being the brakes on the car.

2:41:19.400 --> 2:41:22.640
 And I think the base, it's just going to be throwing just, they're going to want some

2:41:22.640 --> 2:41:23.640
 bone.

2:41:23.640 --> 2:41:25.900
 It's like, oh yeah, we eliminated this one person.

2:41:25.900 --> 2:41:28.180
 So that's going to get really ugly really quickly.

2:41:28.180 --> 2:41:35.640
 You see it being quite divisive, like the division increasing, not stabilizing or decreasing.

2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:37.360
 And I'll be doing my part.

2:41:37.360 --> 2:41:42.800
 I know you'll be doing my part, but I'm trying to do my part and like trying to be like,

2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:50.960
 to me, the division is shouting over people like Elon Musk, people who are actually building

2:41:50.960 --> 2:41:53.840
 stuff and like accomplishing things in this world in terms of like.

2:41:53.840 --> 2:41:56.120
 Elon said he took the red pill.

2:41:56.120 --> 2:42:03.080
 No, see, you're talking about the, I'm talking about, forget Elon, SpaceX and Tesla and actually

2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:07.920
 the good sides of like some of the things that Google is doing.

2:42:07.920 --> 2:42:11.800
 Like actually building things, like making the world's information searchable, all that

2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:12.800
 kind of stuff.

2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:18.360
 Like all this stuff, you know, making actually the world a better place.

2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:21.000
 There's a bunch of technologies that are increasing our quality of life.

2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:22.640
 All this, all that kind of stuff.

2:42:22.640 --> 2:42:29.440
 I feel like they get like not much credit or in our public discourse because of the

2:42:29.440 --> 2:42:30.440
 division.

2:42:30.440 --> 2:42:36.000
 The division is just like, it's clouding our ability to concentrate on what's awesome about

2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:37.000
 this world.

2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.960
 Well, you know what would eliminate the division, right?

2:42:39.960 --> 2:42:40.960
 Succession.

2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:41.960
 Yeah.

2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:47.560
 See, I don't, I don't, it's hard for me to disagree.

2:42:47.560 --> 2:42:57.360
 It's hard for me to disagree because, but at the same time, succession, I'm a romantic

2:42:57.360 --> 2:42:59.720
 at heart and divorce breaks my heart.

2:42:59.720 --> 2:43:00.720
 Cool.

2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:07.400
 But do you want to live in a country where Joe Rogan is regarded as an example of someone

2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:09.200
 who's spreading white supremacy?

2:43:09.200 --> 2:43:10.200
 I don't.

2:43:10.200 --> 2:43:13.960
 Well, but see, I feel like that's not the country we live in.

2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:14.960
 That's just.

2:43:14.960 --> 2:43:18.960
 The New York Times did it, the cathedral does it on a regular basis.

2:43:18.960 --> 2:43:24.960
 Well, the cathedral is, okay, the cathedral, I guess you can maybe define the cathedral,

2:43:24.960 --> 2:43:28.720
 but it's like the centralized institutions that have like a story that they're trying

2:43:28.720 --> 2:43:29.720
 to sell and so on.

2:43:29.720 --> 2:43:33.040
 Yeah, this is mold books concept, but yeah, they basically are set the limits of permissible

2:43:33.040 --> 2:43:35.760
 discourse and create a narrative for the population to follow.

2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:37.760
 But to me, that's a minority of people.

2:43:37.760 --> 2:43:42.000
 Yeah, minorities always controlling everything in any country, the vast majority of the masses

2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:43.000
 have no thought.

2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:45.000
 But minorities can be overthrown and the.

2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:46.560
 Sure, the circulation of the elites, yeah.

2:43:46.560 --> 2:43:51.760
 The way the, no, no, no, and that's why the, what progress looks like is ridiculous people

2:43:51.760 --> 2:43:52.760
 take power.

2:43:52.760 --> 2:43:53.760
 Yes.

2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:58.920
 And then they get annoying and new ridiculous people that are a little bit better overthrow

2:43:58.920 --> 2:43:59.920
 the previous.

2:43:59.920 --> 2:44:04.400
 No, I think progress happens despite the people who are in power, not because of them.

2:44:04.400 --> 2:44:05.400
 Right.

2:44:05.400 --> 2:44:08.880
 And so why is this a succession?

2:44:08.880 --> 2:44:11.480
 So is it always about overthrowing the powerful?

2:44:11.480 --> 2:44:12.600
 Is that how progress happens?

2:44:12.600 --> 2:44:14.760
 No, I think progress happens despite the powerful.

2:44:14.760 --> 2:44:18.560
 The powerful are going to do what's in their power to maintain their power and they're

2:44:18.560 --> 2:44:21.960
 going to fight innovation because it's a threat to their control.

2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:24.500
 There's always going to be the New York Times of the world, right?

2:44:24.500 --> 2:44:26.560
 There's always going to be those, those people that haven't heard.

2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:28.960
 Sure, let them have their own country.

2:44:28.960 --> 2:44:30.080
 So it's two countries.

2:44:30.080 --> 2:44:33.200
 One has Joe Rogan, the other one has the New York Times.

2:44:33.200 --> 2:44:34.780
 That's basically what's happening right now.

2:44:34.780 --> 2:44:40.320
 It just geographically doesn't map out very well, but culturally, yes.

2:44:40.320 --> 2:44:41.600
 But that's just cultural stuff.

2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:43.400
 Like there's a layer of public discourse.

2:44:43.400 --> 2:44:44.400
 Okay.

2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:48.040
 I don't mean like that's what we're operating under now, but there's actual like progress

2:44:48.040 --> 2:44:53.160
 being made, like roads being built, hospitals being run, all those kinds of things like

2:44:53.160 --> 2:44:55.260
 different innovations.

2:44:55.260 --> 2:44:59.080
 That seems like secession is counterproductive to that.

2:44:59.080 --> 2:45:01.720
 Right, because one country would have all the roads and the other would have all the

2:45:01.720 --> 2:45:02.720
 hospitals.

2:45:02.720 --> 2:45:03.720
 That's a great point.

2:45:03.720 --> 2:45:05.440
 No, that's not, that's not the point I'm trying to make.

2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:10.720
 It's just like, it just feels like the division that we're experiencing in the space of ideas

2:45:10.720 --> 2:45:17.360
 could be constructive and productive for, for building better roads and better hospitals

2:45:17.360 --> 2:45:21.480
 as opposed to like using that division to separate the countries.

2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:25.760
 They're all going to have to solve the same problems, it feels like.

2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:28.680
 Sure but they can solve them differently and compete that way.

2:45:28.680 --> 2:45:30.160
 Mass is a great example.

2:45:30.160 --> 2:45:31.160
 Yeah.

2:45:31.160 --> 2:45:32.160
 We're seeing that right now.

2:45:32.160 --> 2:45:34.600
 Different countries have different mass mandates and things like this.

2:45:34.600 --> 2:45:39.920
 And the competition within the same structure, within the same founding documents and same

2:45:39.920 --> 2:45:42.480
 institutions is not effective, you think?

2:45:42.480 --> 2:45:43.480
 As effective as separating.

2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:48.160
 It is effective but there is a certain point, which I think we have long passed, where there

2:45:48.160 --> 2:45:51.920
 is not a governing consensus ideologically or culturally.

2:45:51.920 --> 2:45:54.200
 Let me ask you a fun question, okay?

2:45:54.200 --> 2:45:55.200
 Knock knock.

2:45:55.200 --> 2:45:56.200
 Who's there?

2:45:56.200 --> 2:45:57.200
 Mars.

2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:03.560
 God of war.

2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:06.100
 The other one.

2:46:06.100 --> 2:46:07.100
 The planet.

2:46:07.100 --> 2:46:08.100
 Yeah.

2:46:08.100 --> 2:46:17.280
 So, there is a kind of captivating notion that we might, I'm excited by it, the human

2:46:17.280 --> 2:46:19.520
 being stepping foot on Mars.

2:46:19.520 --> 2:46:30.400
 That to me is, it's like one of those things that feels like it's, why do we want to engage

2:46:30.400 --> 2:46:32.920
 in space exploration?

2:46:32.920 --> 2:46:39.360
 But I'm a little bit with Elon Musk on this, which is, it's obvious that eventually if

2:46:39.360 --> 2:46:45.720
 human species is to survive, it's going to have to innovate in ways that includes the

2:46:45.720 --> 2:46:46.720
 space.

2:46:46.720 --> 2:46:47.720
 Okay.

2:46:47.720 --> 2:46:53.440
 Like, there's a lot of things we're not able to predict yet that if we push ourselves to

2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:59.120
 the limits of space, like new ideas will come that'll be obvious a hundred years from now

2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:01.560
 and then we're not even imagining now.

2:47:01.560 --> 2:47:07.200
 And colonizing Mars, that idea that seems ridiculous, exceptionally difficult, impossibly

2:47:07.200 --> 2:47:14.120
 expensive is something that is actually going to be seen as obvious in retrospect and that

2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:15.120
 we should engage in.

2:47:15.120 --> 2:47:16.120
 Okay.

2:47:16.120 --> 2:47:18.520
 That's just to contextualize things.

2:47:18.520 --> 2:47:27.340
 The fun idea and experiment from a philosophical and political sense is what kind of government,

2:47:27.340 --> 2:47:32.680
 how do you orchestrate a government when you go to Mars, like we don't get too many chances

2:47:32.680 --> 2:47:39.480
 like this, but how do you build new systems, not in place of old ones, but in a place with

2:47:39.480 --> 2:47:41.740
 no system previous have existed?

2:47:41.740 --> 2:47:45.520
 I think organically, I hate that word, but that's the correct word.

2:47:45.520 --> 2:47:48.560
 You would have to figure out, I mean, that's how America was built.

2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:52.120
 You had the, it was a Jamestown colony and they tried to do communism here and it completely

2:47:52.120 --> 2:47:55.620
 failed and they went to a more free market system with the second wave of colonists is

2:47:55.620 --> 2:47:57.420
 my understanding.

2:47:57.420 --> 2:48:04.120
 For Mars, I mean, it depends on the population, who the population was, the number of people.

2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:05.660
 I don't know.

2:48:05.660 --> 2:48:10.860
 These are all kind of hypotheticals that I don't really have any good insight in whatsoever.

2:48:10.860 --> 2:48:12.080
 I'm not a space person.

2:48:12.080 --> 2:48:13.080
 I hate astronomy.

2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:14.720
 Like I hate it.

2:48:14.720 --> 2:48:18.020
 So a lot of people look up to the stars and they're filled with awe and wonder about the

2:48:18.020 --> 2:48:22.640
 mystery of the universe and you look up to the stars and you feel what?

2:48:22.640 --> 2:48:23.640
 I'm not looking up.

2:48:23.640 --> 2:48:25.440
 I'm looking at the earth.

2:48:25.440 --> 2:48:33.000
 If you look at what's, I'd much rather given a choice between Mars and the deep sea.

2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:36.440
 I'd much rather spend a week at the deep sea and all the life forms that are down there

2:48:36.440 --> 2:48:38.480
 because they're literal aliens.

2:48:38.480 --> 2:48:41.760
 It's like things that are not literal, but they're unimaginable to us.

2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:42.920
 Some of the things down there.

2:48:42.920 --> 2:48:43.920
 Yeah, that's true.

2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:47.640
 To me, it's an interesting thought experiment to see when you have 10 people, when you have

2:48:47.640 --> 2:48:53.520
 a hundred people, how do you build an effective, you know, this is actually really useful for

2:48:53.520 --> 2:48:54.520
 a company, right?

2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:57.960
 How do you build an effective company that does things?

2:48:57.960 --> 2:49:02.360
 It's not an obvious, despite everybody being really certain about everything in this, in

2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:07.040
 this modern world, to me, it's not obvious, like how do you run successfully as a group

2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:08.040
 of people?

2:49:08.040 --> 2:49:09.040
 I agree.

2:49:09.040 --> 2:49:10.040
 I agree.

2:49:10.040 --> 2:49:11.040
 That's what I'm saying.

2:49:11.040 --> 2:49:15.140
 It also organic means you have to look at who the people are and tailor the organization

2:49:15.140 --> 2:49:17.640
 to them as opposed to try to impose something.

2:49:17.640 --> 2:49:19.520
 But you get to also select people.

2:49:19.520 --> 2:49:20.520
 Right.

2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:22.280
 Cause it's not going to be open borders on Mars.

2:49:22.280 --> 2:49:23.880
 Oh, right.

2:49:23.880 --> 2:49:27.320
 I was going to say when you have one country, it's all open borders.

2:49:27.320 --> 2:49:28.320
 Yeah, you're right.

2:49:28.320 --> 2:49:32.160
 They're from outer space, right?

2:49:32.160 --> 2:49:33.720
 Some say they're aliens already there.

2:49:33.720 --> 2:49:35.360
 So you're going to have to negotiate that.

2:49:35.360 --> 2:49:36.360
 Sure.

2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:37.360
 We're aliens.

2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:38.880
 So we're aliens to somebody.

2:49:38.880 --> 2:49:39.880
 We're legal aliens.

2:49:39.880 --> 2:49:42.560
 Do you think there's alien civilizations out there?

2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:43.560
 Yes.

2:49:43.560 --> 2:49:44.560
 Of course.

2:49:44.560 --> 2:49:48.080
 What do you think is their system of government anarchism?

2:49:48.080 --> 2:49:51.160
 Cause they're advanced.

2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:53.200
 Do you honestly think there's intelligent life forms out there?

2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:54.200
 Of course.

2:49:54.200 --> 2:49:55.200
 It's the math.

2:49:55.200 --> 2:49:56.200
 It's impossible that there isn't.

2:49:56.200 --> 2:50:03.120
 So what do you make of all the stories of UFO sightings, all that kind of stuff?

2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:05.320
 Do you think they've visited earth?

2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:06.560
 Yes.

2:50:06.560 --> 2:50:10.700
 My grandfather was an air traffic controller in the Soviet Union and he said they would

2:50:10.700 --> 2:50:17.080
 often see these things that were not operating the way we knew vehicles operate.

2:50:17.080 --> 2:50:18.800
 So that's good enough for me.

2:50:18.800 --> 2:50:23.880
 So I mean, do you think government is in possession of some, like, what do you think government

2:50:23.880 --> 2:50:26.160
 is doing with this kind of information?

2:50:26.160 --> 2:50:36.040
 Do you think somebody has any understanding of UFO sightings or any kind of information

2:50:36.040 --> 2:50:41.520
 about extraterrestrial life forms that are not known to the public?

2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:42.520
 Yes.

2:50:42.520 --> 2:50:43.520
 That's indisputably true.

2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:48.360
 I think the fact that so many of these sightings are from aerodynamic professionals, like

2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:53.080
 pilots and things of that nature, they are people who've seen it all, who are reputable.

2:50:53.080 --> 2:50:58.720
 If they are on record saying, I've seen things that don't make sense, and both the Russians

2:50:58.720 --> 2:51:03.160
 and the Americans thought it was the other one, that says something.

2:51:03.160 --> 2:51:04.880
 Shouldn't that be a bigger problem?

2:51:04.880 --> 2:51:09.520
 Shouldn't that be bigger news and a bigger problem if government is in fact hiding it?

2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:13.360
 I guess, but like, what are they going to do with that information?

2:51:13.360 --> 2:51:14.360
 It's a good question.

2:51:14.360 --> 2:51:22.200
 Like, if a UFO, if an extraterrestrial spacecraft, which most likely would be like a crappy space,

2:51:22.200 --> 2:51:28.080
 like it wouldn't be the actual aliens, it would be like some drone probe ship.

2:51:28.080 --> 2:51:29.080
 AI.

2:51:29.080 --> 2:51:30.080
 Yeah.

2:51:30.080 --> 2:51:31.080
 Yeah.

2:51:31.080 --> 2:51:32.080
 Yeah.

2:51:32.080 --> 2:51:33.280
 So if that, like, what would you do with that information?

2:51:33.280 --> 2:51:41.520
 As somebody that's in charge of, you know, like you see how badly WHO fumbled the discussion

2:51:41.520 --> 2:51:42.520
 of masks.

2:51:42.520 --> 2:51:43.520
 Masks?

2:51:43.520 --> 2:51:44.520
 Yeah.

2:51:44.520 --> 2:51:45.520
 Yeah.

2:51:45.520 --> 2:51:47.560
 Masks is one of them, but everything really in terms of communicating with the public

2:51:47.560 --> 2:51:51.040
 honestly about what they know, what they don't know.

2:51:51.040 --> 2:51:53.040
 And that's a trivial one.

2:51:53.040 --> 2:51:54.040
 Right.

2:51:54.040 --> 2:51:58.080
 I don't, I don't, I don't know.

2:51:58.080 --> 2:52:03.600
 There certainly feel incompetent at being able to communicate effectively with the public

2:52:03.600 --> 2:52:11.320
 about something much more difficult, much more full of mystery, like a UFO, a thing,

2:52:11.320 --> 2:52:14.120
 a piece of material that's out of this earth.

2:52:14.120 --> 2:52:17.760
 Forget like organic material.

2:52:17.760 --> 2:52:19.400
 I don't, I don't know.

2:52:19.400 --> 2:52:22.520
 To me, I just, so from a scientist perspective, it would be beautiful.

2:52:22.520 --> 2:52:25.680
 It would be inspiring to reveal this to the world.

2:52:25.680 --> 2:52:29.000
 Here's the mystery and make it completely public.

2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:30.000
 Share it with China.

2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:31.000
 Share it with everybody.

2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:35.120
 I think there is a domino effect where the concern would be what else are you hiding

2:52:35.120 --> 2:52:36.120
 from us?

2:52:36.120 --> 2:52:39.160
 And at that point, if you said, no, no, no, this is everything, people wouldn't believe

2:52:39.160 --> 2:52:43.080
 you and they would, you can't blame them for not believing them.

2:52:43.080 --> 2:52:45.800
 Ah, yeah.

2:52:45.800 --> 2:52:46.800
 And then it'd be like, show us the aliens.

2:52:46.800 --> 2:52:47.800
 They'd be like, we don't have them.

2:52:47.800 --> 2:52:48.800
 We just have the craft.

2:52:48.800 --> 2:52:50.800
 You're lying.

2:52:50.800 --> 2:52:55.920
 Speaking of aliens, offline, you mentioned elves.

2:52:55.920 --> 2:52:57.000
 Yeah.

2:52:57.000 --> 2:52:58.000
 And psychedelics.

2:52:58.000 --> 2:52:59.280
 Yeah.

2:52:59.280 --> 2:53:09.080
 What do you think about psychedelics in terms of the kind of places that can take your mind?

2:53:09.080 --> 2:53:11.640
 The kind of journey it can take you on.

2:53:11.640 --> 2:53:17.880
 Like what do you think, what do you think the psychedelics do to the human mind and

2:53:17.880 --> 2:53:22.660
 what does that say about the capacity of the human mind and just in general, like the mysteries

2:53:22.660 --> 2:53:23.660
 of all that's out there?

2:53:23.660 --> 2:53:26.320
 I don't know that we understand what they do.

2:53:26.320 --> 2:53:32.820
 The way I heard it explained to me is that much of the human mind isn't about receiving

2:53:32.820 --> 2:53:36.080
 information but blocking information, right?

2:53:36.080 --> 2:53:39.600
 Because we're so, there's so much data coming in any moment that you basically have to train

2:53:39.600 --> 2:53:42.880
 yourself to see and to hear only what you want to see and to hear.

2:53:42.880 --> 2:53:46.480
 And that what psychedelics do is they tear that away and suddenly you're much more aware

2:53:46.480 --> 2:53:49.240
 of what's out there and also you're going to be noticing patterns that you hadn't noticed

2:53:49.240 --> 2:53:50.240
 before.

2:53:50.240 --> 2:53:56.160
 I know you had that researcher on the show and he kind of discussed this at some length.

2:53:56.160 --> 2:54:01.200
 I mean, Rogan is probably the person who popularized DMT more than, well, he's obviously the person

2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:03.840
 who's popularized DMT more than anything.

2:54:03.840 --> 2:54:10.240
 I don't know anyone who had, even the researchers who have anything close to a coherent explanation

2:54:10.240 --> 2:54:15.840
 of why this drug, which exists everywhere, would have this very specific, very extreme

2:54:15.840 --> 2:54:21.320
 effect on so many people who are going to be experiencing such bizarre consequences

2:54:21.320 --> 2:54:22.960
 as a result of it.

2:54:22.960 --> 2:54:26.680
 I think it's very interesting that this is talking about the government, you know, the

2:54:26.680 --> 2:54:33.320
 CIA started experimenting with LSD, they killed one of their own people, drove them to suicide

2:54:33.320 --> 2:54:39.480
 and there was a lot of research into, Terrence McKenna talks about this, into this field

2:54:39.480 --> 2:54:43.840
 and then very quickly, once it got into the mainstream, they shut it down, even though

2:54:43.840 --> 2:54:47.400
 it's not addictive, it doesn't cause you to go crazy or anything like that and there was

2:54:47.400 --> 2:54:52.560
 a lot of propaganda against its use, which I think, thankfully, is now somewhat receding.

2:54:52.560 --> 2:54:56.400
 I think Colorado just legalized mushrooms, something like that and I think it'll be very

2:54:56.400 --> 2:54:58.480
 interesting to see what happens as a result of this.

2:54:58.480 --> 2:55:03.320
 Yeah, and the interesting thing is, there doesn't seem to be, for certain psychedelics

2:55:03.320 --> 2:55:09.880
 like psilocybin, like mushrooms, there doesn't seem to be a lethal dose, which is fascinating,

2:55:09.880 --> 2:55:17.280
 like Matthew Johnson, the Hopkins professor that you mentioned, I'm definitely going to

2:55:17.280 --> 2:55:24.960
 do one of his studies, it's a really cool way to do what he calls a heroic dose of psilocybin.

2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:27.320
 Oh, I want to do it, what do I have to do?

2:55:27.320 --> 2:55:28.320
 Let's do it.

2:55:28.320 --> 2:55:32.440
 A heroic dose, holy crap.

2:55:32.440 --> 2:55:36.560
 Yeah, but it's safe.

2:55:36.560 --> 2:55:37.840
 How many grams are we talking?

2:55:37.840 --> 2:55:41.400
 I don't know, but it's just, it's big.

2:55:41.400 --> 2:55:42.400
 He says that...

2:55:42.400 --> 2:55:45.400
 This is going to have a kick.

2:55:45.400 --> 2:55:46.400
 Yeah.

2:55:46.400 --> 2:55:51.800
 He says that, I mean, he also studies cocaine, he studies all kinds of drugs and he's like,

2:55:51.800 --> 2:55:52.800
 the psilocybin is...

2:55:52.800 --> 2:55:55.680
 A heroic dose of cocaine kills you.

2:55:55.680 --> 2:56:01.080
 You can't, so you can't even come close, so he says the problem with studying cocaine

2:56:01.080 --> 2:56:08.200
 is you have people who are addicted to cocaine or war or so on, you give them the kind of

2:56:08.200 --> 2:56:14.520
 doses that we can and part of the study is like, it's nothing to them.

2:56:14.520 --> 2:56:22.280
 Psilocybin is the only one where even daily users or regular users are blown away by the

2:56:22.280 --> 2:56:25.160
 dose they give them.

2:56:25.160 --> 2:56:35.160
 So you can go to Russia in your mind, you can go to outer space, maybe you'll become

2:56:35.160 --> 2:56:39.240
 an astronaut or astronomer after all.

2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:42.080
 Maybe I'll be Baba Yaga.

2:56:42.080 --> 2:56:46.760
 I'll let people look that one up.

2:56:46.760 --> 2:56:50.360
 What is love?

2:56:50.360 --> 2:56:57.280
 What do you think this thing is like our attachment to other human beings?

2:56:57.280 --> 2:57:00.200
 And is it something that we should give to just a few people?

2:57:00.200 --> 2:57:01.960
 Yes, that's for sure.

2:57:01.960 --> 2:57:07.440
 When I was working with DL Hughley in his book, he didn't use the term, but he was describing

2:57:07.440 --> 2:57:10.000
 like low key depression.

2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:15.120
 And he talked about how he was in the airport and he noticed a girl had a red dress and

2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:17.680
 he went up and thanked her and she was like, what are you thanking for?

2:57:17.680 --> 2:57:22.040
 And he had realized he hadn't registered color in like weeks.

2:57:22.040 --> 2:57:28.800
 And I think love is like that when you see someone and you just like, oh, like your eyes

2:57:28.800 --> 2:57:29.800
 are open.

2:57:29.800 --> 2:57:34.260
 Like this is something I've never seen before or I want more of this, that kind of thing.

2:57:34.260 --> 2:57:40.920
 It really disorients and reorients your thinking.

2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:45.360
 Don't you find that like the world is full of that like nonstop?

2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:47.040
 It's not just like a person either.

2:57:47.040 --> 2:57:48.040
 It's like...

2:57:48.040 --> 2:57:53.320
 Yes, but when it's in a person, it's a whole other level because it's like, I could have,

2:57:53.320 --> 2:57:55.060
 this is going to be great for years.

2:57:55.060 --> 2:57:57.760
 It's like, you know, every day it's something new.

2:57:57.760 --> 2:58:00.560
 I mean, that is, and that is rare.

2:58:00.560 --> 2:58:01.560
 You think it's rare?

2:58:01.560 --> 2:58:02.560
 I mean...

2:58:02.560 --> 2:58:06.120
 Find someone who you could talk to them for years and not run out of things to talk to.

2:58:06.120 --> 2:58:07.120
 Oh, that's true for years.

2:58:07.120 --> 2:58:08.120
 Yes.

2:58:08.120 --> 2:58:09.120
 Yes.

2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:10.120
 That's rare.

2:58:10.120 --> 2:58:14.440
 And know that they really, if you leave the room, they will do right by you.

2:58:14.440 --> 2:58:16.040
 That's really rare.

2:58:16.040 --> 2:58:27.080
 Well, from a Russian perspective, you just don't give them another choice.

2:58:27.080 --> 2:58:33.780
 This is Tavadish New Year, New Year's Eve.

2:58:33.780 --> 2:58:41.080
 So you talked about secession and the world burning down and you holding the match at

2:58:41.080 --> 2:58:44.160
 the end, standing with a big smile on your face.

2:58:44.160 --> 2:58:45.160
 Yes.

2:58:45.160 --> 2:58:47.520
 I was serious.

2:58:47.520 --> 2:58:54.940
 But let me ask you, if it doesn't include flame and secession and destruction and laughing

2:58:54.940 --> 2:59:01.600
 malice and makeup and a white suit at the end, how do we bring more kindness and love

2:59:01.600 --> 2:59:03.680
 to the world in 2021?

2:59:03.680 --> 2:59:05.040
 Oh, easy.

2:59:05.040 --> 2:59:09.480
 Be comfortable saying, I want to be happy.

2:59:09.480 --> 2:59:16.200
 And if there's someone who interjects and gives you attitude, arms lengthen.

2:59:16.200 --> 2:59:19.600
 Surround yourself with people who also want to be happy.

2:59:19.600 --> 2:59:21.000
 Here's a great example.

2:59:21.000 --> 2:59:25.880
 My buddy Chris Williamson, who I've mentioned before, he's a podcaster, does Modern Wisdom.

2:59:25.880 --> 2:59:30.240
 He's an awesome dude and we became very close friends this past year.

2:59:30.240 --> 2:59:35.720
 And he was in Dubai recently and he sent me pics from Dubai by the pool, just loving life.

2:59:35.720 --> 2:59:41.840
 And it took me a week and then it clicked in my head and I'm like, you know what?

2:59:41.840 --> 2:59:48.260
 For some other people, if they saw him under remodel at the pool, they would think this

2:59:48.260 --> 2:59:50.840
 is him bragging or humble bragging.

2:59:50.840 --> 2:59:51.920
 And that never entered my head.

2:59:51.920 --> 2:59:58.480
 I'm like, oh man, I'm so glad my boy can be having a good time and is sharing his joy

2:59:58.480 --> 2:59:59.960
 with me.

2:59:59.960 --> 3:00:03.040
 That's the kind of people you need to surround yourself with, where it never enters their

3:00:03.040 --> 3:00:10.960
 head to be resentful or anything other than sharing in your bounty.

3:00:10.960 --> 3:00:12.880
 What makes you happy?

3:00:12.880 --> 3:00:15.320
 I'm happy all the time.

3:00:15.320 --> 3:00:19.440
 And one of the points I made in my life is like, I really hated, I really did not like

3:00:19.440 --> 3:00:24.400
 to give advice because I feel don't give advice until you know what you're talking about.

3:00:24.400 --> 3:00:27.440
 And to me, what makes me happy is being self actualized.

3:00:27.440 --> 3:00:34.200
 I am in a position with my career where I could be myself 24 seven, where I never have

3:00:34.200 --> 3:00:39.300
 to engage in small talk, where I never have to interact with someone I don't want to.

3:00:39.300 --> 3:00:41.440
 And I'm very blessed to have that.

3:00:41.440 --> 3:00:42.980
 Very few people have that.

3:00:42.980 --> 3:00:51.320
 And to have that be not only, to have that be like rewarded and having people find that

3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:55.240
 something of value to them makes me very, very happy.

3:00:55.240 --> 3:00:58.600
 But also being an uncle, I have two little nephews.

3:00:58.600 --> 3:01:01.400
 They make me very, very happy.

3:01:01.400 --> 3:01:05.280
 Sure my sister's raising them Russian, so they talk like immigrants, but that's okay.

3:01:05.280 --> 3:01:06.280
 We're going to change that.

3:01:06.280 --> 3:01:09.040
 We have to dismember her, that's fine.

3:01:09.040 --> 3:01:10.040
 That makes me happy.

3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:17.240
 And to be able to finish this book and know it's going to give people a sense of hope,

3:01:17.240 --> 3:01:20.280
 that's really validating.

3:01:20.280 --> 3:01:25.720
 What are you most grateful for for our conversation today?

3:01:25.720 --> 3:01:27.760
 You're stealing my bit.

3:01:27.760 --> 3:01:29.840
 What am I most grateful for?

3:01:29.840 --> 3:01:38.280
 I am very grateful that I can come in here not knowing what we're going to talk about

3:01:38.280 --> 3:01:44.020
 and know it's not going to be something I have to be on guard about, or I have to watch

3:01:44.020 --> 3:01:53.160
 my words and that neither you or your audience is going to be responding derisively.

3:01:53.160 --> 3:01:55.280
 I feel safe here.

3:01:55.280 --> 3:01:56.280
 You're welcome.

3:01:56.280 --> 3:01:57.280
 Vaseva.

3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:01.460

 And now let me leave you with some words from Emma Goldman on anarchism.

3:02:34.640 --> 3:02:39.960
 People have only as much liberty as they have the intelligence to want and the courage to

3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:41.280
 take.

3:02:41.280 --> 3:02:43.360
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
