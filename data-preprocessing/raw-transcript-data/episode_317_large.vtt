00:00.000 --> 00:04.440
 The universe doesn't care about your personal narrative.

00:04.440 --> 00:09.400
 You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life.

00:09.400 --> 00:13.960
 It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness,

00:13.960 --> 00:18.160
 and you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.360
 That's mortality.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.720
 Mortality isn't just some far flung event.

00:22.720 --> 00:29.320
 It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.

00:29.320 --> 00:36.240
 So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever all the projects

00:36.240 --> 00:43.560
 and the plans you make come up against the fact that the universe can just roll over them.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.280
 The following is a conversation with John Verweke,

00:46.280 --> 00:50.200
 a psychologist and cognitive scientist at the University of Toronto.

00:50.200 --> 00:55.760
 I highly recommend his lecture series called Awakening from the Meaning Crisis,

00:55.760 --> 01:00.840
 which covers the history and future of humanity's search for meaning.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.720
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:02.720 --> 01:06.240
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:06.240 --> 01:10.440
 And now, dear friends, here's John Verweke.

01:10.440 --> 01:15.960
 You have an excellent 50 part lecture series online on the Meaning Crisis.

01:15.960 --> 01:21.080
 And I think you describe in the modern times an increase in depression,

01:21.080 --> 01:26.640
 loneliness, cynicism, and wait for it, bullshit.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.680
 The term used technically by Harry Frankfurt and adopted by you.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.840
 So let me ask, what is meaning?

01:33.840 --> 01:40.200
 What are we looking for when we engage in the search for meaning?

01:40.200 --> 01:43.600
 So when I'm talking about meaning, I'm talking about what's called meaning in life,

01:43.600 --> 01:45.080
 not the meaning of life.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.440
 That's some sort of metaphysical claim.

01:47.440 --> 01:52.480
 Meaning in life are those factors that make people rate their lives as more meaningful,

01:52.480 --> 01:55.920
 worth living, worth the suffering that they have to endure.

01:55.920 --> 02:03.160
 And when you study that, what you see is it's a sense of connectedness,

02:03.160 --> 02:07.240
 connectedness to yourself, to other people, to the world,

02:07.240 --> 02:09.920
 and a particular kind of connectedness.

02:09.920 --> 02:14.960
 You want to be connected to things that have a value and an existence

02:14.960 --> 02:19.120
 independent of your egocentric preferences and concerns.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.920
 This is why, for example, having a child is considered very meaningful,

02:21.920 --> 02:26.040
 because you're connecting to something that's going to have a life and a value

02:26.040 --> 02:29.000
 independent of you.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.360
 Now, the question that comes up for me, well, there's two questions.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.560
 One is, why is that at risk right now?

02:36.560 --> 02:41.080
 And then secondly, and I think you have to answer the second question first,

02:41.080 --> 02:44.040
 which is, well, yeah, but why is meaning so important?

02:44.040 --> 02:46.600
 Why is this sense of connectedness so important to human beings?

02:46.600 --> 02:51.040
 Why, when it is lacking, do they typically fall into depression,

02:51.040 --> 02:55.120
 potentially mental illness, addiction, self destructive behavior?

02:55.120 --> 02:59.480
 And so the first answer I give you is, well, it's that sense of connectedness.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.160
 And people often express it metaphorically.

03:01.160 --> 03:03.760
 They want to be connected to something larger than themselves.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.120
 They want to matter.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.640
 They don't mean it literally.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.640
 I mean, if I chained you to a mountain, you wouldn't thereby say, oh,

03:09.640 --> 03:12.040
 now my life is so fulfilling, right?

03:12.040 --> 03:15.600
 So what they're trying to convey, they're using this metaphor to try and say,

03:15.600 --> 03:17.240
 they want to be connected.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.080
 They want to be connected to something real.

03:19.080 --> 03:22.200
 They want to make a difference and matter to it.

03:22.200 --> 03:27.480
 And one way of asking them, well, you know, what's meaningful is,

03:27.480 --> 03:31.120
 tell me what you would like to continue to exist even if you weren't around

03:31.120 --> 03:37.640
 anymore, and how are you connected to it, and how do you matter to it?

03:37.640 --> 03:44.000
 That's one way of trying to get at what is the source of meaning for you,

03:44.000 --> 03:49.920
 is if you were no longer there, you would like it to continue existing.

03:49.920 --> 03:54.200
 That's not the only part of the definition probably, because there's probably many

03:54.200 --> 04:01.320
 things that aren't a source of meaning for me that maybe I find beautiful

04:01.320 --> 04:03.200
 that I would like to continue existing.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.000
 Yes.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.520
 If it contributes to your life being meaningful, you are connected to it

04:08.520 --> 04:15.600
 in some way, and it matters to you, and you matter to it in that you make

04:15.600 --> 04:16.840
 some difference to it.

04:16.840 --> 04:20.040
 That's when it goes from being just sort of true, good, and beautiful,

04:20.040 --> 04:23.120
 to being a source of meaning for you in your life.

04:23.120 --> 04:27.400
 Is the meaning crisis a new thing, or has it always been with us?

04:27.400 --> 04:30.120
 Is it part of the human condition in general?

04:30.120 --> 04:31.600
 That's an excellent question.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.160
 And part of the argument I made in Awakening from the Meaning Crisis is

04:35.160 --> 04:37.640
 there's two aspects to it.

04:37.640 --> 04:43.800
 One is that there are perennial problems, perennial threats to meaning.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.760
 And in that sense, human beings are always vulnerable to despair.

04:47.760 --> 04:52.960
 You know, the book of Ecclesiastes is, it's all vanity, it's all meaningless.

04:52.960 --> 05:00.680
 But there's also historical forces that have made those perennial problems more

05:00.680 --> 05:05.880
 pertinent, more pressing, more difficult for people to deal with.

05:05.880 --> 05:10.880
 And so the meaning crisis is actually the intersection of perennial problems,

05:10.880 --> 05:17.280
 finding existence absurd, experiencing existential anxiety, feeling alienated,

05:17.280 --> 05:21.560
 and then pressing historical factors, which have to do with the loss of the

05:21.560 --> 05:26.120
 resources that human beings have typically cross historically and cross

05:26.120 --> 05:32.040
 culturally made use of in order to address these perennial problems.

05:32.040 --> 05:39.520
 Is there something potentially deeper than just a lack of meaning that speaks

05:39.520 --> 05:42.880
 to the fact that we're vulnerable to despair?

05:42.880 --> 05:47.400
 You know, Ernest Becker talked about the, in his book Denial of Death,

05:47.400 --> 05:52.480
 about the fear of death and being an important motivator in our life.

05:52.480 --> 05:56.880
 As William James said, death is the warm at the core of the human condition.

05:56.880 --> 06:06.240
 Is it possible that this kind of search for meaning is coupled or can be seen

06:06.240 --> 06:15.480
 from the perspective of trying to escape the reality, the thought of one's own mortality?

06:15.480 --> 06:19.040
 Yeah, Becker and the terror management theory that have come out of it,

06:19.040 --> 06:26.600
 there's been some good work around sort of providing empirical support for that claim.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.960
 Some of the work, not so good.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.360
 So which aspects do you find convincing?

06:31.360 --> 06:35.080
 Can you steel man that case and then can you argue against it?

06:35.080 --> 06:42.600
 So what aspects I find convincing is that human finitude, being finite,

06:42.600 --> 06:49.000
 being inherently limited is very problematic for us.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.080
 Given the extensive use of the word problematic, I like that you used that word

06:54.080 --> 06:57.240
 to describe one's own mortality as problematic.

06:57.240 --> 07:01.760
 Because people sort of on Twitter use the word problematic when they disagree with somebody.

07:01.760 --> 07:06.320
 But this, to me, seems to be the ultimate problematic aspect of the human condition

07:06.320 --> 07:08.480
 is that we die and it ends.

07:08.480 --> 07:14.360
 I think I'm not disagreeing with you, but I'm trying to get you to consider

07:14.360 --> 07:16.760
 that your mortality is not an event in the future.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.440
 It's a state you're in right now.

07:19.440 --> 07:23.400
 That's what I'm trying to shift.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.160
 So your mortality is just a...

07:26.160 --> 07:30.280
 We talk about something that causes mortality fatal.

07:30.280 --> 07:33.520
 But what we actually mean is it's full of fate.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.520
 And I don't mean in the sense of things are prewritten.

07:36.520 --> 07:44.400
 What I mean is the sense of the universe doesn't care about your personal narrative.

07:44.400 --> 07:49.360
 You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life.

07:49.360 --> 07:53.920
 It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness,

07:53.920 --> 07:58.120
 and you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.320
 That's mortality.

07:59.320 --> 08:02.680
 Mortality isn't just some far flung event.

08:02.680 --> 08:09.280
 It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.

08:09.280 --> 08:16.200
 So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever all the projects

08:16.200 --> 08:22.320
 and the plans you make come up against the fact that the universe can just roll over them.

08:22.320 --> 08:28.760
 The death is the indifference of nature of the universe to your existence.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.960
 And so in that sense, it is always here with us.

08:31.960 --> 08:38.480
 Yeah, but you're vulnerable in so many ways other than just the ending of your biological life.

08:38.480 --> 08:43.600
 Because it's interesting, if you rate what people fear most, death is not number one.

08:43.600 --> 08:47.160
 They often put public speaking as number one.

08:47.160 --> 08:54.120
 Because the death of status or reputation can also be a profound loss for human beings.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.360
 It can drive them into despair.

08:56.360 --> 09:00.360
 So as the terror management folks would say, as Ernest Becker would say,

09:00.360 --> 09:06.000
 that a self report on a survey is not an accurate way to capture what is actually

09:06.000 --> 09:08.360
 at the core of the motivation of a human being.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.680
 That we could be terrified of death.

09:10.680 --> 09:18.560
 And we, from childhood, since we realized the absurdity of the fact that the right ends,

09:18.560 --> 09:26.560
 we've learned to really try to forget about it, try to construct illusions that allow us

09:26.560 --> 09:32.120
 to escape momentarily or for prolonged periods of time the realization that we die.

09:32.120 --> 09:37.920
 Okay, so first, I took it seriously, but now I want to say why there's some empirical work

09:37.920 --> 09:39.760
 that makes me want to reconsider it.

09:39.760 --> 09:45.840
 So terror management theory is you do things like you give people a list of words to read.

09:45.840 --> 09:51.040
 And in those lists are words associated with death, cough, and funeral.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.640
 And then you see what happens to people.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.760
 And generally, they start to become more rigid in their thinking.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.920
 They tend to identify with their worldview.

09:58.920 --> 10:01.840
 They lose cognitive flexibility.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.880
 That's if you present it to them in that third person perspective.

10:04.880 --> 10:11.120
 But if you get them to go in the first person perspective and imagine that they're dying

10:11.120 --> 10:17.760
 and that the people that they care about are there with them, they don't show those responses.

10:17.760 --> 10:23.200
 In fact, they show us an increase in cognitive flexibility, an increase in openness.

10:23.200 --> 10:27.160
 See, so I'm trying to say we might be putting the cart before the horse.

10:27.160 --> 10:32.600
 It might not be death per se, but the kind of meaning that is present or absent in death

10:32.600 --> 10:34.640
 that is the crucial thing for us.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.400
 By the way, to push back, I don't think you took it seriously.

10:37.400 --> 10:43.120
 I don't think you truly steel manned the case because you're saying that death is always

10:43.120 --> 10:49.320
 present with us, yes, but isn't there a case to be made that it is one of the major motivators?

10:49.320 --> 10:55.080
 Nietzsche, will to power, Freud wanting to have sex with your mother, all the different

10:55.080 --> 10:58.600
 explanations of what is truly motivating us human beings.

10:58.600 --> 11:06.520
 Isn't there a strong case to be made that this death thing is a really damn good, if

11:06.520 --> 11:12.120
 not anything, a tool to motivate the behavior of humans?

11:12.120 --> 11:18.360
 I'm not saying that the avoidance of death is not significant for human beings, but I'm

11:18.360 --> 11:25.300
 proposing to you that human beings have a capacity for considering certain deaths meaningful

11:25.300 --> 11:31.280
 and certain deaths meaningless, and we have lots of evidence that people are willing to

11:31.280 --> 11:36.200
 sacrifice their biological existence for a death they consider meaningful.

11:36.200 --> 11:40.400
 Are you personally afraid of your death if you think about it?

11:40.400 --> 11:48.320
 As somebody who produces a lot of ideas, records them, writes them down, is a deep thinker,

11:48.320 --> 11:55.800
 admired thinker, and as the years go on, become more and more admired, does it scare you that

11:55.800 --> 11:56.800
 the ride ends?

11:56.800 --> 11:57.800
 No.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.600
 I mean, you have to talk to me on all my levels.

12:00.600 --> 12:04.760
 I'm a biological organism, so if something's thrown at my head, I'll duck and things like

12:04.760 --> 12:06.280
 that.

12:06.280 --> 12:13.400
 But if you're asking me, do I long to live forever, no.

12:13.400 --> 12:19.400
 In the Buddhist tradition, there are practices that are designed to make you aware of simultaneously

12:19.400 --> 12:22.800
 the horror of mortality and the horror of immortality.

12:22.800 --> 12:29.280
 The thought of living forever is actually horrific to me.

12:29.280 --> 12:32.600
 Are those the only two options?

12:32.600 --> 12:39.960
 Like when you're sitting with a loved one or watching a movie you just really love or

12:39.960 --> 12:45.000
 a book you really love, you don't want it to end, you don't necessarily always flip

12:45.000 --> 12:49.680
 it to the other aspect, the complete opposite of the thought experiment.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.720
 What happens if the book lasts forever?

12:52.720 --> 12:55.080
 There's got to be a middle ground, like the snooze button.

12:55.080 --> 12:58.960
 Sure you don't want to sleep forever, but maybe press the snooze button and get an extra

12:58.960 --> 13:01.040
 15 minutes.

13:01.040 --> 13:10.380
 There's surely some kind of balance, that fear seems to be a source of an intense appreciation

13:10.380 --> 13:16.240
 of the moment, in part, and that's what the Stoics talked about, sort of the meditate

13:16.240 --> 13:17.240
 on one's mortality.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.240
 Sure.

13:18.240 --> 13:26.560
 It seems to be a nice wake up call to that life is full of moments that are beautiful

13:26.560 --> 13:29.160
 and then you don't get an infinite number of them.

13:29.160 --> 13:34.560
 Right, and the Stoic response was not the project of trying to extend the duration of

13:34.560 --> 13:42.880
 your life, but to deepen those moments so they become as satisfying as possible so that

13:42.880 --> 13:46.880
 when death comes it does not strike you as any kind of calamity.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.880
 Does that project ring true for your own personal feelings?

13:50.880 --> 13:51.920
 I think so.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.720
 Do you think about your mortality?

13:53.720 --> 13:54.720
 I used to.

13:54.720 --> 13:59.520
 I don't so much anymore.

13:59.520 --> 14:05.400
 Part of it, as I'm older and your temporal horizon flips somewhere in your 30s or 40s,

14:05.400 --> 14:09.120
 you don't live from your birth, you live towards your death.

14:09.120 --> 14:13.220
 That's such a beautiful phrase, the temporal horizon flips.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.900
 That's so true.

14:14.900 --> 14:15.900
 That's so true.

14:15.900 --> 14:18.880
 At what point is that?

14:18.880 --> 14:25.840
 The point before which the world of opportunity and possibility is infinite before you.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.400
 Yeah, it's like Peter Pan.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.600
 There's all these golden possibilities and you fly around between them.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.200
 Yes, very much.

14:33.200 --> 14:39.800
 And then when it flips, you start to look for a different model, the Socratic, the Stoic

14:39.800 --> 14:48.480
 model, Buddhism has also influenced me, which is more about, wait, when I look at my desires,

14:48.480 --> 14:50.720
 I seem to have two meta desires.

14:50.720 --> 14:56.080
 In addition to satisfying a particular desire, I want whatever satisfies my desire to be

14:56.080 --> 15:03.920
 real and whatever is satisfying my desire to not cause internal conflict but bring something

15:03.920 --> 15:05.560
 like peace of mind.

15:05.560 --> 15:12.600
 And so I more and more move towards how can I live such that those two meta desires are

15:12.600 --> 15:19.920
 a constant frame within which I'm trying to satisfy my specific desires.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.080
 What do you think happens after we die?

15:22.080 --> 15:28.960
 I think mind and life go away completely when we die.

15:28.960 --> 15:37.600
 And I think that's actually significantly important for the kind of beings that we are.

15:37.600 --> 15:44.240
 We are the kinds of beings that can come to that awareness and then we have a responsibility

15:44.240 --> 15:48.440
 to decide how we're going to comport ourselves towards it.

15:48.440 --> 15:52.500
 Can you linger on what that means, the mind goes away?

15:52.500 --> 16:00.600
 Like when you're playing music and the last instrument is put down, the song is over.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.360
 Doesn't mean the song wasn't beautiful.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.480
 Doesn't mean the song wasn't complex.

16:04.480 --> 16:09.600
 Doesn't mean the song didn't add to the value of the universe and its existence, but it

16:09.600 --> 16:11.120
 came to an end.

16:11.120 --> 16:18.680
 Is there some aspect in which some part of mind was there before the human and remains

16:18.680 --> 16:20.200
 after?

16:20.200 --> 16:26.320
 Something like panpsychism or is it too much for us limited cognitive beings to understand?

16:26.320 --> 16:29.520
 Something like panpsychism, I take it seriously.

16:29.520 --> 16:33.800
 I don't think it's a ridiculous proposal, but I think it has insoluble problems that

16:33.800 --> 16:37.040
 make me doubt it.

16:37.040 --> 16:45.520
 Any idea that the mind is some kind of ultimately immaterial substance also has for me just

16:45.520 --> 16:46.600
 devastating problems.

16:46.600 --> 16:51.960
 Those are the two kinds of framework that people usually propose in order to support

16:51.960 --> 16:53.920
 some kind of idea of immortality.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.320
 I find both very problematic.

16:56.320 --> 17:02.160
 The fact that we participate in distributed cognition, that most of our problem solving

17:02.160 --> 17:06.560
 is not done as individuals but in groups, this is something I work on, I've published

17:06.560 --> 17:07.560
 on that.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.600
 I think that's important.

17:09.600 --> 17:15.560
 But most of the people who do work on systems of distributed cognition think that while

17:15.560 --> 17:20.240
 there's such a thing as collective intelligence, there's no good evidence that there's collective

17:20.240 --> 17:21.240
 consciousness.

17:21.240 --> 17:25.960
 In fact, it's often called zombie agency for that reason.

17:25.960 --> 17:32.200
 And so while I think it's very clear that no one person runs an airline, and there's

17:32.200 --> 17:36.280
 a collective intelligence that solves that problem, I do not think that collective intelligence

17:36.280 --> 17:38.840
 supports any kind of consciousness.

17:38.840 --> 17:43.600
 And so therefore, I don't think the fact that I participate, which I regularly and

17:43.600 --> 17:49.320
 reliably do in distributed cognition, gives me any reason to believe that that participation

17:49.320 --> 17:51.280
 grounds some kind of consciousness.

17:51.280 --> 17:54.640
 Okay, there's so many things to mention there.

17:54.640 --> 17:59.840
 First of all, distributed cognition, maybe that's a synonym for collective intelligence.

17:59.840 --> 18:08.400
 So that means a bunch of humans individually are able to think, have cognitive machines,

18:08.400 --> 18:15.160
 and are somehow able to interact through the process of dialogue, as you talk about, to

18:15.160 --> 18:20.320
 morph different ideas together, like this idea landscape together.

18:20.320 --> 18:27.000
 It's so interesting to think about, okay, well, you do have these fascinating distributed

18:27.000 --> 18:35.920
 cognition systems, but consciousness does not propagate in the same way as intelligence.

18:35.920 --> 18:41.880
 But isn't there a case, if we just look at intelligence, if we look at us humans as a

18:41.880 --> 18:50.280
 collection of smaller organisms, which we are, and so there's like a hierarchy of organisms,

18:50.280 --> 18:57.440
 tiny ones, work together to form tiny villages that you can then start to see as individual

18:57.440 --> 19:03.920
 organisms that are then also forming bigger villages and interacting different ways and

19:03.920 --> 19:06.160
 function becomes more and more complex.

19:06.160 --> 19:10.440
 And eventually we get to us humans to where we start to think, well, we're an individual,

19:10.440 --> 19:11.720
 but really we're not.

19:11.720 --> 19:18.600
 There's billions of organisms inside us, both domestic and foreign.

19:18.600 --> 19:27.840
 So isn't that building up consciousnesses like turtles all the way up to us, our consciousness?

19:27.840 --> 19:29.760
 Why does it have to stop with us humans?

19:29.760 --> 19:38.680
 Are we the only, like, is this the phase transition when it becomes a zombie like giant hierarchical

19:38.680 --> 19:44.860
 village that first like, oh, there's like a singing angels and it's consciousness is

19:44.860 --> 19:47.540
 born in just us humans.

19:47.540 --> 19:49.520
 Do bacteria have consciousness?

19:49.520 --> 19:54.200
 Not bacteria, but maybe you could say bacteria does, but like the interesting complicated

19:54.200 --> 19:57.480
 organisms that are within us have consciousness.

19:57.480 --> 20:05.060
 I think it's proper to argue, and I have, that like a paramecium or bacteria has a kind

20:05.060 --> 20:10.360
 of agency and even a kind of intelligence, kind of sense making ability.

20:10.360 --> 20:15.880
 But I do not think that we can attribute consciousness, at least what we mean by consciousness, this

20:15.880 --> 20:24.080
 kind of self awareness, this ability to introspect, et cetera, et cetera, to bacteria.

20:24.080 --> 20:28.880
 Now the reason why distributed cognition doesn't have consciousness, I think is a little bit

20:28.880 --> 20:31.760
 more tricky.

20:31.760 --> 20:38.180
 And I think there's no reason in principle why there couldn't be a consciousness for

20:38.180 --> 20:41.760
 distributed cognition, collective intelligence.

20:41.760 --> 20:46.280
 In fact, many, you know, philosophers would agree with me on that point.

20:46.280 --> 20:55.320
 I think it's more an issue of certain empirical facts, bandwidth, density of connection, speed

20:55.320 --> 20:58.400
 of information transfer, et cetera.

20:58.400 --> 21:04.040
 It's conceivable that if we got some horrible Frankensteinian neural link and we linked

21:04.040 --> 21:10.840
 our brains and we had the right density and dynamics and bandwidth and speed that a group

21:10.840 --> 21:12.600
 consciousness could take shape.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.000
 I don't have any argument in principle against that.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.880
 I'm just saying those contingent facts do not yet exist, and therefore it is implausible

21:20.880 --> 21:24.240
 that consciousness exists at the level of collective intelligence.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.560
 So you talk about consciousness quite a bit.

21:26.560 --> 21:32.000
 So let's step back and try to sneak up to a definition.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.520
 What is consciousness?

21:33.520 --> 21:38.720
 For me, there are two aspects to answering that question.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.920
 One is, what's the nature of consciousness?

21:40.920 --> 21:46.480
 How does something like consciousness exist in an otherwise apparently nonconscious universe?

21:46.480 --> 21:49.560
 And then there's a function question, which is equally important, which is, what does

21:49.560 --> 21:52.200
 consciousness do?

21:52.200 --> 21:57.240
 The first one is obviously, you know, problematic for most people, like, yeah, consciousness

21:57.240 --> 22:02.000
 seems to be so different from the rest of the nonconscious universe.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.340
 But I put it to you that the function question is also very hard, because you are clearly

22:07.340 --> 22:15.360
 capable of very sophisticated, intelligent behavior without consciousness.

22:15.360 --> 22:21.160
 You are turning the noises coming out of my face hole into ideas in your mind, and you

22:21.160 --> 22:27.000
 have no conscious awareness of how that process is occurring.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.680
 So why do we have consciousness at all?

22:29.680 --> 22:31.880
 Now, here's the thing.

22:31.880 --> 22:34.240
 There's an extra question you need to ask.

22:34.240 --> 22:38.800
 Should we attempt to answer those questions separately, or should we attempt to answer

22:38.800 --> 22:41.200
 them in an integrated fashion?

22:41.200 --> 22:46.840
 I make the case that you actually have to answer them in an integrated fashion.

22:46.840 --> 22:52.400
 What consciousness does, and what it is, we should be able to give it a unified answer

22:52.400 --> 22:53.760
 to both of those.

22:53.760 --> 23:02.120
 Can you try to elucidate the difference between what consciousness is and what it does, both

23:02.120 --> 23:08.440
 of which are mysteries, as you say, state versus action?

23:08.440 --> 23:13.040
 Can you try to explain the difference that's interesting, that's useful, that's important

23:13.040 --> 23:14.040
 to understand?

23:14.040 --> 23:18.220
 So that's putting me in a bit of a difficult position, because I actually argue that trying

23:18.220 --> 23:22.680
 to answer them separately is ultimately incoherent.

23:22.680 --> 23:28.800
 But what I can point to are many published articles in which only one of these problems

23:28.800 --> 23:31.280
 is addressed, and the other is left unaddressed.

23:31.280 --> 23:35.880
 So people will try and explain what qualia are, how they potentially emerge, without

23:35.880 --> 23:41.400
 saying what do they do, what problems do they help to solve, how do they make the organism

23:41.400 --> 23:42.400
 more adaptive.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.600
 And then you'll have other people who will say, no, no, this is what the function of

23:45.600 --> 23:50.240
 consciousness is, but I don't know, I can't tell you, I can't solve the hard problem,

23:50.240 --> 23:52.520
 I don't know how qualia exist.

23:52.520 --> 23:58.240
 So what I'm saying is many people treat these problems separately, although I think that's

23:58.240 --> 24:02.200
 ultimately an incoherent way to approach the problem.

24:02.200 --> 24:05.520
 So the hard problem is focusing on what it is.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.520
 Yes.

24:06.520 --> 24:10.920
 So the qualia, that it feels like something to experience a thing, that's what consciousness

24:10.920 --> 24:11.920
 is.

24:11.920 --> 24:18.840
 And does is more about the functional usefulness of the thing, to the whole beautiful mix of

24:18.840 --> 24:24.160
 cognition and just function in everyday life.

24:24.160 --> 24:34.240
 Okay, you've also said that you can do very intelligent things without consciousness.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.800
 Yes, clearly.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.800
 Is that obvious to you?

24:38.800 --> 24:39.880
 Yes.

24:39.880 --> 24:43.360
 I don't know what I'm doing to access my memory.

24:43.360 --> 24:50.900
 It just comes up, and it comes up really intelligently.

24:50.900 --> 24:55.600
 But the mechanisms that create consciousness could be deeply interlinked with whatever

24:55.600 --> 25:00.040
 is doing the memory access, that's doing the...

25:00.040 --> 25:02.840
 Oh, I think so, in fact, yes, yes.

25:02.840 --> 25:08.960
 So I guess what I'm trying to say in this will probably sneak up to this question a

25:08.960 --> 25:18.280
 few times, which is whether we can build machines that are conscious, or machines that are intelligent,

25:18.280 --> 25:21.600
 one level intelligent or beyond, without building the consciousness.

25:21.600 --> 25:26.760
 I mean, ultimately, that's one of the ways to understand what consciousness is, is to

25:26.760 --> 25:28.600
 build the thing.

25:28.600 --> 25:33.960
 We can either sort of from the Chomsky way, try to construct models, like he thinks about

25:33.960 --> 25:37.960
 language in this way, try to construct models and theories of how the thing works, or we

25:37.960 --> 25:39.960
 can just build the damn thing.

25:39.960 --> 25:40.960
 Exactly.

25:40.960 --> 25:45.320
 And that's a methodological principle in cognitive science.

25:45.320 --> 25:53.600
 In fact, one of the things that sort of distinguishes cognitive science from other disciplines dealing

25:53.600 --> 25:59.580
 with the nature of cognition in the mind is that cognitive science takes the design stance.

25:59.580 --> 26:06.480
 It asks, well, could we build a machine that would not only simulate it, but serve as a

26:06.480 --> 26:09.400
 bona fide explanation of the phenomenon?

26:09.400 --> 26:15.440
 Do you find any efforts in cognitive science compelling in this direction?

26:15.440 --> 26:21.880
 In terms of how far we are, there's, on the computational side of things, something called

26:21.880 --> 26:26.620
 cognitive modeling, there's all these kinds of packages that you can construct simplified

26:26.620 --> 26:32.680
 models of how the brain does things and see if complex behaviors emerge.

26:32.680 --> 26:38.480
 Do you find any efforts in cognitive, or what efforts in cognitive science do you find most

26:38.480 --> 26:41.300
 inspiring and productive?

26:41.300 --> 26:47.860
 I think the project of trying to create AGI, artificial general intelligence, is where

26:47.860 --> 26:53.400
 I place my hope of artificial intelligence being of scientific significance.

26:53.400 --> 27:01.080
 This is independent of technological socioeconomic significance, which is already well established.

27:01.080 --> 27:08.120
 But being able to say because of the work in AI, we now have a good theory of cognition,

27:08.120 --> 27:13.920
 intelligence, perhaps consciousness, I think that's where I place my bets is in the current

27:13.920 --> 27:17.340
 endeavors around artificial general intelligence.

27:17.340 --> 27:25.120
 And so tackling that problem head on, which has now become central, at least to a group

27:25.120 --> 27:31.800
 of cognitive scientists, is I think what needs to be done.

27:31.800 --> 27:37.080
 And when you think about AGI, do you think about systems that have consciousness?

27:37.080 --> 27:44.160
 Let's go back to what I think is at the core of your general intelligence.

27:44.160 --> 27:49.420
 So right now, compared to even our best machines, you are a general problem solver.

27:49.420 --> 27:53.280
 You can solve a wide variety of problems in a wide variety of domains.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.220
 And some of our best machines have a little bit of transfer.

27:56.220 --> 28:01.080
 They can learn this game and play a few other well designed rule bound games, but they couldn't

28:01.080 --> 28:05.460
 learn how to swim, etc., things like that.

28:05.460 --> 28:12.240
 And so what's interesting is what seems to come up, and this is some of my published

28:12.240 --> 28:20.080
 work, in all these different domains of cognition across all these different problem types is

28:20.080 --> 28:22.120
 a central problem.

28:22.120 --> 28:26.380
 And since we do have good sort of psychometric evidence that we do have some general ability

28:26.380 --> 28:32.060
 that's a significant component of our intelligence, I made an argument as to what I think that

28:32.060 --> 28:35.480
 general ability is.

28:35.480 --> 28:39.800
 And so it's happening right now.

28:39.800 --> 28:43.760
 The amount of information in this room that you could actually pay attention to is combinatorial

28:43.760 --> 28:46.180
 explosive.

28:46.180 --> 28:49.520
 The amount of information you have in your memory, long term memory, and all the ways

28:49.520 --> 28:54.200
 you could combine it, combinatorial explosive.

28:54.200 --> 28:58.040
 The number of possibilities you can consider, also combinatorial explosive.

28:58.040 --> 29:03.040
 The sequences of behavior you can generate, also combinatorial explosive.

29:03.040 --> 29:06.680
 And yet somehow you're zeroing in.

29:06.680 --> 29:10.320
 The right memories are coming up, the right possibilities are opening up, the right sequences

29:10.320 --> 29:12.880
 of behavior, you're paying attention to the right thing.

29:12.880 --> 29:20.280
 Not infallibly so, but so much so that you reliably find obvious what you should interact

29:20.280 --> 29:23.280
 with in order to solve the problem at hand.

29:23.280 --> 29:30.720
 That's an ability that is still not well understood within AGI.

29:30.720 --> 29:35.720
 To filtering out the gigantic waterfall of data.

29:35.720 --> 29:36.720
 Right.

29:36.720 --> 29:37.720
 It's almost like a Zen Koan.

29:37.720 --> 29:44.960
 What makes you intelligent is your ability to ignore so much information and do it in

29:44.960 --> 29:53.240
 such a way that is somewhere between arbitrary guessing and algorithmic search.

29:53.240 --> 30:00.280
 And to a fault sometimes of course that you, based on the models you construct, you forget,

30:00.280 --> 30:03.560
 you ignore things that you should probably not ignore.

30:03.560 --> 30:10.120
 And that, hopefully we can circle back to it Lux, is related to the meaning issue.

30:10.120 --> 30:16.600
 Because the very processes that make us adaptively intelligent make us perennially susceptible

30:16.600 --> 30:22.840
 to self deceptive, self destructive behavior because of the way we misframe the environment

30:22.840 --> 30:24.400
 in fundamental ways.

30:24.400 --> 30:38.200
 So to you, meaning is also connected to ideas of wisdom and truth and how we interpret and

30:38.200 --> 30:42.320
 understand and interact intellectually with the environment.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.320
 Yes.

30:43.320 --> 30:45.120
 So what is wisdom?

30:45.120 --> 30:46.920
 Why do we long for it?

30:46.920 --> 30:49.000
 How do we and where do we find it?

30:49.000 --> 30:50.040
 What is it?

30:50.040 --> 30:56.120
 This is what you use to solve your problems, as I was just describing.

30:56.120 --> 31:01.860
 Rationality is how you use your intelligence to overcome the problems of self deception

31:01.860 --> 31:04.340
 that emerge when you're trying to solve your problems.

31:04.340 --> 31:06.440
 So it's that meta problem.

31:06.440 --> 31:12.080
 And then the issue is, do you have just one kind of knowing?

31:12.080 --> 31:18.220
 I think you have multiple ways of knowing, and therefore you have multiple rationalities.

31:18.220 --> 31:23.500
 And so wisdom is to coordinate those rationalities so that they are optimally constraining and

31:23.500 --> 31:25.500
 affording each other.

31:25.500 --> 31:30.120
 So in that way, wisdom is rationally self transcending rationality.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.360
 Right.

31:31.360 --> 31:40.280
 So life is a kind of process where you jump from rationality to rationality and pick up

31:40.280 --> 31:44.160
 a village of rationalities along the way that then turns into wisdom.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.360
 Yes, if properly coordinated.

31:46.360 --> 31:47.720
 You mentioned framing.

31:47.720 --> 31:48.760
 Yes.

31:48.760 --> 31:52.720
 So what is framing?

31:52.720 --> 31:58.680
 Is it a set of assumptions you bring to the table in how you see the world, how you reason

31:58.680 --> 32:03.680
 about the world, how you understand the world?

32:03.680 --> 32:06.280
 So it depends what you mean by assumptions.

32:06.280 --> 32:12.920
 If by assumption you mean a proposition, representational or rule, I think that's much more downstream

32:12.920 --> 32:14.640
 from relevance realization.

32:14.640 --> 32:25.240
 I think relevance realization refers to, again, constraints on how you are paying attention.

32:25.240 --> 32:32.760
 And so for me, talking about framing is talking about this process you're doing right now

32:32.760 --> 32:35.400
 of salient landscaping.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.780
 What's salient to you?

32:37.780 --> 32:44.520
 And how is what's salient constantly shifting in a sort of a dynamic tapestry?

32:44.520 --> 32:52.060
 And how are you shaping yourself to the way that salient landscaping is aspectualizing

32:52.060 --> 32:55.960
 the world, shaping it into aspects for interaction?

32:55.960 --> 33:02.640
 For me, that is a much more primordial process than any sort of beliefs we have.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.860
 And here's why.

33:04.860 --> 33:14.500
 If we mean by beliefs a representational proposition, then we're in this very problematic position.

33:14.500 --> 33:19.200
 Because then we're trying to say that propositions are ultimately responsible for how we do relevance

33:19.200 --> 33:21.320
 realization.

33:21.320 --> 33:26.200
 And that's problematic because representations presuppose relevance realization.

33:26.200 --> 33:30.660
 So I represent this as a cup.

33:30.660 --> 33:34.840
 The number of properties it actually has, and that I even have epistemic access to,

33:34.840 --> 33:36.600
 is combinatorial explosive.

33:36.600 --> 33:42.480
 I select from those a subset and how they are relevant to each other insofar as they

33:42.480 --> 33:43.640
 are relevant for me.

33:43.640 --> 33:44.800
 This doesn't have to be a cup.

33:44.800 --> 33:50.020
 I could be using it as a hat, I could use it to stand for the letter V, all kinds of

33:50.020 --> 33:51.020
 different things.

33:51.020 --> 33:57.200
 I could say this was the 10th billion object made in North America.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.160
 Representations presuppose relevance realization.

34:00.160 --> 34:06.860
 They are therefore dependent on it, which means relevance realization isn't bound to

34:06.860 --> 34:09.120
 our representational structures.

34:09.120 --> 34:14.720
 It can be influenced by them, but they are ultimately dependent on relevance realization.

34:14.720 --> 34:17.000
 Let's define stuff.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
 Relevance realization.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
 Yes.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.360
 What are the inputs and the outputs of this thing?

34:21.360 --> 34:22.360
 What is it?

34:22.360 --> 34:23.360
 What are we talking about?

34:23.360 --> 34:31.840
 What we're talking about is how you are doing something very analogous to evolution.

34:31.840 --> 34:38.000
 So if you think about that adaptivity isn't in the organism or in the environment, but

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
 in a dynamical relation and then what does evolution do?

34:42.000 --> 34:47.000
 It creates variation and then it puts selective pressure and what that does is that changes

34:47.000 --> 34:49.640
 the niche constructions that are available to a species.

34:49.640 --> 34:52.020
 It changes the morphology.

34:52.020 --> 34:54.040
 You also have a loop.

34:54.040 --> 34:59.700
 It's your sensory motor loop and what's constantly happening is there are processes within you

34:59.700 --> 35:04.720
 that are opening up variation and also processes that are putting selection on it and you're

35:04.720 --> 35:07.600
 constantly evolving that sensory motor loop.

35:07.600 --> 35:13.480
 So you might call your cognitive fittedness, which is how you're framing the world is constantly

35:13.480 --> 35:14.480
 evolving and changing.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.320
 I can give you two clear examples of that.

35:17.320 --> 35:22.440
 One, your autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic and sympathetic.

35:22.440 --> 35:28.560
 The sympathetic system is biased to trying to interpret as much of reality as threat

35:28.560 --> 35:30.160
 or opportunity.

35:30.160 --> 35:37.160
 The parasympathetic is biased to trying to interpret as much of the environment as safe

35:37.160 --> 35:40.520
 and relaxing and they are constantly doing opponent processing.

35:40.520 --> 35:47.000
 There's no little man in you calculating your level of arousal.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.840
 There's this dynamic coupling opponent processing between them that is constantly evolving your

35:51.840 --> 35:52.840
 arousal.

35:52.840 --> 35:57.320
 Similarly, your attention, you have the default mode network, task network.

35:57.320 --> 36:02.760
 The default mode network is putting pressure on you right now to mind wander, to go off,

36:02.760 --> 36:07.980
 to drift, right, and then the task focus network is selecting out of those possibilities the

36:07.980 --> 36:13.840
 ones that will survive and go into and so you are constantly evolving your attention.

36:13.840 --> 36:19.380
 Okay, so there's a natural selection of ideas that a bunch of systems within you are generating

36:19.380 --> 36:22.460
 and then you use the natural selection.

36:22.460 --> 36:27.020
 What is the selector, the object that you're interacting with, the glass?

36:27.020 --> 36:31.520
 Relevance realization, once again, you just describe how it happens.

36:31.520 --> 36:32.520
 Yes.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.840
 You didn't describe what the hell it is.

36:34.840 --> 36:36.400
 So what's the goal?

36:36.400 --> 36:37.400
 What are we talking about?

36:37.400 --> 36:45.160
 So relevance realization is how you interact with things in the world to make sense of

36:45.160 --> 36:48.040
 why they matter, what they mean to you, to your life.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.120
 Yes, and notice the language you just used, you're starting to use the meaning in life

36:51.120 --> 36:52.120
 language.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.120
 Good or bad?

36:53.120 --> 36:54.120
 That's good.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.120
 Okay.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.120
 That's good.

36:56.120 --> 37:02.800
 So what does that evolution of your sensory motor loop do?

37:02.800 --> 37:08.640
 It gives you, and here I'll use a term from Marlon Ponti, it gives you an optimal grip

37:08.640 --> 37:11.300
 on the world.

37:11.300 --> 37:14.120
 So let's use your visual attention again.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.500
 Okay, here's an object.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.280
 How close should I be to it?

37:20.280 --> 37:21.280
 Is there a right?

37:21.280 --> 37:23.280
 That's what you want to do with it.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.280
 Exactly.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.280
 Exactly.

37:25.280 --> 37:32.200
 So you have to evolve your sensory motor loop in order to get the optimal grip that actually

37:32.200 --> 37:35.800
 creates the affordance of you getting to a goal that you're trying to get to.

37:35.800 --> 37:44.120
 Yeah, but you're describing physical goals of manipulating objects, so this applies,

37:44.120 --> 37:49.960
 the task, the process of relevance realization is not just about getting a glass of water

37:49.960 --> 37:50.960
 and taking a drink.

37:50.960 --> 37:51.960
 No.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.280
 It's about falling in love.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.080
 Yeah, of course.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.080
 What else is there?

37:57.080 --> 37:58.080
 Well, there's obvious.

37:58.080 --> 38:01.840
 Between those two options.

38:01.840 --> 38:06.480
 I can show you how you're optimally gripping in an abstract cognitive domain.

38:06.480 --> 38:07.800
 Okay?

38:07.800 --> 38:13.160
 So a mammal goes by and most people will say there's a dog.

38:13.160 --> 38:18.360
 Now why don't they say, they might, but typically, you know, probabilistically they'll say there's

38:18.360 --> 38:19.360
 a dog.

38:19.360 --> 38:23.560
 They could say there's a German Shepherd, there's a mammal, there's a living organism,

38:23.560 --> 38:25.360
 there's a police dog.

38:25.360 --> 38:26.360
 Why that?

38:26.360 --> 38:27.360
 Why there?

38:27.360 --> 38:30.760
 Why did they stop Eleanor Rush called these basic level?

38:30.760 --> 38:35.200
 Well, what you find is that's an optimal grip because it's getting you the best overall

38:35.200 --> 38:41.300
 balance between similarity within your category and difference between the other categories.

38:41.300 --> 38:46.740
 It's allowing you to properly fit to that object in so far as you're setting yourself

38:46.740 --> 38:52.680
 up to, well, I'm getting so as many of the similarities and differences I can on balance

38:52.680 --> 38:56.960
 because they're in a trade off relationship that I need in order to probably interact

38:56.960 --> 38:59.240
 with this mammal.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.440
 That's optimal grip, not right.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.560
 It's at the level of your categorization.

39:04.560 --> 39:13.240
 You evolve these models of the world around you and on top of them, you do stuff like

39:13.240 --> 39:16.720
 you build representations, like you said, yes.

39:16.720 --> 39:19.080
 What's the salience landscape?

39:19.080 --> 39:23.560
 Salience meaning attention landscape.

39:23.560 --> 39:30.280
 Salience is what grabs your attention or what results from you directing your attention.

39:30.280 --> 39:34.320
 I clap my hands, that's salient, it grabs your attention.

39:34.320 --> 39:39.800
 Your attention is drawn to it, that's bottom up, but I can also say you left big toe and

39:39.800 --> 39:42.720
 now it's salient to you because you directed your attention towards it.

39:42.720 --> 39:47.440
 That's top down and again, opponent processing going on there.

39:47.440 --> 39:52.120
 Whatever stands out to you, what grabs your attention, what arouses you, what triggers

39:52.120 --> 39:57.320
 at least momentarily some affect towards it, that's how things are salient.

39:57.320 --> 40:02.760
 What salience I would argue is, is how a lot of unconscious relevance realization makes

40:02.760 --> 40:07.640
 information relevant to working memory.

40:07.640 --> 40:13.360
 That's when it now becomes online for direct sensory motor interaction with the world.

40:13.360 --> 40:19.320
 So you think the salience landscape, the ocean of salience extends into the subconscious

40:19.320 --> 40:21.040
 mind?

40:21.040 --> 40:27.520
 I think relevance does, but I think when relevance is recursively processed, relevance realization

40:27.520 --> 40:35.440
 such that it passes through sort of this higher filter of working memory and has these properties

40:35.440 --> 40:41.400
 of being globally accessible and globally broadcast, then it becomes the thing we call

40:41.400 --> 40:42.400
 salience.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.280
 And that's, that's, that's really good evidence.

40:44.280 --> 40:49.400
 There's really good evidence from my colleague at UFT, University of Toronto, Lynn Hasher,

40:49.400 --> 40:50.880
 that that's what working memory is.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.960
 It's a higher order relevance filter.

40:52.960 --> 40:57.680
 That's why things like chunking will get way more information through working memory because

40:57.680 --> 41:04.280
 it's basically making, it's basically monitoring how much relevance realization has gone into

41:04.280 --> 41:06.040
 this information.

41:06.040 --> 41:09.240
 Usually you have to do an additional kind of recursive processing.

41:09.240 --> 41:13.400
 And that tells you, by the way, when do you need consciousness?

41:13.400 --> 41:18.960
 When do you need that working memory and that salience landscaping?

41:18.960 --> 41:24.000
 It's when you're facing situations that are highly novel, highly complex and very ill

41:24.000 --> 41:27.720
 defined that require you to engage working memory.

41:27.720 --> 41:29.320
 Okay, got it.

41:29.320 --> 41:34.520
 So relevance realization is in part the thing that constructs that basic level thing of

41:34.520 --> 41:35.640
 a dog.

41:35.640 --> 41:41.640
 When you see it, when you see a dog, you call it a dog, not a German Shepherd, not a mammal,

41:41.640 --> 41:44.120
 not a biological meat bag.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.720
 It's a dog.

41:45.720 --> 41:46.720
 Wisdom.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.720
 Yes.

41:47.720 --> 41:50.060
 So what is wisdom?

41:50.060 --> 41:57.600
 If we return, I think as part of that, we got to relevance realization and then wisdom

41:57.600 --> 42:02.920
 is accumulation of rationalities.

42:02.920 --> 42:09.240
 You described the rationality as a kind of starting from intelligence, much of puzzle

42:09.240 --> 42:14.360
 solving and then rationalities like the meta problem of puzzle solving and then what wisdom

42:14.360 --> 42:16.840
 is the meta, meta problem of puzzle solving?

42:16.840 --> 42:23.000
 Yes, in the sense that the meta problem you have when you're solving your puzzles is that

42:23.000 --> 42:25.840
 you can often fall into self deception.

42:25.840 --> 42:26.840
 You can misprint.

42:26.840 --> 42:27.840
 Self deception, right.

42:27.840 --> 42:28.840
 Right.

42:28.840 --> 42:35.440
 So knowledge overcomes ignorance, wisdom is about overcoming foolishness if what we mean

42:35.440 --> 42:40.760
 by foolishness is self deceptive, self destructive behavior, which I think is a good definition

42:40.760 --> 42:42.780
 of foolishness.

42:42.780 --> 42:49.720
 And so what you're doing is you're doing this recursive relevance realization.

42:49.720 --> 42:53.640
 You're using your intelligence to improve the use of your intelligence and then you're

42:53.640 --> 42:57.520
 using your rationality to improve the use of your rationality.

42:57.520 --> 43:01.360
 That's that recursive relevance realization I was talking about a few minutes ago.

43:01.360 --> 43:03.260
 Think about a wise person.

43:03.260 --> 43:09.800
 They come into highly often messy, ill defined, complex situations usually where there's some

43:09.800 --> 43:13.080
 significant novelty and what can they do?

43:13.080 --> 43:19.000
 They can zero in on what really matters, what's relevant and then they can shape themselves,

43:19.000 --> 43:26.640
 salience landscaping to intervene most appropriately to that situation as they have framed it.

43:26.640 --> 43:30.800
 That's what we mean by a wise person and that's how it follows out of the model I've been

43:30.800 --> 43:31.800
 presenting to you.

43:31.800 --> 43:37.400
 So when we say self deception, I mean part of that implies that it's intentional.

43:37.400 --> 43:45.240
 Part of the mechanism of cognition, you're modifying what you should know for some purpose.

43:45.240 --> 43:48.160
 Is that how you see the word self deception?

43:48.160 --> 43:53.320
 No, because I belong to a group of people that think the model of self deception as

43:53.320 --> 43:58.000
 lying to oneself ultimately makes no sense.

43:58.000 --> 44:02.280
 Because in order to lie to you, I have to know something you don't and I have to depend

44:02.280 --> 44:06.720
 on your commitment to the truth in order to modify your behavior.

44:06.720 --> 44:09.840
 I don't think that's what we do to ourselves.

44:09.840 --> 44:13.800
 I think, and I'm going to use it in the technical term and thank you for making space for that

44:13.800 --> 44:21.900
 earlier on, I think we can bullshit ourselves, which is a very different thing than lying.

44:21.900 --> 44:27.040
 So what is bullshit and how do we bullshit ourselves, technically speaking?

44:27.040 --> 44:28.040
 Yeah.

44:28.040 --> 44:32.480
 Frankfurt and this is inspired by Frankfurt and other people's work based on Frankfurt's

44:32.480 --> 44:33.480
 work.

44:33.480 --> 44:34.480
 On bullshit.

44:34.480 --> 44:35.480
 Yeah.

44:35.480 --> 44:36.480
 Classic essay.

44:36.480 --> 44:37.480
 It's a pretty good title.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.040
 I think it's one of the best things he wrote.

44:39.040 --> 44:40.560
 He wrote a lot of good things.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.000
 The title or the essay?

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
 The essay.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.720
 The title's good too.

44:44.720 --> 44:49.780
 It's always an icebreaker in certain academic settings.

44:49.780 --> 44:54.360
 So let's contrast the bullshit artist from the liar.

44:54.360 --> 44:59.080
 The liar depends on your commitment to the truth.

44:59.080 --> 45:04.600
 The bullshit artist is actually trying to make you indifferent to the question of truth

45:04.600 --> 45:11.360
 and modify your behavior by making things salient to you so that they are catchy to

45:11.360 --> 45:12.840
 you.

45:12.840 --> 45:21.400
 So a prototypical example of bullshit is a commercial, a television commercial.

45:21.400 --> 45:29.160
 You watch these people at a bar getting some particular kind of alcohol and they're gorgeous

45:29.160 --> 45:34.340
 and they're laughing and they're smiling and they're clear eyed.

45:34.340 --> 45:39.820
 You know that's not true and they know you know it's not true, but here's the point.

45:39.820 --> 45:45.680
 You don't care because there's gorgeous people smiling and they're happy and that's salient

45:45.680 --> 45:47.640
 to you and that catches your attention.

45:47.640 --> 45:53.200
 And so you know, go into a bar, you know that won't happen when you drink this alcohol,

45:53.200 --> 45:54.200
 you know it.

45:54.200 --> 45:55.200
 Yeah.

45:55.200 --> 45:59.200
 But you buy the product because it was made salient to you.

45:59.200 --> 46:03.080
 Now you can't lie to yourself, Lex.

46:03.080 --> 46:06.560
 Salience can catch attention, but attention can drive salience.

46:06.560 --> 46:08.120
 So this is what I can do.

46:08.120 --> 46:15.080
 I can make something salient by paying attention to it and then that will tend to draw me back

46:15.080 --> 46:20.080
 to it again, which, and you see what happens, which means it tends to catch my attention

46:20.080 --> 46:26.160
 more so that when I go into the store, that bottle of liquor catches my attention and

46:26.160 --> 46:27.160
 I buy it.

46:27.160 --> 46:31.720
 And that's, why is that bullshit?

46:31.720 --> 46:40.340
 Because what you're doing is being caught up in the salience of things independent from

46:40.340 --> 46:44.520
 whether or not that salience is tracking reality.

46:44.520 --> 46:48.340
 Is it independent or is it loosely connected?

46:48.340 --> 46:53.760
 Because it's not so obvious to me when I see happy people at a bar that I don't in part

46:53.760 --> 46:58.240
 believe that, well, my experience has been maybe different.

46:58.240 --> 47:05.280
 Logically, I can understand, but maybe there is a bar out there where it's all happy people

47:05.280 --> 47:06.280
 dancing.

47:06.280 --> 47:11.400
 In fact, most of the bars I go to these days in Texas, there's pretty lots of happy people.

47:11.400 --> 47:16.200
 I think you can, I mean, there's probably variation, although I think it's very the

47:16.200 --> 47:17.960
 truth seeking in there.

47:17.960 --> 47:22.720
 Let's say the intent is at least to try and shut off your truth seeking.

47:22.720 --> 47:25.720
 It might not completely succeed, but that's the intent.

47:25.720 --> 47:32.480
 At times it can completely succeed because I can give you pretty much gibberish and never

47:32.480 --> 47:35.400
 let it will motivate your behavior.

47:35.400 --> 47:39.440
 There's an episode from the classic Simpsons, not the modern Simpsons, the classic Simpsons

47:39.440 --> 47:43.920
 where there's aliens and they're running for office in the United States.

47:43.920 --> 47:47.420
 Now I'm a Canadian, so this doesn't quite work for me, but right.

47:47.420 --> 47:51.880
 And this speech goes like this, my fellow Americans, when I was young, I dreamt of being

47:51.880 --> 47:55.480
 a baseball, but we must move forward, not backward.

47:55.480 --> 48:02.240
 Upward, not forward, twirling, twirling towards freedom and people go, and there's a rush.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.040
 There's nothing there.

48:04.040 --> 48:10.260
 And yet it's great satire because a lot of political speech is exactly like that.

48:10.260 --> 48:11.260
 There's nothing there.

48:11.260 --> 48:12.260
 Right?

48:12.260 --> 48:17.800
 Well, I'm not saying all political speech, I said a lot.

48:17.800 --> 48:22.900
 There's a fundamental difference between, and it's so hilarious, I remember that episode.

48:22.900 --> 48:28.080
 There's a fundamental difference between that absurd sort of non secular speech and political

48:28.080 --> 48:35.620
 speech because one of the things is political speech is grounded in some sense of truth.

48:35.620 --> 48:44.220
 And so if that requires you talking about alternative facts and weird self destructive

48:44.220 --> 48:50.680
 oxymoronic phrases, isn't that approaching pure bullshit?

48:50.680 --> 49:00.920
 No, I think pure bullshit, like the vacuum is very difficult to get to, but I get the

49:00.920 --> 49:01.920
 point.

49:01.920 --> 49:07.520
 So what exactly is truth?

49:07.520 --> 49:09.360
 Is it possible to know?

49:09.360 --> 49:14.720
 I think Spinoza's right about truth, that truth is only known by its own standard, which

49:14.720 --> 49:16.160
 sounds circular.

49:16.160 --> 49:20.160
 There's a way in which he didn't mean that circularly, and I think this is also converges

49:20.160 --> 49:21.160
 with Plato.

49:21.160 --> 49:24.520
 These are two huge influences on me.

49:24.520 --> 49:32.300
 I think we only know the truth retrospectively when we go through some process of self transcendence,

49:32.300 --> 49:37.840
 when we move from a frame to a more encompassing frame so that we can see the limitations and

49:37.840 --> 49:40.880
 the distortions of the earlier frame.

49:40.880 --> 49:43.280
 You have this when you have a moment of insight.

49:43.280 --> 49:47.640
 Insight is you doing, you are re realizing what is relevant.

49:47.640 --> 49:55.260
 You go, oh, oh, I thought she was aggressive and angry.

49:55.260 --> 49:57.640
 She's actually really afraid.

49:57.640 --> 50:02.760
 I was misframing this and you change what you find relevant.

50:02.760 --> 50:04.800
 You have those aha moments.

50:04.800 --> 50:14.120
 So do you think it's possible to get a sense of objective reality?

50:14.120 --> 50:22.680
 So is it possible to get to the ground level of something that you can call objective truth?

50:22.680 --> 50:26.600
 Or are we always on shaky ground?

50:26.600 --> 50:35.140
 I think those moments of transcendence can never get us to an absolute view from nowhere.

50:35.140 --> 50:38.340
 And so this is Drew Hyland's notion of finite transcendence.

50:38.340 --> 50:42.720
 We are capable of self transcendence, and therefore we are creatures who can actually

50:42.720 --> 50:48.120
 raise the question of truth, or goodness, or beauty, because I think they all share

50:48.120 --> 50:49.960
 this feature.

50:49.960 --> 50:55.880
 But that doesn't mean we can transcend to a godhood, to some absolute view from nowhere

50:55.880 --> 51:02.440
 that takes in all information and organizes it in a comprehensive whole.

51:02.440 --> 51:10.120
 But that doesn't mean that truth is thereby rendered valueless.

51:10.120 --> 51:13.840
 I think a better term is real.

51:13.840 --> 51:18.560
 And real and illusory are comparative terms.

51:18.560 --> 51:24.660
 You only know that something's an illusion by taking something else to be real.

51:24.660 --> 51:29.760
 And so we're always in a comparative task, but that doesn't mean that we can somehow

51:29.760 --> 51:37.840
 jump outside of our framing in some final manner and say, this is how it is from a God's

51:37.840 --> 51:39.080
 eye point of view.

51:39.080 --> 51:46.940
 So what do you think, if I may ask, of somebody like Ayn Rand and her philosophy of objectivism?

51:46.940 --> 51:51.000
 So where the core principle is that reality exists independently of consciousness and

51:51.000 --> 51:54.960
 that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception.

51:54.960 --> 52:00.440
 So they have that, you do have that ability to know reality.

52:00.440 --> 52:01.600
 There's two things.

52:01.600 --> 52:06.960
 Knowing that there's an independent reality is not knowing that independent reality.

52:06.960 --> 52:07.960
 Those are not the same thing.

52:07.960 --> 52:15.120
 Yeah, but I think objectivism would probably say that our human reason is able to have

52:15.120 --> 52:17.320
 contact with that.

52:17.320 --> 52:24.880
 Then I would respond and say, I believe, in fact, ultimately, in a conformity theory of

52:24.880 --> 52:33.200
 knowing that the deepest kind of knowing is when there's a contact, a conformity between

52:33.200 --> 52:40.840
 the mind, the embodied mind and reality, and here's where I guess I'd push back on Rand.

52:40.840 --> 52:47.400
 I would say you have to acknowledge partial knowledge as real knowledge, because if you

52:47.400 --> 52:50.720
 don't, you're going to fall prey to Meno's paradox.

52:50.720 --> 52:54.840
 Meno's paradox is, you know, it's in Plato, right?

52:54.840 --> 53:00.760
 To know P. Well, if I don't know P, I'm going to go looking for it.

53:00.760 --> 53:04.120
 But if I don't know P, how could I possibly recognize it when I found it?

53:04.120 --> 53:05.920
 I have no way of recognizing it.

53:05.920 --> 53:09.120
 I have no way of knowing that I found it.

53:09.120 --> 53:13.160
 So I must know P. But if I know P, then I don't need to learn about it.

53:13.160 --> 53:16.080
 I don't need to go searching.

53:16.080 --> 53:18.080
 So learning doesn't exist.

53:18.080 --> 53:19.760
 Knowledge is impossible.

53:19.760 --> 53:25.760
 The way you break out of that paradox is saying, no, no, no, it is possible to partially know

53:25.760 --> 53:26.760
 something.

53:26.760 --> 53:31.600
 I can know it enough that it will guide me to recognizing it, but that's not the same

53:31.600 --> 53:35.920
 as having a complete grasp of it, because I still have to search and find what I don't

53:35.920 --> 53:39.280
 yet possess in my knowledge.

53:39.280 --> 53:43.000
 So partial knowledge has to be real knowledge.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
 Right.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.480
 Partial knowledge is still knowledge.

53:45.480 --> 53:46.480
 Yes.

53:46.480 --> 53:52.800
 What do you think about somebody like Donald Hoffman, who thinks the reality is an illusion,

53:52.800 --> 53:59.880
 so complete illusion, that we're given this actually really nice definition or idea that

53:59.880 --> 54:05.440
 you talked about, that there's a tension between the illusory and what is real.

54:05.440 --> 54:12.680
 He says that basically we've taken that and we've ran with the real to the point where

54:12.680 --> 54:18.680
 the real is not at all connected to some kind of physical reality.

54:18.680 --> 54:20.120
 I hope to talk to him at some point.

54:20.120 --> 54:25.760
 You were supposed to talk at one point, and so I have to talk in his absence.

54:25.760 --> 54:30.680
 I think that, first of all, I think saying that everything is an illusion is like saying

54:30.680 --> 54:31.680
 everything is tall.

54:31.680 --> 54:32.680
 It doesn't make any sense.

54:32.680 --> 54:36.440
 It's a comparative term.

54:36.440 --> 54:42.480
 You have to say, against this standard of realness, this is an illusion.

54:42.480 --> 54:52.400
 And he uses arguments from evolution, which are problematic to me because it's like, well,

54:52.400 --> 55:02.440
 you seem to be saying that evolution is true, that it really exists, and then some of our

55:02.440 --> 55:08.320
 cognition and our perception has access to reality, math and presumably some science

55:08.320 --> 55:10.280
 has access to reality.

55:10.280 --> 55:18.280
 And then what he seems to be saying is, well, a lot of your everyday experience is illusory,

55:18.280 --> 55:24.280
 but we do have some contact with reality, whereby we can make the arguments as to why

55:24.280 --> 55:28.920
 most of your experience, most of your everyday experience is an illusion.

55:28.920 --> 55:32.200
 But to me, that's not a novel thing.

55:32.200 --> 55:33.200
 That's Descartes.

55:33.200 --> 55:38.360
 That's the idea that most of our sense experience is untrustworthy, but the math is what connects

55:38.360 --> 55:39.480
 us to reality.

55:39.480 --> 55:41.520
 That's how he interpreted the Copernican revolution.

55:41.520 --> 55:46.600
 Oh, look, we're all seeing the sun rise and move over and set, and it's all an illusion,

55:46.600 --> 55:49.600
 but the math, the math gets us to the reality.

55:49.600 --> 55:57.280
 Well, I think he makes a deeper point that most of cognition is just evolved and operates

55:57.280 --> 55:59.560
 in the illusory world.

55:59.560 --> 56:04.000
 How does he know that things like cognition and evolution exist?

56:04.000 --> 56:09.560
 I think there's an important distinction between evolution and cognition, right?

56:09.560 --> 56:11.720
 No, no, I'm just saying that's not the point I'm making.

56:11.720 --> 56:17.440
 I'm making a point that he's claiming that there are two things that really exist.

56:17.440 --> 56:19.880
 Why are they privileged?

56:19.880 --> 56:26.680
 He basically says that, look, the process of evolution makes sense, right?

56:26.680 --> 56:30.600
 Like it makes sense that you get complex organisms from simple organisms through the natural

56:30.600 --> 56:32.320
 selection process.

56:32.320 --> 56:37.320
 Whereas how you get to transfer information from generation to generation, it makes sense.

56:37.320 --> 56:44.560
 And then he says that there's no requirement for the cognition to evolve in a way that

56:44.560 --> 56:49.960
 it would actually perceive and have direct contact with the physical reality.

56:49.960 --> 56:54.480
 Except that cognition evolved in such a way that it could perceive the truth of evolution.

56:54.480 --> 56:58.160
 And you can't treat evolution like an isolated thing.

56:58.160 --> 57:01.020
 Evolution depends on Darwinian theory, genetics.

57:01.020 --> 57:05.320
 It depends on understanding plate tectonics, the way the environment changes.

57:05.320 --> 57:08.480
 It depends on how chromosomes are structured.

57:08.480 --> 57:13.520
 Actually, that's an interesting question to him, where I don't know if he actually would

57:13.520 --> 57:18.360
 push back on this, is how do you know evolution is real?

57:18.360 --> 57:20.000
 Yes.

57:20.000 --> 57:25.760
 I think he would be open to the idea that it is part of the illusion that we constructed,

57:25.760 --> 57:33.280
 that there's some, in some sense, it is connected to reality, but we don't have a clear picture

57:33.280 --> 57:34.280
 of it.

57:34.280 --> 57:42.120
 I mean, that's an intellectually honest statement then, if most of our cognition as thinking

57:42.120 --> 57:50.880
 beings is operating at every level in an illusory world, then it makes sense that this, one

57:50.880 --> 57:58.680
 of the main theories of science, that's evolution, is also a complete part of this illusory world.

57:58.680 --> 57:59.680
 Right.

57:59.680 --> 58:04.080
 But then what happens to the premise for his argument leading to the conclusion that cognition

58:04.080 --> 58:05.080
 is illusory?

58:05.080 --> 58:09.520
 I think he makes a very specific argument about evolution as an explanation of why the

58:09.520 --> 58:13.520
 world is, of our cognition operating in an illusory world.

58:13.520 --> 58:17.060
 But that's just one of the explanations.

58:17.060 --> 58:23.880
 I think the deeper question is why do we think we have contact with reality, with physical

58:23.880 --> 58:24.880
 reality?

58:24.880 --> 58:34.280
 It's, we could be very well living in a virtual world constructed by our minds in a way that

58:34.280 --> 58:38.960
 makes that world deeply interesting in some ways, whether it's somebody playing a video

58:38.960 --> 58:46.320
 game or we're trying to, through the process of distributed cognition, construct more and

58:46.320 --> 58:47.760
 more complex objects.

58:47.760 --> 58:54.320
 Like why do we have to, why does it have to be connected to like physics and planets and

58:54.320 --> 58:55.320
 all that kind of stuff?

58:55.320 --> 58:56.320
 Okay.

58:56.320 --> 59:01.160
 So if we're going to say like we're now considering it as a possibility rather than it's a conclusion

59:01.160 --> 59:06.240
 based on arguments, because the arguments, again, will always rely on stipulating that

59:06.240 --> 59:08.720
 there is something that is known.

59:08.720 --> 59:10.960
 These are the features of cognition.

59:10.960 --> 59:12.520
 Cognition is capable of illusion.

59:12.520 --> 59:13.840
 That's a true statement.

59:13.840 --> 59:15.960
 You're somehow in contact with the mind.

59:15.960 --> 59:21.500
 Why does the mind have this privileged contact and other aspects like my body do not?

59:21.500 --> 59:25.680
 So that's, but let's put that aside and now let's just consider it.

59:25.680 --> 59:29.520
 Now when we put it that way, it's not an epistemic question anymore.

59:29.520 --> 59:32.240
 It's an existential question and here's my reply to you.

59:32.240 --> 59:34.080
 There's two possibilities.

59:34.080 --> 59:41.720
 Either the illusion is one that I cannot discover, sort of, you know, the matrix on steroids

59:41.720 --> 59:42.720
 or something.

59:42.720 --> 59:43.720
 There's no way.

59:43.720 --> 59:51.000
 Because what I do, I can't find out that it's an illusion or it's an illusion, but I can

59:51.000 --> 59:54.760
 find out that it's an illusion.

59:54.760 --> 59:56.840
 Those are the two possibilities.

59:56.840 --> 1:00:00.800
 Nothing changes for me if those are the two possibilities, because if I could not find,

1:00:00.800 --> 1:00:08.160
 possibly find out, it is irrational for me to pay any attention to that possibility.

1:00:08.160 --> 1:00:11.600
 So I could keep doing the science as I'm doing it.

1:00:11.600 --> 1:00:17.840
 If there's a way of finding out, science is my best bet, I believe, for finding out if

1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:20.440
 it's, what's true and what's an illusion.

1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:22.000
 So I keep doing what I'm doing.

1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.600
 So it's an argument if you move it to that, that makes no existential difference to me.

1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:31.400
 Oh man, that is such a deeply philosophical argument.

1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:34.880
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:00:34.880 --> 1:00:38.400
 Nobody's saying science doesn't work.

1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:43.880
 It's an interesting question, just like before humans were able to fly, they would ask a

1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:47.480
 question, can we build the machine that makes us fly?

1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:51.600
 In that same way, we're asking a question to which we don't know an answer, but we may

1:00:51.600 --> 1:00:58.000
 know in the future, how much of this whole thing is an illusion?

1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:02.520
 And I think in a second category, the first, I forgot which one, yes, science will be able

1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:04.440
 to help us discover this.

1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:07.960
 Otherwise, yes, for sure, that doesn't matter.

1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:13.120
 If we're living in a simulation, we can't find out at all, then it doesn't matter.

1:01:13.120 --> 1:01:20.580
 But yes, the whole point is as we get deeper and deeper understanding of our mind of cognition,

1:01:20.580 --> 1:01:25.220
 we might be able to discover like how much of this is a big charade constructed by our

1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:28.680
 mind to keep us fed or something like that.

1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:34.620
 Some weird, some weird, very simplistic explanation that it will ultimately in its simplicity

1:01:34.620 --> 1:01:44.760
 be beautiful, or as we try to build robots and instill them, instill them with consciousness,

1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:54.520
 with ability to feel, those kinds of things, we'll discover, well, let's just trick them

1:01:54.520 --> 1:01:58.720
 into thinking they feel and have consciousness and they'll believe it.

1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:01.900
 And then they'll have a deeply fulfilling and meaningful lives.

1:02:01.900 --> 1:02:05.720
 And on top of that, they will interact with us in a way that will make our lives more

1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:06.720
 meaningful.

1:02:06.720 --> 1:02:11.160
 And then all of a sudden, it's like at the end of Animal Farm, you look at pigs and humans

1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:14.920
 and you look at robots and humans and you can't tell the difference between either.

1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:21.960
 And we in that way start to understand that much of this existence could be an illusion.

1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:25.220
 Okay, well, I have two responses to that.

1:02:25.220 --> 1:02:37.080
 First is the progress that's being made on like AGI is about making whatever the system

1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:42.720
 is that's going to be the source of intelligent more and more dynamically and recursively

1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:45.080
 self correcting.

1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:48.920
 That's part of what's happening.

1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:52.520
 Extrapolating from that, you get a system that gets better and better at self correcting,

1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:59.600
 but that's exactly what I was describing before as the transformative theory of truth.

1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:09.420
 The other response to that is people think of science just as sort of end proposition.

1:03:09.420 --> 1:03:15.700
 Let me just use the evolutionary example again, right?

1:03:15.700 --> 1:03:20.520
 If I'm gathering the evidence, I need to know a lot of geology, I need to know plate tectonics,

1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:25.560
 I need to know about radioactive decay, I need to know about genetics, and then in order

1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:30.160
 to measure all those things, I need to know how microscopes work, I need to know how pencils

1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:36.480
 and paper work, I need to know how rulers work, I need to know how English... You can't

1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:38.680
 isolate knowledge that way.

1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:43.200
 And if you say, well, most of that's an illusion, then you're in a weird position of saying

1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:48.360
 somehow all of these illusions get to this truth claim.

1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:50.620
 I think it goes in reverse.

1:03:50.620 --> 1:03:55.960
 If you think this is the truth claim, the measuring and all the things that scientists

1:03:55.960 --> 1:04:01.660
 would do to gather on all the ways the theories are converging together, that also has to

1:04:01.660 --> 1:04:07.920
 be fundamentally right, because it's not like Lego, it is an interwoven whole.

1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:13.180
 Yes, it definitely is interwoven, but I love how I'm playing the devil advocate for the

1:04:13.180 --> 1:04:14.720
 illusion world.

1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:21.800
 But there's an aspect to truth that has to be consistent, deeply consistent across an

1:04:21.800 --> 1:04:23.360
 entire system.

1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:28.480
 But inside a video game, that same kind of consistency evolves.

1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:33.560
 There's rules about interactions, there's game theoretic patterns about what's good

1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:39.640
 and bad and so on, and there's sources of joy and fear and anger, and then understanding

1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:44.460
 about a world, what happens in different dynamics of a video game, even simple video games.

1:04:44.460 --> 1:04:52.680
 So there's no, even inside an illusion, you can have consistency and develop truths inside

1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:59.400
 that illusion and iteratively evolve your truth with the illusion.

1:04:59.400 --> 1:05:02.040
 Okay, but that comes back.

1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:06.320
 Is that process genuinely self correcting, or are you in the simulation in which there

1:05:06.320 --> 1:05:08.560
 is no possible doorway out?

1:05:08.560 --> 1:05:12.920
 Because if, my argument is, if you find one or two doorways, that feeds back.

1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:17.680
 In fact, you can't just say, this is the little tiny island where we have the truth.

1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:18.680
 That's the point I'm making.

1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:19.680
 Right.

1:05:19.680 --> 1:05:24.400
 But what if you find that, I think there is doorways, if that's the case.

1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:29.760
 And what if you find a doorway and you step out, but you're yet in another simulation?

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.860
 I mean, that's the point.

1:05:31.860 --> 1:05:34.360
 That's so self correcting.

1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:40.640
 When you fix the self deception, you don't know if there's other bigger self deceptions

1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:41.640
 you're operating on.

1:05:41.640 --> 1:05:42.640
 Of course.

1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:43.640
 That makes sense.

1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:44.640
 That's right.

1:05:44.640 --> 1:05:49.440
 But again, we're back to when I step into the second simulation, is it, can I get the

1:05:49.440 --> 1:05:51.620
 doorway out of that or right?

1:05:51.620 --> 1:05:55.400
 Because if you just make the infinite regressive simulations, you basically said, I have a

1:05:55.400 --> 1:05:57.280
 simulation that I can never get out of.

1:05:57.280 --> 1:05:58.280
 Yeah.

1:05:58.280 --> 1:06:04.400
 I think there's always a bigger pile of bullshit is the claim I'm trying to make here.

1:06:04.400 --> 1:06:07.000
 Okay.

1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:09.160
 Let me dance around meaning once more.

1:06:09.160 --> 1:06:10.160
 Sure.

1:06:10.160 --> 1:06:16.720
 I ask people on this podcast or at a bar or to imaginary people I talk to in a room when

1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:22.040
 I'm all by myself, the question of the meaning of life.

1:06:22.040 --> 1:06:24.900
 Do you think this is a useful question?

1:06:24.900 --> 1:06:29.320
 You drew a line between meaning in life and meaning of life.

1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:31.680
 Do you think this is a useful question?

1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:35.720
 No, I think it's like the question, what's north of the North Pole or what time is it

1:06:35.720 --> 1:06:36.720
 on the sun?

1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:41.400
 It sounds like a question, but it's actually not really a question because it has a presupposition

1:06:41.400 --> 1:06:45.840
 in it that I think is fundamentally flawed.

1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:50.400
 If I understand what people mean by it, and it's actually often not that clear, but when

1:06:50.400 --> 1:06:55.120
 they talk about the meaning of life, they are talking about there are some feature of

1:06:55.120 --> 1:07:01.040
 the universe in and of itself that I have to discover and enter into a relationship

1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:05.680
 with and there's in that sense, a plan for me or something.

1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:09.600
 And so that's a property of the universe.

1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:14.920
 That's a very deep, serious, metaphysical, ontological claim.

1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:18.320
 You're claiming to know something fundamental about the structure of reality.

1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:22.560
 There were times when people thought they had a worldview that legitimated it, like

1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:28.600
 God is running the universe and God cares about you and there's a plan, et cetera.

1:07:28.600 --> 1:07:36.080
 But I think a better way of understanding meaning is not...

1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:37.080
 Meaning is like the graspability.

1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:41.180
 Remember, I talked about optimal grip, it's like the graspability of that cup.

1:07:41.180 --> 1:07:42.960
 Is that in me?

1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:44.160
 No.

1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:45.160
 Is it in the cup?

1:07:45.160 --> 1:07:47.880
 No, because a fly can't grasp it.

1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:51.680
 Well, graspability is in my hand, well, I can't grasp Africa.

1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:58.320
 No, no, there is a real relation, fittedness between me and this cup.

1:07:58.320 --> 1:08:00.480
 Same thing with the adaptivity of an organism.

1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:03.400
 Is the adaptivity of a great white shark in the great white shark?

1:08:03.400 --> 1:08:07.240
 Drop it in the Sahara, dies, okay?

1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:14.960
 Meaning isn't in me, I think that's romantic bullshit, and it isn't in the universe, it

1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:17.280
 is a proper relationship.

1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:22.040
 I've coined the phrase transjective, it is the binding relationship between the subjective

1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:23.340
 and the objective.

1:08:23.340 --> 1:08:31.560
 And therefore, when you're asking the question about the meaning of life, you are, I think,

1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:33.760
 misrepresenting the nature of meaning.

1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:36.480
 Just like when you ask, what time is it on the sun?

1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:40.740
 You're misrepresenting how we derive clock time.

1:08:40.740 --> 1:08:45.440
 At the risk of disagreeing with a man who did 50 lectures on the meaning crisis, let

1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:48.000
 me hard disagree.

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:52.720
 But I think we probably agree, but it's just like a dance, like any dialogue.

1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:59.120
 I think meaning of life gets at the same kind of relationship between you and the glass

1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:12.760
 of water, between whatever the forces of the universe that created the planets, the proteins,

1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:21.640
 the multi cell organisms, the intelligent early humans, the beautiful human civilizations

1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:26.360
 and the technologies that will overtake them.

1:09:26.360 --> 1:09:39.020
 It's trying to understand the relevance realization of the Big Bang to the feeling of love you

1:09:39.020 --> 1:09:42.080
 have for another human being.

1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:46.500
 It's reaching for that, even though it's hopeless to understand.

1:09:46.500 --> 1:09:50.420
 It's the question, the asking of the question is the reaching.

1:09:50.420 --> 1:09:58.480
 Now it is, in fact, romantic bullshit, technically speaking.

1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:07.700
 But it could be that romantic bullshit is actually the essence of life and the source

1:10:07.700 --> 1:10:09.520
 of its deepest meaning.

1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:12.620
 Well, I hope not.

1:10:12.620 --> 1:10:18.760
 But technically speaking, romantic bullshit, meaning romantic in the philosophical sense,

1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:19.760
 yes.

1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:23.600
 I mean, what is poetry?

1:10:23.600 --> 1:10:24.600
 What is music?

1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:27.840
 What is the magic you feel when you hear a beautiful piece of music?

1:10:27.840 --> 1:10:28.840
 What is that?

1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:31.200
 Oh, but that's exactly to my point.

1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:34.760
 Is music inside you or is it outside you?

1:10:34.760 --> 1:10:36.080
 It's both and neither.

1:10:36.080 --> 1:10:39.120
 And that's precisely why you find it so meaningful.

1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:43.480
 In fact, it can be so meaningful you can regard it as sacred.

1:10:43.480 --> 1:10:48.080
 What you said, I don't think, and you preface that we might not be in disagreement, right?

1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:56.000
 What you said is, no, no, no, there is a way in which reality is realizing itself.

1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:04.320
 And I want my relevance realization to be in the best possible relationship, the sort

1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:07.000
 of meta optimal grip to what is most real.

1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:08.360
 I totally agree.

1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:12.100
 I totally think that's one of the things, I said this earlier, one of our meta desires

1:11:12.100 --> 1:11:16.920
 is whatever is satisfying our desires is also real.

1:11:16.920 --> 1:11:21.800
 I do this with my students, I'll say, you know, because romantic relationships sort

1:11:21.800 --> 1:11:25.520
 of take the role of God and religion and history and culture for us right now.

1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:29.280
 We put everything on them and that's why they break, right?

1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:30.280
 Strong words.

1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:31.820
 Got it.

1:11:31.820 --> 1:11:36.660
 But I'll say to them, okay, how many of you are in really satisfying romantic relationships?

1:11:36.660 --> 1:11:37.660
 Put up your hands.

1:11:37.660 --> 1:11:40.240
 Then I'll say, okay, I'm now only talking to these people.

1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:44.220
 Of those people, how many of you would want to know your partner's cheating on you even

1:11:44.220 --> 1:11:49.140
 if it means the destruction of the relationship, 95% of them put up their hands.

1:11:49.140 --> 1:11:51.300
 And I say, but why?

1:11:51.300 --> 1:11:56.120
 And here's my students who are usually all sort of bitten with cynicism and postmodernism

1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:01.640
 and they'll just say spontaneously, well, because it's not real, because it's not real.

1:12:01.640 --> 1:12:02.640
 Right.

1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:12.360
 So I think what you're pointing to is actually, you're pointing not to an objective or a

1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:14.160
 subjective thing.

1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:15.440
 Empiricism says it's subjective.

1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:19.760
 There's some sort of, I guess, like positivism or Lockean empiricism says it's objective,

1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:24.620
 but you're saying, no, no, no, there's reality realization and can I get relevance realization

1:12:24.620 --> 1:12:30.060
 to be optimally gripping in the best right relationship with it?

1:12:30.060 --> 1:12:33.820
 And there's good reason you can because think about it, your relevance realization isn't

1:12:33.820 --> 1:12:38.140
 just representing properties of the world, it's instantiating it.

1:12:38.140 --> 1:12:42.780
 There's something very similar to biological evolution, which is that the guts of life,

1:12:42.780 --> 1:12:48.620
 if I'm right, running your cognition, it's not just that you have ideas, you actually

1:12:48.620 --> 1:12:52.700
 instantiate, that's what I mean by conformity, the same principles.

1:12:52.700 --> 1:12:55.600
 They're within and without, they don't belong to you subjectively.

1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:58.380
 They're not just out there, they're both at the same time.

1:12:58.380 --> 1:13:03.660
 And they help to explain how you are actually bound to the evolutionary world.

1:13:03.660 --> 1:13:04.660
 Yeah.

1:13:04.660 --> 1:13:07.340
 So it comes from both inside and from the outside.

1:13:07.340 --> 1:13:14.100
 But there's still the question of the meaning of life, first of all, the big benefit of

1:13:14.100 --> 1:13:21.200
 that question is that it shakes you out of your hamster in a wheel that is daily life,

1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:26.340
 the mundane process of daily life, where you have a schedule, you wake up, you have kids,

1:13:26.340 --> 1:13:30.740
 you have to take them to school, then you go to work and the da da da da da and repeats

1:13:30.740 --> 1:13:35.100
 over and over and over and over and then you get increased salary and then you upgrade

1:13:35.100 --> 1:13:40.060
 to home and that whole process.

1:13:40.060 --> 1:13:48.500
 Asking about the meaning of life is so full of romantic bullshit that if you just allow

1:13:48.500 --> 1:13:57.220
 yourself to take it seriously for a second, it forces you to pause and think, what's going

1:13:57.220 --> 1:13:58.500
 on here?

1:13:58.500 --> 1:14:03.420
 And then it ultimately, I think, does return to the question of meaning in those mundane

1:14:03.420 --> 1:14:04.420
 things.

1:14:04.420 --> 1:14:07.260
 What gives my life joy?

1:14:07.260 --> 1:14:12.380
 What gives it lasting deliciousness?

1:14:12.380 --> 1:14:16.740
 Where do I notice the magic and how can I have that magic return again and again?

1:14:16.740 --> 1:14:17.740
 Beauty.

1:14:17.740 --> 1:14:20.220
 And that ultimately what it returns to.

1:14:20.220 --> 1:14:23.260
 But it's the same thing you do when you look up to the sky.

1:14:23.260 --> 1:14:27.340
 You spend most of your day hurrying around looking at things on the surface, but when

1:14:27.340 --> 1:14:33.060
 you look up to the sky and you see the stars, it fills you with the feeling of awe that

1:14:33.060 --> 1:14:39.580
 forces you to pause and think in full context of like, what the hell is going on here?

1:14:39.580 --> 1:14:50.180
 That, but also I think there is a, when you think too much about the meaning of a glass

1:14:50.180 --> 1:14:56.420
 and relevance realization of a glass, you don't necessarily get at the core of what

1:14:56.420 --> 1:14:58.780
 makes music beautiful.

1:14:58.780 --> 1:15:02.260
 So sometimes you have to start at the biggest picture first.

1:15:02.260 --> 1:15:09.540
 And I think meaning of life forces you to really go to the big bang and go to the universe

1:15:09.540 --> 1:15:12.380
 and the whole thing, the origin of life.

1:15:12.380 --> 1:15:19.260
 And I think sometimes you have to start there to discover the meaning in the day to day,

1:15:19.260 --> 1:15:24.580
 I think, but perhaps you would disagree.

1:15:24.580 --> 1:15:32.100
 In so far as the question makes you ask about the whole of your life and how much meaning

1:15:32.100 --> 1:15:34.640
 is in the whole of your life.

1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:40.820
 And in so far as it asks how much that is connected to reality, it's a good question.

1:15:40.820 --> 1:15:47.180
 But it's a bad question in that it also makes you look for the answers in the wrong way.

1:15:47.180 --> 1:15:52.260
 Now you said, and I agree with what you said, how we really answer this question is we come

1:15:52.260 --> 1:15:56.900
 back to the meaning in life and we see how much that meaning in life is connected to

1:15:56.900 --> 1:15:58.220
 reality.

1:15:58.220 --> 1:16:00.120
 We pursue wisdom.

1:16:00.120 --> 1:16:08.220
 And so for me, I don't need that question in order to provoke me into that stance.

1:16:08.220 --> 1:16:11.220
 So let's return to the meaning crisis.

1:16:11.220 --> 1:16:12.220
 Yes.

1:16:12.220 --> 1:16:18.020
 What is the nature of the meaning crisis in modern times?

1:16:18.020 --> 1:16:19.100
 What's its origin?

1:16:19.100 --> 1:16:20.100
 What's its explanation?

1:16:20.100 --> 1:16:25.100
 Well, remember what I said, what I argued, that the very processes that make us adaptively

1:16:25.100 --> 1:16:30.140
 intelligent subject us to perennial problems of self deception, self destruction, creating

1:16:30.140 --> 1:16:33.220
 bullshit for ourselves, for other people, all of that.

1:16:33.220 --> 1:16:42.600
 And that can cause anxiety, existential anxiety, it can cause despair, it can cause a sense

1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:45.180
 of absurdity.

1:16:45.180 --> 1:16:47.940
 These are perennial problems.

1:16:47.940 --> 1:16:54.660
 And across cultures and across historical periods, human beings have come up with ecologies

1:16:54.660 --> 1:16:58.100
 of practices, there's no one practice, there's no panacea practice, they've come up with

1:16:58.100 --> 1:17:05.300
 ecologies of practices for ameliorating that self deception and enhancing that fittedness,

1:17:05.300 --> 1:17:09.380
 that connectedness that's at the core of meaning in life.

1:17:09.380 --> 1:17:13.700
 That's prototypically what we call wisdom.

1:17:13.700 --> 1:17:22.940
 And here's how I can show you one clear instance of the meaning crisis, is it's a wisdom famine.

1:17:22.940 --> 1:17:26.780
 I do this regularly with my students.

1:17:26.780 --> 1:17:28.860
 In the classroom I'll say, where do you go for information?

1:17:28.860 --> 1:17:31.700
 They hold up their phone.

1:17:31.700 --> 1:17:32.700
 Where do you go for knowledge?

1:17:32.700 --> 1:17:36.500
 They're a little bit slower and probably because they're in my class, they'll say, well, science,

1:17:36.500 --> 1:17:37.500
 the university.

1:17:37.500 --> 1:17:42.220
 I'll say, where do you go for wisdom?

1:17:42.220 --> 1:17:45.180
 There's a silence.

1:17:45.180 --> 1:17:49.940
 Wisdom isn't optional, that's why it is perennial, cross cultural, cross historical, because

1:17:49.940 --> 1:17:51.500
 of the perennial problems.

1:17:51.500 --> 1:18:00.120
 But we do not have homes for ecologies of practices that fit into our scientific technological

1:18:00.120 --> 1:18:03.040
 worldview so that they are considered legitimate.

1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:06.900
 The fastest growing demographic group are the nones, N O N E S.

1:18:06.900 --> 1:18:11.780
 They have no religious allegiance, but they are not primarily atheistic.

1:18:11.780 --> 1:18:18.140
 They most frequently describe themselves with this very, this has become almost everybody

1:18:18.140 --> 1:18:25.140
 now describes, I'm spiritual but not religious, which means they are trying to find a way

1:18:25.140 --> 1:18:31.180
 of reducing the bullshit and enhancing the connectedness, but they don't want to turn

1:18:31.180 --> 1:18:36.700
 to any of the legacy established religions by and large.

1:18:36.700 --> 1:18:45.380
 Well isn't both religion and the nones, isn't wisdom a process, not a destination?

1:18:45.380 --> 1:18:52.380
 So trying to find, if you're a deeply faithful religious person, you're also trying to find,

1:18:52.380 --> 1:18:53.380
 right?

1:18:53.380 --> 1:18:59.660
 So just because you have a place where you're looking or a set of traditions around which

1:18:59.660 --> 1:19:05.180
 you're constructing the search, it's nevertheless a search.

1:19:05.180 --> 1:19:12.080
 So I guess, is there a case to be made that this is just the usual human condition?

1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:13.080
 How do you answer?

1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:16.900
 If you asked five centuries ago, where do you look for wisdom?

1:19:16.900 --> 1:19:24.340
 I mean, I suppose people would be more inclined to answer, well, the Bible or a religious

1:19:24.340 --> 1:19:25.340
 text.

1:19:25.340 --> 1:19:26.340
 Right.

1:19:26.340 --> 1:19:32.660
 And they had a worldview that was considered not just religious, but also rational.

1:19:32.660 --> 1:19:40.460
 So we now have these two things, orthogonal or often oppositional, spirituality and rationality.

1:19:40.460 --> 1:19:44.940
 But if you go before a particular historical period, you look back in the Neoplatonic tradition,

1:19:44.940 --> 1:19:49.820
 like before the scientific revolution, those two are not in opposition.

1:19:49.820 --> 1:19:56.280
 They are deeply interwoven so that you can have a sense of legitimacy and deep realness

1:19:56.280 --> 1:19:59.780
 and grounding in your practices.

1:19:59.780 --> 1:20:01.120
 We don't have that anymore.

1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:04.700
 And I'm not advocating for religion, neither am I an enemy of religion.

1:20:04.700 --> 1:20:06.940
 I'll strengthen your case, by the way.

1:20:06.940 --> 1:20:14.300
 So one of my RAs did research, and you get people who have committed themselves to cultivating

1:20:14.300 --> 1:20:15.300
 wisdom.

1:20:15.300 --> 1:20:19.420
 And you can look at people within religious traditions and people who are doing it in

1:20:19.420 --> 1:20:21.800
 a purely secular framework.

1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:28.700
 By many of the measures we use to study wisdom scientifically, the people in the religious

1:20:28.700 --> 1:20:32.220
 paths do better than the secular.

1:20:32.220 --> 1:20:37.140
 But here's the important point, there's no significant difference between the religious

1:20:37.140 --> 1:20:38.520
 paths.

1:20:38.520 --> 1:20:43.900
 So it's not like if you're following the path of Judaism, you're more likely to end up wiser

1:20:43.900 --> 1:20:45.940
 than if you follow Buddhism.

1:20:45.940 --> 1:20:47.180
 By the way, I don't know if that's my case.

1:20:47.180 --> 1:20:50.740
 I was making the case that you don't need to have a religious affiliation to search

1:20:50.740 --> 1:20:52.020
 for wisdom.

1:20:52.020 --> 1:20:57.900
 It's that I thought along to the point you just made, that it doesn't matter which religious

1:20:57.900 --> 1:20:59.860
 affiliation or none.

1:20:59.860 --> 1:21:01.420
 But that's what I'm saying.

1:21:01.420 --> 1:21:04.360
 Okay, so this is the tricky thing we're in.

1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:09.740
 It does matter if you're in one, but it doesn't matter sort of the propositional creeds of

1:21:09.740 --> 1:21:10.740
 that.

1:21:10.740 --> 1:21:12.640
 There's something else at work.

1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:18.260
 If you'll allow me this, there's a functionality to religion that we lost when we rejected

1:21:18.260 --> 1:21:20.460
 all the propositional dogma.

1:21:20.460 --> 1:21:24.340
 But there's a functionality there that we don't know how to recreate.

1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:25.340
 Yeah.

1:21:25.340 --> 1:21:26.340
 What is that?

1:21:26.340 --> 1:21:27.340
 Can you try to speak to that?

1:21:27.340 --> 1:21:28.340
 What is that functionality?

1:21:28.340 --> 1:21:29.340
 What is that?

1:21:29.340 --> 1:21:31.700
 Why is that so useful?

1:21:31.700 --> 1:21:39.260
 A bunch of stories, a bunch of myths, a bunch of narratives that are drenched in deep lessons

1:21:39.260 --> 1:21:43.180
 about morality and all those kinds of things.

1:21:43.180 --> 1:21:47.820
 What's the functional thing there that can't be replaced without a religious text by a

1:21:47.820 --> 1:21:49.700
 nonreligious text?

1:21:49.700 --> 1:21:51.660
 This is, for me, the golden question.

1:21:51.660 --> 1:21:52.660
 So thank you.

1:21:52.660 --> 1:21:54.780
 Do you have an answer?

1:21:54.780 --> 1:21:55.780
 Yeah.

1:21:55.780 --> 1:21:58.860
 I think I have a significant answer.

1:21:58.860 --> 1:22:02.140
 I don't think it's complete, but I think it's important.

1:22:02.140 --> 1:22:10.600
 And this is to step before the Cartesian revolution and think about many different kinds of knowing.

1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:15.380
 And this is now something that is prominent within what's called 4E cognitive science,

1:22:15.380 --> 1:22:17.300
 the kind of cognitive science I practice.

1:22:17.300 --> 1:22:22.180
 And there's a lot of converging evidence for these different ways of knowing.

1:22:22.180 --> 1:22:23.500
 There's propositional knowing.

1:22:23.500 --> 1:22:25.100
 This is what we are most familiar with.

1:22:25.100 --> 1:22:29.740
 In fact, it almost has a tyrannical status, right?

1:22:29.740 --> 1:22:33.780
 This is knowing that something is the case, like that cats are mammals and it's stored

1:22:33.780 --> 1:22:40.540
 in semantic memory, and we have tests of coherence and correspondence and conviction, right?

1:22:40.540 --> 1:22:41.620
 There's procedural knowing.

1:22:41.620 --> 1:22:46.180
 This is knowing how to do something.

1:22:46.180 --> 1:22:47.820
 Skills are not theories.

1:22:47.820 --> 1:22:48.820
 They're not beliefs.

1:22:48.820 --> 1:22:49.820
 They're not true or false.

1:22:49.820 --> 1:22:53.100
 They engage the world or they don't.

1:22:53.100 --> 1:22:58.460
 And they are stored in a different kind of memory, procedural memory.

1:22:58.460 --> 1:23:02.040
 Semantic memory can be damaged without any damage to procedural memory.

1:23:02.040 --> 1:23:06.060
 That's why you have the prototypical story of somebody suffering Alzheimer's and they're

1:23:06.060 --> 1:23:11.240
 losing all kinds of facts, but they can still sit down and play the piano flawlessly.

1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:12.900
 Same kind of argument.

1:23:12.900 --> 1:23:15.380
 There's perspectival knowing.

1:23:15.380 --> 1:23:20.160
 This is knowing what it's like to be you here now in this situation, in this state of mind,

1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:25.860
 the whole field of your salience landscaping, what it's like to be you here now.

1:23:25.860 --> 1:23:31.140
 And you have a specific kind of memory around that, episodic memory, and you have a different

1:23:31.140 --> 1:23:33.200
 criterion of realness.

1:23:33.200 --> 1:23:39.900
 So you can get this by my friend Dan Schiappi and I, we studied the scientists using moving

1:23:39.900 --> 1:23:43.740
 the rovers around, or you can take a look at people who are doing VR.

1:23:43.740 --> 1:23:49.620
 People talk about they want to really be in the game, and that makes it real.

1:23:49.620 --> 1:23:51.660
 They don't mean verisimilitude.

1:23:51.660 --> 1:23:58.340
 You can get that sense of being in the game with something like Tetris, which doesn't

1:23:58.340 --> 1:24:03.620
 look like the real world, and you can fail to have it in a video game that has a lot

1:24:03.620 --> 1:24:04.620
 of verisimilitude.

1:24:04.620 --> 1:24:05.620
 It's something else.

1:24:05.620 --> 1:24:09.300
 It's about, again, this kind of connectedness that we're talking about.

1:24:09.300 --> 1:24:14.060
 If I may interrupt, is that connected to the hard problem of consciousness, the subject,

1:24:14.060 --> 1:24:18.600
 the qualia, or is that a different, that kind of knowing, is that different from the quality

1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:19.600
 of consciousness?

1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:22.660
 I think it has to do with, well, I make a distinction between the adjectival and the

1:24:22.660 --> 1:24:27.020
 adverbial qualia, so I think it has to do with the adverbial qualia much more than with

1:24:27.020 --> 1:24:28.020
 the adjectival.

1:24:28.020 --> 1:24:32.860
 So the adjectival qualia are like the greenness of green and the blueness of blue.

1:24:32.860 --> 1:24:41.500
 The adverbial qualia are the hereness, the nowness, the togetherness.

1:24:41.500 --> 1:24:46.180
 And I think the perspectival knowing has a lot to do with the adverbial qualia.

1:24:46.180 --> 1:24:48.380
 Adjectival qualia and adverbial qualia.

1:24:48.380 --> 1:24:50.660
 I'm learning so many new things today.

1:24:50.660 --> 1:24:53.780
 Okay, so that's another way of knowing.

1:24:53.780 --> 1:24:56.580
 Right, the perspectival, and then there's a deeper one.

1:24:56.580 --> 1:25:01.860
 And this is a philosophical point, and I don't want to, we can go through the argument, but

1:25:01.860 --> 1:25:05.580
 you don't have to know that you know in order to know, because if you start doing that,

1:25:05.580 --> 1:25:06.580
 you get an infinite regress.

1:25:06.580 --> 1:25:10.140
 There has to be kinds of knowing that doesn't mean you know that you know that.

1:25:10.140 --> 1:25:11.140
 Yeah.

1:25:11.140 --> 1:25:12.140
 Okay.

1:25:12.140 --> 1:25:13.140
 Of course.

1:25:13.140 --> 1:25:14.140
 Okay, great.

1:25:14.140 --> 1:25:15.140
 Okay, good.

1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:19.540
 Well, there was a lot of ink spilled over that over a 40 year period, so.

1:25:19.540 --> 1:25:24.900
 My philosophers, they spill, this is what they do, they spill ink to get paid for ink

1:25:24.900 --> 1:25:25.900
 spillage.

1:25:25.900 --> 1:25:29.380
 So I want to talk about what I call participatory knowing.

1:25:29.380 --> 1:25:36.360
 This is the idea that you and the world are co participating in things and such that real

1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:38.520
 affordances exist between you.

1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:44.820
 So both me and this environment are shaped by gravity, so the affordance of walking becomes

1:25:44.820 --> 1:25:46.720
 available to me.

1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:53.480
 Both me and a lot of this environment are shaped by my biology, and so affordances for

1:25:53.480 --> 1:25:55.620
 that are here.

1:25:55.620 --> 1:26:04.660
 Look at this cup, shared physics, shared sort of biological factors, my hand, I'm bipedal,

1:26:04.660 --> 1:26:06.820
 also culture is shaping me and shaping this.

1:26:06.820 --> 1:26:10.460
 I had to learn how to use that and treat it as a cup.

1:26:10.460 --> 1:26:14.780
 So this is an agent arena relationship, right?

1:26:14.780 --> 1:26:21.660
 Use identities being created in your agency, identities being created in the world as an

1:26:21.660 --> 1:26:24.340
 arena so you and the world fit together.

1:26:24.340 --> 1:26:29.940
 You know when that's missing, when you're really lonely, or you're homesick, or you're

1:26:29.940 --> 1:26:31.420
 suffering culture shock.

1:26:31.420 --> 1:26:38.780
 So this is participatory knowing, and it's the sense of, it comes with a sense of belonging.

1:26:38.780 --> 1:26:40.060
 At every level.

1:26:40.060 --> 1:26:43.780
 So the ability to walk is a kind of knowing.

1:26:43.780 --> 1:26:44.780
 Yes.

1:26:44.780 --> 1:26:45.780
 Yes.

1:26:45.780 --> 1:26:52.140
 That there's a dance between the physics that enables this process and just participating

1:26:52.140 --> 1:26:54.860
 in the process is the act of knowing.

1:26:54.860 --> 1:26:55.860
 Right.

1:26:55.860 --> 1:26:59.860
 And there's a really weird form of memory you have for this kind of knowing, it's called

1:26:59.860 --> 1:27:00.860
 yourself.

1:27:00.860 --> 1:27:01.860
 What?

1:27:01.860 --> 1:27:02.860
 Can you elaborate?

1:27:02.860 --> 1:27:10.080
 Well, you do, so we talked about how all the different other kinds of knowing had specific

1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:17.020
 kinds of memory, semantic memory for propositional, procedural, episodic for perspectival.

1:27:17.020 --> 1:27:23.420
 What's the kind of memory that is the coordinated storehouse of all of your agent arena relationships?

1:27:23.420 --> 1:27:28.020
 All the roles you can take, all the identities you can assume, all the identities you can

1:27:28.020 --> 1:27:29.020
 assign.

1:27:29.020 --> 1:27:30.020
 Yeah, what's the self?

1:27:30.020 --> 1:27:31.020
 Do you mean like consciousness?

1:27:31.020 --> 1:27:33.580
 No, I mean your sense of self.

1:27:33.580 --> 1:27:38.020
 Sense of self in this world that's not consciousness.

1:27:38.020 --> 1:27:40.620
 It's like an agency or something.

1:27:40.620 --> 1:27:43.340
 Right, it's an agent arena relationship.

1:27:43.340 --> 1:27:50.260
 And so in an agent arena relationship, it's the sense of the agent.

1:27:50.260 --> 1:27:52.880
 And that the agent belongs in that arena.

1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:58.860
 Whatever the agent is, whatever the arena is, because it's probably a bunch of different

1:27:58.860 --> 1:28:01.700
 framings of how you experience that.

1:28:01.700 --> 1:28:04.260
 Yeah, and you do.

1:28:04.260 --> 1:28:09.120
 In your identity as a self, you have all kinds of roles that are somehow contributing to

1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:12.740
 that identity, but are not equivalent to that identity.

1:28:12.740 --> 1:28:13.740
 Yeah.

1:28:13.740 --> 1:28:20.100
 I wonder if like my two hands have different, because there's a different experience of

1:28:20.100 --> 1:28:25.220
 me picking up something with my right hand and then my left hand.

1:28:25.220 --> 1:28:28.060
 Are those like...

1:28:28.060 --> 1:28:30.180
 That's a really cool question, Lex.

1:28:30.180 --> 1:28:37.580
 They certainly feel like their own things, but that could be just anthropomorphization

1:28:37.580 --> 1:28:40.060
 based on cultural narratives and so on.

1:28:40.060 --> 1:28:43.540
 It could, but I think it's a legitimate empirical question because it also could be sort of

1:28:43.540 --> 1:28:45.020
 Ian McGilchrist stuff.

1:28:45.020 --> 1:28:50.220
 It could be you're using different hemispheres and they sort of have different agent arena

1:28:50.220 --> 1:28:52.080
 relationships to the environment.

1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:55.780
 This is a really important question in the cognitive science of the self.

1:28:55.780 --> 1:29:00.500
 Does that hemispheric difference mean you're multiple or you actually have a singular self?

1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:03.780
 So it's important to understand how many cells are there.

1:29:03.780 --> 1:29:05.380
 Yes, I think so.

1:29:05.380 --> 1:29:09.580
 But that's just like a quirk of evolution.

1:29:09.580 --> 1:29:14.620
 Surely it can be fundamental to cognition, having multiple cells or a singular self.

1:29:14.620 --> 1:29:22.620
 It depends, again, because we're getting far from the answer to the question you originally

1:29:22.620 --> 1:29:23.620
 asked me.

1:29:23.620 --> 1:29:25.260
 Do you want me to go back to that first or answer this one?

1:29:25.260 --> 1:29:26.260
 Which question?

1:29:26.260 --> 1:29:27.260
 I already forgot everything.

1:29:27.260 --> 1:29:28.740
 What's the functionality of religion?

1:29:28.740 --> 1:29:29.740
 Yes.

1:29:29.740 --> 1:29:30.740
 Okay.

1:29:30.740 --> 1:29:31.740
 Let us return.

1:29:31.740 --> 1:29:32.740
 Okay.

1:29:32.740 --> 1:29:33.740
 And then we can return to the self.

1:29:33.740 --> 1:29:34.740
 Okay.

1:29:34.740 --> 1:29:38.700
 So you said you have all these propositions and et cetera, et cetera, and they differ

1:29:38.700 --> 1:29:45.060
 from the religions and they don't seem to be considered legitimate by many people.

1:29:45.060 --> 1:29:51.340
 But yet there's something functioning in the religions that is transforming people and

1:29:51.340 --> 1:29:52.580
 making them wiser.

1:29:52.580 --> 1:29:57.980
 And I put it to you that the transformations are largely occurring at those nonpropositional

1:29:57.980 --> 1:29:59.540
 levels.

1:29:59.540 --> 1:30:04.060
 The procedural, the perspectival, and the participatory.

1:30:04.060 --> 1:30:08.540
 And those are the ones, by the way, that are more fundamentally connected to meaning making

1:30:08.540 --> 1:30:14.820
 because remember the propositions are representational and they're dependent on the nonpropositional,

1:30:14.820 --> 1:30:18.660
 nonrepresentational processes of connectedness and relevance realization.

1:30:18.660 --> 1:30:22.460
 So religion goes down deep to the nonpropositional and works there.

1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:24.380
 That's the functionality we need to grasp.

1:30:24.380 --> 1:30:30.140
 Well, you talk about tools, essentially, that humans are able to incorporate into their

1:30:30.140 --> 1:30:31.140
 cognition.

1:30:31.140 --> 1:30:36.940
 Psychotechnologies, like language is one, I suppose.

1:30:36.940 --> 1:30:39.820
 Isn't religion then a psychotechnology?

1:30:39.820 --> 1:30:43.580
 It would be, yeah, an ecology of psychotechnologies, yes.

1:30:43.580 --> 1:30:49.580
 And the question is that Nietzsche ruined everything by saying God is dead.

1:30:49.580 --> 1:30:52.300
 Do we have to invent the new thing?

1:30:52.300 --> 1:30:57.500
 Go from the old phone, create the iPhone, invent the new psychotechnology that takes

1:30:57.500 --> 1:30:59.020
 place of religion.

1:30:59.020 --> 1:31:03.900
 And so when the madman in Nietzsche's text goes into the marketplace, who's he talking

1:31:03.900 --> 1:31:04.900
 to?

1:31:04.900 --> 1:31:06.580
 He's not talking to the believers.

1:31:06.580 --> 1:31:11.700
 He's talking to the atheists and he says, do you not realize what we have done?

1:31:11.700 --> 1:31:14.980
 We have taken a sponge and wiped away the sky.

1:31:14.980 --> 1:31:16.420
 We are now forever falling.

1:31:16.420 --> 1:31:18.120
 We are unchained from the sun.

1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:20.980
 We have to become worthy of this.

1:31:20.980 --> 1:31:23.740
 But Nietzsche is full of romantic bullshit, as we know.

1:31:23.740 --> 1:31:24.740
 No, no, no.

1:31:24.740 --> 1:31:25.740
 No, but there's a point there.

1:31:25.740 --> 1:31:26.740
 Yes.

1:31:26.740 --> 1:31:31.500
 The point is, right, there's one thing to rejecting the proposition.

1:31:31.500 --> 1:31:37.900
 There's another project of replacing the functionality that we lost when we reject the religion.

1:31:37.900 --> 1:31:47.420
 So his worry that as nihilism takes hold, you don't ever replace the thing that religion,

1:31:47.420 --> 1:31:49.580
 the role that religion played in our world.

1:31:49.580 --> 1:31:54.820
 It's hard to tell what he actually, because he's so multivocal.

1:31:54.820 --> 1:31:57.260
 I'll speak for me rather than for Nietzsche.

1:31:57.260 --> 1:32:04.140
 I think it is possible to, using the best cognitive science and respectfully exacting

1:32:04.140 --> 1:32:11.020
 what we can from the best religion and philosophical traditions, because there's things like stoicism

1:32:11.020 --> 1:32:16.480
 that are in the grey line between philosophy and religion, Buddhism is the same.

1:32:16.480 --> 1:32:24.300
 Using that best cocci, that best exaptation, we can come up with that functionality without

1:32:24.300 --> 1:32:30.740
 having to buy into the particular propositional sets of the legacy religions.

1:32:30.740 --> 1:32:31.740
 That's my proposal.

1:32:31.740 --> 1:32:34.140
 I call that the religion that's not a religion.

1:32:34.140 --> 1:32:39.780
 So things like stoicism or modern stoicism, those things, don't you think in some sense

1:32:39.780 --> 1:32:43.500
 they naturally emerge?

1:32:43.500 --> 1:32:46.460
 Don't you think there's a longing for meaning?

1:32:46.460 --> 1:32:52.540
 So stoicism arises during the Hellenistic period when there was a significant meaning

1:32:52.540 --> 1:32:59.100
 crisis in the ancient world because of what had happened after the breakup of Alexander

1:32:59.100 --> 1:33:00.540
 the Great's empire.

1:33:00.540 --> 1:33:06.820
 So if you compare Aristotle to people who are living after Alexander.

1:33:06.820 --> 1:33:13.140
 So Aristotle grows up in a place where everybody speaks the same language, has the same religion,

1:33:13.140 --> 1:33:16.820
 his ancestors have been there for years, he knows everybody.

1:33:16.820 --> 1:33:22.180
 After Alexander the Great's empire is broken up, people are now thousands of miles away

1:33:22.180 --> 1:33:29.180
 from the government, they're surrounded by people because of the diasporas, they're surrounded

1:33:29.180 --> 1:33:32.660
 by people that don't speak their language, don't share their religion, that's why you

1:33:32.660 --> 1:33:38.100
 get all these mother religions emerging, universal mother religions like ISIS, etc.

1:33:38.100 --> 1:33:43.100
 So there is what's called domicile, there's the killing of home, there's a loss of a

1:33:43.100 --> 1:33:49.740
 sense of home and belonging and fittedness during the Hellenistic period and stoicism

1:33:49.740 --> 1:33:52.660
 arose specifically to address that.

1:33:52.660 --> 1:33:58.060
 And because it was designed to address a meaning crisis, it is no coincidence that it is coming

1:33:58.060 --> 1:34:00.780
 back into prominence right now.

1:34:00.780 --> 1:34:06.900
 Well there could be a lot of other variations and it feels like, I think when you speak

1:34:06.900 --> 1:34:13.780
 of the meaning crisis, you're in part describing, not prescribing, you're describing something

1:34:13.780 --> 1:34:14.780
 that is happening.

1:34:14.780 --> 1:34:23.500
 But I would venture to say that if we just leave things be, the meaning crisis dissipates

1:34:23.500 --> 1:34:30.500
 because we long to create institutions, to create collective ideas, so this distributed

1:34:30.500 --> 1:34:33.900
 cognition process that give us meaning.

1:34:33.900 --> 1:34:40.700
 So if religion loses power, we'll find other institutions that are sources of meaning.

1:34:40.700 --> 1:34:41.700
 I don't...

1:34:41.700 --> 1:34:44.300
 Is that your intuition as well?

1:34:44.300 --> 1:34:48.100
 I think we are already doing that.

1:34:48.100 --> 1:34:55.340
 I am involved with and do participant observation of many of these emerging communities that

1:34:55.340 --> 1:35:00.660
 are creating a colleges of practice that are specifically about trying to address the meaning

1:35:00.660 --> 1:35:01.660
 crisis.

1:35:01.660 --> 1:35:07.180
 I just, in late July, went to Washington State and did Rafe Kelly's Evolve Move Play, Return

1:35:07.180 --> 1:35:12.540
 to the Source, and wow, one of the most challenging things I've ever done.

1:35:12.540 --> 1:35:13.540
 That guy is awesome, by the way.

1:35:13.540 --> 1:35:17.220
 I got to interact with him a long, long time ago.

1:35:17.220 --> 1:35:18.780
 He said to say hi to you, by the way.

1:35:18.780 --> 1:35:19.780
 Yeah.

1:35:19.780 --> 1:35:20.780
 It's from another world.

1:35:20.780 --> 1:35:26.820
 It feels like a different world because I interacted with him, not directly, but...

1:35:26.820 --> 1:35:27.820
 This is somebody...

1:35:27.820 --> 1:35:34.540
 He can speak to what he works on, but he makes movement and play...

1:35:34.540 --> 1:35:39.260
 He encourages people to make that a part of their life, like how you move about the world,

1:35:39.260 --> 1:35:44.820
 whether that's as part of sort of athletic endeavors or actual just like walking around

1:35:44.820 --> 1:35:47.060
 a city.

1:35:47.060 --> 1:35:52.060
 And I think the reason I ran into him is because there was a lot of interest in that in the

1:35:52.060 --> 1:35:56.780
 athletic world, in the grappling world, in the Brazilian jiu jitsu world, people who

1:35:56.780 --> 1:36:01.380
 study movement, who make movement part of their lives to see how can we integrate play

1:36:01.380 --> 1:36:08.800
 and fun and just the basic humanness that's natural to our movement.

1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:11.540
 How do we integrate that into our daily practice?

1:36:11.540 --> 1:36:14.980
 So this is yet another way to find meaning.

1:36:14.980 --> 1:36:19.420
 I think it's actually an exemplar of what I was talking about because what's going on

1:36:19.420 --> 1:36:28.420
 with Raif's integration of parkour in nature and martial arts and mindfulness practices

1:36:28.420 --> 1:36:35.740
 and dialogical practices is exactly, and explicitly so by the way, he will tell you he's been

1:36:35.740 --> 1:36:37.620
 very influenced by my work.

1:36:37.620 --> 1:36:43.180
 He's trying to get at the nonpropositional kinds of knowing that make meaning by evolving

1:36:43.180 --> 1:36:48.540
 our sensory motor loop and enhancing our relevance realization because that gives people profound

1:36:48.540 --> 1:36:53.380
 improved sense of connectedness to themselves, to each other and the world.

1:36:53.380 --> 1:37:00.060
 And I'll tell you, Lex, I don't want to say too specifically the final thing that people

1:37:00.060 --> 1:37:03.780
 did because it's part of his secret sauce, right?

1:37:03.780 --> 1:37:08.460
 But what I can say is when it was done, I said to them all, I said, as far as I can

1:37:08.460 --> 1:37:10.620
 tell, none of you are religious, right?

1:37:10.620 --> 1:37:15.620
 And they go, yeah, yeah, and I said, but what you just did was a religious act, wasn't it?

1:37:15.620 --> 1:37:18.140
 And they all went, yeah, it was.

1:37:18.140 --> 1:37:19.140
 Yeah.

1:37:19.140 --> 1:37:21.420
 So that same magic was there.

1:37:21.420 --> 1:37:22.420
 Yes.

1:37:22.420 --> 1:37:23.980
 Bathroom break.

1:37:23.980 --> 1:37:24.980
 Sure.

1:37:24.980 --> 1:37:30.380
 What's your take on atheism in general?

1:37:30.380 --> 1:37:38.220
 Is it closer to truth than, maybe is an atheist closer to truth than a person who believes

1:37:38.220 --> 1:37:40.020
 in God?

1:37:40.020 --> 1:37:45.460
 So I'm a nontheist, which means I think the shared set of presuppositions between the

1:37:45.460 --> 1:37:49.700
 theist and the atheist are actually what needs to be rejected.

1:37:49.700 --> 1:37:53.540
 Can you explain that further?

1:37:53.540 --> 1:37:56.220
 Yes, I can.

1:37:56.220 --> 1:38:03.860
 And I want to point out, by the way, that there are lots of nontheistic religious traditions.

1:38:03.860 --> 1:38:07.740
 So I'm not coming up with a sort of airy fairy category.

1:38:07.740 --> 1:38:08.740
 Yeah.

1:38:08.740 --> 1:38:14.020
 And what's the difference in nontheism, agnosticism and atheism?

1:38:14.020 --> 1:38:21.760
 So nontheists think that the theist and the atheist share a bunch of presuppositions.

1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:31.020
 For example, it's that sacredness is to be understood in terms of a personal being that

1:38:31.020 --> 1:38:36.140
 is, in some sense, the supreme being, and that the right relationship to that being

1:38:36.140 --> 1:38:39.500
 is to have a correct set of beliefs.

1:38:39.500 --> 1:38:41.660
 I reject all of those claims.

1:38:41.660 --> 1:38:44.420
 So both the theist and the atheist see God.

1:38:44.420 --> 1:38:46.960
 In their modern version, yes, yes.

1:38:46.960 --> 1:38:53.360
 In which, do you reject it in the sense that you don't know, or do you reject it in a sense

1:38:53.360 --> 1:39:02.940
 that you believe that each one of those presuppositions is likely to be not true?

1:39:02.940 --> 1:39:04.480
 The latter.

1:39:04.480 --> 1:39:12.020
 Both on reflection, argument, and personal experimentation and experience, I've come

1:39:12.020 --> 1:39:16.460
 to the conclusion that those shared propositions are probably not true.

1:39:16.460 --> 1:39:20.020
 Which one is the most troublesome to you?

1:39:20.020 --> 1:39:25.800
 The personal being, the kind of accumulation of everything into one being that ultimately

1:39:25.800 --> 1:39:27.840
 created stuff?

1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:29.780
 So for me, there's two, and they're interlocked together.

1:39:29.780 --> 1:39:31.660
 I'm not trying to dodge your question.

1:39:31.660 --> 1:39:39.900
 It's that the idea that the ground of being is some kind of being, I think, is a fundamental

1:39:39.900 --> 1:39:40.900
 mistake.

1:39:40.900 --> 1:39:41.900
 It's void of being?

1:39:41.900 --> 1:39:45.020
 No, no, no.

1:39:45.020 --> 1:39:48.620
 The ground of being is some kind of being, so it's turtles all the way down.

1:39:48.620 --> 1:39:50.940
 The ground of being is not itself any kind of being.

1:39:50.940 --> 1:39:53.340
 Being is not a being.

1:39:53.340 --> 1:40:00.220
 It is the ability for things to be, which is not the same thing as a being.

1:40:00.220 --> 1:40:02.060
 Are humans beings?

1:40:02.060 --> 1:40:03.060
 We are beings.

1:40:03.060 --> 1:40:04.060
 This glass is a being.

1:40:04.060 --> 1:40:05.820
 This table is a being.

1:40:05.820 --> 1:40:13.120
 But when I ask you, how are they all in being, you don't say, by being a glass or by being

1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:15.620
 a table or by being a human.

1:40:15.620 --> 1:40:20.120
 You want to say, no, no, there's something underneath it all, and then you realize it

1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:21.900
 can't be any thing.

1:40:21.900 --> 1:40:28.020
 This is why many mystical traditions converge on the idea that the ground of being is no

1:40:28.020 --> 1:40:32.700
 thingness, which is normally pronounced as nothingness.

1:40:32.700 --> 1:40:40.220
 But if you put the hyphen back in, you get the original intent, no thingness.

1:40:40.220 --> 1:40:46.620
 That is bound up with, okay, what I need to do in order to be in relationship with … So,

1:40:46.620 --> 1:40:52.100
 it's a misconstruing of ultimate reality as a supreme being, which is a category mistake

1:40:52.100 --> 1:40:58.620
 to my mind, and then my relationship to it, that sacredness is a function of belief.

1:40:58.620 --> 1:41:02.860
 And I have been presenting you an argument through most of our discussion that meaning

1:41:02.860 --> 1:41:07.860
 is at a deeper level than beliefs and propositions.

1:41:07.860 --> 1:41:12.980
 And so, that is a misunderstanding of sacredness, because I take sacredness to be that which

1:41:12.980 --> 1:41:18.260
 is most meaningful and connected to what is most real.

1:41:18.260 --> 1:41:23.060
 And theists think of sacredness as what?

1:41:23.060 --> 1:41:33.340
 They think of sacredness as a property of a particular being, God, and that the way

1:41:33.340 --> 1:41:39.820
 that is meaningful to them is by asserting a set of propositions or beliefs.

1:41:39.820 --> 1:41:45.780
 Now, I want to point out that this is what I would now call modern or common theism.

1:41:45.780 --> 1:41:51.980
 You go back into the classical periods of Christianity, you get a view that's really

1:41:51.980 --> 1:41:55.140
 radically different from how most people understand theism today.

1:41:55.140 --> 1:42:00.500
 Okay, so let me … This is an interesting question that I usually think about in the

1:42:00.500 --> 1:42:09.380
 form of mathematics, but … So, in that case, if meaning is sacred in your nontheist view,

1:42:09.380 --> 1:42:14.260
 is meaning created or is it discovered?

1:42:14.260 --> 1:42:20.980
 There's a Latin word that doesn't separate them called inventio, and I would say that,

1:42:20.980 --> 1:42:27.340
 and before you say, oh, well, give me a chance, because you participate in it.

1:42:27.340 --> 1:42:29.740
 You've experienced an insight, yes?

1:42:29.740 --> 1:42:32.940
 Did you make it happen?

1:42:32.940 --> 1:42:35.060
 The insight …

1:42:35.060 --> 1:42:38.900
 Did you make it happen or did … Did you do … Like, can you do that?

1:42:38.900 --> 1:42:39.900
 I'm going to have … I need an insight.

1:42:39.900 --> 1:42:41.940
 This is what I do to make an insight.

1:42:41.940 --> 1:42:42.940
 Oh, I see.

1:42:42.940 --> 1:42:45.900
 Yeah, in some sense, it came from elsewhere.

1:42:45.900 --> 1:42:48.980
 Right, but you didn't just passively receive it, either.

1:42:48.980 --> 1:42:51.100
 You're engaged and involved in it.

1:42:51.100 --> 1:42:52.360
 That's why you get … Right?

1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:54.580
 So that's what I mean by you participate in it.

1:42:54.580 --> 1:42:56.020
 You participate in meaning.

1:42:56.020 --> 1:42:58.100
 So you do think that it's both?

1:42:58.100 --> 1:42:59.100
 Yes.

1:42:59.100 --> 1:43:00.100
 You do think it's both?

1:43:00.100 --> 1:43:08.580
 I mean, that's not a trivial thing to understand, because a lot of time we think … When you

1:43:08.580 --> 1:43:15.500
 think about a search for meaning, you think … It's like you're going through a big

1:43:15.500 --> 1:43:20.260
 house and you open each door and look if it's there and so on, as if there is going to be

1:43:20.260 --> 1:43:31.780
 a glowing orb that you discover, but at the same time, I'm somebody that, based on the

1:43:31.780 --> 1:43:36.500
 chemistry of my brain, have been extremely fortunate to be able to discover beauty in

1:43:36.500 --> 1:43:40.500
 everything, in the most mundane and boring of things.

1:43:40.500 --> 1:43:46.500
 I am, as David Foster Wallace said, unboreable.

1:43:46.500 --> 1:43:52.860
 I could just sit in a room, just like playing with a tennis ball or something and be excited,

1:43:52.860 --> 1:43:56.660
 basically like a dog, I think, endlessly.

1:43:56.660 --> 1:44:06.380
 So to me, meaning is created, because I could create meaning out of everything, but of course,

1:44:06.380 --> 1:44:08.560
 it doesn't require a partner.

1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:13.900
 It does require dance partners, whatever, it does require the tennis ball.

1:44:13.900 --> 1:44:18.100
 But honestly, that's what a lot of people that I don't necessarily … We'll talk

1:44:18.100 --> 1:44:19.100
 about it.

1:44:19.100 --> 1:44:24.820
 I don't practice meditation, but people who meditate very seriously, like the entire

1:44:24.820 --> 1:44:32.980
 days for months kind of thing, they talk about being able to discover meaning in just the

1:44:32.980 --> 1:44:38.980
 wind or something, like they just … The breath and everything, just subtle sensory

1:44:38.980 --> 1:44:45.320
 experiences give you deep fulfillment.

1:44:45.320 --> 1:44:47.060
 So that's, again, it's interaction.

1:44:47.060 --> 1:44:54.900
 Actually, I do want to say, because the interesting difference that you've drawn between nontheism,

1:44:54.900 --> 1:45:01.420
 theism and atheism, where's the agreement or disagreement between you and Jordan Peterson

1:45:01.420 --> 1:45:02.420
 on this?

1:45:02.420 --> 1:45:08.580
 I want to say to Jordan about this, because you're very clear, it's kind of beautiful

1:45:08.580 --> 1:45:11.500
 in the clarity in which you lay this out.

1:45:11.500 --> 1:45:15.920
 I wonder if Jordan has arrived at a similar kind of clarity.

1:45:15.920 --> 1:45:21.980
 Have you been able to draw any kind of lines between the way the two of you see religion?

1:45:21.980 --> 1:45:22.980
 Yeah.

1:45:22.980 --> 1:45:28.620
 So there was a video released, I think, like two or three weeks ago with Jordan and myself

1:45:28.620 --> 1:45:29.620
 and Jonathan Paget.

1:45:29.620 --> 1:45:31.020
 Oh, I haven't watched that one yet, yeah.

1:45:31.020 --> 1:45:33.220
 And it's around this question, Lux.

1:45:33.220 --> 1:45:39.380
 He's basically sort of making, he's putting together an argument for God.

1:45:39.380 --> 1:45:40.660
 I mean, I think that's a fair way.

1:45:40.660 --> 1:45:44.500
 I don't think he would object to me saying that.

1:45:44.500 --> 1:45:50.900
 And Jonathan Paget is also a, well, Jonathan is a Christian, it's unclear what Jordan

1:45:50.900 --> 1:45:52.620
 is.

1:45:52.620 --> 1:45:56.940
 And Jonathan's work is on symbolism and different mythologies and Christianity.

1:45:56.940 --> 1:46:01.820
 Yes, especially Neoplatonic Christianity, which is very important.

1:46:01.820 --> 1:46:04.500
 I have a lot of respect, well, I have a lot of respect for both of them, but I have a

1:46:04.500 --> 1:46:05.980
 lot of respect for Jonathan.

1:46:05.980 --> 1:46:15.180
 But in my participation in that dialogue, you could see me, well, repeatedly, but I

1:46:15.180 --> 1:46:19.940
 think everybody, including Jordan, thought constructively challenging sort of the attempt

1:46:19.940 --> 1:46:24.000
 to build a theistic model, and I was challenging it from a nontheistic perspective.

1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:32.460
 So I think we don't agree on certain sets of propositions.

1:46:32.460 --> 1:46:38.460
 But there was a lot of, there was also a lot of acknowledgement, and I think genuine appreciation

1:46:38.460 --> 1:46:43.060
 on his part and Jonathan's part of the arguments I was making.

1:46:43.060 --> 1:46:48.980
 So they believe in maybe the presupposition of like a supreme being.

1:46:48.980 --> 1:46:57.420
 Not believe, but they see the power of that particular presupposition in being a source

1:46:57.420 --> 1:46:58.420
 of meaning.

1:46:58.420 --> 1:47:01.380
 I think that's relatively clear for me with Jordan.

1:47:01.380 --> 1:47:04.740
 Jordan's a really complex guy, so it's very hard to just like pin.

1:47:04.740 --> 1:47:12.080
 To my best sort of understanding, yes, I think that's clearly the case for Jordan.

1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:14.480
 It's not the case for Jonathan.

1:47:14.480 --> 1:47:18.840
 Jonathan is, remember I said I was talking about modern atheism and theism?

1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:26.940
 Jonathan is a guy who somehow went into icon carving and Maximus the Confessor and Eastern

1:47:26.940 --> 1:47:31.700
 Orthodoxy and has come out of it at the other end as a fifth century church father that

1:47:31.700 --> 1:47:38.220
 is nevertheless being, rightfully so, found to be increasingly relevant to many people.

1:47:38.220 --> 1:47:40.260
 So he's deeply old school.

1:47:40.260 --> 1:47:47.020
 Yeah, I think he has, he and I, especially because Neoplatonism is a nontheistic philosophical

1:47:47.020 --> 1:47:52.580
 spirituality and it's a big part of Eastern Orthodoxy, he and I, I think, he would say

1:47:52.580 --> 1:47:54.740
 things like, God doesn't exist.

1:47:54.740 --> 1:47:55.740
 What?

1:47:55.740 --> 1:47:57.380
 You're a Christian, right?

1:47:57.380 --> 1:48:02.340
 And then he's being coy, but he'll say, well, God doesn't exist the way the cup exists or

1:48:02.340 --> 1:48:06.300
 the table exists, the same kind of move I was making a few minutes ago.

1:48:06.300 --> 1:48:08.180
 He'll say things like that.

1:48:08.180 --> 1:48:15.500
 He will emphasize the no thingness of ultimate reality, the no thingness of God, because

1:48:15.500 --> 1:48:22.100
 he's from that version of Christianity, what you might call classical theism, but classical

1:48:22.100 --> 1:48:27.140
 theism looks a lot more like nontheism than it looks like modern theism.

1:48:27.140 --> 1:48:29.140
 That's so interesting.

1:48:29.140 --> 1:48:31.060
 Yeah, that's really interesting.

1:48:31.060 --> 1:48:38.700
 What about, is there a line to be drawn between myth and religion in terms of its usefulness

1:48:38.700 --> 1:48:42.060
 in man's search for meaning?

1:48:42.060 --> 1:48:46.460
 So here's where Jordan and I are in much more, actually all three of us are in significant

1:48:46.460 --> 1:48:47.460
 agreement.

1:48:47.460 --> 1:48:52.100
 I said this in my series, but I want to say it again here.

1:48:52.100 --> 1:48:58.460
 Myths aren't stories about things that happened in the deep past that are largely irrelevant.

1:48:58.460 --> 1:49:05.620
 Myths are stories about perennial or pertinent patterns that need to be brought into awareness.

1:49:05.620 --> 1:49:11.180
 And they need to be brought into an awareness, not just or primarily at the propositional

1:49:11.180 --> 1:49:14.020
 level, but at those nonpropositional levels.

1:49:14.020 --> 1:49:17.300
 And I think that is what good mythos does.

1:49:17.300 --> 1:49:21.580
 I prefer to use the Greek word because we've now turned the English word into a synonym

1:49:21.580 --> 1:49:25.620
 for a widely believed falsehood.

1:49:25.620 --> 1:49:31.140
 And I don't think, again, if you go back even to the church fathers, I'm not a Christian,

1:49:31.140 --> 1:49:36.740
 I'm not advocating for Christianity, but neither am I here to attack it.

1:49:36.740 --> 1:49:44.340
 But when they talk about reading these stories, they think the literal interpretation is the

1:49:44.340 --> 1:49:47.140
 weakest and the least important.

1:49:47.140 --> 1:49:54.100
 You move to the allegorical or the symbolic, to the moral, to the spiritual, the mystical,

1:49:54.100 --> 1:49:56.340
 and that's where...

1:49:56.340 --> 1:50:05.220
 So they would say to you, but how is the story of Adam and Eve true for you now?

1:50:05.220 --> 1:50:10.000
 And I don't mean true for you in that relativistic sense, I mean, how is it pointing to a pattern

1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.160
 in your life right now?

1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:19.740
 So there is some sense in which the telling of this mythos becomes real in connecting

1:50:19.740 --> 1:50:23.940
 to the patterns that kind of captivate the public today.

1:50:23.940 --> 1:50:24.940
 Sure.

1:50:24.940 --> 1:50:26.420
 So you just keep telling the story.

1:50:26.420 --> 1:50:31.020
 I mean, there's something about some of these stories that are just really good at being

1:50:31.020 --> 1:50:34.860
 sticky to the patterns of each generation.

1:50:34.860 --> 1:50:35.860
 Yes.

1:50:35.860 --> 1:50:41.420
 And they'll stick to different patterns throughout time, they're just sticky in powerful ways.

1:50:41.420 --> 1:50:42.420
 Yes.

1:50:42.420 --> 1:50:46.900
 And so we keep returning back to them again and again and again.

1:50:46.900 --> 1:50:56.940
 And it's important to see that some of these stories are recursive, they're myths about

1:50:56.940 --> 1:51:04.540
 one particular set of patterns, they're myths about not just the important pattern.

1:51:04.540 --> 1:51:13.340
 You get the Jordan stuff about there's heroes and myths are trying to make us understand

1:51:13.340 --> 1:51:16.860
 the need for being heroic in our own lives.

1:51:16.860 --> 1:51:22.100
 One of the things I like to put in counterbalance to that is the Greek also have myths of hubris,

1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:25.560
 that counterbalance the heroic.

1:51:25.560 --> 1:51:34.080
 But then there are myths that are not about those deeply important patterns, but they're

1:51:34.080 --> 1:51:41.460
 myths about religio itself, that the way we're—religio means to bind, to connect, the way relevance

1:51:41.460 --> 1:51:43.260
 realization connects us.

1:51:43.260 --> 1:51:46.680
 And so the point of the myth is not notice that pattern or notice that pattern or notice

1:51:46.680 --> 1:51:55.260
 that pattern, it's notice how all of these patterns are emerging and what does that say

1:51:55.260 --> 1:51:57.460
 about us and reality.

1:51:57.460 --> 1:52:04.580
 And those myths, those myths, I think, are genuinely profound.

1:52:04.580 --> 1:52:11.160
 And how much of the myths, how much of the power of those myths is about the dialogues?

1:52:11.160 --> 1:52:15.700
 You talk about this quite a bit, I think in the first conversation with Jordan, you guys,

1:52:15.700 --> 1:52:20.220
 I'm not sure you've gotten really into it, you scratched the surface a little bit.

1:52:20.220 --> 1:52:25.160
 But the role of, as you say, dialogue in distributed cognition.

1:52:25.160 --> 1:52:26.160
 What is that?

1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:31.500
 The thing we're doing right now, talking with our mouth holes, what is that?

1:52:31.500 --> 1:52:34.820
 And actually, can I ask you this question?

1:52:34.820 --> 1:52:43.100
 If aliens came to Earth and were observing humans, would they notice our distributed

1:52:43.100 --> 1:52:47.600
 cognition first or our individual cognition first?

1:52:47.600 --> 1:52:50.940
 What is the most notable thing about us humans?

1:52:50.940 --> 1:52:55.860
 Is it our ability to individually do well on IQ tests or whatever?

1:52:55.860 --> 1:52:59.660
 Or puzzle solve, or is it this thing we're doing together?

1:52:59.660 --> 1:53:05.780
 I think most of our problem solving is done in distributed cognition.

1:53:05.780 --> 1:53:09.180
 Look around, you didn't make this equipment, you didn't build this place, you didn't invent

1:53:09.180 --> 1:53:12.980
 this language that we're both sharing, et cetera, et cetera.

1:53:12.980 --> 1:53:19.320
 And now there's more specific and precise experimental evidence coming out.

1:53:19.320 --> 1:53:25.180
 Let's take a standard task that people, reasoning task, I won't need to do the details, it's

1:53:25.180 --> 1:53:27.740
 called the waste and selection task.

1:53:27.740 --> 1:53:33.140
 And you give it to people, highly educated psychology students, premier universities

1:53:33.140 --> 1:53:38.980
 across the world, we've been doing it since the 60s, it replicates and replicates, and

1:53:38.980 --> 1:53:43.480
 only 10% of the people get it right.

1:53:43.480 --> 1:53:49.000
 You put them in a group of four, and you allow them to talk to each other, the success rate

1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:51.060
 goes to 80%.

1:53:51.060 --> 1:53:55.980
 That's just one example of a phenomenon that's coming to the fore.

1:53:55.980 --> 1:53:59.720
 By the way, do you know if a similar experiment has been done on a group of engineering students

1:53:59.720 --> 1:54:01.220
 versus psychology students?

1:54:01.220 --> 1:54:04.700
 Is there a major group differences in IQ between those two?

1:54:04.700 --> 1:54:07.240
 Just kidding.

1:54:07.240 --> 1:54:08.240
 Let's move on.

1:54:08.240 --> 1:54:12.860
 All right, so there is a lot of evidence that there's power to this distributed cognition.

1:54:12.860 --> 1:54:17.700
 Now what about this mechanism, this fascinating mechanism of the ants interacting with each

1:54:17.700 --> 1:54:18.700
 other?

1:54:18.700 --> 1:54:19.700
 The dialogue.

1:54:19.700 --> 1:54:25.460
 I use the word discourse or dialogue for just people having a conversation, and this is

1:54:25.460 --> 1:54:33.620
 deeply inspired by Socrates and Plato, especially the Platonic dialogues.

1:54:33.620 --> 1:54:36.940
 And I'm sure we've all had this, and so give me a moment because I want to build onto something

1:54:36.940 --> 1:54:37.940
 here.

1:54:37.940 --> 1:54:43.860
 We've participated in conversations that took on a life of their own and took us both in

1:54:43.860 --> 1:54:48.320
 directions we did not anticipate, afforded us insights that we could not have had on

1:54:48.320 --> 1:54:49.320
 our own.

1:54:49.320 --> 1:54:53.980
 And we don't have to have come to an agreement, but we were both moved and we were both drawn

1:54:53.980 --> 1:54:59.160
 into insight, and we feel like, wow, that was one of the best moments of my life because

1:54:59.160 --> 1:55:07.840
 we feel how that introduced us to a capacity for tapping into a flow state within distributed

1:55:07.840 --> 1:55:15.320
 cognition that puts us into a deeper relationship with ourselves, with another person, and potentially

1:55:15.320 --> 1:55:17.200
 with the world.

1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:19.220
 That's what I mean by dialogos.

1:55:19.220 --> 1:55:30.180
 And so for me, I think dialogos is more important... Boy, I could just... I'm sorry, I can

1:55:30.180 --> 1:55:33.300
 hear Jordan and Jonathan in my head right now, but I think it's more...

1:55:33.300 --> 1:55:35.260
 I hear them all the time.

1:55:35.260 --> 1:55:39.960
 I just wish they would shut up in my head sometimes.

1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:42.040
 So what are they saying to you in your head?

1:55:42.040 --> 1:55:45.960
 What they're saying... Well, see, that's what the most recent conversation was about.

1:55:45.960 --> 1:55:55.600
 I was trying to say that I don't think mythos is... I think mythos is really important.

1:55:55.600 --> 1:56:01.280
 I think these kinds of narratives are really important, but I think this ability to connect

1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:09.880
 together in distributed cognition, collective intelligence, and cultivate a shared flow

1:56:09.880 --> 1:56:14.680
 state within that collective intelligence so it starts to ramp up perhaps towards collective

1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:15.680
 wisdom.

1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:21.400
 I think that's more important because I think that's the basin within which the myths and

1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:25.840
 the rituals are ultimately created and when they function.

1:56:25.840 --> 1:56:28.200
 A myth is like a public dream.

1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:33.160
 It depends on distributed cognition, and it depends on people enacting it and getting

1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:36.160
 into mutual flow states.

1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:44.400
 So the highest form of dialogos of conversation is this flow state, and that it forms the

1:56:44.400 --> 1:56:46.640
 foundation for myth building.

1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:47.800
 I think so.

1:56:47.800 --> 1:56:48.800
 I think so.

1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:53.500
 So that communitas, that's Victor Turner's phrase, and he specifically linked it to flow,

1:56:53.500 --> 1:57:01.920
 and I study flow scientifically, that within distributed cognition as the home, as the

1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:07.600
 generator of mythos and ritual, and those are bound together as well, I think that's

1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:08.600
 fundamentally correct.

1:57:08.600 --> 1:57:14.720
 You know what's the cool thing here, because I'm a huge fan of podcasts and audiobooks,

1:57:14.720 --> 1:57:19.280
 but podcasts in particular is relevant here, is there's a third person in this room listening

1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:23.680
 now, and they're also in the flow state.

1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:24.680
 Yes, yes.

1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:30.120
 Like I'm close friends with a lot of podcasts, they don't know I exist.

1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:34.600
 I just listen to them because I've been in so many flow states with them, and I was like,

1:57:34.600 --> 1:57:36.720
 yes, yes, this is good.

1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:40.360
 But they don't know I exist, but they are in conversation with me, ultimately.

1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:43.200
 And think of what that's doing.

1:57:43.200 --> 1:57:47.440
 You've got dialogues, and then you've got this meta dialogue like you're describing,

1:57:47.440 --> 1:57:54.440
 and think about how things like podcasts and YouTube, they break down old boundaries between

1:57:54.440 --> 1:57:58.240
 the private and the public, between writing and oral speech.

1:57:58.240 --> 1:58:05.160
 So we have the dynamics of living oral speech, but it has the permanency of writing.

1:58:05.160 --> 1:58:12.860
 We're in the midst of creating a vehicle and a medium for distributed cognition that breaks

1:58:12.860 --> 1:58:18.920
 down a lot of the categories by which we organized our cognition.

1:58:18.920 --> 1:58:24.340
 Because of the tools of YouTube and so on, just the network, the graph of how quickly

1:58:24.340 --> 1:58:28.080
 the distributed cognition can spread is really powerful.

1:58:28.080 --> 1:58:31.920
 Just a huge amount of people have listened to your lectures, I've listened to your lectures,

1:58:31.920 --> 1:58:38.280
 but I've experienced them, at least in your style, there's something about your style,

1:58:38.280 --> 1:58:40.840
 it felt like a conversation.

1:58:40.840 --> 1:58:46.360
 It felt like at any moment I could interrupt you and say something, and I was just listening.

1:58:46.360 --> 1:58:52.920
 Thank you for saying that, because I aspire to being genuinely as Socratic as I can when

1:58:52.920 --> 1:58:53.920
 I'm doing this.

1:58:53.920 --> 1:58:57.860
 Yeah, there was that sentence, actually, as I'm saying it now, why was that?

1:58:57.860 --> 1:59:03.600
 It didn't feel like sometimes lectures are kind of, you know, you come down with the

1:59:03.600 --> 1:59:07.760
 commandments and you just want to listen, but there was a sense like, I mean, I think

1:59:07.760 --> 1:59:10.960
 it was the excitement that you have, like, you have to understand, and also the fact

1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:16.800
 that you were kind of, I think, thinking off the top of your head sometimes, there was

1:59:16.800 --> 1:59:21.800
 a, you were interrupting yourself with thoughts, you were playing with thoughts, like you're

1:59:21.800 --> 1:59:27.820
 reasoning through things often, like you had, you referenced a lot of books, so surely

1:59:27.820 --> 1:59:32.120
 you were extremely well prepared and you were referencing a lot of ideas, but then you were

1:59:32.120 --> 1:59:34.200
 also struggling in the way to present those ideas.

1:59:34.200 --> 1:59:40.780
 Yes, there was, and so the jazz, like the jazz and getting into the flow state and trying

1:59:40.780 --> 1:59:47.320
 to share in a participatory and perspectival fashion the learning with the people rather

1:59:47.320 --> 1:59:50.560
 than just pronouncing at them, yes.

1:59:50.560 --> 1:59:52.900
 What's mindfulness?

1:59:52.900 --> 1:59:55.380
 So published on that as well.

1:59:55.380 --> 1:59:59.960
 And I practice, I've been practicing many forms of mindfulness and ecology of practices

1:59:59.960 --> 2:00:05.800
 since 1991, so I both have practitioner's knowledge and I also study it scientifically.

2:00:05.800 --> 2:00:12.060
 I think, I'm pretty sure I was the first person to academically talk about mindfulness at

2:00:12.060 --> 2:00:16.040
 the University of Toronto within a classroom setting, like lecturing on it.

2:00:16.040 --> 2:00:20.840
 So this is a topic that a lot of people have recently become very interested in, think

2:00:20.840 --> 2:00:27.360
 about, so from that, from the early days, how do you think about what it is?

2:00:27.360 --> 2:00:32.540
 I've critiqued the sort of standard definitions, being aware of the present moment without

2:00:32.540 --> 2:00:37.840
 judgment and because I think they're flawed, and if you want to get into the detail of

2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:43.740
 why we can, but this is how I want to explain it to you, and it also points to the fact

2:00:43.740 --> 2:00:46.680
 of why you need an ecology of mindfulness practices.

2:00:46.680 --> 2:00:49.320
 You shouldn't equate mindfulness with meditation.

2:00:49.320 --> 2:00:50.720
 I think that's a primary mistake.

2:00:50.720 --> 2:00:52.800
 When you say ecology, what do you mean, by the way?

2:00:52.800 --> 2:00:54.840
 So lots of many different variants?

2:00:54.840 --> 2:00:58.360
 No, so what I mean by ecology is exactly what you have in an ecology.

2:00:58.360 --> 2:01:02.800
 You have a dynamical system in which there are checks and balances on each other, right?

2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:07.080
 And I'll get to that with this about mindfulness, so I'll make that connection if you allow

2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:08.320
 me.

2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:11.440
 So we're always framing, we've been talking about that, right?

2:01:11.440 --> 2:01:16.880
 And for those of you who are not on YouTube, this podcast, I wear glasses and I'm now sort

2:01:16.880 --> 2:01:21.940
 of putting my fingers and thumb around the frames of my glasses.

2:01:21.940 --> 2:01:28.600
 So this is my frame, and my lens is, right, and that frame, the frame holds a lens, and

2:01:28.600 --> 2:01:33.720
 I'm seeing through it in both senses, beyond and by means of it.

2:01:33.720 --> 2:01:36.240
 So right now, my glasses are transparent to me.

2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:41.040
 I want to use that as a strong analogy for my mental framing, okay?

2:01:41.040 --> 2:01:45.820
 Now this is what you do in meditation, I would argue.

2:01:45.820 --> 2:01:49.840
 You step back from looking through your frame and you look at it, I'm taking my glasses

2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:51.660
 off right now and I'm looking at them.

2:01:51.660 --> 2:01:52.960
 Why might I do that?

2:01:52.960 --> 2:01:59.560
 To see if there's something in the lenses that is distorting, causing me to, right?

2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:06.600
 Now if I just did that, that could be helpful, but how do I know if I've actually corrected

2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:08.080
 the change I made to my lenses?

2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:09.720
 What do I need to do?

2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:15.400
 I need to put my glasses on and see if I can now see more clearly and deeply than I could

2:02:15.400 --> 2:02:17.300
 before.

2:02:17.300 --> 2:02:21.380
 Meditation is this, stepping back and looking at.

2:02:21.380 --> 2:02:25.940
 Contemplation is that looking through, and there are different kinds of practices.

2:02:25.940 --> 2:02:28.920
 The fact that we treat them as synonyms is a deep mistake.

2:02:28.920 --> 2:02:33.840
 The word contemplation has temple in it, in Latin contemplatio, means to look up to the

2:02:33.840 --> 2:02:34.840
 sky.

2:02:34.840 --> 2:02:39.220
 It's a translation of the Greek word theoria, which we get our word theory from.

2:02:39.220 --> 2:02:41.860
 It's to look deeply into things.

2:02:41.860 --> 2:02:47.080
 Meditation is more about having to do with reflecting upon, standing back and looking

2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:48.600
 at.

2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:50.580
 Mindfulness includes both.

2:02:50.580 --> 2:02:57.240
 It includes your ability to break away from an inappropriate frame and the ability to

2:02:57.240 --> 2:02:59.000
 make a new frame.

2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:00.840
 That's what actually happens in insight.

2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:08.060
 You have to both break an inappropriate frame and make, see, realize a new frame.

2:03:08.060 --> 2:03:10.280
 This is why mindfulness enhances insight.

2:03:10.280 --> 2:03:17.200
 Both ways, by the way, meditative practices and also contemplative practices.

2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:25.800
 So mindfulness is frame awareness that can be appropriated in order to improve your capacities

2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:28.440
 for insight and self regulation.

2:03:28.440 --> 2:03:36.400
 Now I am inexperienced with meditation, the rigorous practice and the science of meditation,

2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:44.200
 but I've talked to people who seriously as a science study psychedelics and they often

2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:49.880
 talk about the really important thing is the sort of the integration back.

2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:52.120
 So the contemplation step.

2:03:52.120 --> 2:03:57.000
 So if you, it's not just the actual things you see on psychedelics or the actual journey

2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:59.640
 of where your mind goes on psychedelics.

2:03:59.640 --> 2:04:05.600
 It's also the integrating that into the new perspective that you take on life.

2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:06.600
 Right.

2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:07.600
 Exactly.

2:04:07.600 --> 2:04:08.600
 You really nicely described.

2:04:08.600 --> 2:04:13.720
 So meditation is the, in that metaphors is the psychedelic journey to a different mind

2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:18.640
 state and then contemplation is the return back to reality, how you integrate that into

2:04:18.640 --> 2:04:22.840
 a new world view and mindfulness is the whole process.

2:04:22.840 --> 2:04:23.840
 Right.

2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:30.880
 So if you just did contemplation, you could suffer from inflation and projective fantasy.

2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:36.040
 If you just do meditation, you can suffer from withdrawal, spiritual bypassing, avoiding

2:04:36.040 --> 2:04:37.040
 reality.

2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:39.260
 They act, they need each other.

2:04:39.260 --> 2:04:40.840
 You have to cycle between them.

2:04:40.840 --> 2:04:45.240
 It's like what I talked about earlier, when I talked about the opponent processing within

2:04:45.240 --> 2:04:49.440
 the autonomic nervous system or the opponent processing at work and attention.

2:04:49.440 --> 2:04:52.680
 And that's what I mean by an ecology of practices.

2:04:52.680 --> 2:04:53.680
 You need both.

2:04:53.680 --> 2:04:55.480
 Neither one is a panacea.

2:04:55.480 --> 2:05:00.600
 You need them in this opponent processing, acting as checks and balance on each other.

2:05:00.600 --> 2:05:05.560
 Is there sort of practical advice you can give to people on how to meditate or how to

2:05:05.560 --> 2:05:09.560
 be mindful in this full way?

2:05:09.560 --> 2:05:10.560
 Yes.

2:05:10.560 --> 2:05:12.920
 I would tell them to do at least three things.

2:05:12.920 --> 2:05:16.960
 And I was, I lucked into this.

2:05:16.960 --> 2:05:21.800
 When I started meditation, I went down the street and there was a place that taught Vipassana

2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:26.880
 meditation, Metta contemplation and Tai Chi Chuan for flow induction.

2:05:26.880 --> 2:05:32.760
 And you should get, you should have a meditative practice, you should find a contemplative

2:05:32.760 --> 2:05:37.520
 practice and you should find a moving mindfulness practice, especially one that is conducive

2:05:37.520 --> 2:05:42.080
 to the flow state and practice them in an integrated fashion.

2:05:42.080 --> 2:05:45.800
 Can you elaborate what those practices might look like?

2:05:45.800 --> 2:05:49.120
 So generally speaking.

2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:52.240
 Meditative practice like Vipassana.

2:05:52.240 --> 2:05:57.080
 So what's the primary thing I look through rather than look at?

2:05:57.080 --> 2:05:58.520
 It's my sensations.

2:05:58.520 --> 2:06:02.940
 So what I'm going to do is I'm going to focus on my sensations rather than focusing on the

2:06:02.940 --> 2:06:04.680
 world through my sensations.

2:06:04.680 --> 2:06:13.120
 So I'm going to follow, for example, the sensations in this area of my abdomen where my breathing

2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:14.120
 is.

2:06:14.120 --> 2:06:19.040
 So I can feel as my abdomen is expanding, I can feel those sensations and then I can

2:06:19.040 --> 2:06:21.000
 feel the sensations as it's contracting.

2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:27.760
 Now what will happen is my mind will leap back to try to look through and look at the

2:06:27.760 --> 2:06:28.760
 world again.

2:06:28.760 --> 2:06:29.760
 Right?

2:06:29.760 --> 2:06:32.680
 I'll start thinking about, I need to do my laundry or what was that noise?

2:06:32.680 --> 2:06:33.880
 And so what do I do?

2:06:33.880 --> 2:06:36.440
 I don't get involved with the content.

2:06:36.440 --> 2:06:43.920
 I step back and label the process with an ING word, listening, imagining, planning.

2:06:43.920 --> 2:06:48.600
 And then I return my attention to the breath and I have to return my attention in the correct

2:06:48.600 --> 2:06:49.600
 way.

2:06:49.600 --> 2:06:52.080
 So part of your mind that jumps around in the Buddhist tradition, this is called your

2:06:52.080 --> 2:06:53.080
 monkey mind.

2:06:53.080 --> 2:06:56.800
 It's like a monkey leaping for branches and chattering, right?

2:06:56.800 --> 2:07:01.800
 If I was trying to train that monkey mind to stay, or as Jack Kornfield said, train

2:07:01.800 --> 2:07:08.880
 a puppy dog, stay puppy dog, and if it goes and I get really angry and I bring it back

2:07:08.880 --> 2:07:13.600
 and I'm yelling at it, I'm going to train it to fight and fear me.

2:07:13.600 --> 2:07:18.920
 But if I just indulge it, if I just feed its whims, oh, look, the puppy dog went there.

2:07:18.920 --> 2:07:20.720
 Oh, now it's there.

2:07:20.720 --> 2:07:21.840
 Puppy dog never learns to stay.

2:07:21.840 --> 2:07:22.840
 What do I need to do?

2:07:22.840 --> 2:07:25.640
 I have to neither fight it nor feed it.

2:07:25.640 --> 2:07:27.080
 I have to have this centered attitude.

2:07:27.080 --> 2:07:29.120
 I have to befriend it.

2:07:29.120 --> 2:07:33.560
 So you step back and look at your sensations.

2:07:33.560 --> 2:07:37.240
 You step back and look at your distracting processes.

2:07:37.240 --> 2:07:40.720
 You return your attention to the breath and you do it with the right attitude.

2:07:40.720 --> 2:07:44.240
 That's the core of a good meditative practice.

2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:45.240
 Okay.

2:07:45.240 --> 2:07:47.680
 Then what's a good contemplative practice?

2:07:47.680 --> 2:07:56.440
 A good contemplative practice is to try and meta, it's actually apropos because we talked

2:07:56.440 --> 2:08:00.400
 about that participatory knowing the way you're situated in the world.

2:08:00.400 --> 2:08:06.200
 So this is a long thing because there's different interpretations of meta and I go for what's

2:08:06.200 --> 2:08:10.520
 called an existential interpretation over an emotional one.

2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:17.700
 So what I'm doing in meta is I'm trying to awaken in two ways.

2:08:17.700 --> 2:08:24.000
 I'm trying to awaken to the fact that I am constantly assuming an identity and assigning

2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:25.000
 an identity.

2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:27.720
 So I'm looking at that.

2:08:27.720 --> 2:08:33.360
 I'm trying to awaken to that and then I'm trying to awake from the modal confusion that

2:08:33.360 --> 2:08:35.720
 I could get into around that.

2:08:35.720 --> 2:08:44.680
 And so I'm looking out onto the world and I'm trying to see you in a fundamentally different

2:08:44.680 --> 2:08:48.400
 way than I have before.

2:08:48.400 --> 2:08:51.120
 You know, like you go to the gym and you do bicep curls.

2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:52.120
 Yeah.

2:08:52.120 --> 2:08:53.120
 Yes.

2:08:53.120 --> 2:08:54.120
 Yes.

2:08:54.120 --> 2:08:55.840
 Is it possible to reduce it to those things that, I mean, you don't need to speak to the

2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:00.760
 specifics, but is there actual practice you can do or is it really personal?

2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:03.200
 No, I teach people how to do the meta practice.

2:09:03.200 --> 2:09:07.560
 I also teach them how to do a Neoplatonic contemplative practice, how to do a Stoic.

2:09:07.560 --> 2:09:09.960
 Another one you can do is the view from above.

2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:11.280
 This is classic Stoicism.

2:09:11.280 --> 2:09:15.600
 I get you to imagine that you're in this room and then imagine that you're floating above

2:09:15.600 --> 2:09:22.000
 the room, then above Austin, then above Texas, then above the United States, then the earth.

2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:24.480
 And you have to really imagine it.

2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:25.960
 Don't just think it, but really imagine.

2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:32.240
 And then what you notice is as you're pulling out to a wider and wider like contemplation

2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:36.720
 of reality, your sense of self and what you find relevant and important also changes.

2:09:36.720 --> 2:09:40.080
 No, for all of these, there is a specific step by step methodology.

2:09:40.080 --> 2:09:45.200
 Oh, so you can, so like in that one, you could just literally imagine yourself floating farther

2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:46.200
 and farther out.

2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:51.540
 But you have to go through the steps because the stepping matters because if you just jump,

2:09:51.540 --> 2:09:52.540
 it doesn't work.

2:09:52.540 --> 2:09:54.760
 Do you have any of this stuff online by the way?

2:09:54.760 --> 2:10:03.840
 I do because during COVID, I decided at the advice of a good friend to do a daily course.

2:10:03.840 --> 2:10:06.240
 I taught meditating with John Vervecki.

2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:10.620
 I did all the way through meditation, contemplation, even some of the movement practices.

2:10:10.620 --> 2:10:11.620
 That's all there.

2:10:11.620 --> 2:10:12.620
 It's all available.

2:10:12.620 --> 2:10:15.480
 That was largely inspired by Buddhism and Taoism.

2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:18.760
 And then I went into the Western tradition and went through things like Stoicism and

2:10:18.760 --> 2:10:21.680
 Neoplatonism, cultivating wisdom with John Vervecki.

2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:23.920
 That's all there, all free.

2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:24.920
 On your website?

2:10:24.920 --> 2:10:25.920
 Yeah.

2:10:25.920 --> 2:10:26.920
 It's on my YouTube channel.

2:10:26.920 --> 2:10:27.920
 Yeah.

2:10:27.920 --> 2:10:28.920
 On your YouTube channel.

2:10:28.920 --> 2:10:29.920
 Okay.

2:10:29.920 --> 2:10:30.920
 That's exciting.

2:10:30.920 --> 2:10:34.460
 I mean, your Meaning Crisis lectures is just incredible.

2:10:34.460 --> 2:10:38.640
 Everything around it, including the notes and the notes that people took, it's just,

2:10:38.640 --> 2:10:41.800
 it created this tree of conversations.

2:10:41.800 --> 2:10:45.360
 It's really, really, really well done.

2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:47.480
 What about flow induction?

2:10:47.480 --> 2:10:48.480
 You want to flow wisely.

2:10:48.480 --> 2:10:55.280
 And first of all, you need to understand what flow is, and then you need to confront a particular

2:10:55.280 --> 2:10:57.520
 issue around, a practical problem around flow.

2:10:57.520 --> 2:11:02.400
 Let's go there because a lot of those words seem like synonyms to people sometimes.

2:11:02.400 --> 2:11:07.000
 So the state of flow, what is it?

2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:08.000
 All right.

2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:11.120
 So, and he just died last year, Csikszentmihalyi.

2:11:11.120 --> 2:11:13.400
 I admire him very much.

2:11:13.400 --> 2:11:20.040
 We've exchanged a bunch of messages over the past few years, and he wanted to do the podcast

2:11:20.040 --> 2:11:21.040
 several times.

2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:22.640
 Oh, that would have been wonderful.

2:11:22.640 --> 2:11:30.040
 But he said he struggled with his health, and I never knew in those situations, I deeply

2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:41.800
 regret several cases like this that I had with Conway, that I should have pushed him

2:11:41.800 --> 2:11:48.960
 on it because, yeah, as you get later in life, things, the simple things become more difficult,

2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:54.320
 but a voice, especially one that hasn't been really heard, is important to hear.

2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:57.000
 So anyway, I apologize, but yeah.

2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:58.000
 No, no.

2:11:58.000 --> 2:11:59.000
 I share that.

2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:06.000
 I mean, I can tell you that within my area, he is important and he's famous in an academics

2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:07.000
 sense.

2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:08.000
 Yeah.

2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:13.520
 So the flow state, two important sets of conditions, and very often people only talk about one,

2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:16.560
 and that's a little bit of a misrepresentation.

2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:24.080
 So the flow state is in situations in which the demand of the situation is slightly beyond

2:12:24.080 --> 2:12:25.880
 your skills.

2:12:25.880 --> 2:12:31.320
 So you both have to apply all the skills you can with as much sort of attention and concentration

2:12:31.320 --> 2:12:36.600
 as you possibly can, and you have to actually be stretching your skills.

2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:44.280
 Now, in this circumstance, people report optimal experience, optimal in two ways.

2:12:44.280 --> 2:12:47.380
 Optimal in that this is one of the best experiences I've had in my life.

2:12:47.380 --> 2:12:51.720
 It's distinct from pleasure, and yet it explains why people do very bizarre things like rock

2:12:51.720 --> 2:12:55.040
 climbing because it's a good flow induction.

2:12:55.040 --> 2:12:58.600
 But they also mean optimal in a second sense, my best performance.

2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:02.880
 So it's both the best experience and the best performance.

2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:09.660
 So Csikszentmihalyi also talked about the information flow conditions you need, right,

2:13:09.660 --> 2:13:13.160
 in order for there to be this state of flow, and then I'll talk about what it's like to

2:13:13.160 --> 2:13:14.400
 be in flow in a sec.

2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:16.820
 What you need is three things.

2:13:16.820 --> 2:13:18.700
 You need the information that you're getting to be clear.

2:13:18.700 --> 2:13:20.760
 It can't be ambiguous or vague.

2:13:20.760 --> 2:13:21.760
 Think about a rock climber.

2:13:21.760 --> 2:13:26.240
 If it's ambiguous and vague, you're in trouble, right?

2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:31.160
 There has to be tightly coupled feedback between what you do and how the environment responds.

2:13:31.160 --> 2:13:33.560
 So when you act, there's an immediate response.

2:13:33.560 --> 2:13:38.960
 There isn't a big time lag between your action and your ability to detect the response from

2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:40.360
 the environment.

2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:43.440
 Third, failure has to matter.

2:13:43.440 --> 2:13:45.040
 Error really matters.

2:13:45.040 --> 2:13:48.120
 So there should be some anxiety about failure.

2:13:48.120 --> 2:13:50.160
 And failure matters.

2:13:50.160 --> 2:13:51.160
 So that, yeah, because…

2:13:51.160 --> 2:13:53.720
 Like to you, the person that participates.

2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:55.200
 Yes, yes, yes.

2:13:55.200 --> 2:14:00.600
 Now when you're in the flow state, notice how this sits on the boundary between the

2:14:00.600 --> 2:14:03.000
 secular and the sacred.

2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:10.760
 When you're in the flow state, people report a tremendous sense of atonement with the environment.

2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:16.080
 They report a loss of a particular kind of self consciousness, that narrative, nurturing

2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:19.040
 nanny in your head that, how do I look?

2:14:19.040 --> 2:14:20.080
 Do people like me?

2:14:20.080 --> 2:14:21.080
 How do I look?

2:14:21.080 --> 2:14:22.080
 How's my hair?

2:14:22.080 --> 2:14:23.080
 Do people like me?

2:14:23.080 --> 2:14:24.080
 Should I have said that?

2:14:24.080 --> 2:14:25.240
 That all goes away.

2:14:25.240 --> 2:14:26.240
 You're free from that.

2:14:26.240 --> 2:14:30.840
 You're free from the most sadistic, superego self critic you could possibly have, at least

2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:32.160
 for a while.

2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:34.320
 The world is vivid.

2:14:34.320 --> 2:14:35.960
 It's super salient to you.

2:14:35.960 --> 2:14:39.720
 There's an ongoing sense of discovery.

2:14:39.720 --> 2:14:47.300
 Although often you know you're exerting a lot of metabolic effort, it feels effortless.

2:14:47.300 --> 2:14:53.160
 So in the flow state when you're sparring, your hand just goes up for the block and your

2:14:53.160 --> 2:14:56.200
 strike just goes through the empty space.

2:14:56.200 --> 2:15:01.000
 Or if you're a goalie in hockey, I've got to mention hockey once, I'm a Canadian, right?

2:15:01.000 --> 2:15:05.920
 You put out your glove hand and the puck's there, right?

2:15:05.920 --> 2:15:19.600
 So there's this tremendous sense of grace, atonement, super salience, discovery and realness.

2:15:19.600 --> 2:15:23.600
 People don't, when they're in the flow state, they don't go, I bet this is an illusion.

2:15:23.600 --> 2:15:31.920
 The interesting question for me and my coauthors in the article we published in the Oxford

2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:37.320
 Handbook of Spontaneous Thought with Arianne Harabennett and Leo Ferraro is that's a descriptive

2:15:37.320 --> 2:15:39.420
 account of flow.

2:15:39.420 --> 2:15:45.320
 We wanted an explanatory account, one of the causal mechanisms at work in flow.

2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:51.780
 And so we actually proposed to interlocking cognitive processes.

2:15:51.780 --> 2:15:56.440
 The first thing we said is, well, what's going on in flow?

2:15:56.440 --> 2:15:57.440
 Well think about it.

2:15:57.440 --> 2:15:59.400
 Think about the rock climber.

2:15:59.400 --> 2:16:04.140
 The rock climber, and I talked about this earlier, they're constantly restructuring

2:16:04.140 --> 2:16:06.980
 how they're seeing the rock face.

2:16:06.980 --> 2:16:12.560
 They're constantly doing something like insight, and if they fail to do it, they impasse and

2:16:12.560 --> 2:16:14.160
 that starts to get dangerous.

2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:17.760
 So they've got to do an insight that primes an insight that primes an insight.

2:16:17.760 --> 2:16:23.960
 So imagine the aha experience, that flash and that moment, and imagine it cascading

2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:26.860
 so you're getting the extended aha.

2:16:26.860 --> 2:16:28.440
 That's why things are super salient.

2:16:28.440 --> 2:16:30.000
 There's a sense of discovery.

2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:35.280
 There's a sense of atonement, of deep participation, of grace, but there's something else going

2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:37.280
 on too.

2:16:37.280 --> 2:16:43.340
 So there's a phenomenon called implicit learning, also very well replicated.

2:16:43.340 --> 2:16:45.680
 It's way back in the 60s with Rieber.

2:16:45.680 --> 2:16:54.160
 You can give people complex patterns, like number and letter strings, and they can learn

2:16:54.160 --> 2:16:59.360
 about those patterns outside of deliberate focal awareness.

2:16:59.360 --> 2:17:01.720
 That's what's called implicit learning.

2:17:01.720 --> 2:17:10.680
 And what's interesting is if you try and change that task into, tell me the pattern, but explicitly

2:17:10.680 --> 2:17:13.320
 try to figure it out, the performance degrades.

2:17:13.320 --> 2:17:14.320
 So here's the idea.

2:17:14.320 --> 2:17:19.720
 You have this adaptive capacity for implicit learning, and what it does is it results in

2:17:19.720 --> 2:17:24.920
 you being able to track complex variables in a way, but you don't know how you came

2:17:24.920 --> 2:17:27.280
 up with that knowledge.

2:17:27.280 --> 2:17:31.120
 And this is Hogarth's proposal in educating intuition.

2:17:31.120 --> 2:17:33.040
 Intuition is actually the result of implicit learning.

2:17:33.040 --> 2:17:41.680
 So an example I use is how far do you stand away from somebody at a funeral?

2:17:41.680 --> 2:17:43.160
 There's a lot of complex variables.

2:17:43.160 --> 2:17:49.500
 There's status, closeness to the person, your relationship to them, past history, all kinds

2:17:49.500 --> 2:17:55.160
 of stuff, and yet you know how to do it, and you didn't have to go to funeral school.

2:17:55.160 --> 2:17:56.960
 I'm just using that as an example.

2:17:56.960 --> 2:17:58.840
 So you have these powerful intuitions.

2:17:58.840 --> 2:18:02.580
 Now here's Hogarth's great point.

2:18:02.580 --> 2:18:06.660
 Implicit learning, remember I said before, the things that make it adaptive make us subject

2:18:06.660 --> 2:18:07.840
 to self deception?

2:18:07.840 --> 2:18:09.720
 Here's another example.

2:18:09.720 --> 2:18:14.160
 Implicit learning is powerful at picking up on complex patterns, but it doesn't care what

2:18:14.160 --> 2:18:15.840
 kind of pattern it is.

2:18:15.840 --> 2:18:22.140
 It doesn't distinguish causal patterns from merely correlational patterns.

2:18:22.140 --> 2:18:24.360
 So implicit learning, when we like it, it's intuition.

2:18:24.360 --> 2:18:27.800
 When it's picking up on stuff that's bogus, we call it prejudice or all kinds of other

2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:30.800
 names for intuition that's going wrong.

2:18:30.800 --> 2:18:33.680
 Now, he said, okay, what do we do?

2:18:33.680 --> 2:18:34.680
 What do we do about this?

2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:36.380
 And this will get back to Flo.

2:18:36.380 --> 2:18:37.380
 What do we do about this?

2:18:37.380 --> 2:18:40.800
 Well, we can't try to replace implicit learning with explicit learning because we'll lose

2:18:40.800 --> 2:18:42.820
 all the adaptiveness to it.

2:18:42.820 --> 2:18:44.600
 So what can we do explicitly?

2:18:44.600 --> 2:18:50.140
 What we can do is take care of the environment in which we're doing the implicit learning.

2:18:50.140 --> 2:18:51.160
 How do we do that?

2:18:51.160 --> 2:18:58.420
 We try to make sure the environment has features that help us distinguish causation from correlation.

2:18:58.420 --> 2:19:02.080
 What kind of environments have we created that are good at distinguishing causation

2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:04.320
 from correlation?

2:19:04.320 --> 2:19:05.320
 Experimental environments.

2:19:05.320 --> 2:19:07.600
 What do you do in an experiment?

2:19:07.600 --> 2:19:12.480
 You make sure that the variables are clear, no confound, no ambiguity, no vagueness.

2:19:12.480 --> 2:19:16.120
 You make sure there's a tight coupling between the independent and the dependent variable

2:19:16.120 --> 2:19:19.040
 and your hypothesis can be falsified.

2:19:19.040 --> 2:19:20.040
 Error matters.

2:19:20.040 --> 2:19:21.480
 Now look at those three, Lex.

2:19:21.480 --> 2:19:27.320
 Those are exactly the three conditions that you need for Flo.

2:19:27.320 --> 2:19:31.700
 Clear information, tightly coupled feedback and error matters.

2:19:31.700 --> 2:19:39.120
 So Flo is not only an insight cascade, improving your insight capacity, it's also a marker

2:19:39.120 --> 2:19:46.800
 that you're cultivating the best kind of intuitions, the ones that fit you best to the causal

2:19:46.800 --> 2:19:48.760
 patterns in your environment.

2:19:48.760 --> 2:19:54.240
 But it's hard to achieve that kind of environment where there's a clear distinction between

2:19:54.240 --> 2:20:01.440
 causality and correlation and it has the rigor of a scientific experiment.

2:20:01.440 --> 2:20:06.660
 Fair enough and I don't think Hogarth was saying it's gonna be epistemically as rigorous

2:20:06.660 --> 2:20:13.360
 as a scientific experiment, but he's saying if you structure that, it will tend to do

2:20:13.360 --> 2:20:16.440
 what that scientific method does, which is find causal...

2:20:16.440 --> 2:20:17.800
 Think of the rock climber.

2:20:17.800 --> 2:20:18.800
 All of those things are the case.

2:20:18.800 --> 2:20:20.920
 They need clear information.

2:20:20.920 --> 2:20:25.760
 It's tightly coupled and error matters and they think what they're doing is very real

2:20:25.760 --> 2:20:34.380
 because if they're not conforming to the real causal patterns of the rock face and the physiology

2:20:34.380 --> 2:20:37.280
 of their body, they will fall.

2:20:37.280 --> 2:20:43.640
 Is there something to be said about the power of discovering meaning and having this deep

2:20:43.640 --> 2:20:48.480
 relationship with the moment?

2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:55.200
 There's something about flow that really forgets the past and the future and is really focused

2:20:55.200 --> 2:20:56.200
 on the moment.

2:20:56.200 --> 2:21:00.120
 I think that's part of the phenomenology, but I think the functionality has to do with

2:21:00.120 --> 2:21:07.500
 the fact that what's happening in flow is that dynamic nonpropositional connectedness

2:21:07.500 --> 2:21:12.400
 that is so central to meaning is being optimized.

2:21:12.400 --> 2:21:20.240
 This is why flow is a good predictor of how well you rate your life, how much well being

2:21:20.240 --> 2:21:24.880
 you think you have, which of course is itself also predictive and interrelated with how

2:21:24.880 --> 2:21:26.560
 meaningful you find your life.

2:21:26.560 --> 2:21:31.920
 One of the things that you can do, but there's an important caveat, to increase your sense

2:21:31.920 --> 2:21:36.520
 of meaning in life is to get into the flow state more frequently.

2:21:36.520 --> 2:21:40.320
 That's why I said you want a moving practice that's conducive to the flow state, but there's

2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:48.800
 one important caveat, which is we of course have figured out and I'm playing with words

2:21:48.800 --> 2:21:54.320
 here how to game this and how to hijack it by creating things like video games.

2:21:54.320 --> 2:21:59.320
 I'm not saying this is the case for all video games or this is the case for all people,

2:21:59.320 --> 2:22:05.640
 but the WHO now acknowledges this as a real thing that you can get into the flow state

2:22:05.640 --> 2:22:12.320
 within the video game world to the detriment of your ability to get into the flow state

2:22:12.320 --> 2:22:14.040
 in the real world.

2:22:14.040 --> 2:22:15.880
 What's the opposite of flow?

2:22:15.880 --> 2:22:16.880
 Depression.

2:22:16.880 --> 2:22:21.400
 In fact, depression has been called anti flow.

2:22:21.400 --> 2:22:27.840
 So you get these people that are flowing in this non real world and they can't transfer

2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:32.240
 it to the real world and it's actually costing them flow in the real world.

2:22:32.240 --> 2:22:36.240
 So they tend to get, they tend to suffer depression and all kinds of things.

2:22:36.240 --> 2:22:45.840
 Your ability, your habit and just skill at attaining flow in the video game world basically

2:22:45.840 --> 2:22:52.800
 makes you less effective or maybe shocks you at how difficult it is to achieve flow in

2:22:52.800 --> 2:22:53.800
 the physical world.

2:22:53.800 --> 2:22:54.800
 Yeah.

2:22:54.800 --> 2:22:55.800
 I'm not sure about that.

2:22:55.800 --> 2:23:03.400
 I just, I don't want to push back against the implied challenge of transferability because

2:23:03.400 --> 2:23:10.240
 there's a lot of, I have a lot of friends that play video games, a very large percent

2:23:10.240 --> 2:23:20.560
 of young folks play video games and I'm hesitant to build up models of how that affects behavior.

2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:22.320
 My intuition is weak there.

2:23:22.320 --> 2:23:29.000
 Sometimes people that have PhDs are of a certain age that they came up when video games weren't

2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:31.320
 a deep part of their life development.

2:23:31.320 --> 2:23:38.400
 I would venture to say people who have developed their brain with video games being a part,

2:23:38.400 --> 2:23:45.040
 a large part of that world are in some sense different humans and it's possible that they

2:23:45.040 --> 2:23:47.440
 can transfer more effectively.

2:23:47.440 --> 2:23:54.280
 Some of the lessons, some of the ability to attain flow from the virtual world to the

2:23:54.280 --> 2:23:59.520
 physical world, they're also more, I would venture to say, resilient to the negative

2:23:59.520 --> 2:24:08.280
 effects of, for example, social media or video games that have maybe the objectification

2:24:08.280 --> 2:24:12.440
 or the over sexualized or violent aspect of video games.

2:24:12.440 --> 2:24:15.760
 They're able to turn that off when they go to the physical world and turn it back on

2:24:15.760 --> 2:24:23.040
 when they're playing the video games probably more effectively than the old timers.

2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:27.280
 So I just want to say this sort of, I'm not sure, it's a really interesting question how

2:24:27.280 --> 2:24:29.000
 transferable the flow state is.

2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.960
 I don't know if you want to comment on that.

2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:32.960
 I do, I do.

2:24:32.960 --> 2:24:36.160
 First of all, I did qualify and I'm saying it's not the case for all video games or for

2:24:36.160 --> 2:24:37.160
 all people.

2:24:37.160 --> 2:24:42.120
 I'm holding out the possibility and I know this possibility because I've had students

2:24:42.120 --> 2:24:48.760
 who actually suffer from this and have done work around it with me.

2:24:48.760 --> 2:24:51.000
 The ability to achieve.

2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:54.760
 They couldn't transfer, yeah.

2:24:54.760 --> 2:24:58.840
 And then they were able to step back from that and then take up the cognitive science

2:24:58.840 --> 2:25:01.600
 and write about it and work on it.

2:25:01.600 --> 2:25:10.940
 Also, I'm not so sure about the resiliency claim because there seems to be mounting evidence.

2:25:10.940 --> 2:25:17.640
 It's not consensus, but it's certainly not regarded as fringe, that the increase in social

2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:23.840
 media is pretty strongly correlated with increase in depression, self destructive behavior,

2:25:23.840 --> 2:25:24.840
 things like this.

2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:26.160
 I would like to see that evidence.

2:25:26.160 --> 2:25:27.160
 Sure.

2:25:27.160 --> 2:25:28.160
 I can find it.

2:25:28.160 --> 2:25:29.160
 No, no, no.

2:25:29.160 --> 2:25:41.720
 Let me, I'm always hesitant to too eagerly kind of agree with things that I want to agree

2:25:41.720 --> 2:25:42.720
 with.

2:25:42.720 --> 2:25:48.720
 There's a public perception everyone seems to hate on social media.

2:25:48.720 --> 2:25:56.520
 I wonder, as always with these things, does it reveal depression or does it create depression?

2:25:56.520 --> 2:25:57.680
 This is always the question.

2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:04.220
 It's like whenever you talk about any political or ideological movement, does it create hate

2:26:04.220 --> 2:26:06.000
 or does it reveal hate?

2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:09.960
 And that's a good thing to ask and you should always challenge the things that you intuitively

2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:10.960
 want to believe.

2:26:10.960 --> 2:26:13.960
 I agree with that.

2:26:13.960 --> 2:26:15.640
 Like aliens.

2:26:15.640 --> 2:26:21.280
 So one of the ways you address this, and it's not sufficient and I did say the work is preliminary,

2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:28.900
 but if I can give you a plausible mechanism that's new and then that lends credence.

2:26:28.900 --> 2:26:33.560
 And part of what happens is illusory social comparison.

2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:34.560
 Think of Instagram.

2:26:34.560 --> 2:26:39.400
 People are posting things that are not accurate representation of their life or life events.

2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:46.680
 In fact, they will stage things, but the people that are looking at these, they take it often

2:26:46.680 --> 2:26:56.280
 as real and so they get downward social comparison and this is like compared to how you and I

2:26:56.280 --> 2:27:00.640
 probably live where we may get one or two of those events a week, they're getting them

2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:02.440
 moment by moment.

2:27:02.440 --> 2:27:07.600
 And so it's a plausible mechanism that why it might be driving people into a more depressed

2:27:07.600 --> 2:27:08.600
 state.

2:27:08.600 --> 2:27:14.120
 Okay, the flip side of that is because there's a greater, greater gap going from real world

2:27:14.120 --> 2:27:19.920
 to Instagram world, you start to be able to laugh at it and realize that it's artificial.

2:27:19.920 --> 2:27:26.280
 So for example, even just artificial filters, people start to realize like, there's like,

2:27:26.280 --> 2:27:31.480
 it's the same kind of gap as there is between the video game world and the real world.

2:27:31.480 --> 2:27:35.320
 In the video game world, you can do all kinds of wild things.

2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:38.360
 Grand theft auto, you can shoot people up, you can do whatever the heck you want.

2:27:38.360 --> 2:27:42.880
 In the real world, you can't and you start to develop an understanding of how to have

2:27:42.880 --> 2:27:46.200
 fun in the virtual world and in the physical world.

2:27:46.200 --> 2:27:50.320
 And I think it's just as a pushback, I'm not saying either is true though, those are very

2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:51.760
 interesting claims.

2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:58.520
 The more ridiculously out of touch Instagram becomes, the easier you can laugh it off potentially

2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:00.560
 in terms of the effect it has on your psyche.

2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:01.760
 I'll respond to that.

2:28:01.760 --> 2:28:06.280
 But at some point, we should get back to Flo.

2:28:06.280 --> 2:28:07.460
 As we engage in Flo.

2:28:07.460 --> 2:28:16.280
 You laugh at the shampoo commercial and you buy the shampoo.

2:28:16.280 --> 2:28:21.440
 There's a capacity for tremendous bullshitting because of the way these machines are designed

2:28:21.440 --> 2:28:33.040
 to trigger salience without triggering reflective truth seeking.

2:28:33.040 --> 2:28:42.240
 I'm thinking of common examples because sometimes you can laugh all the way to the bank.

2:28:42.240 --> 2:28:45.560
 You can laugh and not buy the shampoo.

2:28:45.560 --> 2:28:49.160
 There's many cases, so I think you have to laugh hard enough.

2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:54.800
 You do have to laugh hard enough, but the advertisers get millions of dollars precisely

2:28:54.800 --> 2:29:00.280
 because for many, many people, it does make you buy the shampoo and that's the concern.

2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:04.800
 And maybe the machine of social media is such that it optimizes the shampoo buying.

2:29:04.800 --> 2:29:05.800
 Yes.

2:29:05.800 --> 2:29:13.200
 The point I was trying to make is whether or not that particular example is ultimately

2:29:13.200 --> 2:29:18.840
 right, the possibility of transfer failure is a real thing.

2:29:18.840 --> 2:29:22.640
 And I want to contrast that to an experience I had when I was in grad school.

2:29:22.640 --> 2:29:27.160
 I had been doing Tai Chi Chuan about three or four years, very religiously, both senses

2:29:27.160 --> 2:29:32.900
 of the word, like three or four hours a day and reading all the literature and I was having

2:29:32.900 --> 2:29:39.880
 all the weird experiences, cold as ice, hot as lava, all that stuff and it's ooh, right?

2:29:39.880 --> 2:29:45.360
 But my friends in grad school, they said to me, what's going on?

2:29:45.360 --> 2:29:46.360
 You're different.

2:29:46.360 --> 2:29:48.520
 And I said, what do you mean?

2:29:48.520 --> 2:29:54.120
 And they said, well, you're a lot more balanced in your interactions and you're a lot more

2:29:54.120 --> 2:30:01.480
 flowing and you're a lot more sort of flexible and you adjust more and I realized, oh, and

2:30:01.480 --> 2:30:08.160
 this was the sort of Taoist claim around Tai Chi Chuan that it actually transfers in ways

2:30:08.160 --> 2:30:10.160
 that you might not expect.

2:30:10.160 --> 2:30:15.840
 You start to be able, and I've now noticed that, I now notice how I'm doing Tai Chi even

2:30:15.840 --> 2:30:22.280
 in this interaction and how it can facilitate and afford and so there's a powerful transfer

2:30:22.280 --> 2:30:28.800
 and that's what I meant by flow wisely, not only flow in a way that's making sure that

2:30:28.800 --> 2:30:35.160
 you're distinguishing causation from correlation, which flow can do, but find how to situate

2:30:35.160 --> 2:30:39.960
 it, home it so that it will percolate through your psyche and permeate through many domains

2:30:39.960 --> 2:30:42.780
 of your life.

2:30:42.780 --> 2:30:49.540
 Is there something you could say similar to our discussion about mindfulness and meditation

2:30:49.540 --> 2:30:55.360
 and contemplation about the world that psychedelics take our mind?

2:30:55.360 --> 2:31:04.840
 Where does the mind go when it's on psychedelics?

2:31:04.840 --> 2:31:10.840
 I want to remind you of something you said, which is a gem.

2:31:10.840 --> 2:31:16.640
 It's not so much the experience, but the degree to which it can be integrated back.

2:31:16.640 --> 2:31:21.480
 So here's a proposal that comes from Woodward and others, a lot of convergence around this.

2:31:21.480 --> 2:31:25.640
 Carhartt Harris is talking about it similarly in the entropic brain, but I'm not going to

2:31:25.640 --> 2:31:26.640
 talk first about psychedelics.

2:31:26.640 --> 2:31:31.480
 I'm going to talk about neural networks and I'm going to talk about a classic problem

2:31:31.480 --> 2:31:32.480
 in neural networks.

2:31:32.480 --> 2:31:37.180
 So neural networks, like us with intuition and implicit learning, are fantastic at picking

2:31:37.180 --> 2:31:40.040
 up on complex patterns.

2:31:40.040 --> 2:31:41.360
 Which neural networks are we talking about?

2:31:41.360 --> 2:31:43.920
 I'm talking about a general, just general...

2:31:43.920 --> 2:31:45.360
 Both artificial and biological?

2:31:45.360 --> 2:31:46.360
 Yes.

2:31:46.360 --> 2:31:47.360
 Yes.

2:31:47.360 --> 2:31:52.200
 I think at this point, there is no relevant difference.

2:31:52.200 --> 2:31:56.680
 So one of the classic problems because of their power is they suffer from overfitting

2:31:56.680 --> 2:32:04.200
 to the data, or for those of you who are in a statistical orientation, they pick up patterns

2:32:04.200 --> 2:32:09.280
 in the sample that aren't actually present in the population.

2:32:09.280 --> 2:32:13.960
 And so what you do is there's various strategies.

2:32:13.960 --> 2:32:19.300
 You can do dropout where you periodically turn off half of the nodes in a network.

2:32:19.300 --> 2:32:22.520
 You can drop noise into the network.

2:32:22.520 --> 2:32:28.400
 And what that does is it prevents overfitting to the data and allows the network to generalize

2:32:28.400 --> 2:32:32.360
 more powerfully to the environment.

2:32:32.360 --> 2:32:38.600
 I proposed to you that that's basically what psychedelics do.

2:32:38.600 --> 2:32:39.680
 They do that.

2:32:39.680 --> 2:32:44.260
 They basically do significant constraint reduction.

2:32:44.260 --> 2:32:49.640
 And so you get areas of the brain talking to each other that don't normally talk to

2:32:49.640 --> 2:32:53.940
 each other, areas that do talk to each other, not talking to each other, down regulation

2:32:53.940 --> 2:32:58.020
 of areas that are very dominant, like the default mode network, et cetera.

2:32:58.020 --> 2:33:04.140
 And what that does is exactly something strongly analogous to what's happening in dropout or

2:33:04.140 --> 2:33:05.960
 putting noise into the data.

2:33:05.960 --> 2:33:06.960
 It opens up.

2:33:06.960 --> 2:33:11.880
 And by the way, if you give human beings an insight problem that they're trying to solve

2:33:11.880 --> 2:33:16.780
 and you throw in some noise, like literally static on the screen, you can trigger an insight

2:33:16.780 --> 2:33:19.420
 in them.

2:33:19.420 --> 2:33:23.440
 So like literally very simplistic kind of noise to the perception system.

2:33:23.440 --> 2:33:24.440
 Right.

2:33:24.440 --> 2:33:27.760
 It can break it out of overfitting to the data and open you up.

2:33:27.760 --> 2:33:39.880
 Now, that means, though, that just doing that in and of itself is not the answer because

2:33:39.880 --> 2:33:46.580
 you also have to make sure that the system can go back to exploring that new space properly.

2:33:46.580 --> 2:33:48.360
 This isn't a problem with neural networks.

2:33:48.360 --> 2:33:51.940
 You turn off dropout and they just go back to being powerful neural networks, and now

2:33:51.940 --> 2:33:55.360
 they explore the state space that they couldn't explore before.

2:33:55.360 --> 2:34:00.520
 Human beings are a little bit more messy around this, and this is where the analogy does get

2:34:00.520 --> 2:34:02.000
 a little bit strained.

2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:10.740
 So they need practices that help them integrate that opening up to the new state space so

2:34:10.740 --> 2:34:12.560
 they can properly integrate it.

2:34:12.560 --> 2:34:21.760
 So beyond Leary's state and setting, I think you need another S. I think you need sacred.

2:34:21.760 --> 2:34:29.120
 You need, psychedelics need to be practiced within a sapiential framework, a framework

2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:35.340
 in which people are independently and beforehand improving their abilities to deal with self

2:34:35.340 --> 2:34:38.800
 deception and afford insight and self regulate.

2:34:38.800 --> 2:34:43.600
 This is, of course, the overwhelming way in which psychedelics are used by indigenous

2:34:43.600 --> 2:34:44.600
 cultures.

2:34:44.600 --> 2:34:53.080
 And I think if we put them into that context, then they can help the project of people self

2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:56.900
 transcending, cultivating meaning and increasing wisdom.

2:34:56.900 --> 2:35:03.520
 But if I think we remove them out of that context and put them in the context of commodities

2:35:03.520 --> 2:35:10.840
 taken just to have certain phenomenological changes, we run certain important risks.

2:35:10.840 --> 2:35:14.160
 So using the term of higher states of consciousness.

2:35:14.160 --> 2:35:15.160
 Yes.

2:35:15.160 --> 2:35:19.640
 Is consciousness an important part of that word?

2:35:19.640 --> 2:35:22.000
 Why higher?

2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:30.560
 Is it a higher state or is it a detour, a side road on the main road of consciousness?

2:35:30.560 --> 2:35:32.880
 Where do we go here?

2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:37.720
 I think the psychedelic state is on a continuum.

2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:40.960
 There's insight and then flow is an insight cascade.

2:35:40.960 --> 2:35:46.480
 There's flow and then you can have sort of psychedelic experiences, mind revealing experiences,

2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:52.000
 but they overlap with mystical experiences and they aren't the same.

2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:56.640
 So for example, in the Griffiths lab, they gave people psilocybin and they taught them

2:35:56.640 --> 2:36:03.440
 ahead of time sort of the features of a mystical experience and only a certain proportion of

2:36:03.440 --> 2:36:08.260
 the people that took the psilocybin went from a psychedelic into a mystical experience.

2:36:08.260 --> 2:36:13.040
 What was interesting is the people that had the mystical experience had measurable and

2:36:13.040 --> 2:36:17.020
 longstanding change to one of the big five factors of personality.

2:36:17.020 --> 2:36:21.400
 They had increased openness, openness is supposed to actually go down over time and these traits

2:36:21.400 --> 2:36:27.360
 aren't supposed to be that malleable and it was significantly like altered, right?

2:36:27.360 --> 2:36:33.380
 But imagine if you just created more openness in a person, right?

2:36:33.380 --> 2:36:36.960
 And they're now open to a lot more and they want to explore a lot more, but you don't

2:36:36.960 --> 2:36:39.680
 give them the tools of discernment.

2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:42.640
 That could be problematic for them in important ways.

2:36:42.640 --> 2:36:44.120
 That could be very problematic.

2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:53.080
 Yes, I got it, but you know, so you have to land the plane in a productive way somehow

2:36:53.080 --> 2:36:57.360
 integrated back into your life and how you see the world and how you frame your perception

2:36:57.360 --> 2:36:58.360
 of that world.

2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:03.480
 And when people do that, that's when I call it a transformative experience.

2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:06.900
 Now the higher states of consciousness are really interesting because they tend to move

2:37:06.900 --> 2:37:12.400
 people from a mystical experience into a transformative experience, because what happens in these

2:37:12.400 --> 2:37:15.960
 experiences is something really, really interesting.

2:37:15.960 --> 2:37:19.280
 They get to a state that's ineffable, they can't put it into words, they can't describe

2:37:19.280 --> 2:37:25.960
 it, but they're in this state temporarily and then they come back and they do this.

2:37:25.960 --> 2:37:30.680
 They say, that was really real and this in comparison is less real.

2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:35.520
 So I remember that platonic meta desire, I want to change my life myself so that I'm

2:37:35.520 --> 2:37:41.120
 more in conformity with that really real, and that is really odd, Lex, because normally

2:37:41.120 --> 2:37:48.200
 when we go outside of our consensus intelligibility, like a dream state, we come back from it,

2:37:48.200 --> 2:37:51.520
 we say, that doesn't fit into everything, therefore it's unreal.

2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:53.420
 They do the exact opposite.

2:37:53.420 --> 2:37:59.840
 They come out of these states and they say, that doesn't fit into this consensus intelligibility

2:37:59.840 --> 2:38:01.520
 and that means this is less real.

2:38:01.520 --> 2:38:04.920
 They do the exact opposite and that fascinates me.

2:38:04.920 --> 2:38:12.800
 Why do they flip our normal procedure about evaluating alternative states?

2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:18.280
 The thing is those higher states of consciousness, precisely because they have that ontonormativity,

2:38:18.280 --> 2:38:22.960
 the realness that demands that you make a change in your life, they serve to bridge

2:38:22.960 --> 2:38:26.600
 between mystical experiences and genuine transformative experiences.

2:38:26.600 --> 2:38:31.320
 So you do think seeing those as more real is productive because then you reach for them.

2:38:31.320 --> 2:38:38.240
 So Jaden's done work on it, and again, all of this stuff isn't recent, so we have to

2:38:38.240 --> 2:38:44.240
 take it with a grain of salt, but by a lot of objective measure, people who do this,

2:38:44.240 --> 2:38:49.200
 who have these higher states of consciousness and undertake the transformative process,

2:38:49.200 --> 2:38:53.920
 their lives get better, their relationships improve, their sense of self improves, their

2:38:53.920 --> 2:38:59.240
 anxieties go down, depression, like all of these other measures, the needles are moved

2:38:59.240 --> 2:39:03.240
 on these measures by people undergoing this transformative experience.

2:39:03.240 --> 2:39:08.280
 Their lives, by many of the criteria that we judge our lives to be good, get better.

2:39:08.280 --> 2:39:18.040
 I have to ask you about this fascinating distributed cognition process that leads to mass formation

2:39:18.040 --> 2:39:22.120
 of ideologies that have had an impact on our world.

2:39:22.120 --> 2:39:28.600
 So you spoke about the clash of the two great pseudo religious ideologies of Marxism and

2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:29.600
 Nazism.

2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:30.600
 Yes.

2:39:30.600 --> 2:39:33.080
 Especially their clash on the Eastern Front.

2:39:33.080 --> 2:39:34.880
 Battle of Kursk.

2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:42.640
 Can you explain the origin of each of these, Marxism and Nazism, in a kind of way that

2:39:42.640 --> 2:39:47.640
 we have been talking about the formation of ideas?

2:39:47.640 --> 2:39:51.820
 Hegel is to Protestantism what Thomas Aquinas is to Catholicism.

2:39:51.820 --> 2:40:01.640
 He was the philosopher who took German Protestantism and also Kant and Fichte and Schelling, and

2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:07.480
 he built a philosophical system.

2:40:07.480 --> 2:40:08.940
 He explicitly said this, by the way.

2:40:08.940 --> 2:40:12.040
 He wanted to bridge between philosophy and religion.

2:40:12.040 --> 2:40:13.240
 He explicitly said that.

2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:14.800
 I'm not foisting that on him.

2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:18.300
 He said it repeatedly in many different places.

2:40:18.300 --> 2:40:25.800
 So he's trying to create a philosophical system that gathered to it, I think, the core mythos

2:40:25.800 --> 2:40:26.800
 of Christianity.

2:40:26.800 --> 2:40:33.480
 The core mythos of Christianity is this idea of a narrative structure to reality in which

2:40:33.480 --> 2:40:38.860
 progress is real, in which our actions now can change the future.

2:40:38.860 --> 2:40:44.600
 We can co participate with God in the creation of the future, and that future can be better.

2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:49.280
 It can reach something like a utopia or the promised land or whatever.

2:40:49.280 --> 2:40:52.120
 He created a philosophical system of brilliance, by the way.

2:40:52.120 --> 2:40:53.280
 He's a genius.

2:40:53.280 --> 2:41:00.640
 But basically what it did was it took that religious vision and gave it the air of philosophical

2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:04.240
 intelligibility and respect.

2:41:04.240 --> 2:41:10.080
 And then Marx takes that and says, you know that process by which the narrative is working

2:41:10.080 --> 2:41:14.720
 itself out that Hegel called dialectic, I don't think it's primarily happening in ideas.

2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:19.520
 I think it's happening primarily between classes within socioeconomic factors.

2:41:19.520 --> 2:41:21.060
 But it's the same story.

2:41:21.060 --> 2:41:27.140
 Here's this mechanism of history, it's teleological, it's going to move this way, it can move towards

2:41:27.140 --> 2:41:28.140
 a utopia.

2:41:28.140 --> 2:41:34.320
 We can either participate in furthering it, like participating in the work of God, or

2:41:34.320 --> 2:41:37.120
 we can thwart it and be against it.

2:41:37.120 --> 2:41:41.080
 And so you have a pseudo religious vision.

2:41:41.080 --> 2:41:42.640
 It's all encompassing.

2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:48.040
 Think about how Marxism is not just a philosophical position, it's not just an economic position.

2:41:48.040 --> 2:41:56.440
 It's an entire worldview, an entire account of history, and a demanding account of what

2:41:56.440 --> 2:41:58.160
 human excellence is.

2:41:58.160 --> 2:42:03.480
 And it has all these things about participating, belonging, fitting to.

2:42:03.480 --> 2:42:14.160
 But it's very, in Marx's case, it's very pragmatic or directly applicable to society, to where

2:42:14.160 --> 2:42:18.760
 it leads to, it more naturally leads to political ideologies.

2:42:18.760 --> 2:42:19.960
 It does.

2:42:19.960 --> 2:42:26.400
 But I think Marx, to a very significant degree, inherits one of Hegel's main flaws.

2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:32.920
 Hegel is talking about all this and he's trying to fit it into post Kantian philosophy.

2:42:32.920 --> 2:42:38.000
 So for him, it's ultimately propositional, conceptual.

2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:43.200
 He like everybody after Descartes is very focused on the propositional level, and he's

2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:48.340
 not paying deep attention to the nonpropositional.

2:42:48.340 --> 2:42:53.320
 This is why the two great critics of Hegel, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, they're trying

2:42:53.320 --> 2:42:59.360
 to put their finger on the nonpropositional, the nonconceptual, the will to power or faith

2:42:59.360 --> 2:43:04.080
 in Kierkegaard, and they're trying to bring out all these other kinds of knowing as being

2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:05.080
 inadequate.

2:43:05.080 --> 2:43:08.560
 That's why Kierkegaard meant when he said, Hegel made a system and then he sat down beside

2:43:08.560 --> 2:43:11.760
 it.

2:43:11.760 --> 2:43:20.400
 And so Marxism is very much, it is activist, it's about reorganizing society, but the transformation

2:43:20.400 --> 2:43:28.640
 in individuals is largely ideological, meaning it's largely about these significant propositional

2:43:28.640 --> 2:43:31.560
 changes and adopting a set of beliefs.

2:43:31.560 --> 2:43:37.440
 When it came in contact with the Soviet Union or with what became the Soviet Union, why

2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:42.840
 do you think it had such a powerful hold on such a large number of people?

2:43:42.840 --> 2:43:48.120
 Not Marxism, but implementation of Marxism in the name of communism.

2:43:48.120 --> 2:43:57.200
 Because it offered people, I mean, it offered people something that typically only religions

2:43:57.200 --> 2:44:05.540
 had offered, and it offered people the hope of making a new man, a new kind of human being

2:44:05.540 --> 2:44:07.640
 in a new world.

2:44:07.640 --> 2:44:16.400
 And when you've been living in Russia, in which things seem to be locked in a system

2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:25.160
 that is crushing most people, getting the promise in the air of scientific legitimacy

2:44:25.160 --> 2:44:32.360
 that we can make new human beings and a new world and in which happiness will ensue, that's

2:44:32.360 --> 2:44:34.600
 an intoxicating proposal.

2:44:34.600 --> 2:44:40.480
 You get sort of, like I said, you get all of the intoxication of a religious utopia,

2:44:40.480 --> 2:44:47.320
 but you get all the seeming legitimacy of claiming that it's a scientific understanding

2:44:47.320 --> 2:44:48.960
 of history and economics.

2:44:48.960 --> 2:44:55.960
 It's very popular to criticize communism, Marxism these days, and I often put myself

2:44:55.960 --> 2:45:03.520
 in the place before any of the implementations came to be, I tried to think if I would be

2:45:03.520 --> 2:45:11.000
 able to predict what the implementations of Marxism and communism would result in, in

2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:12.000
 the 20th century.

2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:16.440
 And I'm not sure I'm smart enough to make that prediction.

2:45:16.440 --> 2:45:24.920
 Because at the core of the ideas are respecting, with Marx it's very economics type theory,

2:45:24.920 --> 2:45:32.880
 so it's basically respecting the value of the worker and the regular man in society

2:45:32.880 --> 2:45:35.480
 for making a contribution to that society.

2:45:35.480 --> 2:45:42.360
 And to me that seems like a powerful idea, and it's not clear to me how it goes wrong.

2:45:42.360 --> 2:45:52.840
 In fact, it's still not clear to me why the hell would Stalin happen, or Mao happen.

2:45:52.840 --> 2:45:58.120
 There's something very interesting and complex about human nature in hierarchies, about distributed

2:45:58.120 --> 2:46:01.880
 cognition that results in that, and it's not trivial to understand.

2:46:01.880 --> 2:46:02.880
 No, no.

2:46:02.880 --> 2:46:06.520
 So, I mean, I wonder if you could put a finger on it.

2:46:06.520 --> 2:46:08.760
 Why did it go so wrong?

2:46:08.760 --> 2:46:17.520
 So I think, you know, what Ohana talks about in The Intellectual History of Modernity talks

2:46:17.520 --> 2:46:27.760
 about the Promethean spirit, the idea, the really radical proposal.

2:46:27.760 --> 2:46:33.560
 And think about how it's not so radical to us, and in that sense Marxism has succeeded.

2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:38.800
 The radical proposal that you see even in the French Revolution, and don't forget the

2:46:38.800 --> 2:46:46.280
 terror comes in the French Revolution too, that we can make ourselves into godlike beings.

2:46:46.280 --> 2:46:53.440
 Think of the hubris in that, and think of the overconfidence to think that we so understand

2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:59.960
 human nature and all of its complexities and human history, and how religion functioned,

2:46:59.960 --> 2:47:04.960
 that we can just come in with a plan and make it run.

2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:11.640
 To my mind, that Promethean spirit is part of why it's doomed to fail, and it's doomed

2:47:11.640 --> 2:47:20.860
 to fail in a kind of terrorizing way, because the Promethean spirit really licenses you

2:47:20.860 --> 2:47:25.840
 to do anything, because the ends justify the means.

2:47:25.840 --> 2:47:35.240
 The ends justify the means really free you to do some of, basically, well, commit atrocities

2:47:35.240 --> 2:47:36.240
 at any scale.

2:47:36.240 --> 2:47:40.720
 Ground zero with Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, right, exactly.

2:47:40.720 --> 2:47:47.840
 And you can only believe in an ends that can justify any means if you believe in a utopia,

2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:52.580
 and you can only believe in the utopia if you really buy into the Promethean spirit.

2:47:52.580 --> 2:47:55.380
 So is that what explains Nazism?

2:47:55.380 --> 2:47:58.120
 So Nazism is part of that, too.

2:47:58.120 --> 2:48:05.800
 The Promethean spirit that we can make ourselves into supermen, ubermensch, right?

2:48:05.800 --> 2:48:19.160
 And Nazism is fueled very much by appropriating and twisting sort of Gnostic themes that are

2:48:19.160 --> 2:48:26.700
 very prevalent, Gnosticism tends to come to the fore when people are experiencing increased

2:48:26.700 --> 2:48:27.700
 meaning crisis.

2:48:27.700 --> 2:48:33.760
 And don't forget, the Weimar Republic is like a meaning crisis gone crazy on all levels.

2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:38.600
 Everybody's suffering domicile, everybody's home and way of life and identity and culture

2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:43.240
 and relationship to religion and science, all of that, right?

2:48:43.240 --> 2:48:50.360
 So Nazism comes along and offers a kind of Gnosticism, again, twisted, perverted.

2:48:50.360 --> 2:48:59.840
 I'm not saying that all Gnostics are Nazis, but there is this Gnostic mythology, mythos,

2:48:59.840 --> 2:49:01.800
 and it comes to the fore.

2:49:01.800 --> 2:49:09.800
 I remember, and this stuck with me in undergrad, I was taking political science, and the professor

2:49:09.800 --> 2:49:14.920
 extended lecture on this, and it still rings true for me, says, if you understand Nazism

2:49:14.920 --> 2:49:17.880
 as just a political movement, you have misunderstood it.

2:49:17.880 --> 2:49:24.800
 It is much more a religious phenomenon in many ways.

2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:27.600
 Is it religious in that the loss of religion?

2:49:27.600 --> 2:49:30.040
 So is it a meaning crisis?

2:49:30.040 --> 2:49:39.160
 Or is it out of a meaning crisis every discovery of religion in a Promethean type of...

2:49:39.160 --> 2:49:40.280
 I think it's the latter.

2:49:40.280 --> 2:49:43.680
 I think there's this vacuum created.

2:49:43.680 --> 2:49:48.480
 In that context, is Hitler the central religious figure?

2:49:48.480 --> 2:49:49.480
 Yes.

2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:56.340
 And also, did Nazi Germany create Hitler, or did Hitler create Nazi Germany?

2:49:56.340 --> 2:50:02.120
 So in this distributed cognition where everyone's having a dialogue, what's the role of a charismatic

2:50:02.120 --> 2:50:03.120
 leader?

2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:10.240
 Is it an emergent phenomena, or do you need one of those to kind of guide the populace?

2:50:10.240 --> 2:50:13.520
 I hope it's not a necessary requirement.

2:50:13.520 --> 2:50:19.080
 I hope that the next Buddha can be the Sangha rather than a specific individual.

2:50:19.080 --> 2:50:26.600
 But I think in that situation, Hitler's charisma allowed him to take on a mythological, in

2:50:26.600 --> 2:50:29.440
 the proper sense, archetypal...

2:50:29.440 --> 2:50:35.680
 He became deeply symbolic, and he instituted all kinds of rituals, all kinds of rituals,

2:50:35.680 --> 2:50:38.640
 and all kinds of mythos.

2:50:38.640 --> 2:50:43.840
 There's all this mythos about the master race, and there's all these rituals.

2:50:43.840 --> 2:50:47.840
 The swastika is, of course, itself a religious symbol.

2:50:47.840 --> 2:50:57.840
 There's all of this going on because he was tapping into the fact that when you put people

2:50:57.840 --> 2:51:04.100
 into deeper and deeper meaning scarcity, they will fall back on more and more mythological

2:51:04.100 --> 2:51:10.040
 ways of thinking in order to try and come up with a generative source to give them new

2:51:10.040 --> 2:51:11.040
 meaning making.

2:51:11.040 --> 2:51:16.280
 I should say meaning participating behavior.

2:51:16.280 --> 2:51:19.220
 What is evil?

2:51:19.220 --> 2:51:21.320
 Is this a word you avoid?

2:51:21.320 --> 2:51:23.880
 No, I don't.

2:51:23.880 --> 2:51:31.600
 Because I think part of what we're wrestling with here is resisting the Enlightenment,

2:51:31.600 --> 2:51:38.180
 I mean the historical period in Europe, the idea that evil and sin can just be reduced

2:51:38.180 --> 2:51:43.680
 to immorality, individual human immorality.

2:51:43.680 --> 2:51:49.240
 I think there's something deeper in the idea of sin than just immoral.

2:51:49.240 --> 2:51:53.080
 I think sin is a much more comprehensive category.

2:51:53.080 --> 2:52:01.480
 I think sin is a failure to love wisely so that you ultimately engage in a kind of idolatry.

2:52:01.480 --> 2:52:05.120
 You take something as ultimate, which is not.

2:52:05.120 --> 2:52:14.080
 And that can tend to constellate these collective agents, I call them hyperagents, within distributed

2:52:14.080 --> 2:52:21.520
 cognition that have a capacity to wreak havoc on the world that is not just due to a sort

2:52:21.520 --> 2:52:25.680
 of a sum total of immoral decisions.

2:52:25.680 --> 2:52:30.280
 This goes to Hannah Arendt's thing, and the banality of Eichmann.

2:52:30.280 --> 2:52:34.500
 She was really wrestling with it, and I think she's close to something, but I think she's

2:52:34.500 --> 2:52:35.500
 slightly off.

2:52:35.500 --> 2:52:40.920
 Eichmann is just making a whole bunch of immoral decisions, but it doesn't seem to capture

2:52:40.920 --> 2:52:46.360
 the gravity of what the Nazis did, the genocide and the warfare.

2:52:46.360 --> 2:52:51.160
 And she's right, because you're not going to get just the summation of a lot of individual

2:52:51.160 --> 2:52:55.920
 rather banal immoral choices adding up to what was going on.

2:52:55.920 --> 2:53:03.520
 You're getting a comprehensive parasitic process within massive distributed cognition that

2:53:03.520 --> 2:53:09.960
 has the power to confront the world and confront aspects of the world that individuals can't.

2:53:09.960 --> 2:53:14.520
 And I think when we're talking about evil, that's what we're trying to point to.

2:53:14.520 --> 2:53:18.200
 This is a point of convergence between me and Jonathan Paget.

2:53:18.200 --> 2:53:19.440
 We've been talking about this.

2:53:19.440 --> 2:53:21.520
 So the word sin is interesting.

2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:22.520
 Yes.

2:53:22.520 --> 2:53:23.520
 Are you comfortable using the word sin?

2:53:23.520 --> 2:53:24.520
 I'm comfortable.

2:53:24.520 --> 2:53:27.280
 Because it's so deeply rooted in religious texts.

2:53:27.280 --> 2:53:28.280
 It is.

2:53:28.280 --> 2:53:29.280
 It is.

2:53:29.280 --> 2:53:35.320
 And in part, and I struggle around this because I was brought up as a fundamentalist Christian,

2:53:35.320 --> 2:53:38.920
 and so that is still there within me.

2:53:38.920 --> 2:53:41.480
 There's trauma associated with that.

2:53:41.480 --> 2:53:45.880
 Probably layers of self deception mechanisms.

2:53:45.880 --> 2:53:46.880
 No doubt.

2:53:46.880 --> 2:53:47.880
 No doubt.

2:53:47.880 --> 2:53:48.880
 That you're slowly escaping.

2:53:48.880 --> 2:53:49.880
 Yes.

2:53:49.880 --> 2:53:50.880
 Trying to.

2:53:50.880 --> 2:53:58.320
 And trying to come into a proper respectful relationship with Christianity via a detour

2:53:58.320 --> 2:54:02.000
 through Buddhism, Taoism, and pagan Neoplatonism.

2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:04.120
 Trying to find a way how to love wisely.

2:54:04.120 --> 2:54:05.440
 Yes, exactly.

2:54:05.440 --> 2:54:14.560
 And so I think the term sin is good because somebody may not be doing something that we

2:54:14.560 --> 2:54:24.760
 would prototypically call immoral, but if they're failing to love wisely, they are disconnecting

2:54:24.760 --> 2:54:30.520
 themselves in some important way from the structures of reality.

2:54:30.520 --> 2:54:33.880
 And I think it was Hume.

2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:34.880
 I may be wrong.

2:54:34.880 --> 2:54:39.320
 Hume says, you know, people don't do things because they think it's wrong.

2:54:39.320 --> 2:54:42.600
 They do a lesser good in place of a greater good.

2:54:42.600 --> 2:54:45.440
 And that's a different thing than being immoral.

2:54:45.440 --> 2:54:48.240
 Immoral, we're saying, you're doing something that's wrong.

2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:51.920
 It's like, well, no, no, you know, I'm loving my wife.

2:54:51.920 --> 2:54:53.920
 That's a great thing, isn't it?

2:54:53.920 --> 2:54:54.920
 Yeah.

2:54:54.920 --> 2:55:00.360
 But if you love your wife at the expense of your kids, like, wow, maybe something's going

2:55:00.360 --> 2:55:01.360
 awry here.

2:55:01.360 --> 2:55:02.360
 Right?

2:55:02.360 --> 2:55:03.360
 Well, I love my country.

2:55:03.360 --> 2:55:04.360
 Great.

2:55:04.360 --> 2:55:09.720
 But should you love your country at the expense of your commitment to the religion you belong

2:55:09.720 --> 2:55:10.720
 to?

2:55:10.720 --> 2:55:13.720
 I mean, people should wrestle with these questions.

2:55:13.720 --> 2:55:17.280
 And I think sin is a failure to wrestle with these questions properly.

2:55:17.280 --> 2:55:18.280
 Yeah.

2:55:18.280 --> 2:55:24.960
 To be content with the choices you've made without considering, is there a greater good

2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:26.360
 that could be done?

2:55:26.360 --> 2:55:27.360
 Yeah.

2:55:27.360 --> 2:55:32.480
 Your lecture series on The Meaning Crisis puts us in dialogue in the same way as with

2:55:32.480 --> 2:55:37.640
 the podcast with a bunch of fascinating thinkers throughout history.

2:55:37.640 --> 2:55:38.640
 Yes.

2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:45.920
 For example, Paul Corbin, the man Carl Jung, Tillich, Barfield, is there, can you describe,

2:55:45.920 --> 2:55:53.160
 this might be challenging, but one powerful idea from each that jumps to mind?

2:55:53.160 --> 2:55:54.160
 Yes.

2:55:54.160 --> 2:55:55.160
 Maybe Heidegger?

2:55:55.160 --> 2:56:02.260
 So for Heidegger, one real powerful idea that has had a huge influence on me, he's had a

2:56:02.260 --> 2:56:04.200
 huge influence on me in many ways.

2:56:04.200 --> 2:56:07.280
 He's a big influence on what's called 4E Cognitive Science.

2:56:07.280 --> 2:56:12.960
 And this whole idea about the nonpropositional, that was deeply afforded by Heidegger and

2:56:12.960 --> 2:56:13.960
 Marla Ponti.

2:56:13.960 --> 2:56:19.400
 But I guess maybe the one idea, if I had to pick one, is his critique of ontotheology,

2:56:19.400 --> 2:56:24.480
 his critique of the attempt to understand being in terms of a supreme being, something

2:56:24.480 --> 2:56:30.520
 like that, and how that gets us fundamentally messed up and we get disconnected from being

2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:33.280
 because we are overfocused on particular beings.

2:56:33.280 --> 2:56:34.920
 We're failing to love wisely.

2:56:34.920 --> 2:56:39.240
 We're loving the individual things and we're not loving the ground from which they spring.

2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:42.300
 Can you explain that a little more?

2:56:42.300 --> 2:56:45.560
 What's the difference between the being and the supreme being and why that gets us into

2:56:45.560 --> 2:56:46.560
 trouble?

2:56:46.560 --> 2:56:47.560
 Okay.

2:56:47.560 --> 2:56:51.460
 So, well, we talked about this before, the supreme being is a particular being, whereas

2:56:51.460 --> 2:56:52.860
 being is no thing.

2:56:52.860 --> 2:56:54.700
 It's not any particular kind of thing.

2:56:54.700 --> 2:57:00.500
 And so if you're thinking of being as a being, you're thinking of it in a thingy way about

2:57:00.500 --> 2:57:03.040
 something that is fundamentally no thingness.

2:57:03.040 --> 2:57:08.380
 And so then you're disconnecting yourself from presumably ultimate reality.

2:57:08.380 --> 2:57:10.560
 This takes me to Tillich.

2:57:10.560 --> 2:57:18.520
 Tillich's great idea is understanding faith as ultimate concern rather than a set of propositions

2:57:18.520 --> 2:57:20.520
 that you're asserting, right?

2:57:20.520 --> 2:57:25.200
 So what are you ultimately concerned about?

2:57:25.200 --> 2:57:31.800
 What do you want to be in right relationship to, ratio religio?

2:57:31.800 --> 2:57:34.020
 And is that ultimate?

2:57:34.020 --> 2:57:36.440
 Is that the ultimate reality that you conceive of?

2:57:36.440 --> 2:57:38.920
 Are those two things in sync?

2:57:38.920 --> 2:57:44.480
 This has had a profound influence on me and I think it's a brilliant idea.

2:57:44.480 --> 2:57:49.260
 So some of the others, how do they integrate?

2:57:49.260 --> 2:57:54.120
 Maybe this is Carl Jung and Freud.

2:57:54.120 --> 2:57:55.320
 Which team are you on?

2:57:55.320 --> 2:57:57.040
 I'm on Jung.

2:57:57.040 --> 2:58:02.980
 Freud is the better writer, but Jung has, I think, a model of the psyche that is closer

2:58:02.980 --> 2:58:06.000
 to where cognitive science is heading.

2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:07.680
 He's more prescient.

2:58:07.680 --> 2:58:09.480
 Which aspect of his model of the psyche?

2:58:09.480 --> 2:58:10.480
 Directly.

2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:11.560
 So Freud has a hydraulic model.

2:58:11.560 --> 2:58:13.080
 The psyche is like a steam engine.

2:58:13.080 --> 2:58:16.400
 Things are under pressure and there's a fluid that's moving around.

2:58:16.400 --> 2:58:19.760
 It's like, like this is a record note of this.

2:58:19.760 --> 2:58:21.800
 Jung has an organic model.

2:58:21.800 --> 2:58:24.120
 The psyche is like a living being.

2:58:24.120 --> 2:58:26.480
 It's doing all this opponent processing.

2:58:26.480 --> 2:58:30.920
 It's doing all of this self transcending and growing.

2:58:30.920 --> 2:58:37.120
 And I think that's a much better model of the psyche than the sort of steam engine model.

2:58:37.120 --> 2:58:41.120
 What do you think about their view of the subconscious mind?

2:58:41.120 --> 2:58:47.760
 What do you think their view and your own view of what's going on there in the shadow?

2:58:47.760 --> 2:58:53.680
 So all bad stuff, some good stuff, any stuff at all?

2:58:53.680 --> 2:59:00.240
 Well, I mean, both Freud and Jung are only talking about the psychodynamic unconscious,

2:59:00.240 --> 2:59:02.520
 which is only a small part of the unconscious.

2:59:02.520 --> 2:59:05.160
 Can you elaborate on the psychodynamic?

2:59:05.160 --> 2:59:12.800
 They're talking about the aspects of the unconscious that have to do with your sort of ego development

2:59:12.800 --> 2:59:16.960
 and how you are understanding and interpreting yourself.

2:59:16.960 --> 2:59:17.960
 Yeah.

2:59:17.960 --> 2:59:19.640
 What else is there?

2:59:19.640 --> 2:59:23.280
 There's the unconscious that allows you to turn the noise coming out of my face hole

2:59:23.280 --> 2:59:25.000
 into ideas.

2:59:25.000 --> 2:59:31.200
 There's the unconscious that says, yeah, all that stuff, which is huge and powerful.

2:59:31.200 --> 2:59:33.240
 And they didn't think about that.

2:59:33.240 --> 2:59:37.400
 They're focused on the big romantic stuff that you have to deal with through psychotherapy,

2:59:37.400 --> 2:59:38.560
 that kind of stuff.

2:59:38.560 --> 2:59:39.760
 Which is relevant and important.

2:59:39.760 --> 2:59:40.760
 I'm not dismissing.

2:59:40.760 --> 2:59:44.080
 I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but it's certainly not all of the unconscious.

2:59:44.080 --> 2:59:50.000
 A lot of work that's going on, my colleague and deep friend, Anderson Todd is about, can

2:59:50.000 --> 2:59:54.160
 we take the Jungian stuff and the cognitive science stuff and can we integrate it together

2:59:54.160 --> 2:59:55.440
 theoretically?

2:59:55.440 --> 2:59:59.320
 And so he's working on that, exactly that project.

2:59:59.320 --> 3:00:02.360
 But nevertheless, your sense is there is a subconscious.

3:00:02.360 --> 3:00:03.360
 Or at least an unconscious.

3:00:03.360 --> 3:00:05.200
 I like the term unconscious.

3:00:05.200 --> 3:00:09.960
 And Jung continually reminded people that the unconscious is unconscious, that we're

3:00:09.960 --> 3:00:11.680
 not conscious of it.

3:00:11.680 --> 3:00:13.160
 And that's its fundamental property.

3:00:13.160 --> 3:00:21.200
 Yeah, and then isn't the task of therapy then to bring, to make the unconscious conscious?

3:00:21.200 --> 3:00:23.560
 Yeah, to a degree, right?

3:00:23.560 --> 3:00:31.680
 But also, I mean, yeah, to bring consciousness where there was unconscious is part of Jung's

3:00:31.680 --> 3:00:32.800
 mythos.

3:00:32.800 --> 3:00:36.680
 But it's also not the thought that that can be completed.

3:00:36.680 --> 3:00:41.840
 Part of why you're extending the reach of the conscious mind is it so it can enter into

3:00:41.840 --> 3:00:48.360
 a more proper dialogical relationship with the self organizing system of the unconscious

3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:49.360
 mind.

3:00:49.360 --> 3:00:53.200
 What did they have to say about the motivations of humans?

3:00:53.200 --> 3:00:59.400
 So for Freud, jokingly, I said, you know, sex, so much of our mind is developed in our

3:00:59.400 --> 3:01:07.160
 young age, sexual interactions with the world or whatever, hence the thing about the edible

3:01:07.160 --> 3:01:12.180
 complex and all, you know, I wanted to have sex with your mother.

3:01:12.180 --> 3:01:16.320
 What do you think about their description about what motivates humans?

3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:22.520
 And what do you think about the will to power from Nietzsche?

3:01:22.520 --> 3:01:24.120
 Which camp are you in there?

3:01:24.120 --> 3:01:27.440
 What motivates humans?

3:01:27.440 --> 3:01:28.980
 Sex or power?

3:01:28.980 --> 3:01:30.760
 I think Plato is right.

3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:33.360
 And I think there's a connection for me.

3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:36.840
 Plato's my first philosopher, Jung's my first psychologist, and Jung is very much the Plato

3:01:36.840 --> 3:01:37.840
 of the psyche.

3:01:37.840 --> 3:01:38.840
 You never forget your first.

3:01:38.840 --> 3:01:39.840
 Yeah.

3:01:39.840 --> 3:01:40.840
 You never do.

3:01:40.840 --> 3:01:41.840
 You never do.

3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:50.040
 And I think we have, I reject the monological mind, I reject the monophasic mind model.

3:01:50.040 --> 3:01:51.720
 I think we are multi centered.

3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:57.180
 I think we have different centers of motivation that operate according to different principles

3:01:57.180 --> 3:02:05.760
 to satisfy different problems, and that part of the task of our humanity is to get those

3:02:05.760 --> 3:02:14.320
 different centers into some internal culture by which they are optimally cooperating rather

3:02:14.320 --> 3:02:18.400
 than in conflict with each other.

3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:22.880
 What advice would you give to young people today?

3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:25.960
 They're in high school trying to figure out what they're going to do with their life.

3:02:25.960 --> 3:02:28.120
 Maybe they're in college.

3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:32.720
 What advice would you give how to have a career they can be proud of or how to have a life

3:02:32.720 --> 3:02:37.800
 they can be proud of?

3:02:37.800 --> 3:02:48.040
 So the first thing is find an ecology of practices and a community that supports them without

3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:54.800
 involving you in believing things that contravene our best understood science so that wisdom

3:02:54.800 --> 3:03:02.120
 and virtue, especially how they show up in relationships, are primary to you.

3:03:02.120 --> 3:03:09.500
 This will sound ridiculous, but if you take care of that, the other things you want are

3:03:09.500 --> 3:03:11.000
 more likely to occur.

3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:22.900
 Because what you want at when you're approaching your death is what were the relationships

3:03:22.900 --> 3:03:27.480
 you cultivated to yourself, to other people, to the world, and what did you do to improve

3:03:27.480 --> 3:03:33.560
 the chance of them being deep and profound relationships?

3:03:33.560 --> 3:03:38.520
 That's an interesting ecology of practice, finding a place where a lot of people are

3:03:38.520 --> 3:03:43.760
 doing different things that are interesting interplay with each other, but at the same

3:03:43.760 --> 3:03:49.520
 time is not a cult where ideas can flourish.

3:03:49.520 --> 3:03:53.600
 How the hell do you know?

3:03:53.600 --> 3:03:59.120
 Because in a place where people are really excited about doing stuff, that's very ripe

3:03:59.120 --> 3:04:01.040
 for cult formation.

3:04:01.040 --> 3:04:05.920
 Especially if they're awash in a culture in which we have ever expanding waves of bullshit.

3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:07.800
 Yes, precisely.

3:04:07.800 --> 3:04:08.800
 So...

3:04:08.800 --> 3:04:11.040
 Try to keep away from the bullshit is the advice.

3:04:11.040 --> 3:04:12.040
 Yes.

3:04:12.040 --> 3:04:16.560
 No, I mean, I take this very seriously and I was with a bunch of people in Vermont at

3:04:16.560 --> 3:04:22.860
 the respond retreat, people, Rafe Kelly was there, a bunch of people who have set up ecologies

3:04:22.860 --> 3:04:27.120
 of practices and created communities.

3:04:27.120 --> 3:04:31.960
 And I have good reason to find all of these people trustworthy.

3:04:31.960 --> 3:04:39.480
 And so we gathered together to try and generate real dialogos, flow in distributed cognition,

3:04:39.480 --> 3:04:44.400
 exercise the collective intelligence, and try and address that problem, both in terms

3:04:44.400 --> 3:04:51.960
 of metachurriculum that we can offer emerging communities, in terms of practices of vetting,

3:04:51.960 --> 3:04:58.960
 how we will self govern the federation we're forming so that we can resist gurufication.

3:04:58.960 --> 3:05:00.600
 Gurufication of people or ideas?

3:05:00.600 --> 3:05:01.600
 Both.

3:05:01.600 --> 3:05:02.600
 Yeah.

3:05:02.600 --> 3:05:03.600
 Both.

3:05:03.600 --> 3:05:04.600
 Some of us just get unlucky.

3:05:04.600 --> 3:05:11.480
 Some of us get unlucky and we all at respond, we all had a tremendous sense of urgency around

3:05:11.480 --> 3:05:18.040
 this, but we were trying to balance it about not being premature, but there was going to,

3:05:18.040 --> 3:05:22.680
 I mean, we're going to produce a metachurriculum that's coming in months, there's going to

3:05:22.680 --> 3:05:27.880
 be a scientific paper about integrating the scientific work on wisdom with this practitioner

3:05:27.880 --> 3:05:34.480
 based ideas about the cultivation of wisdom, there's going to be projects about how we

3:05:34.480 --> 3:05:41.880
 can create a self correcting vetting system so we can say to people, we think this ecology

3:05:41.880 --> 3:05:47.160
 is legit, it's in good fellowship with all these other legit ecologies, we don't know

3:05:47.160 --> 3:05:51.880
 about that one, we're hesitant about that one, it's not in good fellowship, we have

3:05:51.880 --> 3:05:55.020
 concerns, here's why we have our concerns, et cetera.

3:05:55.020 --> 3:05:56.940
 And you may say, well, who are you to do that?

3:05:56.940 --> 3:06:00.160
 It's like nobody, but somebody's got to do it, right?

3:06:00.160 --> 3:06:04.180
 And that's what it comes down to, and so we're going to give it our best effort.

3:06:04.180 --> 3:06:06.520
 It's worth a try.

3:06:06.520 --> 3:06:17.200
 You talked about the meaning crisis in human civilization, but in your own personal life,

3:06:17.200 --> 3:06:20.600
 what has been a dark place you've ever gone in your mind?

3:06:20.600 --> 3:06:24.520
 Has there been difficult times in your life where you've really struggled?

3:06:24.520 --> 3:06:25.520
 Yes.

3:06:25.520 --> 3:06:34.920
 So when I left fundamentalist Christianity, and for a while I was just sort of a hard

3:06:34.920 --> 3:06:43.960
 bitten atheist, the problem with leaving the belief structure was that I didn't deal with

3:06:43.960 --> 3:06:50.280
 all the nonpropositional things that had gotten into me, all the procedures and habits and

3:06:50.280 --> 3:06:55.040
 all the perspectives and all the identities and the trauma associated with that.

3:06:55.040 --> 3:07:01.720
 So I required therapy, it required years of meditation and Tai Chi, and I'm still wrestling

3:07:01.720 --> 3:07:12.560
 with it, but for the first four or five years, I would... I described it like this, I called

3:07:12.560 --> 3:07:13.560
 it the black burning.

3:07:13.560 --> 3:07:19.960
 I felt like there was a blackness that was on fire inside of me, precisely because the

3:07:19.960 --> 3:07:24.660
 religion had left a taste for the transcendent in my mouth, but it had... The food it had

3:07:24.660 --> 3:07:29.760
 given me, food in square quotes, had soured in my stomach and made me nauseous, and the

3:07:29.760 --> 3:07:36.500
 juxtaposition of those seemed like an irresolvable problem for me.

3:07:36.500 --> 3:07:38.600
 That was a very, very dark time for me.

3:07:38.600 --> 3:07:41.720
 Did it feel lonely?

3:07:41.720 --> 3:07:48.860
 When it was very bad, it felt extremely lonely and deeply alienating.

3:07:48.860 --> 3:07:53.680
 The universe seemed absurd, and there was also existential anxiety.

3:07:53.680 --> 3:07:55.480
 I talk about these things for a reason.

3:07:55.480 --> 3:07:57.880
 I don't just talk about them as things I'm pointing to.

3:07:57.880 --> 3:08:04.080
 I'm talking about them as seeing in myself and in people I care, having undergone them

3:08:04.080 --> 3:08:12.480
 and how they can bring you close to self destructive... I started engaging in kinds of self destructive

3:08:12.480 --> 3:08:13.480
 behavior.

3:08:13.480 --> 3:08:20.440
 So the meaning crisis to you is not just the thing you look outside and see many people

3:08:20.440 --> 3:08:21.440
 struggling.

3:08:21.440 --> 3:08:22.440
 You yourself have struggled.

3:08:22.440 --> 3:08:29.920
 But that's, in fact, the narrative, is I struggled with it, thinking it was a purely personal,

3:08:29.920 --> 3:08:30.920
 idiosyncratic thing.

3:08:30.920 --> 3:08:35.540
 I started learning the kog sai, I started doing the tai chi and the meditation, I started

3:08:35.540 --> 3:08:39.760
 doing all this Socratic philosophy.

3:08:39.760 --> 3:08:47.360
 And when I started to talk about these pieces, I saw my students eyes light up, and I realized,

3:08:47.360 --> 3:08:52.800
 wait, maybe this isn't just something I'm going through.

3:08:52.800 --> 3:08:58.840
 And talking to them and then doing the research and expanding it out, it's like, oh, many

3:08:58.840 --> 3:09:05.000
 people in a shared fashion and also in an individual lonely fashion are going through

3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:06.000
 meaning crisis.

3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:12.460
 Well, we talked a lot about wisdom and meaning, and you said that the goal is to love wisely.

3:09:12.460 --> 3:09:14.760
 So let me ask about love.

3:09:14.760 --> 3:09:18.040
 What's the role of love in the human condition?

3:09:18.040 --> 3:09:19.040
 It's central.

3:09:19.040 --> 3:09:23.300
 I mean, it's even central to reason and rationality.

3:09:23.300 --> 3:09:30.720
 This is Plato, but Spinoza, the most logical of the rationalists.

3:09:30.720 --> 3:09:36.840
 The ethics is written like Euclid's geometry, but he calls it the ethics for a reason, because

3:09:36.840 --> 3:09:38.800
 he wants to talk about the blessed life.

3:09:38.800 --> 3:09:40.360
 And what does he say?

3:09:40.360 --> 3:09:47.260
 He says that ultimately reason needs love, because love is what brings reason out of

3:09:47.260 --> 3:09:52.440
 being entrapped in the gravity well of egocentrism.

3:09:52.440 --> 3:09:57.520
 And Murdoch, Iris Murdoch said, I think really beautifully, love is when you painfully realize

3:09:57.520 --> 3:10:03.320
 that something other than yourself is real.

3:10:03.320 --> 3:10:06.680
 Escaping the gravity well of egocentrism.

3:10:06.680 --> 3:10:07.680
 Beautifully put.

3:10:07.680 --> 3:10:09.040
 A beautiful way to end it.

3:10:09.040 --> 3:10:11.200
 And you're a beautiful human being.

3:10:11.200 --> 3:10:17.660
 Thank you for struggling in your own mind with the search for meaning and encouraging

3:10:17.660 --> 3:10:19.640
 others to do the same.

3:10:19.640 --> 3:10:21.920
 And ultimately to learn how to love wisely.

3:10:21.920 --> 3:10:23.640
 Thank you so much for talking today.

3:10:23.640 --> 3:10:24.800
 It's been a great pleasure, Lex.

3:10:24.800 --> 3:10:26.160
 I really enjoyed it a lot.

3:10:26.160 --> 3:10:27.160
 Thank you so much.

3:10:27.160 --> 3:10:30.240
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jon Verweke.

3:10:30.240 --> 3:10:34.720
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:10:34.720 --> 3:10:38.600
 And now let me leave you with some words from Hermann Hesse in Siddhartha.

3:10:38.600 --> 3:10:43.400
 I've always believed, and I still believe, that whatever good or bad fortune may come

3:10:43.400 --> 3:10:49.560
 our way, we can always give it meaning and transform it into something of value.

3:10:49.560 --> 3:11:09.080
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
