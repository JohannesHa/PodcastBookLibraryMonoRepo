WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
 we would come up to these rafts and these boats

00:05.120 --> 00:09.440
 that were in really dire shape and people would be pushed off

00:09.440 --> 00:10.960
 and people would jump off

00:10.960 --> 00:13.200
 and people would fall into the water

00:13.200 --> 00:17.480
 and some of them couldn't swim.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.200
 And so we found ourselves in this moment

00:21.200 --> 00:23.040
 where we had a choice.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.240
 We could film someone drown in front of us

00:26.240 --> 00:27.960
 or we could put our cameras down

00:27.960 --> 00:30.120
 and pull them out of the water.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.240
 The following is a conversation with Sky Fitzgerald,

00:34.240 --> 00:37.120
 a two time Oscar nominated documentary filmmaker

00:37.120 --> 00:41.120
 who made the films Hunger Ward, about the war in Yemen,

00:41.120 --> 00:44.040
 Lifeboat, about the search and rescue operations

00:44.040 --> 00:45.640
 off the coast of Libya,

00:45.640 --> 00:50.640
 and 50 Feet from Syria, about the war in Syria.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.120
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.480
 in the description.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.920
 Now, dear friends, here's Sky Fitzgerald.

01:00.800 --> 01:05.520
 Nearly 811 million people worldwide are hungry today

01:05.520 --> 01:08.440
 and 45 million people are on the edge of famine

01:08.440 --> 01:10.160
 across 43 countries.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.360
 How do you feel?

01:12.360 --> 01:14.680
 How do you make sense of that many people suffering

01:14.680 --> 01:17.280
 from hunger and famine in the world today?

01:17.280 --> 01:20.080
 I don't know if I can make sense of it, Lex.

01:20.080 --> 01:25.080
 I mean, I think it's deeply disturbing to me

01:25.080 --> 01:29.120
 that as a global community, we've allowed this number

01:29.120 --> 01:34.120
 of people to go hungry when the food to feed them exists

01:34.120 --> 01:37.080
 and the resources to feed them exists.

01:37.080 --> 01:41.360
 I think the thing that disturbs me most about those figures

01:41.360 --> 01:46.360
 is that many of those who are starving today

01:46.360 --> 01:51.360
 or going hungry today are the net result of war

01:51.360 --> 01:56.040
 and intentional acts by leaders to starve entire populations.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.760
 And that's the most deeply disturbing part to me.

02:00.160 --> 02:05.160
 You know your history and we all know that deeply embedded

02:06.120 --> 02:09.560
 in the Geneva Conventions post World War II,

02:09.560 --> 02:13.280
 the intent of one of those articles was to ban the use

02:13.280 --> 02:17.480
 of starvation as a weapon of war because of what Hitler did

02:17.480 --> 02:19.600
 during World War II.

02:19.600 --> 02:23.400
 That's been reiterated multiple times over the years

02:23.400 --> 02:27.040
 in international humanitarian law, including in 2018

02:27.040 --> 02:29.800
 because of the Saudi blockade over Yemen.

02:29.800 --> 02:33.680
 And yet to this day, starvation as a weapon of war

02:33.680 --> 02:36.200
 continues to be used in Ethiopia,

02:36.200 --> 02:39.080
 obviously in Ukraine right now and in Yemen

02:39.080 --> 02:40.440
 with the blockade over the country.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.880
 And that disgusts me that the law is in place

02:43.880 --> 02:46.240
 but it won't be enforced by the international bodies

02:46.240 --> 02:47.840
 and the nation states that make up

02:47.840 --> 02:49.160
 the international community.

02:49.160 --> 02:54.160
 So when the starvation is a result of human actions,

02:55.000 --> 02:59.240
 human decisions, that it's especially painful

02:59.240 --> 03:00.520
 to make sense of.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.480
 For me personally, yeah.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.040
 I think that if you and I sit in here,

03:05.040 --> 03:10.000
 didn't eat for three days and had to lay our head

03:10.000 --> 03:12.600
 on the sidewalk for a couple nights,

03:12.600 --> 03:17.600
 I think we would take hunger and homelessness

03:17.600 --> 03:19.160
 a lot more seriously.

03:19.160 --> 03:22.240
 And I think that's, for some reason,

03:22.240 --> 03:25.560
 that's missing at this moment in history, tragically.

03:25.560 --> 03:29.240
 And I think until that we can generate enough empathy,

03:30.120 --> 03:32.360
 that's immediate for all of us to understand

03:32.360 --> 03:34.080
 what that means to go hungry.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.480
 I'm not sure we're gonna sort of marshal

03:36.480 --> 03:39.480
 the global community to solve it.

03:39.480 --> 03:44.480
 I did just that by the way, fasted for three days recently.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.360
 It was fundamentally different, I think,

03:47.360 --> 03:51.840
 because the thing that would be terrifying to me

03:51.840 --> 03:54.040
 is not the fasting, but the hopelessness

03:54.040 --> 03:55.400
 at the end of the fasting.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.880
 Like I wouldn't know when the next meal is coming.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.360
 I always had the freedom to have the meal.

04:01.360 --> 04:06.360
 The fear, not just your own ability to eat and survive,

04:06.960 --> 04:07.800
 but your family's.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.400
 If there's loved ones, that's the other thing I don't have.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.520
 I'm single.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.800
 So I feel like the worst suffering

04:14.800 --> 04:17.520
 is watching somebody you love

04:17.520 --> 04:20.040
 that you're supposed to be a caretaker of

04:20.040 --> 04:21.720
 and you can't take care of them.

04:23.960 --> 04:27.160
 And if all of that is caused by leaders

04:30.640 --> 04:35.520
 as a weapon of war, that is especially painful.

04:35.520 --> 04:39.720
 So how can we help?

04:41.360 --> 04:42.760
 What are the ways to help?

04:42.760 --> 04:46.440
 How do we alleviate this suffering?

04:48.360 --> 04:52.800
 Well, I think on the humanitarian front,

04:52.800 --> 04:56.520
 we have to be aggressive and attentive

04:56.520 --> 04:59.240
 and intervene in significant ways.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.720
 And I think on the political front,

05:01.720 --> 05:06.600
 we have to hold players accountable for their actions.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.320
 So the leaders that start the war.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.360
 So when you say we have to speak up

05:10.360 --> 05:14.160
 about the decisions and the humans making those decisions

05:14.160 --> 05:15.520
 that lead to the starvation.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.160
 For example, let's make it concrete.

05:17.160 --> 05:20.200
 So when I was, I don't wanna jump ahead,

05:20.200 --> 05:22.520
 but when I was filming Hunger Ward in Yemen,

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
 I met a mother who, when she gave birth, weighed 70 pounds.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.440
 The mother weighed 70 pounds.

05:34.440 --> 05:39.440
 And so her daughter was starved in the womb.

05:42.400 --> 05:46.560
 When she was born, she was born into a world

05:46.560 --> 05:50.120
 with no breast milk, very little formula.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.360
 So she was starved before birth.

05:52.360 --> 05:56.640
 She was born into a world where she continued to be starved

05:56.640 --> 06:00.000
 by a mother who herself was starved.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
 I watched that child, her name is Asila, die in front of me.

06:05.840 --> 06:10.720
 Asila had no chance for all those things we hope for,

06:10.720 --> 06:12.560
 for a child in this world.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.400
 She didn't have a chance to grow up.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.760
 She didn't have a chance to discover love.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.040
 She didn't have a chance to have a career.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.200
 She was robbed of all of those things

06:22.200 --> 06:24.440
 because of the insidious nature of hunger

06:24.440 --> 06:26.320
 that she was born into.

06:26.320 --> 06:31.320
 She didn't have to die, she was not starving.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.840
 Her mother was being starved

06:34.840 --> 06:37.040
 because of the blockade over the country.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.840
 Now, who instituted that blockade?

06:39.760 --> 06:43.880
 MBS in Saudi Arabia with the reinforcement

06:43.880 --> 06:46.400
 and sort of tacit approval of the United States,

06:46.400 --> 06:48.520
 our own government here.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.360
 And so there are people who are responsible

06:51.360 --> 06:52.800
 for the starvation of children

06:52.800 --> 06:55.520
 and I think we need to hold them accountable.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.520
 Now, that's incredibly difficult to do,

06:58.520 --> 07:00.200
 but just because it's difficult

07:00.200 --> 07:02.480
 doesn't mean it ought not to be done.

07:03.320 --> 07:06.840
 And we'll talk about many cases like these

07:06.840 --> 07:08.960
 throughout history and going on today.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.440
 Let's talk about Hunger Ward.

07:10.440 --> 07:11.280
 Let's dive in.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.840
 You've been nominated for an Oscar twice.

07:14.840 --> 07:19.440
 This is one of the times for a documentary.

07:21.080 --> 07:24.160
 Can you please tell me what Hunger Ward,

07:24.160 --> 07:27.360
 The Last Hope Between War and Starvation is about?

07:27.360 --> 07:29.560
 Hunger Ward is a short documentary

07:31.080 --> 07:34.640
 that really is an attempt to illustrate

07:34.640 --> 07:38.240
 the effects of the conflict on Yemen,

07:38.240 --> 07:40.200
 specifically on civilians.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.720
 And we document it in both the north

07:43.720 --> 07:44.720
 and the south of the country

07:44.720 --> 07:46.680
 because it's a bifurcated country.

07:46.680 --> 07:50.240
 The south is held by the globally recognized government

07:50.240 --> 07:52.320
 in the south, which up until last week

07:52.320 --> 07:56.200
 was run by, at least on the surface,

07:56.200 --> 08:00.040
 by President Hadi holed up in Riyadh.

08:00.040 --> 08:05.040
 He was essentially removed from office last week

08:05.120 --> 08:08.360
 by, most people would agree,

08:08.360 --> 08:10.400
 the Emiratis and the Saudis

08:10.400 --> 08:12.640
 to put in place a presidential council.

08:12.640 --> 08:16.400
 So we wanted to show that starvation was happening

08:16.400 --> 08:19.680
 in very similar fashions, both in the south and the north.

08:19.680 --> 08:22.400
 And we wanted to do this film

08:22.400 --> 08:26.040
 because so few people in the west

08:26.040 --> 08:29.000
 know anything about the conflict in Yemen,

08:29.000 --> 08:32.640
 nor the US's complicity in it.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.240
 And so my intent with the project

08:34.240 --> 08:36.680
 was try to bring it to a larger western audience

08:36.680 --> 08:38.360
 as an attempt to intervene

08:38.360 --> 08:40.120
 and change the political status quo,

08:40.120 --> 08:44.560
 which allows the use of starvation in Yemen to continue.

08:44.560 --> 08:49.160
 So US complicity, who are the bad guys?

08:49.160 --> 08:52.480
 Now, the world, unfortunately,

08:52.480 --> 08:54.400
 cannot be painted in black and white

08:54.400 --> 08:56.640
 of good guys and bad guys.

08:56.640 --> 08:59.640
 But for the purpose of conversation,

08:59.640 --> 09:04.640
 who is causing suffering in the world in this situation?

09:06.160 --> 09:07.320
 Who started the war?

09:07.320 --> 09:08.160
 Why?

09:09.480 --> 09:14.280
 And then, of course, the roots of war go back in history.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.560
 But let's start at the top.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.640
 Well, there are bad actors and there are less bad actors.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.840
 I mean, I think that's always the case in war, probably.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.520
 And everybody loses in war.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.080
 Yeah, I concur with that statement.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.080
 In the case of the status quo in Yemen right now,

09:33.080 --> 09:35.960
 it's a completely asymmetrical war.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.080
 And so the Saudi coalition,

09:38.080 --> 09:41.280
 which is made up of primarily Saudi Arabia,

09:41.280 --> 09:46.280
 the Emiratis, United States, France, Britain,

09:46.280 --> 09:49.280
 supplying weapons, but it's really driven

09:49.280 --> 09:51.360
 and catalyzed by Saudi Arabia.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.880
 And it's asymmetrical to a great extent

09:54.880 --> 09:58.680
 just because of the incredible firepower by air

09:58.680 --> 10:03.680
 that the Saudis use continuously to pummel Northern Yemen.

10:04.720 --> 10:08.960
 When I was there, the sheer volume of airstrikes

10:08.960 --> 10:10.680
 is hard to describe.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.840
 And we show the result of only one in the film, really.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.200
 But it's an asymmetrical war.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.520
 The de facto authorities of the North,

10:18.520 --> 10:21.000
 Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthi rebel group,

10:23.400 --> 10:25.080
 they don't have an air force, right?

10:25.080 --> 10:27.600
 They have a drone force, but they don't have an air force.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.800
 And so from a military standpoint,

10:29.800 --> 10:31.760
 it's completely asymmetrical.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.560
 The Saudis really don't commit troops to the ground.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.080
 They use only proxies to fight on the ground.

10:37.080 --> 10:42.080
 What is the narrative they use to justify war?

10:42.080 --> 10:46.320
 So there's a story on every side in war.

10:46.320 --> 10:49.040
 Some of it is grounded in truth.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.040
 Some of it is not at all grounded in truth,

10:52.040 --> 10:54.040
 also known as propaganda.

10:54.040 --> 10:57.600
 What's the narrative used by the Saudis for this war?

10:58.440 --> 11:01.720
 The Saudi line is essentially that the Houthis

11:01.720 --> 11:03.240
 are an illegitimate government,

11:04.400 --> 11:08.680
 and that it's really a proxy war between Iran,

11:08.680 --> 11:10.640
 who supports the Houthis nominally,

11:10.640 --> 11:12.280
 and the rest of the world.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.000
 That's the Saudi narrative.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.320
 The reality is something altogether different.

11:16.320 --> 11:19.600
 While the Houthis do receive support from Iran,

11:19.600 --> 11:24.600
 this is a war started by and sustained by MBS in Saudi Arabia.

11:25.000 --> 11:25.840
 Who's MBS?

11:25.840 --> 11:27.400
 Mohammed bin Salman.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.240
 And who is he?

11:28.240 --> 11:32.200
 He is the son of the ruler of Saudi Arabia.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.720
 What's his power?

11:33.720 --> 11:35.720
 I'm asking basic dumb questions.

11:35.720 --> 11:37.360
 He's the de facto ruler.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.040
 Of the military and the...

11:39.040 --> 11:42.800
 Yes, he seized control of the country several years ago,

11:42.800 --> 11:44.560
 even though he, on the surface,

11:44.560 --> 11:46.720
 is not the ruler of Saudi Arabia, he is.

11:46.720 --> 11:47.560
 He's the crown prince.

11:47.560 --> 11:52.560
 I'm sorry to interrupt often, but who is he as a man?

11:52.680 --> 11:53.520
 What's your sense of the...

11:53.520 --> 11:55.440
 Yeah, so I've never met him,

11:55.440 --> 11:58.480
 and I likely will never meet him, hopefully.

11:59.880 --> 12:03.480
 But he is, I know a lot about him through his actions,

12:03.480 --> 12:05.400
 sort of in the MENA region,

12:05.400 --> 12:07.880
 Middle East and North Africa region.

12:07.880 --> 12:12.320
 And he is one of three, in my view,

12:12.320 --> 12:14.720
 as an American sitting here in the US,

12:14.720 --> 12:18.400
 three people in the world that I think

12:18.400 --> 12:23.280
 has caused such an incredible volume of misery

12:23.280 --> 12:27.040
 and suffering and murder on this planet

12:27.040 --> 12:32.040
 that I think if he weren't around,

12:33.720 --> 12:35.320
 the world would be a lot better place.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.480
 And I'm not a violent person by nature,

12:37.480 --> 12:39.120
 but there are three human beings

12:39.120 --> 12:42.680
 that I think the world would be better off without.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.360
 Do you mind, before I ask other questions,

12:45.360 --> 12:46.800
 mentioning the three?

12:46.800 --> 12:49.920
 Oh, yeah, Assad is one in Syria,

12:49.920 --> 12:51.800
 and that comes out of an earlier project

12:51.800 --> 12:54.000
 that I did in Syria and Turkey,

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
 and what I saw Assad as a ruler do to his own people.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.520
 And Putin would be the third.

13:03.520 --> 13:08.520
 Those three human beings are murderers on a scale

13:08.680 --> 13:11.600
 beyond imagining.

13:11.600 --> 13:16.120
 On MBS, are you able to think as a documentary filmmaker,

13:16.120 --> 13:19.040
 as a human being, as a scholar, as a thinker,

13:19.040 --> 13:22.040
 with an open mind about a man like that

13:22.040 --> 13:23.760
 who does evil onto the world,

13:23.760 --> 13:25.960
 and what that must feel like

13:25.960 --> 13:28.040
 to be inside the mind of that man?

13:28.040 --> 13:31.720
 So basically, consider his worldview.

13:31.720 --> 13:35.280
 With most evil people, with all people, probably,

13:35.280 --> 13:37.960
 but with people who do evil onto the world,

13:37.960 --> 13:40.160
 they think they're doing good.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.560
 They're the hero of their own story.

13:41.560 --> 13:45.120
 Right, and so to be able to place yourself,

13:45.120 --> 13:47.840
 I feel like, for me, to understand a person,

13:47.840 --> 13:51.160
 I have to literally, like the way actors

13:51.160 --> 13:54.200
 kind of have to do, you know,

13:54.200 --> 13:57.200
 live inside the body of the person they're trying to study.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.120
 Inhabit the character.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.600
 Inhabit the person.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.480
 So are you able to do that, or because you

14:03.600 --> 14:06.600
 are also studying the people who suffer

14:06.600 --> 14:10.000
 as a result, as a consequence of their actions,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.040
 you just, you put them in a box,

14:13.040 --> 14:15.160
 and you say, I hate the person in that box.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.840
 I'm going to move on.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.680
 This goes back to your black and white statement

14:19.680 --> 14:20.680
 at the beginning, right?

14:20.680 --> 14:23.920
 It's like, the world as a whole, of course,

14:23.920 --> 14:26.920
 you know, is every gradation of gray, right?

14:26.920 --> 14:29.040
 My background is theater, Lex,

14:29.040 --> 14:32.400
 and so I was trained long before I picked up a camera

14:32.400 --> 14:34.200
 to inhabit other characters, right?

14:34.200 --> 14:36.160
 I have two degrees in theater,

14:36.160 --> 14:38.520
 and so that level of sort of like

14:38.520 --> 14:40.160
 walking in other people's shoes

14:40.160 --> 14:42.280
 and trying to understand and empathize

14:42.280 --> 14:45.120
 with their worldview is fundamental

14:45.120 --> 14:47.960
 to how I live my life and how I do my work.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.160
 So in the case of those three that I named,

14:50.160 --> 14:53.520
 Assad, MBS, and Putin, yeah, I can go there

14:53.520 --> 14:55.600
 and think through how they came to be,

14:55.600 --> 14:59.360
 who they are, right, from afar, right?

14:59.360 --> 15:01.880
 And after I go through that process,

15:02.720 --> 15:04.920
 I still don't think there's any way

15:04.920 --> 15:08.520
 that one can justify what they've done.

15:10.040 --> 15:14.440
 We're going to talk about each of those people, for sure.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.960
 Well, I'm not an expert on any of them.

15:16.960 --> 15:17.920
 Well, you're a human being,

15:17.920 --> 15:22.920
 which makes you a partial expert on human nature

15:23.280 --> 15:24.400
 because nobody's an expert.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.360
 You're just as good as anyone else.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.680
 Anybody who actually carries a camera

15:28.680 --> 15:31.640
 and listens and observe others

15:31.640 --> 15:34.160
 isn't especially an expert of human nature.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.560
 Who's willing to take that leap

15:37.560 --> 15:41.320
 and truly understand somebody of any level, not leaders.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.640
 I feel like to understand a leader,

15:42.640 --> 15:45.040
 you have to first understand humans,

15:45.040 --> 15:47.160
 and to understand humans, you have to see humans

15:47.160 --> 15:49.240
 at their worst and their best,

15:49.240 --> 15:52.280
 which is something that you've definitely done.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.440
 So let's stick on Hunger Ward.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.880
 This lens that you've chosen to look at this

15:56.880 --> 16:00.560
 is through a single, maybe you can speak to that.

16:00.560 --> 16:05.560
 You've mentioned the starvation as a result of war.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.480
 What is the documentary?

16:08.480 --> 16:10.000
 Like, what is the lens you've chosen

16:10.000 --> 16:14.600
 to give the world a peek at the results,

16:14.600 --> 16:17.000
 at the suffering that's a result of this war?

16:18.120 --> 16:19.760
 People a lot of times will ask me

16:19.760 --> 16:22.520
 if they've seen Hunger Ward, you know.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.760
 They ask where the hope is, right?

16:26.760 --> 16:30.720
 You read the byline earlier, The Lost Hope.

16:32.320 --> 16:37.320
 And what I try to focus on in many of my films,

16:37.440 --> 16:42.440
 including Hunger Ward, is in the very difficult context

16:42.720 --> 16:47.760
 of war, as the case is in Hunger Ward in Yemen,

16:47.760 --> 16:50.360
 I look for hope, and I look for inspiration,

16:50.360 --> 16:54.280
 and I do that through people who are doing incredible things

16:54.280 --> 16:56.720
 under the most difficult circumstances.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.760
 So when I set out to do a film

16:59.760 --> 17:04.080
 about starvation in Yemen, right?

17:04.080 --> 17:06.240
 I mean, just listen to that statement.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.000
 Where's the hope there, right?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.480
 And yet what I found, what I discovered,

17:11.480 --> 17:14.320
 were human beings that we could tell the story through

17:14.320 --> 17:18.000
 who are incredible, inspirational human beings

17:18.000 --> 17:20.960
 doing amazing things every day.

17:20.960 --> 17:24.880
 One of those is Makiya Maji, a nurse practitioner

17:24.880 --> 17:27.400
 in the north of the country at a small rural clinic.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.040
 And another is Dr. Aida Al Sadiq,

17:30.040 --> 17:33.040
 who's a pediatrician in the south of the country.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.720
 And so we chose to tell the story

17:34.720 --> 17:38.360
 sort of through their experiences as caregivers,

17:38.360 --> 17:43.360
 devoting their lives to try to save this entire cohort,

17:43.360 --> 17:45.760
 this entire generation of children

17:45.760 --> 17:48.760
 that has been born into starvation.

17:48.760 --> 17:52.040
 And that's an incredible, difficult task,

17:52.040 --> 17:56.480
 but equally inspirational to watch these human beings

17:56.480 --> 18:00.400
 devote every minute of every day to save a child.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.200
 I mean, in my view,

18:02.200 --> 18:04.400
 nothing is more important than that action.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.120
 Maybe on that point, real quick.

18:07.560 --> 18:11.400
 So there is suffering at scale, starvation at scale.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.520
 There's, I mean, the numbers,

18:15.680 --> 18:17.080
 maybe you can mention in Yemen,

18:17.080 --> 18:19.400
 what are the numbers in terms of people in starvation,

18:19.400 --> 18:24.200
 but from a perspective of a nurse practitioner or a doctor,

18:24.200 --> 18:27.200
 you always have, you're treating one person in front of you.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.360
 So how do you make sense of that calculus,

18:31.360 --> 18:35.120
 of like there's a huge number of people suffering,

18:35.120 --> 18:37.560
 and then there's just the person in front of you?

18:37.560 --> 18:42.560
 Is that all we can do as humans,

18:43.160 --> 18:45.440
 is just to help one person at a time?

18:45.440 --> 18:49.480
 Is that the right way to think and to approach these problems

18:49.480 --> 18:52.760
 or can you actually make sense of the numbers?

18:52.760 --> 18:55.000
 Speaking just as a human being,

18:55.000 --> 18:58.560
 I think the scale of suffering is so great in Yemen

18:58.560 --> 19:06.960
 that I think I'd be overwhelmed if I focused on that scale.

19:06.960 --> 19:11.120
 You've probably heard that a child dies

19:11.120 --> 19:14.800
 every 75 seconds in Yemen from hunger.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.920
 So we've been sitting here, how long?

19:16.920 --> 19:18.440
 35 minutes or so.

19:19.680 --> 19:20.920
 That's a good handful of children

19:20.920 --> 19:23.080
 that have already passed away.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.120
 So to overcome sort of, I think,

19:25.120 --> 19:28.600
 that danger of psychic numbing, which can happen

19:28.600 --> 19:32.120
 when you think about suffering on such a large scale,

19:32.120 --> 19:34.800
 as a filmmaker, as a human being,

19:34.800 --> 19:36.680
 I have to focus in on the individuals,

19:36.680 --> 19:38.840
 on those human beings in front of me.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.840
 And I think that's exactly what Dr. Al Sadiq and Makiya do

19:41.840 --> 19:43.480
 to keep going each day.

19:43.480 --> 19:44.840
 And one of the amazing things

19:44.840 --> 19:47.840
 about these two healthcare providers

19:47.840 --> 19:50.200
 that we showcased in the film is that

19:50.200 --> 19:53.800
 they treat anyone who shows up, right?

19:53.800 --> 19:55.840
 They don't have to have money.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.240
 They don't have to have any resources.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.160
 They just have to get to the clinic or the hospital.

20:00.160 --> 20:05.600
 And it's incredibly moving to see sort of the flexibility

20:05.600 --> 20:08.840
 of their thinking in terms of how they make that work.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.280
 Makiya, for example, I saw her in the north of the country.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.640
 It's an incredibly rural clinic that she works at.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.160
 So it's like a magnet for all the cases

20:17.160 --> 20:18.520
 in the north of the country.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.560
 People come from hundreds of kilometers away sometimes

20:21.560 --> 20:25.520
 for specialty treatment of pediatric malnutrition.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.760
 And one time I saw a child come in

20:28.760 --> 20:33.040
 and it was a male relative that brought this young girl in.

20:33.040 --> 20:38.040
 And just because of sort of the gender dynamics in Yemen,

20:38.640 --> 20:42.080
 there had to be a parent or a relative there

20:42.080 --> 20:43.960
 to stay with the child while they're at the clinic.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.560
 And it was a male relative.

20:45.560 --> 20:49.920
 And so what many doctors in that instance would do

20:49.920 --> 20:51.760
 would just turn them away.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.840
 And instead what Makiya did is she walked

20:53.840 --> 20:56.680
 into one of the rooms, talked to one of the other mothers

20:56.680 --> 20:59.400
 and convinced them to become the temporary guardian,

20:59.400 --> 21:01.600
 essentially, of this child

21:01.600 --> 21:04.620
 until a female relative could arrive.

21:04.620 --> 21:06.160
 So, you know, she's flexible.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.360
 She finds solutions rather than allowing the problems

21:09.360 --> 21:11.000
 to deter solutions.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.200
 One child at a time.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.940
 Yeah, yeah, one child at a time.

21:13.940 --> 21:18.940
 You mentioned that you saw a child die in front of you.

21:22.820 --> 21:25.200
 So when you're filming this as a filmmaker,

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
 what's that like psychologically, philosophically,

21:33.540 --> 21:36.620
 creatively as a filmmaker, as a storyteller?

21:39.660 --> 21:43.860
 What do you do there as a human and as a filmmaker?

21:43.860 --> 21:45.820
 Or what's that whole experience like?

21:45.820 --> 21:47.420
 Because you get to, like you said,

21:47.420 --> 21:49.700
 you take it to the whole journey

21:49.700 --> 21:52.620
 of a starving mother giving birth to a starving child.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.300
 It's not something I want to film.

21:57.460 --> 22:01.740
 It's not something that I certainly wanted to happen

22:01.740 --> 22:05.020
 or seek out, but it happened.

22:05.020 --> 22:07.740
 And the sad truth is that it happens every week

22:07.740 --> 22:09.220
 at that hospital.

22:09.220 --> 22:12.980
 And so when it happened in this instance,

22:12.980 --> 22:15.820
 I felt an incredible responsibility

22:15.820 --> 22:18.880
 to do justice to that reality,

22:18.880 --> 22:22.200
 to acknowledge that a child had just died

22:22.200 --> 22:24.780
 of starvation related causes.

22:26.980 --> 22:31.780
 And to find some way, if the parents wanted us to,

22:31.780 --> 22:34.460
 to integrate that into this story

22:34.460 --> 22:39.360
 we bring back to a Western audience.

22:39.360 --> 22:44.360
 And I've filmed many difficult things over the years.

22:49.460 --> 22:54.260
 And usually I really love filming.

22:54.260 --> 22:56.380
 And I didn't love filming Hunger Ward.

22:56.380 --> 23:00.380
 It was not a process that I enjoyed

23:00.380 --> 23:04.180
 on any way, show, perform, sadly, because of the content.

23:04.180 --> 23:06.860
 Because who wants to watch a child die in front of them?

23:06.860 --> 23:08.820
 I don't, but I did.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.060
 And I had to.

23:10.060 --> 23:11.900
 And when that happened,

23:11.900 --> 23:14.900
 I felt an incredible responsibility again,

23:14.900 --> 23:17.220
 to go deep, right?

23:17.220 --> 23:19.180
 To go deep with that family,

23:19.180 --> 23:21.980
 to tell the story of this hospital

23:22.980 --> 23:27.380
 with every sort of ounce of focus and talent

23:27.380 --> 23:28.740
 that I could bring to the story.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.260
 Because people should know

23:31.260 --> 23:34.980
 that children are dying of starvation right now

23:34.980 --> 23:36.100
 as we sit here.

23:36.100 --> 23:37.940
 And that that doesn't have to happen.

23:37.940 --> 23:40.300
 And it is happening because of political dynamics

23:40.300 --> 23:41.500
 that we can intervene on.

23:42.660 --> 23:45.700
 Is there times you wanted to walk away,

23:46.780 --> 23:48.620
 quit the telling of the story,

23:51.220 --> 23:53.580
 come back to the United States

23:54.700 --> 23:59.100
 where you can just appreciate

24:02.380 --> 24:04.260
 the wonderful comfort you can have

24:04.260 --> 24:06.180
 just sitting there and having food

24:06.180 --> 24:11.180
 and freedom to do whatever you want,

24:12.500 --> 24:13.860
 those kinds of things.

24:13.860 --> 24:15.620
 Doesn't have to be in the United States.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.580
 In a lot of places in the world.

24:17.580 --> 24:21.340
 Well, that dynamic of sort of like survivor's guilt

24:21.340 --> 24:23.860
 on some level definitely exists.

24:23.860 --> 24:26.220
 One of the hardest things from Hunger Report actually

24:26.220 --> 24:28.940
 was eating, right?

24:28.940 --> 24:31.240
 Because we were in these malnutrition clinics,

24:31.240 --> 24:34.380
 they're called TFCs, Therapeutic Feeding Centers,

24:34.380 --> 24:39.380
 where over a long period of time,

24:41.220 --> 24:45.340
 children lost the ability to eat normal food, right?

24:45.340 --> 24:49.580
 And couldn't digest it and just were literally starving.

24:49.580 --> 24:53.220
 And the practitioners were trying to bring them back

24:53.220 --> 24:55.740
 to a state of thriving.

24:55.740 --> 24:58.100
 But to leave those clinics, right?

24:58.100 --> 25:00.860
 And to go to our camp or to go to our hotel

25:00.860 --> 25:03.380
 and then to have access to food, right?

25:03.380 --> 25:06.700
 Because we could buy food on the streets and in the hotels.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.900
 I mean, it was a very intentional act

25:10.900 --> 25:12.300
 throughout the course of the shoot

25:12.300 --> 25:14.780
 to look at a piece of bread, right?

25:14.780 --> 25:19.340
 Or to look at a bowl of rice and think about that child

25:19.340 --> 25:22.940
 in the TFC and think about how the privilege

25:22.940 --> 25:26.540
 of having that bowl of rice that I could eat and digest.

25:26.540 --> 25:31.540
 So it certainly every day helped me appreciate, right?

25:31.540 --> 25:33.340
 The privilege I had.

25:33.340 --> 25:34.580
 Every bite you take.

25:34.580 --> 25:36.780
 With every bite, absolutely.

25:36.780 --> 25:38.780
 And so I wouldn't call it guilt.

25:38.780 --> 25:39.860
 It wasn't exactly guilt,

25:39.860 --> 25:42.780
 but it was definitely mindfulness, right?

25:42.780 --> 25:47.460
 Meditate on the suffering of people who can't.

25:47.460 --> 25:48.780
 That's right, exactly.

25:48.780 --> 25:52.300
 So that knowledge sort of, it was catalytic in some ways.

25:52.300 --> 25:55.100
 It sort of moved us forward really wanting

25:55.100 --> 25:58.260
 to shape the most powerful story we could

25:58.260 --> 26:00.940
 because we were surrounded by so much suffering.

26:00.940 --> 26:03.180
 So much suffering every day.

26:03.180 --> 26:06.580
 How did filming that movie change you as a man?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.580
 As a human being?

26:09.580 --> 26:12.340
 You've filmed a few difficult documentaries.

26:14.220 --> 26:16.740
 That one is a heavy one.

26:16.740 --> 26:20.100
 When you think of the person you were before you filmed it,

26:20.100 --> 26:21.660
 and now when you wake up every morning

26:21.660 --> 26:23.260
 and look yourself in the mirror,

26:23.260 --> 26:25.380
 how is that person different?

26:25.380 --> 26:29.500
 Every documentary I do changes me in a different way.

26:29.500 --> 26:32.820
 Like I am not static in that sense, right?

26:32.820 --> 26:36.220
 And preformed, it's like I change with every project

26:36.220 --> 26:40.580
 because so many of them are difficult and challenging, right?

26:40.580 --> 26:43.180
 And so in order to do them,

26:43.180 --> 26:46.420
 I have to allow myself to change and be changed by them.

26:46.420 --> 26:48.020
 In the case of Hunger Ward,

26:48.020 --> 26:52.020
 you may remember the girl Omeima,

26:52.020 --> 26:56.740
 who's the 10 year old girl who we showcase in Auden

26:56.740 --> 26:58.660
 in the south of the country.

26:58.660 --> 27:03.660
 And we were there when she was admitted to the hospital.

27:04.740 --> 27:08.340
 And when she was admitted,

27:08.340 --> 27:10.900
 this 10 year old girl weighed 24 pounds

27:10.900 --> 27:14.060
 and she could barely stand up.

27:14.060 --> 27:18.020
 And we started with the permission of the family

27:18.020 --> 27:21.620
 to start to document her treatment

27:21.620 --> 27:25.020
 and to see what would happen with this young girl

27:25.020 --> 27:27.580
 who is so severely malnourished.

27:27.580 --> 27:31.460
 And we watched her be treated by the nurses

27:31.460 --> 27:35.020
 and the doctors in Sadaka Hospital.

27:35.020 --> 27:38.740
 And slowly over the course of a couple of weeks,

27:38.740 --> 27:40.660
 we saw her change.

27:40.660 --> 27:44.060
 We saw her start to sort of gain strength

27:44.060 --> 27:45.780
 and start to recover.

27:45.780 --> 27:50.740
 And she also watched the caregivers very carefully.

27:50.740 --> 27:54.180
 And I watched her watch them.

27:54.180 --> 27:58.540
 And I'll never forget there was a moment

27:58.540 --> 28:02.780
 where about two and a half weeks, I think,

28:02.780 --> 28:05.820
 into her treatment, we walked into a room

28:05.820 --> 28:10.100
 and I saw her offering a cap full of water

28:10.100 --> 28:15.100
 to another younger child who was also starving.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.420
 The shot's actually in the film.

28:17.420 --> 28:22.420
 And so to see Omeima, this child who's starving,

28:22.420 --> 28:27.100
 giving sustenance to a younger, more vulnerable child

28:27.100 --> 28:30.620
 who is also starving, moved me deeply.

28:31.940 --> 28:36.940
 So I saw her learn from the caregivers around her.

28:38.420 --> 28:40.820
 And as a human being, as a filmmaker,

28:40.820 --> 28:44.180
 I was incredibly inspired by Omeima.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.460
 That capacity for compassion is there.

28:46.460 --> 28:49.420
 Even within a 10 year old girl who's starving.

28:49.420 --> 28:52.340
 And so you asked what changed me.

28:52.340 --> 28:54.340
 That's one moment, right?

28:54.340 --> 28:57.060
 Rather than being crushed by such heavy content,

28:57.060 --> 28:58.620
 it was actually the opposite,

28:58.620 --> 29:02.300
 where I came away inspired by a 10 year old girl.

29:02.300 --> 29:05.180
 And I didn't anticipate that.

29:05.180 --> 29:07.340
 I didn't think that's what this content would do,

29:07.340 --> 29:08.540
 but it's what it did.

29:08.540 --> 29:13.020
 It reinforced for me sort of this incredible capacity

29:13.020 --> 29:16.100
 we all have as human beings, right?

29:16.100 --> 29:17.860
 To do good, right?

29:17.860 --> 29:20.820
 To even within the most difficult circumstances,

29:20.820 --> 29:24.940
 to choose who we become and what we do.

29:24.940 --> 29:27.300
 And a 10 year old girl taught me that

29:27.300 --> 29:29.140
 or reinforced that for me.

29:29.140 --> 29:34.140
 Were you able to feel the culture of the people,

29:34.140 --> 29:37.340
 so the language barrier,

29:37.340 --> 29:39.180
 were you able to break through the language barrier,

29:39.180 --> 29:42.340
 the culture barrier, to understand the people?

29:45.100 --> 29:48.940
 Because even suffering has a language of sorts,

29:48.940 --> 29:50.580
 depending on where you are.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.740
 The way people joke about things,

29:52.740 --> 29:55.740
 the way they cry, the way.

29:55.740 --> 29:57.540
 This is an interesting thing I actually wanna ask you.

29:57.540 --> 29:59.540
 Sorry, I'm asking a million questions.

30:00.740 --> 30:02.660
 I find that the people,

30:02.660 --> 30:05.980
 I've been talking to people in Ukraine and Russia,

30:05.980 --> 30:09.420
 but in general, I've gotten a chance to talk to people

30:09.420 --> 30:12.060
 who've been through trauma in their life.

30:13.020 --> 30:18.020
 And there's a humor they have about trauma

30:18.020 --> 30:20.140
 in hard times.

30:20.140 --> 30:22.860
 It depends on the culture, of course.

30:22.860 --> 30:25.460
 Certainly, Russian speaking folk,

30:25.460 --> 30:29.300
 I mean, the more suffering you've experienced,

30:29.300 --> 30:31.660
 for some reason, the more they joke about it.

30:31.660 --> 30:35.020
 It's almost like they're able to see something deep

30:35.020 --> 30:38.580
 about humanity now that they have suffered

30:38.580 --> 30:40.500
 and they're able to laugh at the absurdity,

30:40.500 --> 30:42.260
 the injustice of it all.

30:42.260 --> 30:45.780
 And you could also say it's a way for them to deal with it.

30:45.780 --> 30:50.780
 But that humor has a kind of profound understanding

30:53.260 --> 30:57.260
 within it about what it means to be human.

30:57.260 --> 31:00.420
 That I just, and then you, to really understand it,

31:00.420 --> 31:02.060
 you have to know the language.

31:02.060 --> 31:06.260
 So I guess I'm asking, were you able to really feel

31:07.300 --> 31:09.740
 the humans on the other side of the language?

31:09.740 --> 31:10.980
 I'd like to think so.

31:10.980 --> 31:14.340
 I mean, as you noted, there are universities

31:14.340 --> 31:19.340
 and there are universals in life that transcend language.

31:19.540 --> 31:21.940
 I mean, suffering is suffering.

31:21.940 --> 31:23.300
 Love is love.

31:23.300 --> 31:28.500
 Compassion doesn't take place only through language.

31:28.500 --> 31:29.460
 It's through actions.

31:29.460 --> 31:31.620
 And so was there a language barrier?

31:31.620 --> 31:33.300
 Absolutely.

31:33.300 --> 31:36.980
 Did we try to bridge that through other means

31:36.980 --> 31:41.300
 and sort of universal emotions and experiences?

31:41.300 --> 31:42.140
 Absolutely.

31:42.140 --> 31:44.100
 That's one of the things I always think about

31:44.100 --> 31:48.140
 when I'm filming is how do we distill down to universals

31:49.780 --> 31:54.620
 through imagery, through the vocabulary of cinema?

31:54.620 --> 31:56.420
 Because I believe so deeply that

31:56.420 --> 31:58.540
 that vocabulary should be visual.

31:58.540 --> 32:01.340
 So the words, what's the most powerful way

32:01.340 --> 32:03.260
 to express the universal?

32:03.260 --> 32:07.900
 Is it visual or is it language words?

32:07.900 --> 32:09.860
 I think it's visual.

32:09.860 --> 32:11.660
 And we're talking about the human face

32:11.660 --> 32:14.300
 or human face, human body, everything.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.540
 Through actions as well.

32:15.540 --> 32:16.900
 Actions, the dynamic.

32:16.900 --> 32:20.100
 I'm thinking about a woman named Salha in the film

32:20.100 --> 32:25.100
 who isn't named, but you see her multiple times

32:25.380 --> 32:26.220
 throughout the film.

32:26.220 --> 32:29.420
 And she's basically the matron of the ward in the South.

32:29.420 --> 32:31.580
 And she's the gatekeeper for the ward.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.980
 So no one enters that ward without her permission.

32:33.980 --> 32:36.020
 She's literally the gatekeeper at the door.

32:36.020 --> 32:40.020
 So no one comes in unless Salha allows them to come in.

32:40.020 --> 32:42.140
 But then she also is sort of like

32:43.540 --> 32:47.900
 the first point of contact for compassion in the ward.

32:47.900 --> 32:51.540
 So when mothers and families are admitted,

32:51.540 --> 32:55.540
 she forms relationships between the moms

32:55.540 --> 32:57.540
 and the grandmothers, for example,

32:57.540 --> 33:00.180
 who are admitted and who are living there on the ward.

33:00.180 --> 33:03.620
 And she does it through hugging, right?

33:03.620 --> 33:07.340
 She does it through bringing them food, right?

33:07.340 --> 33:11.060
 And she forms these really rather quickly

33:11.060 --> 33:15.660
 deep relationships of compassion with the families.

33:15.660 --> 33:19.100
 And so it's amazing to watch

33:19.100 --> 33:22.980
 and no language is needed, right, to bear witness to this.

33:22.980 --> 33:26.980
 And she also suffers because of that, right?

33:26.980 --> 33:30.260
 And so near the end of the film, if you recall,

33:31.460 --> 33:35.860
 when another child dies and the mother is wailing,

33:35.860 --> 33:38.980
 we actually cut away to Salha, who's in the hallway,

33:38.980 --> 33:43.020
 who walks into another room and begins sobbing.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.820
 She's not a family member,

33:44.820 --> 33:48.380
 but she has a deep relationship with that family

33:48.380 --> 33:51.420
 that she forged as soon as they stepped into the ward.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.380
 So that's universal, right?

33:53.380 --> 33:58.380
 To see a woman weep because a child has died,

33:58.580 --> 34:00.500
 even if they're not related to that,

34:00.500 --> 34:03.500
 that's a universal sort of emotional experience

34:03.500 --> 34:04.580
 we can all relate to.

34:04.580 --> 34:07.500
 So that's what I mean by visual vocabulary.

34:07.500 --> 34:08.860
 And it's especially powerful

34:08.860 --> 34:12.380
 because she has seen much of this kind of suffering

34:12.380 --> 34:17.020
 and she's still, maybe she has built up some callous

34:17.020 --> 34:20.020
 to be able to work day to day,

34:20.020 --> 34:25.020
 but there's still an ocean underneath the ice.

34:25.060 --> 34:26.700
 She's kept her heart open

34:26.700 --> 34:30.060
 despite all the pain that she sees and feels every day.

34:30.060 --> 34:33.020
 Somehow she's a human being who's able to do that,

34:33.020 --> 34:35.420
 which is a very difficult thing to do, right?

34:35.420 --> 34:38.100
 She still allows herself to be vulnerable.

34:39.180 --> 34:41.500
 And maybe that's why she can do what she does.

34:43.300 --> 34:45.980
 What lessons do you draw from other families in history?

34:45.980 --> 34:50.540
 So for me personally, one that's touched my family

34:50.540 --> 34:54.140
 and one of the great families in history is in Ukraine,

34:54.140 --> 34:56.260
 Holodomor in the 30s.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.540
 32, 33, right?

34:57.540 --> 34:59.820
 32, 33 with Stalin.

34:59.820 --> 35:03.060
 Maybe you could speak to the universals of the suffering here.

35:05.220 --> 35:09.820
 What lessons do you draw from those other famines

35:09.820 --> 35:13.220
 if you looked at them or in general about famine

35:13.220 --> 35:17.220
 that are manufactured by the decisions of,

35:17.220 --> 35:19.260
 let's say, authoritarian leaders?

35:19.260 --> 35:24.260
 Well, famine doesn't have to exist

35:29.700 --> 35:31.820
 or the bulk of famines on this planet,

35:31.820 --> 35:33.180
 I believe don't have to exist.

35:33.180 --> 35:36.500
 And most of them, or at least a good number of them

35:36.500 --> 35:39.060
 are manufactured by the leaders

35:40.140 --> 35:44.060
 that choose to use famine as a weapon, right?

35:44.060 --> 35:49.060
 And Ukraine is one of the obvious examples right now,

35:49.740 --> 35:51.540
 with siege tactics that are happening

35:51.540 --> 35:53.460
 in different parts of the country.

35:53.460 --> 35:58.460
 And we built international humanitarian law for a reason,

36:01.980 --> 36:06.500
 many years ago, and it continues to be written to this day.

36:06.500 --> 36:09.500
 And it's there to prevent

36:09.500 --> 36:11.500
 what's happening in Ukraine right now.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.900
 It's there to prevent what's been happening in Yemen

36:14.900 --> 36:16.340
 for seven years.

36:16.340 --> 36:19.820
 And yet there hasn't been any teeth behind it.

36:19.820 --> 36:24.820
 And that's what disturbs me is that we can see

36:25.420 --> 36:30.340
 how these famines are being used as weapons in war.

36:30.340 --> 36:34.020
 And yet we aren't sort of using the levers of power

36:34.020 --> 36:39.020
 that exist in order to, I think, to call out

36:39.020 --> 36:43.500
 in important and powerful ways those who are causing them

36:43.500 --> 36:46.300
 and to make sure that we hold them accountable

36:46.300 --> 36:47.140
 on the global stage.

36:47.140 --> 36:51.300
 Now, to some extent, that seems to be happening in Ukraine

36:51.300 --> 36:53.860
 in a way that hasn't happened for a long time.

36:53.860 --> 36:56.420
 And that gives me hope, right?

36:56.420 --> 36:58.900
 And yet I don't believe we've done enough.

36:59.860 --> 37:02.620
 And I think the national community needs to do far more

37:02.620 --> 37:05.860
 than we are both in Yemen, in Ethiopia,

37:05.860 --> 37:07.500
 and in Ukraine right now.

37:07.500 --> 37:10.500
 There are certain kinds of things that captivate

37:10.500 --> 37:14.140
 the global attention, and it seems like starvation

37:14.140 --> 37:15.460
 is not always one of them.

37:16.700 --> 37:20.140
 For some reason, murder and destruction

37:21.260 --> 37:23.620
 gets people's attention more.

37:23.620 --> 37:26.980
 The death, of course, is easy to enumerate,

37:26.980 --> 37:29.060
 but it's the suffering that's the problem.

37:29.060 --> 37:32.820
 Yeah, yeah, you know, when we went to film Hunger Ward,

37:32.820 --> 37:35.100
 that was one of the creative questions

37:35.100 --> 37:38.900
 that I was really concerned about because starvation,

37:38.900 --> 37:41.780
 you know, it's not a quick action, right?

37:41.780 --> 37:45.780
 It's a long, slow, insidious process, right?

37:45.780 --> 37:47.860
 Just like hunger, right?

37:47.860 --> 37:52.860
 And yet when you're hungry, right, it takes you over.

37:53.700 --> 37:56.420
 It becomes the most important thing, right?

37:56.420 --> 37:59.060
 It's just absolutely fundamental to life.

37:59.060 --> 38:00.860
 It's like drawing breath.

38:00.860 --> 38:05.300
 And so I really, before I filmed Hunger Ward,

38:05.300 --> 38:07.860
 I struggled to sort of answer

38:07.860 --> 38:09.900
 how we could creatively approach that

38:09.900 --> 38:13.460
 because, you know, someone's sitting in a clinic, right?

38:13.460 --> 38:16.780
 Starving or being treated for starvation, you know,

38:16.780 --> 38:19.100
 that's a pretty static scene, right?

38:20.420 --> 38:24.380
 And what we found was that because of the volume of cases

38:24.380 --> 38:28.380
 and because of the nature of sort of how quickly

38:28.380 --> 38:32.060
 how quickly people were coming and going

38:32.060 --> 38:34.500
 is that it was more dynamic than we anticipated.

38:35.820 --> 38:38.820
 And there's something also about starvation.

38:38.820 --> 38:40.260
 You get tired.

38:40.260 --> 38:43.460
 It's almost like it's a quiet suffering.

38:43.460 --> 38:44.300
 Yeah.

38:46.100 --> 38:48.100
 And by the way, there's something about

38:48.100 --> 38:49.980
 when I think about dark times,

38:49.980 --> 38:53.140
 I mean, you'll hear me chuckle, for example.

38:53.140 --> 38:54.420
 I don't know what that is.

38:54.420 --> 38:59.420
 That's almost like, it's almost like

38:59.460 --> 39:02.220
 you have to kind of laugh at,

39:03.660 --> 39:07.660
 you can't help but laugh at like the injustice

39:07.660 --> 39:08.780
 and the cruelty in the world.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.780
 Somehow that helps your mind deal with it.

39:10.780 --> 39:13.180
 I mean, I see this all the time.

39:13.180 --> 39:16.380
 Like when you're struggling, you can't feed your family.

39:16.380 --> 39:17.660
 You lost your home.

39:18.620 --> 39:21.620
 The last thing you have is jokes about.

39:21.620 --> 39:22.460
 It's humor.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.300
 Yeah, it's humor.

39:23.300 --> 39:28.180
 It's like, ah, the fucking man fucked me over again.

39:28.180 --> 39:30.460
 And there's jokes all around that.

39:30.460 --> 39:35.460
 And then you laugh and you drink vodka and you play music.

39:36.020 --> 39:37.260
 I don't know what that is.

39:37.260 --> 39:38.260
 I don't know what that is.

39:38.260 --> 39:39.540
 It's gallows humor, right?

39:39.540 --> 39:44.340
 It's a way of, I think, simultaneously acknowledging

39:44.340 --> 39:46.780
 and allowing yourself to move forward, right?

39:46.780 --> 39:49.820
 Beyond the pain and the suffering.

39:49.820 --> 39:52.780
 So you mentioned Ukraine and you mentioned Putin.

39:52.780 --> 39:57.780
 What are your thoughts about the humanitarian crisis

39:58.340 --> 40:00.700
 and generally the suffering that's resulting

40:00.700 --> 40:02.420
 from the war in Ukraine?

40:02.420 --> 40:03.980
 Well, first off, I think the conflict

40:03.980 --> 40:06.260
 is just gonna exacerbate, you know,

40:06.260 --> 40:11.260
 sort of the global challenge we have with displacement.

40:12.940 --> 40:17.540
 The last entire trilogy I did was about displacement

40:17.540 --> 40:19.540
 to great extent due to war.

40:19.540 --> 40:23.060
 And, you know, this is a huge displacement of human beings

40:23.060 --> 40:24.740
 regardless of the cause.

40:24.740 --> 40:29.220
 And that is gonna sort of have a ripple effect

40:29.220 --> 40:31.980
 across the globe for many, many years to come

40:31.980 --> 40:34.940
 regardless of even if the conflict ended today.

40:34.940 --> 40:35.780
 So there's that.

40:35.780 --> 40:38.020
 That's gonna set up a whole nother strain

40:38.020 --> 40:42.540
 on sort of the global sort of resources

40:44.020 --> 40:47.740
 that come into play to deal with refugees.

40:47.740 --> 40:50.820
 You know, there were 79 million displaced people

40:50.820 --> 40:54.780
 on this globe prior to the Ukrainian conflict, right?

40:54.780 --> 40:56.580
 You probably know the numbers better than I do

40:56.580 --> 40:59.340
 in terms of what the current estimates are

40:59.340 --> 41:00.820
 for displacement from Ukraine.

41:00.820 --> 41:01.940
 It's four to six million.

41:01.940 --> 41:03.220
 So what are we up to now?

41:03.220 --> 41:07.100
 73, 74 million individuals on this planet now

41:07.100 --> 41:09.260
 who are displaced?

41:09.260 --> 41:10.860
 That's a significant bump.

41:12.060 --> 41:16.220
 I wish that the levers of power were used differently

41:16.220 --> 41:19.620
 in situations like Ukraine and Syria, for example.

41:20.740 --> 41:23.380
 So what are the levers of power?

41:23.380 --> 41:24.500
 Well, military might.

41:24.500 --> 41:26.740
 Let's take that for one, right?

41:26.740 --> 41:31.740
 So I have always felt after working in Syria and Turkey

41:34.700 --> 41:39.460
 that we completely missed our opportunity

41:39.460 --> 41:44.380
 as a player on the global stage with military capability

41:44.380 --> 41:48.700
 to prevent the killing of hundreds of thousands

41:48.700 --> 41:50.860
 of civilians in Syria.

41:50.860 --> 41:54.660
 We had the ability and we didn't leverage that ability.

41:54.660 --> 41:59.660
 You know, the fact that I talked with so many Syrians

41:59.740 --> 42:02.020
 during the course of doing that project

42:02.020 --> 42:07.020
 who told me their stories of living in their house, right?

42:07.540 --> 42:12.460
 And having a Syrian helicopter fly over their house

42:12.460 --> 42:16.260
 and drop a 55 gallon drum full of explosives

42:16.260 --> 42:20.700
 and shrapnel in their neighborhood

42:20.700 --> 42:24.060
 over and over and over again.

42:24.060 --> 42:27.580
 Not focused on any military targets,

42:27.580 --> 42:31.500
 only meant to kill and sow fear, right?

42:31.500 --> 42:35.540
 And early in the conflict, we could have stopped that.

42:35.540 --> 42:39.020
 Before Russia got involved, we could have intervened

42:39.020 --> 42:40.820
 and created a no fly zone.

42:40.820 --> 42:43.780
 That we, the United States or coalition

42:43.780 --> 42:45.340
 that we were a part of, yeah.

42:45.340 --> 42:47.380
 And we didn't do it and we could have.

42:47.380 --> 42:49.500
 And I think that's an example where we have

42:49.500 --> 42:52.180
 the military capability to actually do good

42:52.180 --> 42:53.420
 in a situation like that.

42:53.420 --> 42:55.700
 And we don't usually use it for those purposes.

42:55.700 --> 42:58.660
 And I think that's what a military ought to be used for

42:58.660 --> 43:02.620
 beyond just defending our borders is to save others

43:02.620 --> 43:04.860
 with the privilege that that power affords.

43:04.860 --> 43:07.460
 What do you think about the power of the military

43:07.460 --> 43:09.180
 versus the power of sanctions

43:09.180 --> 43:11.220
 versus the power of conversation?

43:12.500 --> 43:13.940
 They're all different tools, right?

43:13.940 --> 43:15.460
 To be used at different moments.

43:15.460 --> 43:20.460
 But if words fail, if sanctions fail, right?

43:21.340 --> 43:24.100
 I think there are moments in history

43:24.100 --> 43:26.340
 where power is justified, right?

43:26.340 --> 43:28.140
 And I think Syria was one of them.

43:28.140 --> 43:31.900
 I think when barrel bombs were dropping

43:31.900 --> 43:34.700
 on civilian neighborhoods for months and months and months

43:34.700 --> 43:37.380
 with no intent to do anything

43:37.380 --> 43:40.060
 other than kill Syrian civilians,

43:40.060 --> 43:43.540
 that's an instance I think where might is justified

43:43.540 --> 43:45.340
 to shoot those helicopters out of the sky.

43:45.340 --> 43:46.660
 Here's the difficult thing.

43:46.660 --> 43:48.460
 We've talked about Yemen.

43:48.460 --> 43:53.100
 Where's the line between good and evil

43:53.100 --> 43:56.820
 for US intervention in different countries

43:56.820 --> 43:58.540
 and conflicts in the world?

43:59.660 --> 44:02.300
 It's easy to look back 10, 20, 30 years

44:02.300 --> 44:05.740
 to know what was and wasn't a quote unquote just war.

44:05.740 --> 44:08.740
 In the moment, how do we know?

44:08.740 --> 44:11.620
 I think it's incredibly difficult to answer that, right?

44:11.620 --> 44:14.980
 And I think that's why leaders make the wrong choices

44:14.980 --> 44:15.820
 so often, right?

44:15.820 --> 44:17.580
 Is they second guess themselves.

44:18.980 --> 44:21.580
 I think you take all the data at your fingertips,

44:21.580 --> 44:23.580
 all the intelligence that you have, right?

44:23.580 --> 44:25.940
 And you look at it all very carefully

44:25.940 --> 44:27.980
 and you make a decision, right?

44:27.980 --> 44:30.420
 There are some instances though

44:30.420 --> 44:33.980
 where it's very clear what's happening, right?

44:33.980 --> 44:36.380
 And leaders still don't act, right?

44:36.380 --> 44:38.660
 In Yemen right now, for example,

44:38.660 --> 44:40.900
 it's very clear what's happening, right?

44:40.900 --> 44:44.420
 Children are being starved because of a blockade.

44:44.420 --> 44:48.340
 All the US would have to do is ensure that blockade,

44:48.340 --> 44:50.340
 now there's a two month ceasefire in place now,

44:50.340 --> 44:54.020
 but remains lifted beyond the ceasefire

44:54.020 --> 44:56.300
 and children will stop starving.

44:56.300 --> 44:57.860
 That's pretty simple.

44:57.860 --> 45:00.660
 You can trace, it's a direct connection.

45:00.660 --> 45:04.940
 And we haven't had the sort of the moral wherewithal

45:04.940 --> 45:08.020
 to make that decision because we're too interested

45:08.020 --> 45:10.900
 in maintaining positive ties with Saudi Arabia

45:10.900 --> 45:14.340
 where oil flows from and so much influence

45:15.980 --> 45:17.660
 because Saudi Arabia has so much influence

45:17.660 --> 45:19.900
 throughout the MENA region.

45:19.900 --> 45:22.140
 We want to keep that relationship tight

45:22.140 --> 45:26.300
 despite sort of the moral wounds that come from that.

45:26.300 --> 45:30.580
 About half the world is under authoritarian regimes

45:30.580 --> 45:33.420
 and everybody operates under narratives.

45:33.420 --> 45:35.820
 And there's a narrative in the United States

45:35.820 --> 45:38.900
 that freedom is good, democracy is good.

45:40.180 --> 45:43.540
 I have fallen victim to this narrative.

45:43.540 --> 45:44.700
 I believe in it.

45:46.020 --> 45:48.500
 I'm saying this jokingly, but not really

45:49.620 --> 45:53.700
 because who knows the truth of anything in this world?

45:53.700 --> 45:57.020
 I eat meat, factory farm meat,

45:57.020 --> 45:59.740
 and I seem to not be intellectually

45:59.740 --> 46:02.580
 and philosophically tortured by this, and I should be.

46:02.580 --> 46:04.980
 There's a lot of suffering there.

46:04.980 --> 46:09.300
 What do we do to lessen the suffering

46:09.300 --> 46:11.540
 of the people under authoritarian regimes?

46:12.620 --> 46:14.660
 Again, the same question.

46:14.660 --> 46:19.660
 Military conflict, diplomacy, sanctions,

46:20.340 --> 46:21.700
 all those kinds of things.

46:24.340 --> 46:28.580
 Does that lessen suffering or increase the suffering

46:28.580 --> 46:30.260
 for what you see in Yemen?

46:31.780 --> 46:36.300
 Is it something that has to be healed across generations

46:36.300 --> 46:39.260
 or can be healed on a scale of months and years?

46:39.260 --> 46:42.140
 I'm just a guy with a camera, Alex, you know?

46:42.140 --> 46:43.540
 But as a guy with a camera,

46:44.580 --> 46:49.460
 I've seen a lot of things in a lot of places

46:49.460 --> 46:54.380
 and I've seen the effects these decisions made

46:54.380 --> 46:59.300
 by authoritarian leaders have on their own citizens.

46:59.300 --> 47:02.540
 And that's what drives my thinking on this.

47:04.500 --> 47:08.380
 And that's what drives and motivates me each day

47:08.380 --> 47:11.260
 to raise the red flag through my films

47:11.260 --> 47:14.580
 and say, listen, Biden,

47:15.940 --> 47:20.940
 you campaigned for president in part on a platform

47:20.940 --> 47:25.940
 that said that we would regain our prominence

47:25.980 --> 47:28.300
 on the moral stage of the world

47:28.300 --> 47:33.300
 and that we would prioritize sort of a moral paradigm

47:35.420 --> 47:39.300
 over relationships with authoritarian regimes,

47:39.300 --> 47:41.500
 Saudi Arabia being one.

47:41.500 --> 47:44.780
 And yet when the CIA report came out

47:44.780 --> 47:47.780
 that clearly articulated in detail

47:47.780 --> 47:51.300
 that MBS was responsible for Khashoggi's murder

47:51.300 --> 47:53.460
 and for cutting his body into pieces

47:53.460 --> 47:56.580
 and probably burning it in the backyard of the embassy,

47:57.460 --> 47:58.460
 what did Biden do?

47:59.500 --> 48:02.380
 He didn't really make a pariah out of MBS

48:02.380 --> 48:05.180
 like he said he was going to, right?

48:05.180 --> 48:06.860
 What if he'd done something else

48:06.860 --> 48:09.180
 and actually done what he said he was gonna do,

48:09.180 --> 48:10.020
 which was make MBS?

48:10.020 --> 48:13.580
 What if he had removed the ability for MBS

48:13.580 --> 48:16.340
 to fly to the United States, for example?

48:16.340 --> 48:18.060
 Now that's a sanction, right?

48:18.060 --> 48:21.700
 That's a sanction that's individual and concrete

48:21.700 --> 48:25.100
 and would be hugely embarrassing for MBS.

48:25.100 --> 48:27.340
 That would have been Biden saying,

48:27.340 --> 48:31.220
 this is unacceptable behavior, right?

48:31.220 --> 48:35.540
 This is something which because you executed

48:35.540 --> 48:40.060
 such a horrendous act on someone living in the United States,

48:40.060 --> 48:47.060
 we are not going to give you a stage here at least, right?

48:47.060 --> 48:49.180
 Within the borders of our country.

48:49.180 --> 48:51.380
 Those are the things that leaders can do

48:51.380 --> 48:53.300
 that I don't think they do often enough.

48:53.300 --> 48:55.820
 And certainly our leader right now isn't doing it

48:55.820 --> 48:57.260
 in the way I wish he were.

48:57.260 --> 48:59.900
 He certainly has taken a different stand on Ukraine

49:01.740 --> 49:03.100
 and been very vocal.

49:03.100 --> 49:05.420
 But there's so many instances we could talk about

49:05.420 --> 49:09.940
 where I feel like the political game and ship, right?

49:09.940 --> 49:13.420
 Often falls into maintaining relationships

49:13.420 --> 49:15.180
 like with MBS and Saudi Arabia

49:15.180 --> 49:16.820
 rather than doing the right thing.

49:16.820 --> 49:20.940
 Rather than as a nation, a leader of a nation saying,

49:20.940 --> 49:22.420
 this is unacceptable.

49:22.420 --> 49:24.340
 We have a higher standard than this.

49:24.340 --> 49:27.260
 Cause I think when leaders do that,

49:28.620 --> 49:30.580
 it becomes aspirational, right?

49:30.580 --> 49:32.980
 It becomes aspirational for other leaders

49:34.620 --> 49:36.220
 in the progressive world at least.

49:36.220 --> 49:38.620
 And also it rings the alarm bells

49:38.620 --> 49:41.740
 for other authoritarian leaders and says,

49:41.740 --> 49:44.220
 you know what, there are lines, right?

49:44.220 --> 49:46.260
 There are things that can't be done

49:46.260 --> 49:48.140
 or there will be significant consequences.

49:48.140 --> 49:51.500
 Like you will not be able to fly into our airspace anymore.

49:51.500 --> 49:55.180
 And sanctions I think need to be concrete and individual

49:55.180 --> 49:58.060
 to some, in addition to the larger scope.

49:58.060 --> 50:00.380
 But when they're concrete and individual,

50:01.420 --> 50:04.420
 I think often they're felt in a different way.

50:04.420 --> 50:06.860
 You mean felt obviously by the individuals.

50:06.860 --> 50:09.420
 And so the ripple effects of that

50:11.700 --> 50:16.700
 might have the power to steer the direction of nations.

50:18.420 --> 50:21.500
 Because of the nature of authoritarian regimes, right?

50:21.500 --> 50:22.780
 Individuals have so much power.

50:22.780 --> 50:23.620
 Exactly, right.

50:23.620 --> 50:28.620
 So if Putin is put on trial in the Hague at some point,

50:30.300 --> 50:32.140
 or at least there's the threat of that, right?

50:32.140 --> 50:34.380
 Now that's likely never to happen of course

50:34.380 --> 50:37.220
 because someone has to be in custody to go on trial, right?

50:37.220 --> 50:39.300
 And he's never gonna allow that to happen.

50:39.300 --> 50:44.300
 But just knowing that that danger exists

50:45.780 --> 50:49.740
 is going to change his travel plans in the future, right?

50:49.740 --> 50:51.980
 MBS not being able to fly to the US,

50:51.980 --> 50:54.820
 he's gonna feel that and be embarrassed by that.

50:55.940 --> 51:00.860
 So I think they have a special meaning and consequence

51:00.860 --> 51:03.580
 in authoritarian regimes because of that.

51:03.580 --> 51:06.100
 So you said you're just a guy with a camera.

51:06.100 --> 51:06.940
 Yeah.

51:07.780 --> 51:12.780
 I would say you're a brilliant guy with a camera.

51:13.940 --> 51:15.980
 I'm also a kind of guy with a camera.

51:15.980 --> 51:16.980
 You're a guy with a couple cameras.

51:16.980 --> 51:17.820
 A couple cameras.

51:17.820 --> 51:18.660
 I have more.

51:18.660 --> 51:20.340
 A couple mics too.

51:20.340 --> 51:23.180
 You got a couple mics, a couple cameras, robot over here.

51:23.180 --> 51:25.620
 When you can't beat them with quality,

51:25.620 --> 51:27.300
 you bring the quantity.

51:27.300 --> 51:28.500
 That's right.

51:28.500 --> 51:31.740
 So to me, that's also an interest partially

51:31.740 --> 51:36.100
 because I also speak Russian and a bit Ukrainian.

51:37.820 --> 51:39.900
 I wanna study that part of the world.

51:39.900 --> 51:41.620
 I wanna talk to a lot of people.

51:41.620 --> 51:42.860
 I wanna talk to the leaders.

51:42.860 --> 51:44.540
 I wanna talk to regular people.

51:44.540 --> 51:48.700
 To be honest, and I would love to get your comments on this,

51:48.700 --> 51:51.380
 the regular quote unquote people

51:51.380 --> 51:53.420
 are way more fascinating to me.

51:53.420 --> 51:58.340
 As a filmmaker, how do you figure out how to tell this story?

51:58.340 --> 52:00.300
 I'm sure a guy with a camera,

52:00.300 --> 52:02.420
 you're looking at war in Ukraine,

52:02.420 --> 52:05.900
 but also what's going on in Yemen and Syria

52:05.900 --> 52:07.140
 and other places in the world.

52:07.140 --> 52:08.380
 I mentioned North Korea.

52:08.380 --> 52:10.260
 That's a super interesting one.

52:10.260 --> 52:11.740
 Hard to bring cameras along.

52:11.740 --> 52:16.580
 China, in Canada, the truckers.

52:16.580 --> 52:18.460
 There's all kinds of fascinating things

52:18.460 --> 52:19.780
 happening in the world.

52:19.780 --> 52:23.780
 So you as a scholar of human suffering

52:23.780 --> 52:25.020
 and human flourishing,

52:26.300 --> 52:28.300
 how do you choose how to tell the story?

52:29.180 --> 52:30.140
 How do I choose a story?

52:30.140 --> 52:31.220
 How do I choose how to tell a story?

52:31.220 --> 52:34.420
 Both a story and how, I assume those are coupled.

52:35.900 --> 52:38.100
 So how do you choose which story to tell?

52:38.100 --> 52:40.620
 And how do you choose how to tell that story?

52:41.980 --> 52:45.660
 Well, in terms of how to choose which story,

52:48.380 --> 52:51.780
 it's a bit of a mystery potion for me, frankly.

52:52.980 --> 52:55.540
 I go often on instinct,

52:55.540 --> 52:58.860
 but there's also a highly intentional piece of it

52:58.860 --> 53:00.140
 for me as well.

53:00.140 --> 53:02.340
 And the intentional piece is,

53:03.380 --> 53:06.900
 I guess I'd call it the do I care threshold,

53:06.900 --> 53:08.500
 or the so what threshold.

53:08.500 --> 53:11.300
 You personally, just something in your heart

53:11.300 --> 53:15.700
 just kind of gets excited or hurts or just feels something.

53:15.700 --> 53:17.380
 So one of the things that disturbs me

53:17.380 --> 53:19.020
 about American culture, Lex,

53:19.020 --> 53:21.380
 is that we seem to be a people

53:21.380 --> 53:24.180
 that's fascinated by reality television, for example.

53:24.180 --> 53:27.660
 Like look at how many of us here in America

53:27.660 --> 53:30.340
 watch reality television, right?

53:30.340 --> 53:31.620
 That deeply disturbs me.

53:31.620 --> 53:33.340
 Not that I've never watched an episode,

53:33.340 --> 53:36.020
 I've shot a whole season of it once to make a living, right?

53:36.020 --> 53:38.580
 So it's like I know it, right?

53:38.580 --> 53:42.620
 But I feel like the things we should be paying attention to

53:42.620 --> 53:44.780
 are the things, personally,

53:44.780 --> 53:47.860
 are the things I choose to film, right?

53:47.860 --> 53:52.860
 As a human being, as a dad, as a filmmaker,

53:53.540 --> 53:55.900
 I think we should be paying attention

53:55.900 --> 53:58.860
 to the fact that children are being starved in Yemen.

53:58.860 --> 54:00.500
 I think we should be paying attention

54:00.500 --> 54:03.220
 to the fact that Ukrainians are being displaced

54:03.220 --> 54:04.580
 by the millions.

54:04.580 --> 54:07.100
 So there's this so what threshold that I use.

54:07.100 --> 54:09.580
 And I feel like it has to be a topic

54:09.580 --> 54:14.100
 that if we don't cover and we don't put out in the world

54:14.100 --> 54:16.140
 in the largest possible way,

54:16.140 --> 54:17.580
 in the hope of intervening,

54:17.580 --> 54:20.300
 in the hope of marshaling maximum resources

54:20.300 --> 54:22.780
 and attention to solving the problem,

54:22.780 --> 54:25.460
 that's what I'm dedicated to as a filmmaker.

54:25.460 --> 54:29.100
 Because I didn't pick up a camera initially

54:29.100 --> 54:31.820
 to film puppy dogs, right?

54:31.820 --> 54:33.420
 To make people smile.

54:33.420 --> 54:36.460
 I believe the camera is a tool for change.

54:36.460 --> 54:40.140
 I believe the camera is a powerful tool

54:40.140 --> 54:44.220
 that we can use to raise awareness and marshal resources

54:44.220 --> 54:47.660
 and help people understand the impact

54:47.660 --> 54:50.140
 that these geopolitical decisions have

54:50.140 --> 54:51.780
 on real people's lives.

54:51.780 --> 54:56.780
 And that's the intent I create each film with.

54:57.460 --> 54:59.340
 Now, how I choose each story,

54:59.340 --> 55:01.860
 that's the magic potion piece of it, right?

55:01.860 --> 55:04.820
 And often one flows rather organically

55:04.820 --> 55:06.660
 into another, frankly.

55:06.660 --> 55:08.140
 So you just kind of, like you said,

55:08.140 --> 55:09.940
 you go with instinct a little bit.

55:09.940 --> 55:12.900
 To some extent, but oftentimes I choose the next project

55:12.900 --> 55:17.380
 based on relationships I've developed in the last film.

55:17.380 --> 55:18.220
 Right?

55:18.220 --> 55:20.540
 And so one often flows into another

55:20.540 --> 55:21.900
 through relationships I develop.

55:21.900 --> 55:24.540
 And then a colleague will share a detail

55:24.540 --> 55:27.340
 about something that's happening in a certain place.

55:27.340 --> 55:30.860
 And I'll go, hmm, really, I didn't know that, right?

55:30.860 --> 55:33.860
 And usually it's before it's hit the world stage

55:33.860 --> 55:34.900
 in a big way.

55:34.900 --> 55:36.740
 And so I start to do due diligence.

55:36.740 --> 55:39.340
 And often that, it reveals it to be a much bigger

55:39.340 --> 55:43.620
 and more pressing topic that I wanna learn more about.

55:43.620 --> 55:48.620
 Before I talk to you about Syria and Lifeboat,

55:50.020 --> 55:52.860
 you mentioned a camera is the best weapon.

55:52.860 --> 55:57.860
 Maybe just, well, I can't take out a tank, right?

55:57.860 --> 55:58.780
 But it's a good weapon.

55:58.780 --> 56:00.660
 Second, top three.

56:00.660 --> 56:01.500
 Yeah.

56:01.500 --> 56:03.300
 I love the humor throughout this.

56:03.300 --> 56:04.860
 I really appreciate it.

56:04.860 --> 56:07.140
 We were talking about such dark topics.

56:07.140 --> 56:07.980
 Yeah.

56:07.980 --> 56:12.540
 It resets the mind in a way that allows me to think.

56:12.540 --> 56:13.900
 So thank you.

56:13.900 --> 56:18.900
 As a filmmaker, I almost wanna talk

56:20.620 --> 56:23.740
 about the technical details.

56:23.740 --> 56:24.580
 Uh oh.

56:24.580 --> 56:29.020
 How do you choose to shoot stuff?

56:29.020 --> 56:31.700
 Again, so maybe you can explain to me.

56:31.700 --> 56:36.700
 I work with incredible folks that care about lenses

56:37.860 --> 56:40.540
 and equipment and so on.

56:40.540 --> 56:45.540
 And I tend to be somebody that just wants to kinda go

56:50.340 --> 56:55.340
 as like a gorilla shooting, like not plan too much,

56:56.220 --> 56:58.580
 just go with gritty.

56:58.580 --> 57:01.020
 I'm trying to come up with words that sound positive.

57:01.020 --> 57:04.060
 Do a positive spin on what I try to do.

57:04.060 --> 57:08.500
 But like gritty, don't over plan, use,

57:08.500 --> 57:10.780
 like we had a big discussion if you see this light.

57:10.780 --> 57:12.180
 Yeah.

57:12.180 --> 57:15.700
 It's on a stand that's a very ghetto stand.

57:15.700 --> 57:16.540
 Yeah.

57:16.540 --> 57:17.460
 You need a sandbag on that, man.

57:17.460 --> 57:18.300
 Exactly.

57:18.300 --> 57:23.300
 So no sandbag and like the stand is actually bending

57:23.820 --> 57:25.260
 under the weight of that thing.

57:25.260 --> 57:26.380
 It could fall on us.

57:26.380 --> 57:27.220
 It could fall.

57:27.220 --> 57:28.060
 It probably won't reach us, but it could fall.

57:28.060 --> 57:30.940
 But the danger, live under that danger.

57:30.940 --> 57:32.660
 Embrace that danger.

57:32.660 --> 57:33.500
 Love it.

57:33.500 --> 57:34.380
 Yeah.

57:34.380 --> 57:36.500
 Because that thing is easier to transport

57:36.500 --> 57:37.740
 than a heavier one.

57:37.740 --> 57:38.580
 Yeah.

57:38.580 --> 57:40.260
 Sandbag, that's extra weight.

57:40.260 --> 57:42.860
 So if you keep, like people tell me

57:42.860 --> 57:44.660
 there's the right way to do stuff.

57:44.660 --> 57:47.900
 Like here's these giant cases with all the kinds of padding

57:47.900 --> 57:49.260
 for transporting stuff.

57:49.260 --> 57:52.220
 I transport most of the equipment in a garbage bag.

57:52.220 --> 57:53.060
 Yeah.

57:53.060 --> 57:56.220
 So that's just a preference because that's somehow

57:56.220 --> 58:00.660
 that chaos allows me to ignore all the stupidity

58:00.660 --> 58:04.780
 of loving the equipment and focusing on the story.

58:04.780 --> 58:09.780
 So that said, I've never shot anything like worthwhile.

58:11.180 --> 58:15.620
 Like there is power to the visual.

58:15.620 --> 58:16.460
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:16.460 --> 58:17.820
 Like definitely.

58:17.820 --> 58:22.820
 And so finding a certain angle, a certain light

58:22.940 --> 58:26.300
 whether it's natural light or additional artificial lighting

58:27.260 --> 58:32.260
 just capturing a tear, capturing when the person forgets

58:32.260 --> 58:35.740
 themselves for a moment and looks out into the distance

58:35.740 --> 58:38.460
 missing somebody, thinking about somebody.

58:38.460 --> 58:42.260
 All of those like moments you can capture a lens,

58:42.260 --> 58:44.900
 a camera can do magic with that.

58:44.900 --> 58:46.420
 I don't even know the question I'm asking you

58:46.420 --> 58:51.140
 but how do both technical and philosophical,

58:51.140 --> 58:54.180
 how do you capture the visual power that you're after?

58:54.180 --> 58:55.340
 Yeah.

58:55.340 --> 58:59.820
 So, so many of my films I think are built

58:59.820 --> 59:02.980
 on the premise of access, right?

59:02.980 --> 59:07.980
 Built on this notion that the biggest hurdle

59:10.420 --> 59:14.860
 to the story is getting there, being there in the room

59:14.860 --> 59:19.860
 or being there on the boat while a crisis is unfolding.

59:19.860 --> 59:23.180
 And that access typically is really nuanced

59:23.180 --> 59:26.020
 and difficult to gain.

59:26.020 --> 59:28.940
 And then trust flows from that, right?

59:28.940 --> 59:31.740
 Cause usually it takes a long time to gain that access

59:32.780 --> 59:35.420
 because that access is so hard fought.

59:37.020 --> 59:42.020
 It necessarily informs how we film, right?

59:43.380 --> 59:47.380
 To be in a room at Sadaka Hospital in Southern Yemen

59:47.380 --> 59:50.820
 I can't have five people in that room, right?

59:50.820 --> 59:54.220
 I can't have a boom mic over a scene.

59:54.220 --> 59:58.220
 I want in creatively the opposite of that as well.

59:58.220 --> 1:00:00.060
 So it's not just a logistical question,

1:00:00.060 --> 1:00:04.340
 it's also a creative question to capture intimate moments

1:00:04.340 --> 1:00:08.340
 where families are dealing with suffering children

1:00:08.340 --> 1:00:11.700
 and dying children and caretaking is active

1:00:11.700 --> 1:00:13.300
 and ongoing all the time.

1:00:13.300 --> 1:00:15.340
 You don't want to interrupt that moment.

1:00:15.340 --> 1:00:17.460
 And so that informs how I do things.

1:00:17.460 --> 1:00:21.220
 So we go fleet and nimble and small.

1:00:21.220 --> 1:00:22.900
 Those are all really good words.

1:00:22.900 --> 1:00:26.100
 But so it's logistical on the one hand,

1:00:26.100 --> 1:00:28.100
 but it's also a creative choice, right?

1:00:28.100 --> 1:00:30.340
 So when we filmed Hunger Ward,

1:00:30.340 --> 1:00:32.940
 two people were filming the entire film, right?

1:00:32.940 --> 1:00:34.860
 Me and my director of photography.

1:00:34.860 --> 1:00:36.380
 That was the two people in the room?

1:00:36.380 --> 1:00:37.220
 Two people in the room.

1:00:37.220 --> 1:00:38.060
 That's it.

1:00:38.060 --> 1:00:38.900
 Yeah, that's it.

1:00:38.900 --> 1:00:39.740
 The whole film, right?

1:00:39.740 --> 1:00:41.500
 We had a field producer as well in this part of the country,

1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:43.740
 but in terms of camera, it's just two people

1:00:43.740 --> 1:00:45.060
 and we're doing everything.

1:00:45.060 --> 1:00:49.860
 And we have lenses that are long enough

1:00:49.860 --> 1:00:52.060
 that we don't have to move to camera.

1:00:52.060 --> 1:00:53.620
 We don't have to move to capture the film.

1:00:53.620 --> 1:00:56.620
 So we can tuck into a corner sometimes, right?

1:00:56.620 --> 1:00:58.300
 And so just what's long mean?

1:00:58.300 --> 1:00:59.940
 That means they're standing farther away

1:00:59.940 --> 1:01:00.780
 and they can look.

1:01:00.780 --> 1:01:02.220
 Zoom lens, it's not a prime lens.

1:01:02.220 --> 1:01:04.060
 So it's not a fixed focal length, right?

1:01:04.060 --> 1:01:04.900
 Because a fixed focal length,

1:01:04.900 --> 1:01:07.740
 you have to move a lot more in order to capture action.

1:01:07.740 --> 1:01:12.740
 With a zoom lens, maybe a 105 at the long end,

1:01:12.900 --> 1:01:16.860
 I can tuck into a corner and just film from 15 feet away

1:01:16.860 --> 1:01:18.980
 instead of having to get right up on someone, right?

1:01:18.980 --> 1:01:21.940
 So you're less likely to interrupt the scene

1:01:21.940 --> 1:01:25.900
 and you can kind of become the fly on the wall sometimes.

1:01:25.900 --> 1:01:30.180
 So I'm very intentional about that piece of it

1:01:30.180 --> 1:01:33.540
 so that we can capture those vulnerable moments

1:01:33.540 --> 1:01:34.660
 and not interrupt them.

1:01:36.340 --> 1:01:39.700
 That's really fascinating too, because the access,

1:01:41.540 --> 1:01:42.860
 I don't often think about this,

1:01:42.860 --> 1:01:44.860
 but that's probably true for me as well.

1:01:44.860 --> 1:01:49.860
 Part of the storytelling is to be in the room.

1:01:52.180 --> 1:01:53.700
 And that's the hard part.

1:01:53.700 --> 1:01:56.380
 For me, most of my films, that's the hardest part.

1:01:56.380 --> 1:01:59.860
 Actually, as hard as Hunger Ward and Lifeboat were to film

1:01:59.860 --> 1:02:01.340
 and 50 Feet From Syria,

1:02:02.540 --> 1:02:04.740
 the getting there piece of it for the last two

1:02:04.740 --> 1:02:06.180
 was much harder.

1:02:06.180 --> 1:02:09.340
 Yeah, and it's also, it's a creative act.

1:02:09.340 --> 1:02:12.540
 It's, I don't know if it is for you,

1:02:12.540 --> 1:02:15.140
 but it's the kind of people you talk to.

1:02:15.140 --> 1:02:18.660
 It's like how you live your life.

1:02:18.660 --> 1:02:21.100
 Like the kind of people I talk to right now,

1:02:21.100 --> 1:02:22.780
 they steer the direction of my life

1:02:22.780 --> 1:02:25.620
 and steer the direction of things I'll film.

1:02:25.620 --> 1:02:28.340
 So it's not just like you're trying to get access.

1:02:28.340 --> 1:02:30.980
 It's like, it's everything.

1:02:30.980 --> 1:02:34.580
 It builds, it builds and builds and builds and builds.

1:02:34.580 --> 1:02:36.420
 It builds on itself, yeah, yeah.

1:02:36.420 --> 1:02:38.820
 I mean, part of the thing, even saying,

1:02:38.820 --> 1:02:40.140
 talking about some of these leaders

1:02:40.140 --> 1:02:41.860
 and conversations with them,

1:02:41.860 --> 1:02:45.020
 it's almost like steering your life

1:02:45.020 --> 1:02:47.820
 into the direction of the difficult,

1:02:47.820 --> 1:02:50.140
 of like taking the leap.

1:02:51.100 --> 1:02:54.740
 And if you're a good human being

1:02:56.180 --> 1:03:00.460
 and a lot of people know who you are as a human,

1:03:00.460 --> 1:03:04.140
 like not as a name, but as really who you are,

1:03:04.140 --> 1:03:06.940
 that like putting that attention out there,

1:03:06.940 --> 1:03:10.980
 it's somehow the world opens doors

1:03:10.980 --> 1:03:14.300
 where the access becomes,

1:03:14.300 --> 1:03:18.500
 the access that once seemed impossible becomes possible.

1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:21.020
 And then all of that is a creative journey

1:03:21.020 --> 1:03:22.180
 to be in the room.

1:03:22.180 --> 1:03:23.620
 I think that probably is,

1:03:23.620 --> 1:03:26.620
 I mean, it's true even for fiction films probably,

1:03:26.620 --> 1:03:30.220
 is like everything that led to that,

1:03:30.220 --> 1:03:33.380
 like to be in the room, the journey to be in the room

1:03:33.380 --> 1:03:37.700
 and to shoot the scene is maybe more important

1:03:37.700 --> 1:03:39.780
 than the scene itself.

1:03:39.780 --> 1:03:42.820
 And like really focus on the creative act of that.

1:03:42.820 --> 1:03:43.980
 Yeah, that's really fascinating.

1:03:43.980 --> 1:03:45.980
 And especially, I mean, with a documentary,

1:03:45.980 --> 1:03:47.700
 you get one take.

1:03:47.700 --> 1:03:49.980
 Yeah, you can't say, hey, reset, right?

1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:51.140
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1:03:51.140 --> 1:03:53.140
 Ah, that is so interesting.

1:03:53.140 --> 1:03:56.980
 As you were in some of the most difficult parts of the world

1:03:57.900 --> 1:04:00.780
 in the room with some of the most difficult stories

1:04:00.780 --> 1:04:02.060
 to be told.

1:04:02.060 --> 1:04:05.780
 And yet, I think that's why I keep doing these stories.

1:04:05.780 --> 1:04:10.060
 Because once you have that lived experience for me,

1:04:15.260 --> 1:04:16.860
 it's moving.

1:04:16.860 --> 1:04:20.780
 It moves me to bear witness

1:04:20.780 --> 1:04:25.780
 to these inspiring people under difficult circumstances.

1:04:26.740 --> 1:04:31.740
 And I can't come back to the US afterwards

1:04:31.740 --> 1:04:35.660
 and walk down the grocery aisle

1:04:35.660 --> 1:04:40.220
 where there's 50 different choices for canned peas, right?

1:04:40.220 --> 1:04:45.060
 And not sort of feel that lived tension, right?

1:04:45.060 --> 1:04:47.260
 That lived tension of the privilege

1:04:47.260 --> 1:04:49.220
 that I have here in the US.

1:04:49.220 --> 1:04:52.060
 And then I have a choice about what to do

1:04:52.060 --> 1:04:54.020
 with that privilege, right?

1:04:54.020 --> 1:04:56.460
 And the last thing I wanna do is start

1:04:58.380 --> 1:05:01.140
 doing stories about dandelions, right?

1:05:01.140 --> 1:05:02.740
 There's far more important things to do

1:05:02.740 --> 1:05:05.700
 on this very limited time that I have on the planet.

1:05:05.700 --> 1:05:10.700
 And I think that's catalytic for me.

1:05:12.140 --> 1:05:17.140
 Like I feel that mortality each day.

1:05:17.420 --> 1:05:22.420
 And my goal is to tell as many of these stories

1:05:25.780 --> 1:05:26.700
 before I'm gone.

1:05:26.700 --> 1:05:30.980
 Could you speak to the getting access?

1:05:31.980 --> 1:05:36.180
 Is this just, you know, is there interesting stories

1:05:36.180 --> 1:05:41.180
 of how a weird or funny or profound ways

1:05:43.020 --> 1:05:45.100
 that led you to get access to a room?

1:05:45.100 --> 1:05:46.860
 Each one is a different adventure.

1:05:46.860 --> 1:05:47.700
 And it's definitely an adventure.

1:05:47.700 --> 1:05:48.540
 It's an adventure.

1:05:48.540 --> 1:05:49.860
 Everyone's an adventure, yeah.

1:05:49.860 --> 1:05:51.980
 Probably one of the easiest ones I ever had

1:05:51.980 --> 1:05:54.980
 in the recent past was for 50 Feet from Syria

1:05:54.980 --> 1:05:59.980
 where I literally broke my hand in a bicycle race.

1:06:01.980 --> 1:06:06.060
 And after many months of trying to get an appointment

1:06:06.060 --> 1:06:09.180
 with an orthopedic hand surgeon, a specialist,

1:06:09.180 --> 1:06:11.700
 I finally did and he was Syrian American.

1:06:11.700 --> 1:06:14.820
 And the Syrian conflict had just begun

1:06:14.820 --> 1:06:16.620
 and we just started talking about it.

1:06:16.620 --> 1:06:21.060
 And after he looked at my hand in the first five minutes,

1:06:21.060 --> 1:06:23.260
 he's like, yeah, you need surgery, great.

1:06:23.260 --> 1:06:25.860
 But then somehow we started talking about Syria

1:06:25.860 --> 1:06:28.380
 and like five minutes in, he just stood up

1:06:28.380 --> 1:06:30.700
 and like put the privacy curtain around us,

1:06:30.700 --> 1:06:33.060
 supposed to be a 15 minute appointment or so.

1:06:33.060 --> 1:06:35.340
 And we talked for an hour, right?

1:06:35.340 --> 1:06:37.380
 So, you know, those moments

1:06:37.380 --> 1:06:40.820
 of sort of mysterious confluence happen, right?

1:06:40.820 --> 1:06:43.340
 And I think you have to be open to them when they do happen

1:06:43.340 --> 1:06:46.700
 because I'm a storyteller, I'm always looking as well, right?

1:06:46.700 --> 1:06:50.460
 So, because he then contacted me later and said,

1:06:50.460 --> 1:06:54.180
 Skye, I am going back to the Syrian border to volunteer

1:06:54.180 --> 1:06:56.580
 as a surgeon, do you want to come with me?

1:06:56.580 --> 1:06:57.460
 That was an easy one.

1:06:57.460 --> 1:06:58.960
 That's probably the easiest one I could give you.

1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:01.220
 But it came out of this interesting moment,

1:07:01.220 --> 1:07:02.900
 very personal moment, right?

1:07:02.900 --> 1:07:05.780
 Lifeboat and Hunger Ward are completely different.

1:07:07.380 --> 1:07:11.340
 And I had to really work hard to gain access

1:07:11.340 --> 1:07:12.420
 to those stories.

1:07:12.420 --> 1:07:14.420
 So you intentionally thought like what,

1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:18.340
 I want to get access to the story.

1:07:18.340 --> 1:07:20.500
 And then what are the different ideas?

1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:24.500
 And they often might involve a doctor or a dentist

1:07:24.500 --> 1:07:29.500
 or just being maybe intentionally and aggressively open

1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:34.320
 to experiences that lead you into the room.

1:07:35.580 --> 1:07:38.900
 So it's funny you mentioned the doctor

1:07:38.900 --> 1:07:41.760
 because I have similar experiences now.

1:07:42.740 --> 1:07:47.740
 I've just gotten access to all kinds of fascinating people

1:07:47.740 --> 1:07:50.000
 in the same way.

1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:50.840
 They're all around us.

1:07:50.840 --> 1:07:52.160
 They're all around us.

1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:53.000
 You just have to look.

1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:53.840
 Yeah, exactly.

1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:55.520
 It's like there's fascinating people everywhere

1:07:55.520 --> 1:07:57.240
 who are doing incredible things,

1:07:57.240 --> 1:07:59.480
 but we have to be open and keep our eyes open

1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:04.160
 and realize that there are amazing human beings everywhere.

1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:07.720
 Yeah, there's networks that connect people

1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:09.080
 just through life.

1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:12.560
 You meet people, you share a beer or a drink

1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:14.800
 or just you fall in love

1:08:14.800 --> 1:08:18.600
 or you share trauma together.

1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:19.920
 You go through a hard time together.

1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:22.560
 And those little sticky things connects us humans.

1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:24.840
 And if you just keep yourself open

1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:27.880
 and embrace the curiosity.

1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:30.040
 And then also the persistence, I suppose.

1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:35.040
 Like how long have you chased access?

1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:39.640
 Does it take days, weeks, months, years?

1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:43.080
 Lex, I'm not the most talented filmmaker in the world.

1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:46.160
 I'm not the smartest guy in the world.

1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:48.200
 I think if there's qualities

1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:50.640
 that have served me well in my career,

1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:53.200
 it's persistence and tenacity, right?

1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:56.960
 I've always been sort of a slow burn human being.

1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:00.240
 Like I would never hit a home run,

1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:03.240
 but I hit a first, right?

1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:04.160
 A single to first,

1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:06.560
 and then I'd hit another single to first.

1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:09.460
 So I ran a marathon when I was 18.

1:09:09.460 --> 1:09:11.520
 And I think that is illustrative

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:14.480
 of sort of how my career has been.

1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:16.040
 I just keep going.

1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:20.640
 And I believe in this notion of incremental evolution

1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:23.980
 that with each project, I try to learn from it

1:09:23.980 --> 1:09:28.160
 and take away lessons learned and improve my craft, right?

1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:33.000
 And improve how I leverage that craft

1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.280
 and improve how I tell the story

1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:37.880
 from a narrative standpoint each time.

1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:41.800
 So that on the next project, it's a little bit better.

1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:43.740
 And that's the arc of my career

1:09:43.740 --> 1:09:47.400
 is learning, learning, evolving, evolving,

1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:50.480
 so that I can make a little better film the next time.

1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:52.420
 How do you gain people's trust?

1:09:53.280 --> 1:09:56.640
 Like for example, there's a line between journalists

1:09:56.640 --> 1:09:58.520
 and documentary filmmakers.

1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:00.320
 Nobody really trusts journalists.

1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:03.840
 Yeah, right, exactly.

1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:06.480
 But a documentary filmmaker,

1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:09.480
 of course I'm joking, half joking.

1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:12.160
 I don't know which percentage joking, but some truth.

1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:15.560
 But documentary filmmaker is a kind of storyteller,

1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:18.880
 an artist, and somehow that's more trustworthy

1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:22.560
 because you're on the same side in some way.

1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:23.400
 I don't know.

1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:25.360
 Maybe on the same side, yeah.

1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:26.640
 Is there something to be said

1:10:26.640 --> 1:10:29.600
 how you gain the trust of people to gain access?

1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:32.820
 Are you just trying to be a good human being?

1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:35.560
 Is there something to be said there?

1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:37.360
 Well, so I do draw a distinction

1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:40.120
 between journalism and filmmaking

1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:42.520
 because I think you're right, they're different.

1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:44.600
 And there are some filmmakers who do hue

1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:47.880
 to sort of the journalistic tenets

1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:49.620
 of who, what, where, when, why,

1:10:49.620 --> 1:10:51.400
 fair and balanced on both sides, right?

1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:52.780
 Make sure everyone has a voice.

1:10:52.780 --> 1:10:53.620
 I don't.

1:10:53.620 --> 1:10:55.080
 If you say fair and balanced,

1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:58.300
 you're rarely either fair or balanced.

1:10:58.300 --> 1:10:59.680
 I've seen that with journalists.

1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:02.800
 Journalists often, unfortunately, in my perspective,

1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:05.520
 sorry to interrupt you rudely and go on a rant,

1:11:05.520 --> 1:11:07.640
 but they seem to have. Go on a rant, do it.

1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:09.760
 They seem to have an agenda.

1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:12.160
 As opposed to seeking to truly tell a story

1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:13.520
 or to truly understand,

1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:18.040
 especially when they're talking to people

1:11:21.280 --> 1:11:24.240
 who have some degree of evil in them.

1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:25.740
 Well, we all have an agenda, right?

1:11:25.740 --> 1:11:27.040
 I think in anything we do,

1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:30.480
 whether it's like to seek truth

1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:32.580
 or some larger principle,

1:11:32.580 --> 1:11:35.980
 I always have an agenda.

1:11:35.980 --> 1:11:40.820
 I chose to work with civilians and caretakers in Yemen

1:11:40.820 --> 1:11:44.660
 on Hunger Ward rather than to go interview MBS, right?

1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:46.900
 That's what I'm interested in

1:11:46.900 --> 1:11:49.240
 is bringing that to the world, right?

1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:55.540
 But in terms of building relationships and trust,

1:11:55.800 --> 1:11:59.100
 it's really, I think about transparency

1:11:59.100 --> 1:12:00.700
 as much as anything else

1:12:00.700 --> 1:12:03.340
 and going in in a collaborative sense.

1:12:03.340 --> 1:12:08.340
 So I don't think of the people

1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:12.580
 that I film with as subjects, for example.

1:12:12.580 --> 1:12:14.340
 I think of them as collaborators.

1:12:14.340 --> 1:12:17.700
 So it's a different mindset that I go into projects with.

1:12:17.700 --> 1:12:18.540
 That's beautiful.

1:12:18.540 --> 1:12:19.900
 And it's based on relationships, right?

1:12:19.900 --> 1:12:22.260
 You have to build relationships with other human beings,

1:12:22.260 --> 1:12:24.920
 however you can, and that takes time

1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:28.660
 and it takes listening and it's active.

1:12:28.660 --> 1:12:32.940
 So I've talked about the notion of consent before,

1:12:32.940 --> 1:12:36.680
 which is so important in nonfiction film.

1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:40.420
 And I hew to this idea that

1:12:42.140 --> 1:12:45.180
 you don't just slide a piece of paper in front of someone,

1:12:45.180 --> 1:12:47.240
 have release form and have them sign it, right?

1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:48.580
 And then you're done.

1:12:48.580 --> 1:12:51.740
 That's not the nature of true consent in my mind.

1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:56.740
 It's you have to work on a foundation of active consent

1:12:56.740 --> 1:12:59.120
 every single day that you're working with someone.

1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:01.240
 And that's based on relationship, right?

1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:02.500
 And it's based on dialogue.

1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:05.800
 So it's trust that I'm always aiming for.

1:13:05.800 --> 1:13:07.760
 It's the building of relationships,

1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:08.620
 which I'm always aiming for,

1:13:08.620 --> 1:13:13.160
 which is why yesterday I got a bunch of photos

1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:15.320
 from Dr. Al Sadiq in the South of Yemen.

1:13:15.320 --> 1:13:17.360
 And she sends me photos all the time

1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:19.920
 of the children that she's currently treating

1:13:19.920 --> 1:13:21.720
 because we have an active relationship

1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:24.560
 that's continues on and probably will

1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:26.160
 for many years to come.

1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:28.360
 So it's going to continue.

1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:32.020
 And that's the only way that I can do these kinds of films.

1:13:32.020 --> 1:13:36.720
 Let me ask you about silly little details of filming.

1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:41.400
 Before we go to the big picture stories,

1:13:42.660 --> 1:13:46.080
 cameras, lenses, how much do those matter?

1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:47.880
 You mentioned director of photography.

1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:52.880
 What's your, how much do you love the feel,

1:13:52.880 --> 1:13:56.940
 the smell of equipment that does the visual filming?

1:13:56.940 --> 1:13:59.100
 You know, there's some people, they're just like,

1:13:59.100 --> 1:14:03.100
 ah, they love lenses.

1:14:03.100 --> 1:14:05.900
 How much do you love that or versus how much

1:14:05.900 --> 1:14:08.220
 do you focus on the story or the access

1:14:08.220 --> 1:14:09.060
 and all those kinds of things?

1:14:09.060 --> 1:14:14.060
 I'm not a tech geek, but because during the bulk

1:14:14.180 --> 1:14:18.460
 of my career, I've worked as a director of photography

1:14:18.460 --> 1:14:21.540
 myself for other people in order to pay the bills

1:14:21.540 --> 1:14:25.660
 over the years, you know, I know the technical side of it

1:14:25.660 --> 1:14:29.040
 because I've had to know it and I've had to train myself

1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:29.880
 and learn it.

1:14:29.880 --> 1:14:33.740
 So I see them as necessary tools.

1:14:33.740 --> 1:14:38.500
 And again, because I believe, you know,

1:14:38.500 --> 1:14:43.140
 film and cinema is and should be visually driven

1:14:43.140 --> 1:14:45.680
 and not verbally driven.

1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:49.460
 I want the best tools possible within my means, right?

1:14:49.460 --> 1:14:53.860
 And within the logistical ability of the project

1:14:53.860 --> 1:14:56.260
 because we have to go so small, right?

1:14:56.260 --> 1:15:00.860
 I can't afford nor can I bring a huge $100,000 lens.

1:15:00.860 --> 1:15:02.820
 So if I gave you a trillion dollars.

1:15:02.820 --> 1:15:03.800
 A trillion dollars?

1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:04.640
 Yeah.

1:15:04.640 --> 1:15:05.480
 Wow.

1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:06.300
 Unlimited.

1:15:06.300 --> 1:15:07.140
 Yeah.

1:15:07.140 --> 1:15:08.460
 There's still huge constraints that have nothing

1:15:08.460 --> 1:15:09.300
 to do with money.

1:15:09.300 --> 1:15:10.140
 Yeah.

1:15:10.140 --> 1:15:10.960
 Like you just said.

1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:11.800
 Yeah.

1:15:11.800 --> 1:15:13.840
 So what cameras would you use?

1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:16.060
 You know what I'd do with a trillion dollars?

1:15:16.060 --> 1:15:16.900
 I could do a lot with a trillion dollars.

1:15:16.900 --> 1:15:17.740
 You're not allowed.

1:15:17.740 --> 1:15:21.740
 You're only allowed to fund the film and no corrupt stuff

1:15:21.740 --> 1:15:24.900
 where you like use the film to actually help children.

1:15:24.900 --> 1:15:26.420
 No, you're not allowed to do any of that.

1:15:26.420 --> 1:15:28.540
 What I would do with a trillion is I wouldn't invest in it.

1:15:28.540 --> 1:15:29.860
 Well, I guess I would invest in current.

1:15:29.860 --> 1:15:33.460
 I would increase capacity to do more films.

1:15:33.460 --> 1:15:34.300
 What I would do.

1:15:34.300 --> 1:15:37.740
 So I would buy basically the perfect little,

1:15:37.740 --> 1:15:40.760
 you know, mini equipment set, right?

1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:43.980
 But then I would train three teams maybe

1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:45.940
 to do the same thing that I've been doing

1:15:45.940 --> 1:15:48.340
 so we could multiply and scale up.

1:15:48.340 --> 1:15:49.300
 More and more stories.

1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:51.060
 Yeah, that's what I would do with the money.

1:15:51.060 --> 1:15:52.500
 But the actual setup.

1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:54.700
 Would remain small and nimble.

1:15:54.700 --> 1:15:55.540
 Yeah.

1:15:56.620 --> 1:15:59.820
 And what about lighting?

1:15:59.820 --> 1:16:01.780
 Do you usually use natural light?

1:16:01.780 --> 1:16:03.120
 Do you ever do?

1:16:04.260 --> 1:16:06.300
 I mean, sorry for the technical questions here,

1:16:06.300 --> 1:16:11.300
 but highlighting the drama of the human face.

1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:12.600
 Yeah.

1:16:13.940 --> 1:16:14.820
 That's the visual.

1:16:14.820 --> 1:16:15.660
 That's art.

1:16:15.660 --> 1:16:20.660
 That's like, to reveal reality at its deepest is art.

1:16:23.060 --> 1:16:24.980
 And do you use lighting?

1:16:24.980 --> 1:16:27.100
 Lighting's such a big part of that.

1:16:27.100 --> 1:16:28.460
 Do you ever do artificial lighting?

1:16:28.460 --> 1:16:30.120
 Do you try to do natural always?

1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:33.260
 You know the best lighting instrument in the world?

1:16:33.260 --> 1:16:34.740
 Is the sun.

1:16:34.740 --> 1:16:37.020
 At the right moment of the day.

1:16:37.020 --> 1:16:40.780
 And so I predominantly use natural light

1:16:40.780 --> 1:16:45.780
 at certain moments and just shape natural light

1:16:49.020 --> 1:16:51.700
 during the course of these small human rights stocks.

1:16:51.700 --> 1:16:54.680
 That's not to say we don't bring instruments sometimes,

1:16:54.680 --> 1:16:59.680
 but when we do, they're very small and again, compact.

1:17:00.020 --> 1:17:05.020
 So for example, I have this small little tube kit

1:17:05.340 --> 1:17:07.020
 that's just three instruments, right?

1:17:07.020 --> 1:17:08.400
 That you can charge with USB.

1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:11.940
 Because electricity is often a major issue where we go.

1:17:11.940 --> 1:17:15.020
 So there's just three little tube lights with magnetic backs

1:17:15.020 --> 1:17:17.780
 that if we find in a situation where, you know,

1:17:17.780 --> 1:17:20.780
 we can't get enough exposure for a hallway or something,

1:17:20.780 --> 1:17:22.800
 and we have the time to throw it up,

1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:24.540
 we'll throw it up if people are walking,

1:17:24.540 --> 1:17:27.140
 if collaborators are walking down that hallway a lot,

1:17:27.140 --> 1:17:29.980
 for example, at night, just so we can see them, right?

1:17:29.980 --> 1:17:31.520
 So it's instances like that.

1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:35.580
 Or if we do do an interview, which we don't do very often,

1:17:35.580 --> 1:17:40.580
 but if we do, just so we have a key light on the face, right?

1:17:40.740 --> 1:17:43.380
 And always bring a reflector or two, you know,

1:17:43.380 --> 1:17:46.820
 just to shape natural light as well in ways.

1:17:46.820 --> 1:17:51.820
 But it's about shaping rather than producing light for us.

1:17:53.060 --> 1:17:55.860
 Got it, as we sit surrounded by black curtains

1:17:55.860 --> 1:17:57.620
 in complete natural light.

1:17:57.620 --> 1:18:02.140
 So just so you know, this room is like a violation

1:18:02.140 --> 1:18:07.140
 of the basic principles of using the sun.

1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:13.120
 So behind the large curtains are giant windows.

1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:13.960
 Yeah.

1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:14.960
 So this whole.

1:18:14.960 --> 1:18:15.800
 Should I rip them open?

1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:19.060
 Should I rip open the curtains real quick?

1:18:19.060 --> 1:18:21.400
 How much of the work is done in the edit?

1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:24.280
 That's another question I'm curious about.

1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:28.880
 And how much do you sort of anticipate that?

1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:30.720
 Like when you're actually shooting,

1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:35.720
 are you thinking of the final story as it appears on screen

1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:40.800
 or are you just collecting, as a human,

1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:42.920
 collecting little bits of story here and there

1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:46.560
 and in the edit is where most of the storytelling happens?

1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:49.400
 I've developed this sort of mental paradigm

1:18:49.400 --> 1:18:53.960
 for myself over the years that speaks to that.

1:18:53.960 --> 1:18:56.720
 And I call it the three creations, right?

1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:00.960
 And so when I'm doing a film, the first creation for me

1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:05.860
 is my preconception or visualization

1:19:05.860 --> 1:19:09.440
 of what the film is going to be before I shoot it, right?

1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:14.440
 So I have this entire vision of what a film's gonna be.

1:19:15.080 --> 1:19:16.920
 And sometimes it can be pretty specific.

1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:18.640
 Like I'll think through the scenes

1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:20.800
 if I know the locations and everything,

1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:24.440
 and I'll have this idea of what I'm gonna create, right?

1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:26.760
 And then I'm there filming, right?

1:19:26.760 --> 1:19:30.960
 And always without fail, reality is something

1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:33.880
 altogether different than what I thought it would be.

1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:35.520
 But it's still good to have the original idea.

1:19:35.520 --> 1:19:38.560
 Yeah, yeah, but if I tried to hold to that original vision,

1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:41.400
 right, and to create a film out of that idea,

1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:43.440
 they'd be crap, all the films would be crap.

1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:46.200
 So I have to adapt, I have to evolve my approach

1:19:46.200 --> 1:19:49.880
 and then embrace what is actually occurring

1:19:49.880 --> 1:19:53.060
 with the people actually doing it and then reenvision.

1:19:53.060 --> 1:19:55.180
 So that reenvision is very active

1:19:55.180 --> 1:19:57.120
 during the entire filming process.

1:19:57.120 --> 1:19:58.960
 And so that's the second creation,

1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:02.880
 that's the rethinking and revisualizing

1:20:02.880 --> 1:20:05.720
 based on what we're actually experiencing and seeing

1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:08.000
 what this film is going to be.

1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:11.380
 And then I finished filming, right?

1:20:11.380 --> 1:20:13.080
 And we bring the hard drives back

1:20:13.080 --> 1:20:16.600
 and we plug in the hard drives in the edit bay.

1:20:16.600 --> 1:20:20.420
 And oftentimes, because it's two of us filming

1:20:20.420 --> 1:20:23.720
 most of the time, I haven't seen all the footage.

1:20:23.720 --> 1:20:26.920
 Because in the field, it's all about just filming, right?

1:20:26.920 --> 1:20:28.740
 And then just transferring the footage

1:20:28.740 --> 1:20:31.840
 and getting on safely, you know, clone to multiple drives.

1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:33.600
 I don't have a chance to review everything.

1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:36.400
 I can't do rushes like you do on a large feature.

1:20:36.400 --> 1:20:38.480
 So because I'm filming half of it,

1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:40.800
 I know what I've filmed, right?

1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:42.200
 But I haven't seen everything

1:20:42.200 --> 1:20:45.080
 the director of photography has filmed, right?

1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:50.080
 So the next stage for me is reviewing every single frame

1:20:50.080 --> 1:20:51.920
 of what's been filmed.

1:20:51.920 --> 1:20:56.040
 And that's where discovery happens the third time, right?

1:20:56.040 --> 1:20:57.760
 Or the second time rather is,

1:20:57.760 --> 1:21:01.580
 wow, now I thought we'd filmed this,

1:21:01.580 --> 1:21:05.040
 but actually there's this over here.

1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:07.400
 And then I have to open up this second vision

1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:10.080
 and turn it and transform it into a third vision

1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:12.880
 for the film based on what's actually on the hard drive.

1:21:12.880 --> 1:21:15.640
 So is this like a daily process?

1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:17.880
 So what I do, my process is that

1:21:17.880 --> 1:21:21.040
 if it's a really difficult project,

1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:23.400
 I'll take a break before I go through this

1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:25.160
 just for healing, you know,

1:21:25.160 --> 1:21:27.400
 and some space away and fresh eyes.

1:21:27.400 --> 1:21:29.120
 And usually that's about a month.

1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:32.480
 And then once I reengage, I reengage whole hog,

1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:37.140
 I reengage fully and I review every single frame.

1:21:37.140 --> 1:21:40.560
 And as I do that, I create a spreadsheet.

1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:43.240
 And for Hunger War, that spreadsheet was,

1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:45.880
 I don't know, 1500 lines long or something

1:21:45.880 --> 1:21:48.100
 where it's basically log notes.

1:21:48.100 --> 1:21:51.320
 And I watch every scene and I take notes

1:21:51.320 --> 1:21:54.200
 and I know really what we have.

1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:55.880
 And once I've gone through that process

1:21:55.880 --> 1:21:57.320
 that takes about a month

1:21:57.320 --> 1:21:59.880
 and I really know what we came back with,

1:21:59.880 --> 1:22:02.800
 I create an outline for the film from that.

1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:04.780
 And that's the third visioning, right?

1:22:05.720 --> 1:22:07.580
 That's usually completely different

1:22:07.580 --> 1:22:10.800
 than my original vision for the film to some extent, right?

1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:14.280
 But I have to stay open to that entire process

1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:17.080
 or I'd be trying to create something

1:22:17.080 --> 1:22:19.640
 that I can't really create.

1:22:19.640 --> 1:22:22.680
 So I think those are the three creations for me.

1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:25.820
 That's so cool to know what we have,

1:22:27.500 --> 1:22:31.960
 just to lay it all out and to load it in into your mind.

1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:35.820
 Cause like, this is the capture of reality we have.

1:22:35.820 --> 1:22:37.820
 It's a very kind of scientific process too.

1:22:37.820 --> 1:22:39.480
 Cause you know, in science,

1:22:39.480 --> 1:22:41.880
 you collect a bunch of data about a phenomena

1:22:41.880 --> 1:22:43.700
 and now you have to like analyze that data,

1:22:43.700 --> 1:22:46.040
 but now your phenomena is long gone.

1:22:46.040 --> 1:22:46.960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.

1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:47.800
 Now you just have the data.

1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:51.240
 Just the data and you have to write a paper about it,

1:22:51.240 --> 1:22:54.000
 like analyze the data, it's similar things.

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:55.440
 You have to like load it all in.

1:22:55.440 --> 1:22:56.900
 Where's the story?

1:22:56.900 --> 1:23:01.900
 How do you, that last probably profound piece

1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:07.060
 of doing the editing, like in your mind,

1:23:07.060 --> 1:23:10.240
 like how to lay those things out?

1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:12.200
 Well, it's almost like the scientific process, right?

1:23:12.200 --> 1:23:15.320
 I have a hypothesis, a creative hypothesis, right?

1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:17.040
 Not a scientific one.

1:23:17.040 --> 1:23:19.080
 But then I'm testing the hypothesis

1:23:19.080 --> 1:23:20.960
 during the course of filming, right?

1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:24.280
 And I have to stay true to what the data tells me

1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:25.740
 in the end creatively.

1:23:25.740 --> 1:23:27.520
 So it's very similar to the scientific processes.

1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:30.200
 I don't know what we should, we should probably coin that.

1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:31.200
 Yeah, that's pretty good.

1:23:31.200 --> 1:23:34.660
 Creative scientific process or something like that.

1:23:34.660 --> 1:23:38.260
 But then you actually do the edit and then you watch,

1:23:38.260 --> 1:23:41.300
 that's also iterative in a sense,

1:23:41.300 --> 1:23:45.200
 because maybe when you have a film,

1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:48.440
 that's 20, 30, 40 minutes, or if it's feature length,

1:23:50.260 --> 1:23:54.600
 like do you ever have it where it sucks?

1:23:54.600 --> 1:23:55.440
 Like it's not at all.

1:23:55.440 --> 1:23:56.720
 Is there a stage where it sucks?

1:23:56.720 --> 1:23:58.720
 Like a stage where, right, right.

1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:01.380
 Like it's where it's like, no, this is not,

1:24:01.380 --> 1:24:03.900
 this is not what I was, like when it's all put together

1:24:03.900 --> 1:24:07.000
 in this way, this doesn't, this is not working right.

1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:08.780
 This is not right.

1:24:08.780 --> 1:24:12.100
 Or do you, is it always like an incremental step

1:24:12.100 --> 1:24:13.000
 towards better and better?

1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:13.920
 It's incremental.

1:24:13.920 --> 1:24:14.920
 Yeah, it's incremental.

1:24:14.920 --> 1:24:18.360
 Yeah, and there's always some moment in the editing process

1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:19.960
 where there's a breakthrough,

1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:24.360
 where suddenly I understand how it fits together more fully.

1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:26.120
 And you have to be, like you said, resilient.

1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:28.560
 You have to be patient that that moment will come.

1:24:28.560 --> 1:24:29.480
 Yeah, exactly.

1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:31.440
 Are you ultra self critical

1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:35.400
 or are you generally optimistic and patient?

1:24:35.400 --> 1:24:38.520
 I don't think those are mutually exclusive.

1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:40.240
 Right, so you just oscillate

1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:42.440
 or are they like dance partners or something?

1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:44.120
 They're dance partners, yeah.

1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:47.400
 Definitely dancing all the way through the process.

1:24:47.400 --> 1:24:51.460
 By way of advice, you know, to young filmmakers,

1:24:52.680 --> 1:24:57.680
 how to film something that is recognized

1:24:58.380 --> 1:25:00.600
 by the world in some way.

1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:05.340
 I would say, you know, first off, learn your craft, right?

1:25:05.340 --> 1:25:10.340
 Because I think craft is incredibly foundational, right?

1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:14.440
 To creating a powerful story.

1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:16.560
 And sorry to interrupt, but when you say craft,

1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:18.740
 do you mean just the raw technical,

1:25:18.740 --> 1:25:21.760
 the director of photography, like the filming aspect?

1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:24.480
 Is it the storytelling, is it the access, the whole thing?

1:25:24.480 --> 1:25:25.920
 I think craft is more than just knowing

1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:28.720
 how to push record on a camera or what lens to use, right?

1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:30.480
 That's part of it, right?

1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:35.080
 But I think at least in nonfiction,

1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:38.640
 you know, I'm a product to some extent

1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:42.560
 of having to know how to do it all, right?

1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:44.720
 Having to teach myself how to do it all.

1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:47.020
 Because I didn't go to film school, you know?

1:25:48.020 --> 1:25:53.020
 But I became so enamored of telling stories through a camera.

1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:55.720
 What was the leap, by the way,

1:25:55.720 --> 1:25:57.960
 from theater to storyteller?

1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:00.880
 Oh, I just needed an extra class in grad school.

1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:03.760
 I was in a MFA directing class

1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:06.240
 and I needed an extra class and I just sort of like

1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:09.720
 talked my way into a television directing class

1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:11.720
 and fell in love with it.

1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:14.160
 And the actor became the director.

1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:15.500
 Yeah, yeah.

1:26:15.500 --> 1:26:18.200
 Well, yeah, I mean, I wasn't an actor,

1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:21.640
 but I had to act and I had to know the craft of acting

1:26:21.640 --> 1:26:22.960
 because I was in the theater, you know,

1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:24.720
 to work with actors. Did you love it, though?

1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:27.000
 Did you love acting? The theater?

1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:28.180
 Yeah, theater?

1:26:28.180 --> 1:26:30.820
 The first, yeah, as an undergraduate, yeah.

1:26:30.820 --> 1:26:32.040
 But then I learned pretty quickly

1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:36.440
 that I was pretty bad at it, or at least not very good,

1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:39.320
 and that my skills lay elsewhere

1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:42.520
 in more sort of behind the scenes and shaping a story.

1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:45.560
 When you started taking a class,

1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:48.760
 but also telling stories as a director,

1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:53.760
 did you quickly realize that you're pretty good at this

1:26:53.760 --> 1:26:55.100
 or was it a grind?

1:26:56.080 --> 1:26:58.680
 That's a good question, Max.

1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:02.280
 I think, I definitely knew right away

1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:05.440
 that it was more my wheelhouse, right?

1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:07.360
 And I think part of that was because

1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:13.200
 I grew up in sort of a world of imagination.

1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:18.040
 And I think that active imagination as a child

1:27:18.040 --> 1:27:21.080
 really lent itself well to the skillset

1:27:21.080 --> 1:27:23.960
 that a director needs, right?

1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:26.760
 To shape story, to shape narrative, to shape performances.

1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:29.640
 So I think it was a much more natural fit for me.

1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:31.840
 Was I excellent at the beginning?

1:27:31.840 --> 1:27:36.000
 Heck no, no, I think few people are, but I learned.

1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:37.920
 Where was the biggest struggle for you?

1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:41.600
 Is it, so your imagination clearly was something

1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:43.600
 that you worked on for a lifetime.

1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:46.480
 So I'm sure that was pretty strong.

1:27:46.480 --> 1:27:47.920
 Books, came from books.

1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:49.320
 Books.

1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:52.000
 But the actual conversion of the imagination,

1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:53.960
 you said shape the story.

1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:56.840
 Where was the skill most lacking

1:27:56.840 --> 1:27:59.080
 in the shaping of the story initially?

1:27:59.080 --> 1:27:59.920
 Technical side.

1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:00.760
 Just technical side.

1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:01.580
 Yeah, like, you know,

1:28:01.580 --> 1:28:03.840
 cause I taught myself everything.

1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:05.640
 What kind of microphone should I use, right?

1:28:05.640 --> 1:28:06.480
 What kind of camera?

1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:07.560
 What does this lens do?

1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:08.720
 What's that lens do?

1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:10.100
 I didn't know any of that.

1:28:10.100 --> 1:28:11.440
 And so I essentially was,

1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:14.200
 I have been self taught, technically.

1:28:14.200 --> 1:28:15.600
 How do you get good technically,

1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:16.840
 would you say, when you're self taught?

1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:18.240
 Just doing it over and over again.

1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:20.840
 And what kind of stories were you telling?

1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:24.280
 I began shooting local commercials for.

1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:25.160
 For money?

1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:26.000
 For money, yeah, yeah.

1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.840
 So you're doing professional projects?

1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:28.680
 Yeah, yeah.

1:28:28.680 --> 1:28:31.240
 And so I kind of learned on the job as I did it.

1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:32.840
 How many hobby projects did you do,

1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:34.080
 just for the hell of it?

1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:35.880
 Or were you trying to focus on the professional?

1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:37.320
 Well, I was trying to make money, right?

1:28:37.320 --> 1:28:39.400
 Right out of grad school, just to pay the rent.

1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:42.440
 And that's a forcing function to,

1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:45.680
 I mean, I personally love having my back to the wall

1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:48.920
 or financially you're screwed if you don't succeed.

1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:50.480
 So that's nice.

1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:51.960
 I mean, I lived out of the trunk of my car

1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:53.720
 for a couple of years after grad school,

1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:56.360
 just freelancing, just like,

1:28:56.360 --> 1:29:00.320
 but that couple of years really helped me learn fast

1:29:00.320 --> 1:29:02.480
 because I had to learn fast.

1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:05.880
 So I did a couple of voyages around the world

1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:08.160
 for this group called Semester at Sea,

1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:09.580
 that is a floating university

1:29:09.580 --> 1:29:11.880
 that where they go out three and a half months at a time

1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:15.120
 with about 500 college level students

1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:16.520
 and about 35 professors.

1:29:16.520 --> 1:29:19.480
 And so you're shooting every day for three and a half months

1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:20.760
 in like nine different countries.

1:29:20.760 --> 1:29:25.240
 And so that really was like instrumental to me

1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:27.680
 becoming a pretty good camera person pretty quickly.

1:29:27.680 --> 1:29:29.240
 And you were doing most of the work yourself?

1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:31.240
 One man, one man band, yeah.

1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:35.440
 The second voyage, I at least had an editor with me.

1:29:35.440 --> 1:29:36.920
 Yeah, but I was shooting everything.

1:29:36.920 --> 1:29:38.800
 Yeah, what's the perfect team?

1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:43.640
 Is it two people for nonfiction asking for a friend?

1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:45.840
 Some kind of interested in some storytelling,

1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:50.040
 not of the level and the sophistication that you're doing,

1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:51.040
 but more.

1:29:51.040 --> 1:29:52.400
 I think you have to allow the story

1:29:52.400 --> 1:29:54.280
 to dictate what the size of the film should be.

1:29:54.280 --> 1:29:55.980
 For these small human rights docs I do,

1:29:55.980 --> 1:29:59.600
 I think two or three, it means you work your butt off,

1:29:59.600 --> 1:30:01.360
 because you're doing everything, right?

1:30:01.360 --> 1:30:03.640
 But it allows you to tell intimate stories

1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:04.560
 and have that access.

1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:08.560
 I'm doing a film this summer that's a scripted piece

1:30:08.560 --> 1:30:10.520
 where we'll probably have 25 crew people.

1:30:10.520 --> 1:30:11.360
 Oh, wow.

1:30:11.360 --> 1:30:14.520
 So it's a completely different endeavor altogether.

1:30:14.520 --> 1:30:18.560
 But doing it yourself, what do you think about that?

1:30:18.560 --> 1:30:21.360
 Even though you have that trillion dollars.

1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:23.040
 Oh, I have that trillion dollars again?

1:30:23.040 --> 1:30:25.160
 Sweet, you can write that check before I leave, right?

1:30:25.160 --> 1:30:26.000
 Yeah, I will.

1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:26.820
 Okay, great.

1:30:26.820 --> 1:30:30.280
 I've never seen a check for that big.

1:30:30.280 --> 1:30:31.120
 It's gonna be interesting.

1:30:31.120 --> 1:30:31.960
 How many zeros is that?

1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:36.160
 I write them so often, I've lost track.

1:30:36.160 --> 1:30:38.280
 Or the United States government sure as heck

1:30:38.280 --> 1:30:39.360
 writes them often.

1:30:39.360 --> 1:30:42.240
 Okay, anyway, I mean, is there an argument

1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:44.840
 can you steel man the case for a single person?

1:30:44.840 --> 1:30:49.320
 Not for me, not for me, and here's why.

1:30:53.640 --> 1:30:58.640
 What I've found is that by being a team of two filming

1:31:01.580 --> 1:31:03.880
 with a field producer, by two people filming,

1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:10.440
 it allows us to double our footage first off, right?

1:31:10.440 --> 1:31:13.240
 So we have twice as much footage in the time

1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:14.980
 we're filming to come back with as opposed

1:31:14.980 --> 1:31:15.820
 to one person filming.

1:31:15.820 --> 1:31:18.360
 So you're each manning a camera?

1:31:18.360 --> 1:31:19.840
 Yeah, constantly.

1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:22.800
 And how much, sorry to keep interrupting,

1:31:22.800 --> 1:31:25.240
 how much interaction and interplay there is?

1:31:25.240 --> 1:31:28.160
 Sometimes the director of photography is in another room

1:31:28.160 --> 1:31:30.020
 filming a different scene, if it makes sense.

1:31:30.020 --> 1:31:32.760
 Sometimes we're cross shooting in the same room, right?

1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:35.400
 Just depends on the needs of the moment.

1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:38.040
 So we come back with double the footage is one thing.

1:31:38.040 --> 1:31:40.480
 But as a director, so that's, you know,

1:31:40.480 --> 1:31:45.240
 given how access is sometimes shaped by the events

1:31:45.240 --> 1:31:47.800
 so that we can only, something, you know,

1:31:47.800 --> 1:31:49.680
 in Lifeboat, for example, you know,

1:31:49.680 --> 1:31:52.880
 a rescue operation may only happen three days, right?

1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:55.000
 So you want as much footage of that as you can.

1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:57.360
 But the other piece of it that's really critical for me,

1:31:57.360 --> 1:32:00.360
 I found is that by having another human being

1:32:00.360 --> 1:32:02.760
 I'm filming with, who I'm co shooting with,

1:32:02.760 --> 1:32:05.860
 it frees me up as a director to not always

1:32:05.860 --> 1:32:07.480
 have to be shooting either.

1:32:07.480 --> 1:32:11.560
 I can do all the other work to build relationships, right?

1:32:11.560 --> 1:32:14.040
 To have side conversations with people,

1:32:14.040 --> 1:32:18.680
 to sort out the right way to tell a story, right?

1:32:18.680 --> 1:32:21.600
 Or to transfer footage, knowing that the director

1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:23.360
 of photography is still filming during all that.

1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:26.460
 So it frees me up to think of as a director

1:32:26.460 --> 1:32:29.960
 rather than just an image acquirer.

1:32:29.960 --> 1:32:32.440
 Yeah, cause there's also, I don't know how distracting it is.

1:32:32.440 --> 1:32:35.640
 You've obviously done it for years, but setting stuff up,

1:32:35.640 --> 1:32:40.640
 it preoccupies your mind.

1:32:40.640 --> 1:32:42.480
 Like pressing the record button,

1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:43.960
 and like framing stuff and all that,

1:32:43.960 --> 1:32:46.440
 that still takes up some part of your mind

1:32:46.440 --> 1:32:48.240
 where you can't think freely.

1:32:48.240 --> 1:32:49.480
 That's my choice, right?

1:32:49.480 --> 1:32:51.040
 That's how I work best.

1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:53.040
 That said, the caveat there would be

1:32:53.040 --> 1:32:55.000
 that's not the only way to do it, obviously, right?

1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:58.960
 Like one of my favorite documentaries of all time

1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:03.920
 is a documentary called A Woman Captured, shot in Hungary,

1:33:03.920 --> 1:33:07.120
 by a single filmmaker with a single camera

1:33:07.120 --> 1:33:09.480
 with a single lens, right?

1:33:09.480 --> 1:33:12.160
 And it's brilliant, and powerful,

1:33:12.160 --> 1:33:16.080
 and moving, and interventional.

1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:19.320
 It's incredible filmmaking, and it was a single human being

1:33:19.320 --> 1:33:23.480
 who created that film with a collaborator or subject.

1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:26.800
 So it can be done, it's just not how I work best.

1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:29.980
 Yeah, how much personally would the other person,

1:33:29.980 --> 1:33:34.180
 how important is the relationship with them

1:33:34.180 --> 1:33:36.360
 outside of the filming?

1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:37.200
 Like.

1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:38.020
 With the director of photography?

1:33:38.020 --> 1:33:39.620
 The director of photography, say.

1:33:39.620 --> 1:33:44.500
 Like, how much drinking, and if you don't drink,

1:33:44.500 --> 1:33:46.060
 whatever the equivalent of that is,

1:33:46.060 --> 1:33:47.580
 do you have to do together?

1:33:47.580 --> 1:33:48.940
 How much soul searching?

1:33:48.940 --> 1:33:52.460
 Or is it more like two surgeons getting together?

1:33:52.460 --> 1:33:55.940
 Is it surgeons, or is it a jazz band?

1:33:55.940 --> 1:33:57.980
 Well, it could be either, right?

1:33:57.980 --> 1:33:59.240
 Hopefully not at the same time, though,

1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:00.980
 because I don't think surgeons and jazz bands

1:34:00.980 --> 1:34:02.580
 go well together, probably.

1:34:02.580 --> 1:34:05.740
 They're both good with fingers, I suppose.

1:34:05.740 --> 1:34:08.220
 Exactly, but I'd rather maybe not play jazz

1:34:08.220 --> 1:34:09.860
 while they operate on me.

1:34:09.860 --> 1:34:14.860
 But I think, for me, I think there are moments of both,

1:34:15.500 --> 1:34:17.580
 but usually not at the same time, right?

1:34:17.580 --> 1:34:20.860
 There are surgical moments where the moment is so pressing,

1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:25.000
 you really have to be that task driven, right?

1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.100
 To capture as thoroughly as possible

1:34:27.100 --> 1:34:29.300
 whatever's unfolding, right?

1:34:29.300 --> 1:34:30.380
 But I think there's other times

1:34:30.380 --> 1:34:32.880
 where you do improvise like jazz, right?

1:34:32.880 --> 1:34:35.940
 And where you have a lot of choices ahead of you,

1:34:35.940 --> 1:34:38.780
 and you're doing maybe a dance

1:34:38.780 --> 1:34:41.060
 with the other camera person, right?

1:34:41.060 --> 1:34:43.220
 In order to capture a scene as creatively

1:34:43.220 --> 1:34:47.420
 and fully as possible during a fixed duration.

1:34:47.420 --> 1:34:51.340
 How much, you said shaping, because it is nonfiction.

1:34:51.340 --> 1:34:53.380
 But I feel like there's so many ways

1:34:53.380 --> 1:34:55.420
 to tell the same nonfiction,

1:34:55.420 --> 1:34:57.820
 that is bordering on fiction.

1:34:57.820 --> 1:34:58.660
 Yeah.

1:34:58.660 --> 1:35:01.100
 Well, it's storytelling.

1:35:03.060 --> 1:35:08.060
 And how much shaping do you see yourself as doing?

1:35:08.820 --> 1:35:10.300
 Like how important is your role?

1:35:10.300 --> 1:35:11.640
 How you tell the story?

1:35:14.620 --> 1:35:16.460
 I suppose the question I'm asking is,

1:35:16.460 --> 1:35:18.660
 how many ways can you really screw this up?

1:35:20.420 --> 1:35:21.980
 Every day you can screw it up.

1:35:22.860 --> 1:35:24.780
 I mean, that's really the,

1:35:24.780 --> 1:35:25.980
 I think what you're asking about

1:35:25.980 --> 1:35:29.540
 is really the ethos of documentary filmmaking, right?

1:35:29.540 --> 1:35:32.580
 I allow a lot of things to guide my choices.

1:35:34.100 --> 1:35:38.100
 One of them being, am I being fair, right?

1:35:38.100 --> 1:35:43.100
 Not balanced, but am I being fair to what I'm witnessing?

1:35:43.460 --> 1:35:46.420
 Does the camera capturing in a fair way

1:35:46.420 --> 1:35:48.580
 the truth of the reality?

1:35:48.580 --> 1:35:49.420
 Some fundamental truth of it.

1:35:49.420 --> 1:35:51.620
 And it also speaks to consent, right?

1:35:51.620 --> 1:35:53.900
 Am I being fair in a sense of consent?

1:35:53.900 --> 1:35:56.460
 Do I have active consent in this moment, right?

1:35:56.460 --> 1:35:58.620
 Regardless of whether I have a signed piece of paper.

1:35:58.620 --> 1:36:00.300
 I always find some way to document it,

1:36:00.300 --> 1:36:02.420
 whether it's just direct address to camera

1:36:02.420 --> 1:36:05.460
 or a translated release.

1:36:05.460 --> 1:36:07.740
 So there's, actually that's an interesting little,

1:36:07.740 --> 1:36:10.620
 so they say something to the camera that they consent

1:36:10.620 --> 1:36:12.060
 or they sign the thing.

1:36:12.060 --> 1:36:16.740
 Yeah, so for example, the large broadcast companies

1:36:16.740 --> 1:36:18.300
 have this formalized process

1:36:18.300 --> 1:36:21.580
 where they present a piece of paper, right?

1:36:21.580 --> 1:36:25.180
 And the subject reads it and they sign it

1:36:25.180 --> 1:36:28.860
 and then you have permission and that's irrevocable, right?

1:36:28.860 --> 1:36:30.820
 So it'll hold up in court.

1:36:30.820 --> 1:36:32.820
 That's not how I operate, right?

1:36:32.820 --> 1:36:37.820
 And so it's just, for example, that doesn't work

1:36:38.340 --> 1:36:39.700
 if someone's illiterate

1:36:39.700 --> 1:36:42.020
 and can't read that piece of paper, right?

1:36:42.020 --> 1:36:44.300
 What if they don't know how to sign their name, right?

1:36:44.300 --> 1:36:46.300
 So instead you have to have a conversation,

1:36:47.580 --> 1:36:49.420
 ask questions, have them ask questions,

1:36:49.420 --> 1:36:51.580
 come to a complete understanding

1:36:51.580 --> 1:36:53.700
 before you even know whether they understand

1:36:53.700 --> 1:36:54.940
 what you're asking, right?

1:36:54.940 --> 1:36:57.220
 And then in that case, if someone's illiterate,

1:36:57.220 --> 1:36:58.860
 then you have that conversation,

1:36:58.860 --> 1:37:00.980
 you just sit down and it takes a long time sometimes,

1:37:00.980 --> 1:37:01.820
 but you have to do it.

1:37:01.820 --> 1:37:04.420
 And then if they still wanna participate

1:37:04.420 --> 1:37:06.540
 and they give you their consent,

1:37:06.540 --> 1:37:08.580
 they can't sign a piece of paper, right?

1:37:08.580 --> 1:37:11.780
 So then you just do in their native language, right?

1:37:11.780 --> 1:37:14.220
 Direct consent to camera in their language.

1:37:14.220 --> 1:37:16.340
 Interesting, but also you're speaking to the consent

1:37:16.340 --> 1:37:19.700
 that's just a human placing trust in you.

1:37:19.700 --> 1:37:20.540
 Yeah.

1:37:20.540 --> 1:37:21.380
 You make a connection like this.

1:37:21.380 --> 1:37:23.220
 That's the most important consent, yeah.

1:37:23.220 --> 1:37:27.980
 I hate papers, I hate papers and lawyers

1:37:28.860 --> 1:37:31.420
 because they, exactly for that reason,

1:37:31.420 --> 1:37:35.220
 yeah, okay, great, but you should be focusing

1:37:35.220 --> 1:37:39.060
 on the human connection that leads to the trust,

1:37:39.060 --> 1:37:41.620
 like real consent and consent day to day,

1:37:41.620 --> 1:37:43.740
 minute to minute, because that can change.

1:37:43.740 --> 1:37:46.980
 Absolutely, and it does change.

1:37:46.980 --> 1:37:49.220
 You mentioned A Woman Captured.

1:37:51.340 --> 1:37:54.100
 I'm sure you can't answer that, but I will force you.

1:37:54.100 --> 1:37:58.340
 What are the top three documentaries of all time,

1:37:58.340 --> 1:38:00.140
 short or feature length?

1:38:00.140 --> 1:38:01.180
 Oh boy.

1:38:01.180 --> 1:38:04.220
 This is not your opinion, this is objective truth.

1:38:05.780 --> 1:38:09.300
 Maybe top one, what's the greatest?

1:38:09.300 --> 1:38:14.300
 We got, let's see, March of the Penguins.

1:38:14.300 --> 1:38:15.860
 That's probably number one for me.

1:38:15.860 --> 1:38:16.700
 Really?

1:38:16.700 --> 1:38:17.740
 No, I'm just kidding, I don't know.

1:38:17.740 --> 1:38:22.740
 I do seem to, the metaphor of penguins

1:38:23.180 --> 1:38:28.180
 huddling together in hard, cold,

1:38:28.820 --> 1:38:32.460
 like in the harsh conditions of nature,

1:38:32.460 --> 1:38:34.940
 that's something that's kind of beautiful.

1:38:34.940 --> 1:38:37.140
 I don't love all nature documentaries,

1:38:37.140 --> 1:38:40.380
 but something about March of the Penguins.

1:38:40.380 --> 1:38:42.580
 I think Morgan Freeman.

1:38:42.580 --> 1:38:43.500
 Yeah, he narrated it.

1:38:43.500 --> 1:38:45.180
 Narrates it, so maybe everything,

1:38:45.180 --> 1:38:47.820
 just any documentary with Morgan Freeman,

1:38:47.820 --> 1:38:49.180
 I'm a sucker for that.

1:38:50.300 --> 1:38:54.180
 Warner, Herzog, The Life and the Taiga, The Simple People.

1:38:54.180 --> 1:38:56.980
 I love Grizzly Man, I love Grizzly Man.

1:38:56.980 --> 1:38:59.020
 I think that's one of his best works.

1:38:59.020 --> 1:39:03.180
 Yes, I think that's Joe Rogan's favorite documentary.

1:39:04.340 --> 1:39:06.860
 It's both comedy and, I mean it's.

1:39:06.860 --> 1:39:07.700
 Tragic comedy.

1:39:07.700 --> 1:39:09.900
 Tragic comedy, yeah.

1:39:09.900 --> 1:39:11.740
 Is there something that stands out to you,

1:39:11.740 --> 1:39:13.900
 I mean I'm joking about best,

1:39:13.900 --> 1:39:15.740
 something that was impactful to you?

1:39:15.740 --> 1:39:16.660
 Just to put it out there,

1:39:16.660 --> 1:39:19.060
 I don't think there's any way to say

1:39:19.060 --> 1:39:22.420
 that they're objectively the best three documentaries

1:39:22.420 --> 1:39:23.660
 of all time, but for me,

1:39:23.660 --> 1:39:25.660
 and you may find this interesting given your background,

1:39:25.660 --> 1:39:30.660
 is that I think my top three are all

1:39:32.140 --> 1:39:35.540
 from the Eastern Bloc, actually.

1:39:35.540 --> 1:39:40.540
 So Aquarella by Viktor Kosokovsky is one of my favorite,

1:39:41.980 --> 1:39:43.780
 and it's a couple years old now,

1:39:43.780 --> 1:39:47.420
 which is sort of a meditation on the place water has

1:39:47.420 --> 1:39:49.100
 on our planet and on our lives.

1:39:50.580 --> 1:39:53.340
 I think A Woman Captured that I mentioned,

1:39:53.340 --> 1:39:54.580
 which was shot in Hungary.

1:39:54.580 --> 1:39:56.220
 Is it a feature length one?

1:39:56.220 --> 1:39:58.500
 Both are feature lengths, yeah.

1:39:58.500 --> 1:40:00.540
 It is just brilliant,

1:40:00.540 --> 1:40:05.340
 and it I think has yet to find distribution here in the U.S.

1:40:05.340 --> 1:40:09.540
 But it's the perfect example of what they call verite,

1:40:09.540 --> 1:40:13.380
 or direct nonfiction filmmaking.

1:40:13.380 --> 1:40:15.620
 A European woman, this is the synopsis,

1:40:15.620 --> 1:40:17.660
 a European woman has been kept by a family

1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:20.140
 as a domestic slave for 10 years,

1:40:20.140 --> 1:40:23.580
 drawing courage from the filmmaker's presence.

1:40:23.580 --> 1:40:27.300
 She decides to escape the unbearable oppression

1:40:27.300 --> 1:40:28.620
 and become a free person.

1:40:28.620 --> 1:40:32.540
 Wow, so the filmmaker is part of the story.

1:40:32.540 --> 1:40:34.740
 Part of the story, it didn't start that way,

1:40:34.740 --> 1:40:36.340
 but during the course of the story,

1:40:36.340 --> 1:40:39.540
 the filmmaker comes to understand

1:40:39.540 --> 1:40:41.940
 that this is actually modern day slavery.

1:40:41.940 --> 1:40:45.380
 And rather than just allow it to be,

1:40:45.380 --> 1:40:48.420
 actually enables and assists this woman

1:40:48.420 --> 1:40:51.020
 to free herself from slavery and become a free woman.

1:40:51.020 --> 1:40:52.660
 I wonder, sorry, on a small tangent

1:40:52.660 --> 1:40:53.700
 before we get to number three,

1:40:53.700 --> 1:40:55.740
 like Icarus is interesting too.

1:40:57.060 --> 1:41:00.980
 How often do you become part of the story,

1:41:00.980 --> 1:41:04.740
 or the story is different because of your presence?

1:41:06.060 --> 1:41:10.140
 Like you changed the tide of history.

1:41:10.140 --> 1:41:12.740
 Yeah, well, back to just like one person at a time

1:41:12.740 --> 1:41:13.580
 that we keep talking,

1:41:13.580 --> 1:41:16.980
 we keep coming back to that theme on some level.

1:41:16.980 --> 1:41:19.180
 So this could tie in interesting

1:41:19.180 --> 1:41:21.180
 to one of my favorite films actually.

1:41:21.180 --> 1:41:24.780
 So the last two films that I would mention

1:41:24.780 --> 1:41:26.660
 for my top four list would be,

1:41:26.660 --> 1:41:28.300
 the third Eastern Bloc one

1:41:28.300 --> 1:41:31.940
 would be a film called Immortal in 2019,

1:41:31.940 --> 1:41:34.500
 which was shot in Russia by a Russian woman

1:41:35.460 --> 1:41:39.380
 that sort of examines the place of the state

1:41:41.620 --> 1:41:46.020
 in shaping individuals to be vehicles for the state.

1:41:46.020 --> 1:41:47.220
 I mean, that's my own synopsis,

1:41:47.220 --> 1:41:49.100
 but that's one of my takeaways

1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:52.180
 from the brilliant 60 minute doc or so.

1:41:52.180 --> 1:41:57.180
 Again, Russian filmmaking is really quite good and powerful.

1:41:57.180 --> 1:41:59.900
 The fourth one would be a Frederick Wiseman film,

1:41:59.900 --> 1:42:04.900
 Titicate Follies, which was filmed in the US decades ago,

1:42:04.900 --> 1:42:09.220
 inside basically the bowels of an insane asylum

1:42:09.220 --> 1:42:11.180
 or a mental health institution.

1:42:11.180 --> 1:42:16.180
 And I bring up Wiseman because he is really the godfather,

1:42:17.420 --> 1:42:21.900
 so to speak, of direct cinema or cinema verite.

1:42:21.900 --> 1:42:25.260
 And when early in my career,

1:42:25.260 --> 1:42:29.700
 I really believed in what he expressed

1:42:29.700 --> 1:42:32.940
 as the place of the verite filmmaker,

1:42:32.940 --> 1:42:36.380
 which is simply fly on the wall,

1:42:36.380 --> 1:42:41.140
 which is only observational in nature, right?

1:42:41.140 --> 1:42:44.300
 And I believe that that's how I should be

1:42:44.300 --> 1:42:45.620
 as a nonfiction filmmaker,

1:42:45.620 --> 1:42:48.860
 that I was there only to bear witness, to observe,

1:42:48.860 --> 1:42:52.340
 and not to intervene in any way, shape, or form.

1:42:52.340 --> 1:42:56.980
 And that was the sort of foundation

1:42:56.980 --> 1:43:00.060
 for how I operated for many, many years.

1:43:00.060 --> 1:43:01.860
 And then some things happened.

1:43:01.860 --> 1:43:06.860
 So one of those things that happened was I filmed Lifeboat.

1:43:07.540 --> 1:43:10.980
 And during the course of filming Lifeboat,

1:43:10.980 --> 1:43:15.300
 which covered rescue operations in the Mediterranean

1:43:15.300 --> 1:43:16.580
 off the coast of Libya,

1:43:16.580 --> 1:43:21.580
 in the first three days of that rescue mission,

1:43:22.620 --> 1:43:27.140
 we came upon over 3,000 people, asylum seekers,

1:43:27.140 --> 1:43:29.820
 floating in flimsy rafts in the water.

1:43:30.700 --> 1:43:35.340
 And we were on the Zodiacs and we were filming.

1:43:35.340 --> 1:43:39.220
 And within the first couple hours,

1:43:39.220 --> 1:43:44.220
 we would come up to these rafts and these boats

1:43:44.220 --> 1:43:46.540
 that were in really dire shape,

1:43:46.540 --> 1:43:49.900
 and people would be pushed off, and people would jump off,

1:43:49.900 --> 1:43:52.140
 and people would fall into the water,

1:43:52.140 --> 1:43:56.660
 and some of them couldn't swim.

1:43:57.660 --> 1:44:00.260
 And so we found ourselves in this moment

1:44:00.260 --> 1:44:02.060
 where we had a choice.

1:44:02.060 --> 1:44:05.300
 We could film someone drown in front of us,

1:44:05.300 --> 1:44:06.980
 or we could put our cameras down

1:44:06.980 --> 1:44:08.740
 and pull them out of the water.

1:44:08.740 --> 1:44:10.540
 And so that's what we did.

1:44:10.540 --> 1:44:13.860
 We put our cameras in the bottom of the water,

1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:14.820
 bottom of the Zodiac,

1:44:14.820 --> 1:44:17.420
 and just started pulling people out of the water.

1:44:17.420 --> 1:44:22.420
 And if I was Wiseman, according to his paradigm,

1:44:24.100 --> 1:44:25.980
 then we should have just filmed.

1:44:25.980 --> 1:44:30.580
 And I didn't anticipate that moment beforehand.

1:44:30.580 --> 1:44:32.420
 I had no sort of foreknowledge

1:44:32.420 --> 1:44:34.340
 that I was gonna find myself faced

1:44:34.340 --> 1:44:38.300
 with that dilemma of the moment as a documentarian.

1:44:38.300 --> 1:44:40.020
 But there was no question in my mind

1:44:40.020 --> 1:44:41.340
 that I had to put my camera down

1:44:41.340 --> 1:44:43.860
 and pull that fellow human being out of the water.

1:44:43.860 --> 1:44:45.460
 And I don't regret it at all.

1:44:45.460 --> 1:44:46.900
 So I've come to a different place.

1:44:46.900 --> 1:44:49.820
 I've evolved to what I believe for the kind of film

1:44:49.820 --> 1:44:52.860
 that I do is more appropriate.

1:44:52.860 --> 1:44:56.740
 I can go to sleep at night knowing that,

1:44:56.740 --> 1:44:58.460
 regardless of how the film would have been different

1:44:58.460 --> 1:45:00.780
 if I hadn't made that choice,

1:45:00.780 --> 1:45:02.820
 I made the right choice as a human being.

1:45:02.820 --> 1:45:05.420
 So I think of it as being a human being first

1:45:05.420 --> 1:45:08.340
 and a filmmaker second in moments like that.

1:45:08.340 --> 1:45:11.780
 That's beautifully put, but I also think

1:45:11.780 --> 1:45:15.220
 you could be a human being in small ways too,

1:45:16.100 --> 1:45:19.140
 like silly ways, and put a little bit of yourself

1:45:19.140 --> 1:45:20.940
 in documentaries.

1:45:20.940 --> 1:45:23.060
 I tend to see that as really beautiful.

1:45:24.420 --> 1:45:26.340
 Like the meta piece of it?

1:45:26.340 --> 1:45:31.020
 Yeah, just put yourself into the movie a little bit.

1:45:31.020 --> 1:45:35.220
 Because break that third, fourth, whatever the wall is,

1:45:35.220 --> 1:45:38.820
 is realize that there's a human behind the camera too.

1:45:38.820 --> 1:45:41.700
 For some reason, me as a fan, as a viewer,

1:45:41.700 --> 1:45:42.900
 that's enjoyable too.

1:45:42.900 --> 1:45:45.780
 I think there's a real authenticity there

1:45:46.780 --> 1:45:49.180
 behind the story, especially with these hard stories

1:45:49.180 --> 1:45:53.060
 that you're doing that there's a human being struggling to.

1:45:53.060 --> 1:45:56.420
 Like observing the suffering

1:45:57.420 --> 1:46:02.420
 and having to bear the burden

1:46:02.660 --> 1:46:05.140
 that this kind of suffering exists in the world

1:46:05.140 --> 1:46:09.060
 and you're behind that camera living that struggle.

1:46:09.060 --> 1:46:12.420
 And there's small ways to show yourself in that way.

1:46:12.420 --> 1:46:16.500
 As you know, I don't do that in a big way.

1:46:16.500 --> 1:46:18.940
 But I actually, there are subtle moments

1:46:18.940 --> 1:46:23.180
 where I allow that presence to live just for a second.

1:46:23.180 --> 1:46:26.580
 Like I hate belly button docs, that's what I call them.

1:46:26.580 --> 1:46:27.420
 I don't know.

1:46:27.420 --> 1:46:28.260
 What's a belly button doc?

1:46:28.260 --> 1:46:30.420
 A belly button doc is navel gazing, right?

1:46:30.420 --> 1:46:33.900
 Where it's sort of a narcissistic filmmaking

1:46:33.900 --> 1:46:38.380
 where someone just studies their own place in the world.

1:46:38.380 --> 1:46:39.220
 Right, I think.

1:46:39.220 --> 1:46:40.060
 I see, yeah.

1:46:40.060 --> 1:46:44.740
 I think my, I'm more concerned

1:46:44.740 --> 1:46:48.980
 with how I can intervene, right?

1:46:48.980 --> 1:46:52.580
 Yeah, well, you're trying to really deeply empathize.

1:46:52.580 --> 1:46:53.420
 Yeah.

1:46:53.420 --> 1:46:55.980
 So like, if you do empathize, who am I?

1:46:55.980 --> 1:46:57.980
 I don't wanna center myself in these stories.

1:46:57.980 --> 1:46:59.380
 It's not about me, right?

1:46:59.380 --> 1:47:01.100
 I am so unimportant.

1:47:02.020 --> 1:47:03.660
 What is important is what's happening,

1:47:03.660 --> 1:47:06.300
 what's unfolding in the world that we need to act upon.

1:47:06.300 --> 1:47:09.180
 And I think it's selfish and narcissistic

1:47:09.180 --> 1:47:13.380
 to push myself into these stories unnecessarily.

1:47:13.380 --> 1:47:16.180
 Now that said, I think there is some small value

1:47:16.180 --> 1:47:18.900
 in what you're saying just to remind viewers

1:47:18.900 --> 1:47:21.020
 that there's obviously a filmmaker at play.

1:47:21.020 --> 1:47:22.980
 So sometimes the way that I do that

1:47:22.980 --> 1:47:25.700
 is just like through a question on camera.

1:47:25.700 --> 1:47:28.660
 I'd allow the audio to live of a question

1:47:28.660 --> 1:47:31.140
 or during a conversation I'm having with someone

1:47:31.140 --> 1:47:34.820
 so they can just hear how it's posed, for example, right?

1:47:34.820 --> 1:47:36.020
 And to me, that's enough.

1:47:37.180 --> 1:47:38.020
 Yeah.

1:47:38.020 --> 1:47:43.020
 I do like moments when people recognize that you exist.

1:47:43.620 --> 1:47:47.220
 They look at the filmmaker past the camera

1:47:47.220 --> 1:47:49.620
 and yes, you ask the question in an interview

1:47:49.620 --> 1:47:52.540
 or something like that and they respond to that.

1:47:52.540 --> 1:47:53.660
 Yeah.

1:47:53.660 --> 1:47:57.140
 Like they respond to this like new perturbation

1:47:57.140 --> 1:47:59.980
 into their reality that was created by this other human.

1:47:59.980 --> 1:48:00.820
 Yeah.

1:48:00.820 --> 1:48:02.820
 I especially like when those questions

1:48:02.820 --> 1:48:07.620
 or those perturbations are like a little bit absurd

1:48:07.620 --> 1:48:11.260
 and like add something very novel to their situation

1:48:11.260 --> 1:48:14.220
 and that novelty reveals something about them.

1:48:15.260 --> 1:48:18.260
 So as opposed to capturing the day to day reality

1:48:18.260 --> 1:48:21.620
 of their life, you do that plus the perturbations

1:48:21.620 --> 1:48:23.020
 of like something novel.

1:48:23.020 --> 1:48:24.340
 Yeah.

1:48:24.340 --> 1:48:26.860
 But of course, there's all kinds of ways to do this.

1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:29.900
 Let me, what was number five, by the way?

1:48:29.900 --> 1:48:31.020
 I only gave you four.

1:48:31.020 --> 1:48:31.860
 You just.

1:48:31.860 --> 1:48:33.500
 I'm just gonna stay at four.

1:48:33.500 --> 1:48:35.180
 There's a short doc I like, I mentioned,

1:48:35.180 --> 1:48:38.500
 they're called The Toxic Pigs of Fukushima.

1:48:38.500 --> 1:48:39.500
 I know, I know.

1:48:39.500 --> 1:48:40.340
 I apologize.

1:48:40.340 --> 1:48:41.180
 I know, I know.

1:48:41.180 --> 1:48:42.220
 It's dark.

1:48:42.220 --> 1:48:43.060
 It's a great title though, right?

1:48:43.060 --> 1:48:43.900
 It's a great title.

1:48:43.900 --> 1:48:45.300
 Yeah, great title.

1:48:45.300 --> 1:48:47.780
 No one's seen it, but it's great.

1:48:47.780 --> 1:48:49.380
 It says what it sounds like.

1:48:49.380 --> 1:48:51.380
 Yeah, yeah, it's exactly what it sounds like,

1:48:51.380 --> 1:48:53.740
 but really brilliantly executed.

1:48:55.140 --> 1:48:56.420
 Well, let me ask you about Lifeboat

1:48:56.420 --> 1:49:01.300
 because it's extremely, I don't.

1:49:04.180 --> 1:49:07.740
 It's a really moving idea.

1:49:07.740 --> 1:49:10.540
 Just the fact that this exists in the world,

1:49:10.540 --> 1:49:14.540
 that there's, as a metaphor, as a reality,

1:49:14.540 --> 1:49:18.740
 that there is a set of people trying to flee desperately.

1:49:18.740 --> 1:49:20.220
 It's the desperation of it.

1:49:21.740 --> 1:49:25.020
 And now with these refugees, the desperation of that,

1:49:25.020 --> 1:49:28.340
 of trying to escape towards a world

1:49:28.340 --> 1:49:32.460
 that's full of mystery, uncertainty, doubt,

1:49:32.460 --> 1:49:34.220
 could be hopeless at times,

1:49:34.220 --> 1:49:38.060
 and you're willing to do a lot for your own survival

1:49:38.060 --> 1:49:39.740
 and for the survival of your family

1:49:39.740 --> 1:49:40.740
 and all those kinds of things.

1:49:40.740 --> 1:49:42.820
 That's kind of the human spirit,

1:49:42.820 --> 1:49:47.420
 and you just capture it in Lifeboat.

1:49:47.420 --> 1:49:51.020
 Can you tell me the story behind this film

1:49:51.020 --> 1:49:52.540
 as you started to already tell?

1:49:52.540 --> 1:49:55.460
 Can you tell me what is it about?

1:49:56.460 --> 1:50:01.460
 So Lifeboat really seeks to sort of lift up

1:50:03.460 --> 1:50:08.460
 and showcase the asylum seeker crisis in the Mediterranean

1:50:10.060 --> 1:50:15.140
 when it was at its height in 2016.

1:50:15.140 --> 1:50:18.980
 And it came to be for many reasons,

1:50:18.980 --> 1:50:23.700
 but one of those reasons is colleagues

1:50:23.700 --> 1:50:26.540
 in the NGO community really shared with me

1:50:26.540 --> 1:50:29.700
 that when the borders between Greece and Turkey

1:50:29.700 --> 1:50:34.700
 were shut down, that the flow of Syrian asylum seekers

1:50:35.620 --> 1:50:39.620
 that was initially going across from Turkey to Greece

1:50:39.620 --> 1:50:42.540
 was going to shift westward across the Mediterranean.

1:50:42.540 --> 1:50:43.860
 So I started to research that

1:50:43.860 --> 1:50:46.660
 and discovered that was exactly the case,

1:50:46.660 --> 1:50:49.420
 and then further stumbled upon the fact

1:50:49.420 --> 1:50:54.340
 that nation states hadn't really stepped up to address it

1:50:54.340 --> 1:50:57.420
 and that there were hundreds of asylum seekers

1:50:57.420 --> 1:50:59.380
 often drowning in these flimsy crafts

1:50:59.380 --> 1:51:01.780
 that were pushed off from the shores of Libya

1:51:01.780 --> 1:51:06.060
 because the EU wasn't doing its duty

1:51:06.060 --> 1:51:09.540
 to patrol those waters from a humanitarian standpoint.

1:51:09.540 --> 1:51:11.860
 And so the net result of that was that

1:51:11.860 --> 1:51:16.860
 this whole sort of like humanitarian community sprung up

1:51:16.940 --> 1:51:18.820
 and it was civil society based

1:51:18.820 --> 1:51:22.100
 that tried to meet the needs of those asylum seekers

1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:25.500
 to just ensure that fellow human beings

1:51:25.500 --> 1:51:27.380
 weren't drowning, simply put.

1:51:27.380 --> 1:51:30.980
 And one of those was the small little NGO called Sea Watch,

1:51:30.980 --> 1:51:33.300
 which when they discovered what was happening,

1:51:33.300 --> 1:51:38.300
 just cobbled together a coalition of volunteers,

1:51:38.740 --> 1:51:41.740
 bought a research vessel, retrofitted it,

1:51:41.740 --> 1:51:44.380
 and motored down off the coast of Libya

1:51:44.380 --> 1:51:45.980
 to start pulling people out of the water.

1:51:45.980 --> 1:51:48.700
 And again, I found that inspiring, right?

1:51:48.700 --> 1:51:52.300
 I found that inspiring that this group of volunteers

1:51:52.300 --> 1:51:56.860
 was doing something that our leaders wouldn't, right?

1:51:56.860 --> 1:51:59.500
 And it was something as basic and simple

1:51:59.500 --> 1:52:01.460
 as saving human beings.

1:52:03.060 --> 1:52:06.220
 And I thought there was an inspiring story there.

1:52:06.220 --> 1:52:08.380
 And as it turned out, there was.

1:52:08.380 --> 1:52:11.180
 Have you ever saved someone's life

1:52:13.620 --> 1:52:17.580
 as part of making these documentaries directly?

1:52:17.580 --> 1:52:22.100
 And directly, I think you probably have countless lives,

1:52:22.100 --> 1:52:25.020
 but directly, were you put in that position?

1:52:25.020 --> 1:52:29.420
 I don't wanna, I mean, I certainly poured people

1:52:29.420 --> 1:52:33.540
 out of the water who couldn't swim, I did that.

1:52:33.540 --> 1:52:35.700
 And that's again, speaking to the basic humanity,

1:52:35.700 --> 1:52:39.460
 put down the camera and help, yeah.

1:52:40.580 --> 1:52:43.540
 So this is people coming from Libya,

1:52:43.540 --> 1:52:46.260
 trying to make it across the Mediterranean Sea

1:52:46.260 --> 1:52:48.900
 on a crappy, tiny boat.

1:52:48.900 --> 1:52:51.420
 From a filmmaker perspective, how do you film that?

1:52:51.420 --> 1:52:55.900
 Was there decisions to capture the desperation?

1:52:55.900 --> 1:53:00.900
 Well, we were going back to this idea of access

1:53:01.180 --> 1:53:03.420
 and how that's so fundamental to my approach.

1:53:03.420 --> 1:53:08.420
 And we were bound by the strictures of the rescue operation

1:53:10.060 --> 1:53:12.900
 on this Sea Watch vessel, which was 30 meters long.

1:53:12.900 --> 1:53:16.740
 And we were two of a crew of 15, right?

1:53:16.740 --> 1:53:18.700
 So we had to multitask all the time

1:53:18.700 --> 1:53:21.740
 because the only reason we were on that boat

1:53:21.740 --> 1:53:25.460
 was by agreeing that if needed,

1:53:25.460 --> 1:53:27.740
 we would do whatever necessary, right?

1:53:27.740 --> 1:53:30.700
 To help, right?

1:53:30.700 --> 1:53:33.140
 And so it was very active on multiple levels

1:53:33.140 --> 1:53:38.020
 and we were making decisions each and every day

1:53:38.020 --> 1:53:42.220
 that were not only filmmaking and creative decisions,

1:53:42.220 --> 1:53:47.220
 but also decisions about how to live that duality, right?

1:53:53.580 --> 1:53:56.980
 Of being a humanitarian and a filmmaker simultaneously.

1:53:56.980 --> 1:54:01.980
 And the greatest example I can share of that was,

1:54:01.980 --> 1:54:04.500
 or with my director of photography in that project,

1:54:04.500 --> 1:54:08.940
 Kenny Allen, Kenny's a big guy.

1:54:08.940 --> 1:54:11.940
 It's like, he's got like arms like tree trunks.

1:54:11.940 --> 1:54:16.940
 And he, because he was so physically able and strong,

1:54:18.300 --> 1:54:22.740
 the head of mission really tasked him

1:54:22.740 --> 1:54:24.860
 to be on the Zodiacs to pull people out of the water

1:54:24.860 --> 1:54:27.100
 because he could literally with one arm reach down

1:54:27.100 --> 1:54:30.460
 and just oftentimes pull someone out, right?

1:54:30.460 --> 1:54:33.100
 Whereas usually it would take two or three people, right?

1:54:33.100 --> 1:54:37.060
 And so when we were at the height of triage

1:54:37.060 --> 1:54:39.380
 and there were people in the water all over

1:54:39.380 --> 1:54:41.780
 and rafts were sinking,

1:54:41.780 --> 1:54:43.780
 Kenny was out pulling people out of the water.

1:54:43.780 --> 1:54:46.380
 And this went on for like 24 hours, right?

1:54:46.380 --> 1:54:48.380
 And at the end of that first day,

1:54:48.380 --> 1:54:51.260
 I remember like looking over on the deck

1:54:51.260 --> 1:54:54.380
 and seeing Kenny like help people up from the ladders

1:54:54.380 --> 1:54:56.260
 to walk them back, right?

1:54:56.260 --> 1:54:59.780
 And his camera was nowhere to be seen, right?

1:54:59.780 --> 1:55:01.300
 And so I walked over to him

1:55:01.300 --> 1:55:03.740
 and I just grabbed him by the shoulders and said,

1:55:03.740 --> 1:55:06.060
 Kenny, where's your camera?

1:55:07.060 --> 1:55:08.820
 And he didn't know.

1:55:08.820 --> 1:55:11.140
 He had no idea where his camera was, right?

1:55:11.140 --> 1:55:13.220
 And so I just said, Kenny,

1:55:15.340 --> 1:55:17.460
 we're here to do what you're doing,

1:55:19.380 --> 1:55:21.980
 but we're also here to film it, right?

1:55:21.980 --> 1:55:24.260
 To make sure that we document

1:55:24.260 --> 1:55:26.140
 what is unfolding in front of us

1:55:26.140 --> 1:55:28.180
 so that we have a record of it, right?

1:55:28.180 --> 1:55:30.780
 So we can bring it to a larger audience.

1:55:30.780 --> 1:55:32.460
 So you need to go find your camera

1:55:32.460 --> 1:55:34.900
 so we can also document it.

1:55:34.900 --> 1:55:36.500
 And that kind of pulled him out

1:55:36.500 --> 1:55:38.420
 and he went and got his camera and started filming again,

1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:40.940
 but that gives you a sense of sort of this world

1:55:40.940 --> 1:55:43.940
 that we had to live in in order to get the story done.

1:55:43.940 --> 1:55:47.300
 But I think to be a great director of photography,

1:55:47.300 --> 1:55:48.980
 to be a great director,

1:55:48.980 --> 1:55:53.860
 you have to lose yourself like that in the story too.

1:55:53.860 --> 1:55:55.940
 But usually with a camera in your hand, right?

1:55:55.940 --> 1:55:58.100
 But sometimes you forget the camera.

1:55:58.100 --> 1:56:00.620
 I mean, there's a,

1:56:00.620 --> 1:56:05.620
 I feel like if you're obsessed with the camera too much,

1:56:06.220 --> 1:56:08.100
 you can lose the humanity of it.

1:56:08.100 --> 1:56:10.420
 You get obsessed with the film and the story.

1:56:10.420 --> 1:56:11.500
 It can become clinical.

1:56:11.500 --> 1:56:12.420
 Yes, it can become clinical.

1:56:12.420 --> 1:56:15.700
 Absolutely, and it's, you know, yeah, absolutely.

1:56:15.700 --> 1:56:17.020
 And we don't wanna become,

1:56:17.020 --> 1:56:19.420
 I don't wanna become clinical in my film, certainly.

1:56:19.420 --> 1:56:23.500
 Let me ask you a strange and perhaps edgy question.

1:56:23.500 --> 1:56:26.180
 So some filmmakers believe it's justified

1:56:26.180 --> 1:56:30.860
 to break the rules in order to tell a powerful story.

1:56:30.860 --> 1:56:35.860
 Warner Herzog, I read this somewhere,

1:56:36.020 --> 1:56:37.940
 teaches young filmmakers to pick locks

1:56:37.940 --> 1:56:39.620
 and forge documents and so on.

1:56:39.620 --> 1:56:41.460
 Oh, I didn't know that, interesting.

1:56:41.460 --> 1:56:42.540
 What do you think about that?

1:56:42.540 --> 1:56:45.140
 Bending the rules in service of telling a story.

1:56:46.100 --> 1:56:48.300
 You would, of course, never break the law,

1:56:49.460 --> 1:56:54.460
 but is there, does that, just generally speaking,

1:56:54.460 --> 1:56:58.420
 speaking, bending the rules and so on?

1:56:58.420 --> 1:57:02.180
 You know, just to elaborate on this question, perhaps,

1:57:02.180 --> 1:57:04.820
 I'm distinctly aware that there's parts in the world

1:57:04.820 --> 1:57:09.820
 where the rule of law is not, like,

1:57:11.140 --> 1:57:15.260
 enforced as cleanly as it is in the United States,

1:57:15.260 --> 1:57:17.380
 as fairly as it is in the United States,

1:57:17.380 --> 1:57:20.900
 that there's a kind of, there's a lot of bribery,

1:57:20.900 --> 1:57:25.220
 there's a lot of, like, you don't really know to trust,

1:57:25.220 --> 1:57:27.580
 you don't know if you can trust the cops

1:57:27.580 --> 1:57:30.300
 or basically anybody.

1:57:30.300 --> 1:57:34.540
 So, like, the rules are a very hazy kind of concept.

1:57:34.540 --> 1:57:36.540
 And a lot of them, especially, like, it's funny,

1:57:36.540 --> 1:57:38.180
 but authoritarian regimes often have

1:57:38.180 --> 1:57:40.860
 a giant bureaucracy buildup that's full of rules.

1:57:40.860 --> 1:57:43.020
 There's more rules than you know what to deal with,

1:57:43.020 --> 1:57:44.500
 and you can't actually live life

1:57:44.500 --> 1:57:45.940
 unless you break the rules.

1:57:45.940 --> 1:57:49.180
 Anyway, laying that all out on the table,

1:57:49.180 --> 1:57:51.740
 do you ever contend with that,

1:57:53.020 --> 1:57:58.020
 on what are the rules I can break or should break

1:57:58.060 --> 1:58:00.860
 to keep to the spirit of the story?

1:58:00.860 --> 1:58:03.300
 I think you have to ask yourself, are the rules just,

1:58:03.300 --> 1:58:05.100
 and why are they in place, right?

1:58:05.100 --> 1:58:07.380
 So, for example, coming into the airport

1:58:07.380 --> 1:58:10.060
 in southern Yemen, right?

1:58:10.060 --> 1:58:11.900
 If I just tried to walk through the airport

1:58:11.900 --> 1:58:14.140
 with all my equipment, even with all the permissions

1:58:14.140 --> 1:58:18.020
 beforehand, like we had, without having a fixer

1:58:18.020 --> 1:58:20.540
 at the airport beforehand to make sure

1:58:20.540 --> 1:58:23.180
 we didn't go through the standard line, right?

1:58:24.620 --> 1:58:28.260
 We would have been caught up for three hours at least

1:58:28.260 --> 1:58:30.940
 negotiating over our equipment and eventually paying

1:58:30.940 --> 1:58:33.500
 a bribe to get it through, right?

1:58:33.500 --> 1:58:36.660
 That's just reality in a place like Yemen.

1:58:36.660 --> 1:58:39.700
 And so, of course, knowing that, right?

1:58:39.700 --> 1:58:41.460
 Having talked to colleagues who had taken

1:58:41.460 --> 1:58:45.180
 that path previously, I took a different path, right?

1:58:45.180 --> 1:58:48.500
 Where we hire a fixer beforehand to sort it out

1:58:48.500 --> 1:58:50.060
 beforehand, right?

1:58:50.060 --> 1:58:52.260
 Rather than spending three hours of our time

1:58:52.260 --> 1:58:54.260
 and paying a series of bribes, right?

1:58:54.260 --> 1:58:56.980
 Instead, we're going to get it fixed beforehand

1:58:56.980 --> 1:58:59.220
 so that we can walk through a different line

1:58:59.220 --> 1:59:02.180
 and have no one look at any of our equipment.

1:59:02.180 --> 1:59:06.420
 That's a pretty good trade off in my mind.

1:59:06.420 --> 1:59:09.300
 What about security when you're traveling in these places?

1:59:09.300 --> 1:59:10.820
 Do you ever have bodyguards?

1:59:12.820 --> 1:59:14.620
 Well, several questions around that.

1:59:14.620 --> 1:59:16.820
 Are you ever afraid for your life

1:59:16.820 --> 1:59:18.700
 when you're filming in a war zone?

1:59:19.620 --> 1:59:24.620
 Is there any way to lessen the probability of death?

1:59:27.180 --> 1:59:28.420
 I don't have a death wish.

1:59:28.420 --> 1:59:32.020
 I try to mitigate risk however I can, however I can.

1:59:32.020 --> 1:59:35.140
 But one of the ways I can't do it in a conflict zone

1:59:35.140 --> 1:59:37.500
 is by having armed security with me.

1:59:37.500 --> 1:59:39.300
 And the reason for that is because,

1:59:39.300 --> 1:59:41.740
 especially in a place like Yemen, right?

1:59:41.740 --> 1:59:44.300
 If you have armed security, you become a target

1:59:44.300 --> 1:59:47.980
 in a way that if you're operating under sort of

1:59:47.980 --> 1:59:52.020
 the auspices of international humanitarian law,

1:59:52.020 --> 1:59:53.580
 I actually have more protection.

1:59:53.580 --> 1:59:55.460
 So I don't bring security.

1:59:55.460 --> 1:59:58.740
 If you're working in Northern Yemen, for example,

2:00:00.660 --> 2:00:03.700
 you're going to have someone from the de facto authorities

2:00:03.700 --> 2:00:06.740
 with you anyway the entire time you're there.

2:00:06.740 --> 2:00:10.940
 So the authorities are with you in form anyway.

2:00:10.940 --> 2:00:15.940
 Regarding fear, yeah, of course.

2:00:17.340 --> 2:00:20.740
 I mean, fear is a natural human emotion, right?

2:00:20.740 --> 2:00:25.740
 And I think we have a weird mindset,

2:00:26.980 --> 2:00:29.980
 this sort of heroic mindset surrounding fear in the US,

2:00:29.980 --> 2:00:33.060
 which I don't pay tribute to.

2:00:34.180 --> 2:00:37.780
 I believe as a natural human emotion,

2:00:37.780 --> 2:00:40.180
 it's an alarm bell that I need to pay attention to.

2:00:40.180 --> 2:00:45.180
 And I think rather than pretending to be brave,

2:00:47.340 --> 2:00:52.340
 I think you have to just acknowledge that fear has a place

2:00:52.860 --> 2:00:54.540
 to keep you alive.

2:00:54.540 --> 2:00:59.540
 And I think it's a matter of not letting the fear arrest you

2:01:01.100 --> 2:01:04.740
 and allowing the fear to live and then acting anyway.

2:01:04.740 --> 2:01:07.620
 Don't you think as a documentary filmmaker,

2:01:07.620 --> 2:01:10.500
 the fear is a really good signal

2:01:10.500 --> 2:01:12.820
 for potentially a good thing to do

2:01:12.820 --> 2:01:14.900
 because there's a story there?

2:01:14.900 --> 2:01:17.340
 So is fear is an indicator that you shouldn't do it

2:01:17.340 --> 2:01:19.220
 or is it an indicator that you should do it?

2:01:19.220 --> 2:01:22.980
 It's probably an indication you should do it, right?

2:01:22.980 --> 2:01:26.700
 And strangely, I think that's why,

2:01:27.700 --> 2:01:30.500
 I think that if there's something unusual

2:01:30.500 --> 2:01:32.260
 about the work I do in some part,

2:01:32.260 --> 2:01:35.180
 it's because of these types of stories, right?

2:01:35.180 --> 2:01:38.020
 They're hard to access, but you also have to have

2:01:38.020 --> 2:01:43.020
 a threshold of willingness to do them when you can't,

2:01:46.940 --> 2:01:50.180
 there is no guarantee of physical safety, right?

2:01:50.180 --> 2:01:52.860
 And maybe that's why you should do them.

2:01:52.860 --> 2:01:56.260
 I'm very much motivated by the things that scare me.

2:01:56.260 --> 2:02:00.300
 They seem to direct the things that are worth doing

2:02:00.300 --> 2:02:01.980
 in this all too short life.

2:02:01.980 --> 2:02:05.100
 How often do you interact with our friendly friends

2:02:05.100 --> 2:02:07.580
 at the police departments of various locations?

2:02:07.580 --> 2:02:12.580
 Like, because of the humanitarian nature of your work,

2:02:12.900 --> 2:02:17.020
 are you able to avoid all such friendly conversations

2:02:17.020 --> 2:02:21.620
 or are you often making friends with our?

2:02:21.620 --> 2:02:25.220
 I try to avoid the friendly police people

2:02:25.220 --> 2:02:27.220
 all over the world as much as possible,

2:02:28.260 --> 2:02:33.260
 but in some instances, it's important to be proactive,

2:02:33.260 --> 2:02:36.380
 right, and make sure that they know what you're doing

2:02:36.380 --> 2:02:37.580
 before you do it.

2:02:37.580 --> 2:02:40.700
 So it's all about the context and the situation.

2:02:41.620 --> 2:02:43.620
 For example, working in Northern Yemen,

2:02:43.620 --> 2:02:45.620
 you couldn't film for five minutes

2:02:45.620 --> 2:02:47.260
 if you didn't have paperwork,

2:02:47.260 --> 2:02:48.700
 because you'd be taken away.

2:02:48.700 --> 2:02:50.740
 So you have to make sure you have all those permissions

2:02:50.740 --> 2:02:51.580
 ahead of time.

2:02:53.740 --> 2:02:58.740
 50 Feet from Syria, I would love to talk

2:02:58.740 --> 2:03:00.700
 at least a little bit about this film.

2:03:00.700 --> 2:03:03.900
 First, can you, high level, can you tell

2:03:03.900 --> 2:03:05.420
 what this documentary is about?

2:03:05.420 --> 2:03:09.380
 Yeah, it was early in the Syrian uprising,

2:03:09.380 --> 2:03:14.380
 and we returned to the Syrian Turkish border

2:03:15.740 --> 2:03:18.780
 with a Syrian American orthopedic surgeon

2:03:18.780 --> 2:03:21.420
 who was volunteering, operating on refugees

2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:24.820
 as they float across the border from Syria into Turkey.

2:03:24.820 --> 2:03:27.660
 And it was an attempt at the time,

2:03:27.660 --> 2:03:30.580
 before a lot of films had come out about the conflict,

2:03:30.580 --> 2:03:35.580
 to really show again the effects of the war on civilians.

2:03:38.660 --> 2:03:41.820
 You've heard me echo that sentiment multiple times now,

2:03:41.820 --> 2:03:46.820
 but people knew there was a major conflict in Syria,

2:03:47.020 --> 2:03:50.060
 but didn't really understand the form that that was taking

2:03:50.060 --> 2:03:51.740
 and the impact it was having.

2:03:51.740 --> 2:03:55.420
 And so we embedded into the,

2:03:55.420 --> 2:03:58.660
 at the time it was the only clinic in Turkey

2:03:58.660 --> 2:04:02.020
 that was sanctioned by the Turkish government

2:04:02.020 --> 2:04:04.900
 to treat Syrian refugees.

2:04:04.900 --> 2:04:08.220
 And so we filmed there with surgeons

2:04:08.220 --> 2:04:11.060
 as they operated on war victims.

2:04:11.060 --> 2:04:14.060
 And we also went into Syria into some of the camps as well.

2:04:14.060 --> 2:04:17.780
 So in this film, there's a man who crosses the border

2:04:17.780 --> 2:04:19.540
 every day to retrieve the wounded

2:04:19.540 --> 2:04:21.580
 and fair them safety and care.

2:04:21.580 --> 2:04:25.300
 And you also mentioned about heroism in the United States.

2:04:25.300 --> 2:04:29.940
 Can you tell me about this man and just people like him?

2:04:29.940 --> 2:04:31.740
 Like what's the heroic action

2:04:32.700 --> 2:04:35.780
 in some of these places that you've visited?

2:04:35.780 --> 2:04:37.540
 So in that instance, you know,

2:04:37.540 --> 2:04:41.100
 I thought of him as the Turkish Schindler, right?

2:04:41.100 --> 2:04:46.100
 Because he was a human being who of his own volition,

2:04:46.180 --> 2:04:48.820
 no one was paying him to do this,

2:04:48.820 --> 2:04:53.580
 but he was spending much of his time.

2:04:53.580 --> 2:04:55.380
 He was just a local businessman

2:04:55.380 --> 2:04:57.740
 who really saw the need in the camps

2:04:57.740 --> 2:05:00.260
 right across the border 10 K away.

2:05:00.260 --> 2:05:04.260
 And he saw the medical need in particular

2:05:04.260 --> 2:05:07.380
 and how hard it was to get people

2:05:07.380 --> 2:05:11.180
 in desperate medical conditions across the border

2:05:11.180 --> 2:05:13.700
 where there was a clinic just right across the border.

2:05:13.700 --> 2:05:17.940
 But because of the security and the layers of security,

2:05:17.940 --> 2:05:20.020
 they couldn't get out by themselves.

2:05:20.020 --> 2:05:24.020
 So he took it upon himself as a Turkish person

2:05:24.020 --> 2:05:26.940
 to build relationships with the Turkish guards,

2:05:26.940 --> 2:05:28.940
 which was relatively easy.

2:05:28.940 --> 2:05:31.340
 And then he built relationships

2:05:31.340 --> 2:05:34.460
 with sort of the guards in the no man's land

2:05:34.460 --> 2:05:36.220
 between the Syrian guards

2:05:36.220 --> 2:05:38.460
 and sort of those who lived in the middle area.

2:05:38.460 --> 2:05:41.260
 And then also with the Syrian guards at the camp.

2:05:41.260 --> 2:05:44.940
 And he would drive out there daily and bring them food,

2:05:44.940 --> 2:05:45.980
 right?

2:05:45.980 --> 2:05:47.620
 Talk them up and build relationships.

2:05:47.620 --> 2:05:49.940
 And so every day he would bring these guards food

2:05:49.940 --> 2:05:51.500
 and build relationships with them.

2:05:51.500 --> 2:05:54.380
 And what that meant was eventually, right?

2:05:54.380 --> 2:05:58.740
 He had this avenue of access to and from the camps.

2:05:58.740 --> 2:06:00.340
 And so he started using it

2:06:00.340 --> 2:06:05.100
 and he would drive this avenue of access

2:06:05.100 --> 2:06:08.020
 through the three layers of guards each day.

2:06:08.020 --> 2:06:10.420
 And then they would open the gates for him

2:06:10.420 --> 2:06:13.940
 because he had made himself trustworthy in their eyes.

2:06:13.940 --> 2:06:18.420
 And he would receive the most desperate medical cases

2:06:18.420 --> 2:06:21.900
 that were coming from all over Northern Syria, right?

2:06:21.900 --> 2:06:23.500
 To receive medical treatment.

2:06:23.500 --> 2:06:25.380
 And he would, as you see in the film,

2:06:25.380 --> 2:06:28.980
 he would ferry them into the back of his car, right?

2:06:28.980 --> 2:06:31.700
 And then drive them to the hospital

2:06:31.700 --> 2:06:33.540
 where they would receive operations.

2:06:33.540 --> 2:06:36.620
 And then he would bring them back if they wanted

2:06:36.620 --> 2:06:39.460
 after they'd healed and recovered back to Syria,

2:06:39.460 --> 2:06:41.900
 if they wanted to return out post recovery.

2:06:41.900 --> 2:06:44.060
 And he didn't get paid for that.

2:06:44.060 --> 2:06:46.580
 He was spending his own money to do it

2:06:46.580 --> 2:06:49.580
 because he saw other human beings in need.

2:06:49.580 --> 2:06:52.820
 And it's like we were talking about earlier.

2:06:52.820 --> 2:06:54.620
 That's heroic, right?

2:06:54.620 --> 2:06:55.940
 That's selfless.

2:06:55.940 --> 2:06:59.940
 That's aspirational for me, right?

2:06:59.940 --> 2:07:03.940
 Here's someone who is spending their time on the planet

2:07:03.940 --> 2:07:06.740
 doing something of value and good to other human beings.

2:07:07.700 --> 2:07:09.380
 I mean, if you draw parallels to Schindler,

2:07:09.380 --> 2:07:13.620
 I feel like the fascinating thing about Schindler

2:07:13.620 --> 2:07:18.260
 is that he's kind of a flawed human

2:07:18.260 --> 2:07:21.660
 and is not the kind of human that does these things usually.

2:07:21.660 --> 2:07:23.500
 But he just can't help it.

2:07:23.500 --> 2:07:25.060
 And that's like the basic humanity.

2:07:25.060 --> 2:07:30.060
 Despite who you are, the basic humanity shines through.

2:07:30.340 --> 2:07:34.940
 I think the whims of war test people in those ways, right?

2:07:34.940 --> 2:07:39.620
 They ask of you things that you may not even know

2:07:39.620 --> 2:07:41.220
 were going to be asked of you.

2:07:41.220 --> 2:07:43.700
 And then it speaks to who you are fundamentally

2:07:43.700 --> 2:07:44.980
 as a human being.

2:07:44.980 --> 2:07:48.860
 They reveal who you are as a human being, just as you said.

2:07:51.020 --> 2:07:55.180
 Let me ask a kind of stupid technical question

2:07:55.180 --> 2:07:58.180
 about publications of movies and so on.

2:07:58.180 --> 2:08:02.340
 I've been recently becoming good friends with Thomas Tall,

2:08:02.340 --> 2:08:04.180
 who was the producer.

2:08:04.180 --> 2:08:06.340
 His company, Legendary, funded some of the big

2:08:06.340 --> 2:08:08.540
 sort of blockbuster films and so on.

2:08:08.540 --> 2:08:11.420
 And so obviously money is part of filmmaking,

2:08:11.420 --> 2:08:13.820
 but also the release of movies.

2:08:13.820 --> 2:08:18.820
 And me as a consumer, with Netflix, with YouTube,

2:08:21.740 --> 2:08:23.700
 that's one of the reasons I'm a huge fan of YouTube

2:08:23.700 --> 2:08:26.860
 is it's like out in the open.

2:08:26.860 --> 2:08:30.380
 Access, especially historical access.

2:08:30.380 --> 2:08:33.940
 Like over time, you can look back years later.

2:08:33.940 --> 2:08:35.860
 If you pay some money, you can watch

2:08:35.860 --> 2:08:38.340
 some of the great films ever made.

2:08:38.340 --> 2:08:41.420
 YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, I don't know what other services

2:08:41.420 --> 2:08:44.100
 there are, HBO, Paramount.

2:08:44.100 --> 2:08:44.940
 Paramount Plus.

2:08:44.940 --> 2:08:46.020
 Paramount Plus.

2:08:48.260 --> 2:08:50.100
 Anyway, there's all these platforms.

2:08:51.260 --> 2:08:52.740
 Spotify now.

2:08:55.980 --> 2:08:59.020
 I understand they want to create paywalls and so on.

2:08:59.020 --> 2:09:02.500
 It makes sense, but I'm a huge fan of openness

2:09:02.500 --> 2:09:04.660
 and I'm really kind of torn by this whole thing.

2:09:04.660 --> 2:09:07.300
 Anyway, that's a discussion for perhaps another time.

2:09:07.300 --> 2:09:11.820
 But the short question is why is it so hard

2:09:11.820 --> 2:09:15.700
 to watch your documentaries and other films,

2:09:15.700 --> 2:09:18.980
 other incredible films on the internet?

2:09:20.020 --> 2:09:23.100
 If I want to pay unlimited amount of money,

2:09:24.100 --> 2:09:26.420
 I want to pay a lot of money to watch it.

2:09:26.420 --> 2:09:27.940
 Why is it so hard?

2:09:27.940 --> 2:09:30.780
 Well, Lifeboat is streaming free on the New Yorker.

2:09:32.180 --> 2:09:35.420
 Yes, I saw that, which is interesting.

2:09:35.420 --> 2:09:37.340
 That doesn't make any sense.

2:09:37.340 --> 2:09:41.660
 And then also Hunger Ward is on Paramount Plus,

2:09:41.660 --> 2:09:45.660
 but also it's also streaming free.

2:09:45.660 --> 2:09:47.940
 So you can either go through a paywall

2:09:47.940 --> 2:09:52.180
 or you can watch it with ads with Big Macs interspersed.

2:09:52.180 --> 2:09:53.060
 Big Macs.

2:09:53.060 --> 2:09:53.900
 Sometimes.

2:09:53.900 --> 2:09:55.660
 Yeah, the contrast.

2:09:55.660 --> 2:09:56.980
 It's tough.

2:09:56.980 --> 2:10:00.380
 Well, no, it really reveals the power of the documentary.

2:10:01.300 --> 2:10:04.380
 No, but it's still not, even those platforms are,

2:10:04.380 --> 2:10:07.780
 I mean, they're not as easily accessible

2:10:07.780 --> 2:10:09.580
 because you have to like, you have to use,

2:10:09.580 --> 2:10:13.300
 you have to think and you have to chase a particular.

2:10:13.300 --> 2:10:15.180
 You have to chase it, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:10:15.180 --> 2:10:17.020
 I guess from an economic standpoint,

2:10:17.020 --> 2:10:19.420
 the answer to that is pretty clear, right?

2:10:19.420 --> 2:10:21.620
 It may not be what people want to watch.

2:10:22.780 --> 2:10:25.540
 Maybe people want to watch reality.

2:10:25.540 --> 2:10:30.540
 Maybe people want to watch animal rescue shows

2:10:30.540 --> 2:10:35.540
 here in the US, which is exactly why in part,

2:10:36.260 --> 2:10:40.640
 I think it's so vital that we continue to do stories

2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:44.300
 on things that aren't about flowers and puppy dogs, right?

2:10:44.300 --> 2:10:45.260
 I would push back on that.

2:10:45.260 --> 2:10:50.260
 So there's TikTok and you could say,

2:10:51.060 --> 2:10:55.880
 well, look, humans just want to watch really short content

2:10:55.880 --> 2:10:58.260
 because they seem to be addicted to that kind of thing.

2:10:58.260 --> 2:11:00.100
 That's partially true.

2:11:00.100 --> 2:11:04.200
 But they also watch two, three, four, five hour podcasts.

2:11:06.220 --> 2:11:07.380
 On TikTok?

2:11:07.380 --> 2:11:09.700
 No, there's different platforms for that.

2:11:09.700 --> 2:11:12.060
 It's a place called YouTube, I'll teach you about it.

2:11:12.060 --> 2:11:14.340
 Okay, yeah, I've never heard of it.

2:11:14.340 --> 2:11:16.940
 It's a good place to publish documentaries, I think.

2:11:18.900 --> 2:11:21.860
 Humans are interested in a lot of things

2:11:21.860 --> 2:11:25.900
 and I've seen many times a thing that you think

2:11:25.900 --> 2:11:29.060
 is a niche thing become a very big thing.

2:11:29.060 --> 2:11:30.980
 But for them to become mainstream,

2:11:30.980 --> 2:11:32.300
 they have to have a platform

2:11:32.300 --> 2:11:35.060
 that allows for the mainstream to happen.

2:11:35.060 --> 2:11:35.900
 The access.

2:11:35.900 --> 2:11:39.940
 The access, the dumb, simple, frictionless access.

2:11:39.940 --> 2:11:43.560
 The frictionless access is a really important thing.

2:11:44.780 --> 2:11:48.420
 Paywalls create friction and not just because of the money.

2:11:49.500 --> 2:11:52.100
 It can be free, but if you have to click on a thing

2:11:52.100 --> 2:11:55.620
 or maybe sign up or put your email,

2:11:55.620 --> 2:12:00.620
 it prevents you to enjoy the thing you would really enjoy

2:12:05.020 --> 2:12:06.660
 and you know you would enjoy,

2:12:06.660 --> 2:12:10.820
 but your baser human nature prevents you from enjoying

2:12:10.820 --> 2:12:14.240
 because you can just open up TikTok and keep scrolling.

2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:17.000
 So that's just something to say about platforms

2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:21.660
 because I think the things that need platforms the most

2:12:21.660 --> 2:12:23.940
 are things like your films.

2:12:23.940 --> 2:12:27.260
 The things that I think a lot of people would love watching.

2:12:27.260 --> 2:12:30.460
 They're very important and they can have viral impact

2:12:30.460 --> 2:12:32.860
 on the world that is fundamentally positive.

2:12:32.860 --> 2:12:35.460
 You know, it's just, it makes me sad

2:12:35.460 --> 2:12:40.460
 that there's not a machine for celebrating those films.

2:12:41.900 --> 2:12:44.180
 There are lots of machines to celebrate them,

2:12:44.180 --> 2:12:47.520
 but they're just not as always accessible as YouTube, right?

2:12:47.520 --> 2:12:49.080
 I mean, as soon as you write me that check

2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:51.340
 for a trillion dollars when I walk out of here,

2:12:51.340 --> 2:12:53.340
 then I'm gonna put all my films on YouTube

2:12:53.340 --> 2:12:55.380
 because then I won't have to worry about, you know,

2:12:55.380 --> 2:12:58.020
 selling them in order so I can make the next film

2:12:58.020 --> 2:13:00.860
 because you know, film is not just an art.

2:13:00.860 --> 2:13:02.900
 It's also an industry, right?

2:13:02.900 --> 2:13:06.540
 And that tension between the two is a constant interplay

2:13:06.540 --> 2:13:08.740
 that is a reality for me.

2:13:08.740 --> 2:13:10.460
 So I always have to think about

2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:14.800
 how can I access the largest audience,

2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:19.300
 but also, right, go out and shoot the next film, right?

2:13:19.300 --> 2:13:22.320
 So that longevity question is also an issue

2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:26.820
 and the finances are part of that sort of equation

2:13:26.820 --> 2:13:29.540
 that I constantly have to rewrite over and over again.

2:13:29.540 --> 2:13:32.260
 How often, as a creative mind,

2:13:32.260 --> 2:13:35.580
 do you feel the constraints, the financial constraints?

2:13:37.580 --> 2:13:41.140
 I wish I could do a lot more films

2:13:41.140 --> 2:13:44.820
 that I can't always because of financial constraints.

2:13:44.820 --> 2:13:46.180
 So it's the number of films.

2:13:46.180 --> 2:13:47.020
 Yeah.

2:13:48.100 --> 2:13:51.540
 And is a film that you do currently,

2:13:51.540 --> 2:13:53.900
 is a film that you do at any one time

2:13:53.900 --> 2:13:56.460
 as you're filming it already funded

2:13:56.460 --> 2:13:59.040
 or is it the funding from previous stuff

2:13:59.040 --> 2:14:01.140
 that you're trying to use?

2:14:01.140 --> 2:14:02.780
 Before Hunger Ward,

2:14:05.100 --> 2:14:08.200
 I would just take a flyer on my films, right?

2:14:08.200 --> 2:14:12.920
 Where I would just say this meets the so what threshold.

2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:17.540
 This is a story that has to be told and I want to tell it.

2:14:17.540 --> 2:14:19.620
 And then I could just go shoot it.

2:14:19.620 --> 2:14:22.820
 And usually on credit, usually on a credit card, right?

2:14:22.820 --> 2:14:27.460
 So based on a belief that Lifeboat was done that way.

2:14:27.460 --> 2:14:28.300
 Yes.

2:14:28.300 --> 2:14:29.120
 Right?

2:14:29.120 --> 2:14:29.960
 50 Feet from Syria was done that way.

2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:32.220
 So you're on a boat, broke.

2:14:32.220 --> 2:14:33.060
 Yeah.

2:14:33.060 --> 2:14:34.880
 Yeah, but it's free food, right?

2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:37.100
 And free lodging because there's a bunk on the boat.

2:14:37.100 --> 2:14:41.620
 But I do that not intending to stay broke, right?

2:14:41.620 --> 2:14:44.080
 But based on a foundational belief

2:14:44.080 --> 2:14:47.520
 that if I bring to bear

2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:52.520
 all of my sort of quiver of creative arrows to it, right?

2:14:52.980 --> 2:14:56.640
 That I can create something of value, right?

2:14:56.640 --> 2:15:00.220
 In the world, but hopefully also financially

2:15:00.220 --> 2:15:01.980
 that then I can sell to someone.

2:15:01.980 --> 2:15:05.020
 And you know, every time I've done that Lex,

2:15:05.020 --> 2:15:06.940
 I've gotten into the black.

2:15:06.940 --> 2:15:11.140
 So it's a risk and I have to have a certain risk threshold

2:15:11.140 --> 2:15:12.380
 financially to do that.

2:15:12.380 --> 2:15:14.420
 But I believe so deeply in these stories

2:15:14.420 --> 2:15:15.640
 that I'm willing to do that.

2:15:15.640 --> 2:15:17.160
 I didn't have to do that with Hunger Ward.

2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:20.060
 Luckily I had funders for that film.

2:15:21.420 --> 2:15:22.500
 Yeah.

2:15:22.500 --> 2:15:24.420
 Yeah, take risks in this life.

2:15:24.420 --> 2:15:25.720
 It's gonna pay off.

2:15:26.660 --> 2:15:28.340
 Which reminds me of, let me ask you,

2:15:28.340 --> 2:15:31.060
 I already asked you for advice about,

2:15:31.060 --> 2:15:34.260
 for a filmmaker, how to win an Oscar.

2:15:34.260 --> 2:15:35.780
 Well, I haven't won an Oscar.

2:15:35.780 --> 2:15:38.080
 How to get nominated for an Oscar, that's true.

2:15:39.500 --> 2:15:42.080
 Or just how to make great documentaries,

2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:42.920
 how to make great film.

2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:44.920
 But let me ask, even zoom out bigger.

2:15:44.920 --> 2:15:48.220
 You mentioned some of these things,

2:15:48.220 --> 2:15:50.420
 doing the things that you think matters.

2:15:50.420 --> 2:15:52.920
 What advice would you give to young people,

2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:54.580
 high school, college,

2:15:55.920 --> 2:16:00.920
 dreaming of living a life worth living?

2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:03.800
 What advice would you give them about career

2:16:03.800 --> 2:16:06.000
 or maybe just life in general?

2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:08.000
 How to have a life they can be proud of?

2:16:09.820 --> 2:16:11.240
 Yeah, I don't know how you're gonna react to this

2:16:11.240 --> 2:16:13.020
 given sort of your expertise.

2:16:13.020 --> 2:16:17.320
 But I would say put down the smartphone,

2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:19.480
 step away from the monitor, right?

2:16:19.480 --> 2:16:23.640
 Because real life is not a screen, right?

2:16:23.640 --> 2:16:27.040
 I believe that sort of the foundational skills

2:16:27.040 --> 2:16:30.380
 which are conducive and important to success

2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:34.800
 aren't necessarily those technical skills

2:16:34.800 --> 2:16:39.440
 which we're going to learn in trade schools or university.

2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:43.280
 I think they're more foundational than that.

2:16:43.280 --> 2:16:48.160
 They're learning how to interact and listen.

2:16:48.160 --> 2:16:49.000
 With humans?

2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:54.000
 With humans, yeah, to really see and listen, right?

2:16:54.840 --> 2:16:55.840
 And observe.

2:16:55.840 --> 2:16:58.560
 And observe, right?

2:16:58.560 --> 2:17:00.600
 And how to step out of your door

2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:03.020
 and if the electricity goes out, right?

2:17:03.020 --> 2:17:05.040
 And you're five miles away from your house,

2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:07.320
 you don't need a smartphone to get home

2:17:07.320 --> 2:17:10.220
 because you've set visual markers for yourself

2:17:10.220 --> 2:17:12.500
 on how to get back to where you live, right?

2:17:12.500 --> 2:17:15.040
 I think we're in danger right now

2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:18.800
 of living in a world where

2:17:18.800 --> 2:17:21.440
 if the satellites stop functioning, right?

2:17:22.400 --> 2:17:23.480
 Then a whole lot of people

2:17:23.480 --> 2:17:27.760
 have become completely dysfunctional, right?

2:17:27.760 --> 2:17:30.900
 Because we're so reliant upon the screens in our lives.

2:17:30.900 --> 2:17:33.200
 So I think there's a lot of foundational skills

2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:34.800
 that have nothing to do with technology

2:17:34.800 --> 2:17:38.000
 that we need to learn and everything rests upon those.

2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:39.160
 So I would say learn those foundations,

2:17:39.160 --> 2:17:40.800
 learn how to write well.

2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:43.360
 Read a lot, right?

2:17:43.360 --> 2:17:45.640
 It's a different kind of knowledge and wisdom

2:17:45.640 --> 2:17:47.400
 that comes out of that.

2:17:47.400 --> 2:17:49.520
 So reading is kind of the equivalent of listening

2:17:49.520 --> 2:17:51.000
 and observing and writing is

2:17:53.200 --> 2:17:57.020
 kind of integration of all of that

2:17:57.020 --> 2:17:58.480
 that you've observed and listened to

2:17:58.480 --> 2:18:00.280
 and tried to express something with that.

2:18:00.280 --> 2:18:02.600
 So I think my training in the theater

2:18:02.600 --> 2:18:06.720
 has served me so well in the documentary world, right?

2:18:06.720 --> 2:18:08.960
 Because it's all about interaction

2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:11.920
 and listening and talking and dialogue, right?

2:18:11.920 --> 2:18:14.200
 And that's what I do in documentaries, right?

2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:15.840
 Is I listen.

2:18:15.840 --> 2:18:19.140
 Yeah, we mentioned fear.

2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:22.640
 Being an introvert, I'm very afraid of people

2:18:22.640 --> 2:18:25.840
 but I'm drawn to them and fascinated by them

2:18:25.840 --> 2:18:26.960
 because of that.

2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:28.240
 Enjoy listening to them.

2:18:28.240 --> 2:18:29.080
 Totally.

2:18:29.080 --> 2:18:31.960
 And observing them.

2:18:31.960 --> 2:18:33.120
 And you mentioned reading.

2:18:33.120 --> 2:18:35.380
 You mentioned books as a catalyst,

2:18:35.380 --> 2:18:37.960
 as a stimulator of your imagination.

2:18:37.960 --> 2:18:42.380
 Is there books in your life, a couple, one, two, three,

2:18:42.380 --> 2:18:46.240
 that kind of left an impact

2:18:46.240 --> 2:18:50.920
 or a little bit of a spark of inspiration

2:18:50.920 --> 2:18:54.400
 early on in life that stand out from your memory?

2:18:54.400 --> 2:18:58.360
 I was given The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran

2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:01.840
 as a graduation present from my high school

2:19:01.840 --> 2:19:03.040
 English teacher.

2:19:03.040 --> 2:19:05.880
 And I still have that book in a special place

2:19:05.880 --> 2:19:08.600
 on my bookshelf because I think it speaks

2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:11.780
 to the nature of human experience, right?

2:19:11.780 --> 2:19:13.840
 And I return to it all the time

2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:15.760
 because there's wisdom there, you know?

2:19:15.760 --> 2:19:18.240
 But there's many, many books.

2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:21.760
 Fiction or nonfiction, what connects with you usually

2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:23.040
 in the past, for the imagination?

2:19:23.040 --> 2:19:26.480
 I read mostly nonfiction most of the time.

2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:28.920
 Ten Points is a book I love a lot.

2:19:28.920 --> 2:19:30.560
 What is Ten Points?

2:19:30.560 --> 2:19:34.120
 Ten Points is, I think his name is Bill Strickland.

2:19:34.120 --> 2:19:37.720
 He was the editor of, I think, Bicycle Magazine.

2:19:37.720 --> 2:19:40.200
 And it's sort of his personal memoir

2:19:40.200 --> 2:19:44.080
 of his experience growing up with a lot of abuse

2:19:44.080 --> 2:19:46.700
 and how that transformed him as a human being.

2:19:46.700 --> 2:19:49.260
 You know, one instrumental book for me

2:19:49.260 --> 2:19:52.000
 that I bumped into in my early 20s,

2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:54.160
 boy, these are all nonfiction,

2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:55.720
 except for The Princess Bride.

2:19:56.960 --> 2:19:59.160
 Have to mention, it's an outlier.

2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:03.280
 No, no, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.

2:20:03.280 --> 2:20:05.440
 I read that in my early 20s,

2:20:05.440 --> 2:20:10.440
 and I found so many of the principles in that book.

2:20:11.280 --> 2:20:13.260
 What are the habits from that one?

2:20:14.480 --> 2:20:16.860
 Seek first to understand, then to be understood

2:20:16.860 --> 2:20:18.760
 is one of them, you know?

2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:21.800
 The notion of proactivity is one of them.

2:20:21.800 --> 2:20:25.060
 It's really, and so I've held onto some of those principles

2:20:25.060 --> 2:20:27.920
 through my life as well, for sure.

2:20:27.920 --> 2:20:32.360
 What have been, you've observed

2:20:33.880 --> 2:20:37.080
 suffering darker aspects of human nature

2:20:37.080 --> 2:20:38.880
 in your own personal life.

2:20:38.880 --> 2:20:42.960
 What has been some of the darkest moments in your life,

2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:45.160
 darkest times in your life?

2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:49.400
 Is there something that you went through

2:20:49.400 --> 2:20:53.000
 and then perhaps you carry it through your work?

2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:56.520
 Yeah, probably one of the darkest moments

2:20:56.520 --> 2:21:00.840
 was an experience that I had, again, in my early 20s,

2:21:00.840 --> 2:21:03.280
 and I was living in Southern California,

2:21:04.240 --> 2:21:08.760
 and the Pacific Coast Highway

2:21:08.760 --> 2:21:10.600
 that goes north and south along the beach,

2:21:10.600 --> 2:21:13.980
 and there's that little concrete path

2:21:13.980 --> 2:21:15.440
 that people jog and ride their bikes,

2:21:15.440 --> 2:21:18.080
 and I was riding my bike on the PCH,

2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:21.960
 and I was coming up to a corner on it,

2:21:21.960 --> 2:21:26.960
 and I heard this tremendous crash, and it was really loud,

2:21:28.920 --> 2:21:31.520
 and I came around the corner,

2:21:31.520 --> 2:21:34.680
 and it was a car accident, a car crash.

2:21:34.680 --> 2:21:38.000
 It was a multiple vehicle crash,

2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:43.000
 and what had happened is that a Volvo had hit another car,

2:21:44.480 --> 2:21:48.040
 and then when it hit it, it went over the top of the car

2:21:48.040 --> 2:21:50.240
 and hit a Volkswagen van,

2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:52.760
 and it peeled away the top of the Volkswagen van

2:21:52.760 --> 2:21:55.060
 when it hit it and then landed.

2:21:55.060 --> 2:21:59.480
 So three vehicles, and it just happened,

2:21:59.480 --> 2:22:04.160
 and lying in the middle of the road

2:22:04.160 --> 2:22:07.400
 was a body decapitated,

2:22:08.560 --> 2:22:12.460
 and there was another person from one of the cars

2:22:12.460 --> 2:22:15.360
 lying in the middle of the road, still alive,

2:22:15.360 --> 2:22:17.920
 and then on the hood of the Volvo

2:22:17.920 --> 2:22:21.120
 was this woman who had come through the windshield,

2:22:21.120 --> 2:22:26.120
 just a mess, blood everywhere, moaning back and forth,

2:22:28.160 --> 2:22:32.680
 and a bystander ran into the middle of the road

2:22:32.680 --> 2:22:34.800
 and started administering first aid

2:22:34.800 --> 2:22:37.040
 to the person lying in the road,

2:22:37.040 --> 2:22:42.040
 and I stood there watching the scene

2:22:42.440 --> 2:22:45.720
 and every fiber of my being,

2:22:45.720 --> 2:22:50.720
 wanted to run to the woman on the hood of the Volvo

2:22:50.720 --> 2:22:54.640
 and do something, anything, right, just to be there,

2:22:54.640 --> 2:22:58.440
 and it was obvious to me that she was gonna die,

2:22:59.400 --> 2:23:01.640
 but I felt like at least if I ran there,

2:23:01.640 --> 2:23:05.760
 I could offer some comfort for her last moment,

2:23:05.760 --> 2:23:09.760
 and right then, the sirens started to blare,

2:23:09.760 --> 2:23:13.760
 and I knew that there'd be paramedics there

2:23:13.760 --> 2:23:17.120
 within minutes, that people would come to help,

2:23:18.080 --> 2:23:21.560
 and I froze, and I was scared,

2:23:23.080 --> 2:23:24.880
 and I didn't do anything,

2:23:24.880 --> 2:23:29.880
 and I watched while this woman died on the hood of the Volvo,

2:23:33.760 --> 2:23:38.760
 and that experience is sort of seared into my consciousness,

2:23:38.760 --> 2:23:42.600
 the fact that I watched and didn't act,

2:23:42.600 --> 2:23:46.600
 I feel is one of the great failures of my life,

2:23:46.600 --> 2:23:49.400
 that I wasn't able to act in a moment of need,

2:23:49.400 --> 2:23:50.840
 no matter how small,

2:23:51.840 --> 2:23:56.840
 and from that, I made a decision out of that experience

2:23:57.680 --> 2:24:00.840
 that if I ever found myself in a situation

2:24:00.840 --> 2:24:04.280
 where I had the ability to act and I could act

2:24:04.280 --> 2:24:06.280
 to help another human being,

2:24:06.280 --> 2:24:10.800
 I would act to help another human being in such need

2:24:10.800 --> 2:24:15.800
 that I would act, that I wouldn't let fear freeze me.

2:24:16.400 --> 2:24:21.400
 Instead, I would allow that fear to catalyze me into action

2:24:22.200 --> 2:24:25.640
 and do something and intervene in whatever way I could,

2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:27.440
 even if I didn't have the skillset.

2:24:28.560 --> 2:24:33.720
 And in some ways, all of that echoes in your documentaries.

2:24:33.720 --> 2:24:37.160
 I'm not gonna let fear stop you from trying to help.

2:24:37.160 --> 2:24:40.800
 I think that experience, that experience of failure,

2:24:40.800 --> 2:24:45.160
 what I framed as just human failure on my part

2:24:46.280 --> 2:24:49.600
 is foundational probably to my work.

2:24:49.600 --> 2:24:52.000
 I don't want that to happen again, Lex.

2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:54.960
 I don't want to be that person who watches.

2:24:54.960 --> 2:24:57.240
 I want to do what I can when I can.

2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:02.720
 If we zoom out, you were just one human

2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:05.120
 that witnessed that, that trauma.

2:25:06.680 --> 2:25:09.640
 One human that witnessed so much suffering

2:25:09.640 --> 2:25:11.520
 in different parts of the world.

2:25:11.520 --> 2:25:15.760
 And as we zoom out across space and time and look at Earth,

2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:20.760
 why do you think we're here on this Earth?

2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:24.840
 What's the meaning of human civilization?

2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:29.840
 What's the meaning of your life, of individual human life?

2:25:29.840 --> 2:25:33.640
 And broadly speaking, what is the meaning of life?

2:25:33.640 --> 2:25:35.760
 Skyfish, Cheryl.

2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:37.280
 Oh boy, yeah.

2:25:41.840 --> 2:25:44.920
 For me, I can speak personally on that only.

2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:49.040
 And that's that I believe that the meaning of my life

2:25:49.040 --> 2:25:52.680
 is to try to make the world a little bit better before I go.

2:25:52.680 --> 2:25:57.680
 You know, I, when I was in theater in grad school,

2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:06.040
 I directed a play called Shadowlands by C.S. Lewis.

2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:09.000
 And there's a quote from that, it goes like this.

2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:10.880
 We are like blocks of stone

2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:15.040
 out of which the sculptor carves the forms of men.

2:26:15.040 --> 2:26:19.000
 The blows of his chisel, which hurt us so much,

2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:20.480
 are what make us perfect.

2:26:20.480 --> 2:26:23.480
 Now, I would take away the perfect part, right?

2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:27.560
 But I think I've remembered that quote for so many years

2:26:27.560 --> 2:26:30.840
 because I believe in the underlying notion

2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:33.520
 that the blows of the chisel,

2:26:33.520 --> 2:26:36.040
 which are the experiences that we go through,

2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:39.080
 shape us, right, necessarily so,

2:26:39.080 --> 2:26:42.640
 and hopefully shape us into a better human being.

2:26:42.640 --> 2:26:45.840
 And in my case, a human being that I hope

2:26:45.840 --> 2:26:47.800
 can make the world a little better,

2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:50.640
 you know, through those blows.

2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:51.760
 Before it's over.

2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:53.760
 Yeah, before it's over.

2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:57.000
 Before you go, as you said, do you think about that?

2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:02.000
 Do you think about the going part, your mortality?

2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:03.160
 You ever think about that?

2:27:03.160 --> 2:27:04.640
 You said you don't have a death wish,

2:27:04.640 --> 2:27:07.760
 you try to minimize risk, but eventually it's gonna be over.

2:27:07.760 --> 2:27:10.040
 Yeah, for all of us, absolutely.

2:27:10.040 --> 2:27:11.360
 Well, speak for yourself.

2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:13.560
 Well, you've got other plans as well.

2:27:13.560 --> 2:27:15.680
 I tend to merge, you know,

2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:18.240
 you've got other plans as well.

2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:23.240
 I'm going to merge with robots, embody, no, not at all.

2:27:23.360 --> 2:27:26.440
 Yes, for all of us, unfortunately or fortunately,

2:27:26.440 --> 2:27:28.440
 or who the heck knows.

2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:33.240
 But do you ponder your mortality?

2:27:33.240 --> 2:27:34.440
 Are you afraid of it?

2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:39.840
 I live with my mortality, knowing that it's fleeting,

2:27:39.840 --> 2:27:43.160
 that my life is fleeting and that I'm gonna go

2:27:43.160 --> 2:27:45.160
 into the ground, just like everyone else,

2:27:45.160 --> 2:27:47.120
 or maybe as ashes, you know?

2:27:48.840 --> 2:27:50.280
 So I live with that knowledge every day,

2:27:50.280 --> 2:27:54.360
 but I don't allow it to stop me or hold me up.

2:27:54.360 --> 2:27:58.080
 Rather, I really, it drives me, right?

2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:00.120
 It drives me to try to get as much done

2:28:00.120 --> 2:28:02.960
 as I can before I go, right?

2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:05.680
 Yeah, so the knowledge of your death

2:28:05.680 --> 2:28:07.720
 is a kind of dance partner,

2:28:07.720 --> 2:28:09.480
 and you try to dance beautifully.

2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:13.080
 This guy, you're an incredible human,

2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:15.120
 incredible artist and filmmaker,

2:28:16.080 --> 2:28:18.000
 and it's a huge honor that you would sit

2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:20.840
 and spend your really valuable time with me today.

2:28:20.840 --> 2:28:22.320
 I really, really enjoyed this conversation.

2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:23.840
 I did too, thanks for having me, Lex,

2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:25.920
 and thanks for doing what you do.

2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:27.440
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:28:27.440 --> 2:28:29.040
 with Sky Fist Gerald.

 And now, let me leave you with some words

2:28:35.320 --> 2:28:36.400
 from Elie Wiesel.

2:28:37.400 --> 2:28:41.600
 The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.

2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:45.760
 The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference.

2:28:45.760 --> 2:28:49.760
 The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference.

2:28:49.760 --> 2:28:54.760
 And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.

2:28:54.760 --> 2:29:10.760
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
