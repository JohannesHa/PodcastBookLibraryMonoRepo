00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
 The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein,

00:02.960 --> 00:05.640
 the third time we've spoken on this podcast.

00:05.640 --> 00:10.320
 He is the wise turtle master Oogway to my Kung Fu Panda,

00:10.320 --> 00:13.160
 one of my favorite people to talk to in this world.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.480
 A complicated and fascinating mind

00:15.480 --> 00:17.920
 that I'm grateful to have the chance to accompany

00:17.920 --> 00:20.560
 in exploring this world through conversation

00:20.560 --> 00:25.560
 on this podcast and on his, the latter called The Portal.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.240
 Quick mention of each sponsor followed by some thoughts

00:29.240 --> 00:31.220
 related to the episode.

00:31.220 --> 00:35.200
 First is Grammarly, a service I use in my writing

00:35.200 --> 00:37.720
 to check spelling, grammar, sentence structure,

00:37.720 --> 00:39.160
 and readability.

00:39.160 --> 00:43.320
 Second is Sunbasket, a meal delivery service I use

00:43.320 --> 00:46.520
 to add healthy variety into my culinary life.

00:47.640 --> 00:51.760
 Third is SEMrush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool

00:51.760 --> 00:53.400
 I've ever come across.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.640
 I don't like looking at numbers, but somebody should.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.840
 It helps you make good decisions.

00:58.840 --> 01:03.180
 And finally, ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years

01:03.180 --> 01:05.660
 to protect my privacy on the internet.

01:05.660 --> 01:07.960

01:11.680 --> 01:15.840
 As a side note, let me say that wherever this life takes me,

01:15.840 --> 01:17.940
 I'm drawn to the possibility of having many more

01:17.940 --> 01:21.280
 conversations with Eric through the years.

01:21.280 --> 01:24.960
 I think we have just the right kind of contrast

01:24.960 --> 01:29.120
 in having worldviews and a deep respect and appreciation

01:29.120 --> 01:32.760
 of each other's life stories that creates for

01:32.760 --> 01:36.240
 this magical experience in the realm of conversation

01:36.240 --> 01:41.240
 that feels like we're always looking for something

01:41.320 --> 01:43.640
 that we never quite find,

01:43.640 --> 01:45.900
 but are always better for having tried.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.200
 I'm not sure how or why the universe has connected

01:50.200 --> 01:52.560
 Eric and me, but it did.

01:52.560 --> 01:56.240
 And I would be a fool not to trust its judgment

01:56.240 --> 01:58.560
 and enjoy the journey.

 And now here's my conversation with Eric Weinstein.

02:16.460 --> 02:19.520
 Who's the greatest musician of all time, would you say?

02:19.520 --> 02:21.920
 We were just off camera talking about Eddie Van Halen.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.120
 He unfortunately passed away.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.080
 Who's the greatest musician of all time?

02:26.080 --> 02:27.400
 Yeah.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.880
 Jonathan Richman.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.560
 Who's that?

02:30.560 --> 02:31.560
 It's a weird question.

02:31.560 --> 02:32.760
 So I'm gonna give you a weird answer.

02:32.760 --> 02:33.580
 It's not because of...

02:33.580 --> 02:34.420
 Thank you.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.240
 Okay, Jonathan Richman.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.920
 The reason I'm picking on him is that he had a quote.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.540
 He was the front man of a group called the Modern Lovers.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.460
 And his quote was something like,

02:43.460 --> 02:46.560
 "'We have to be prepared to play music

02:46.560 --> 02:48.360
 "'when our instruments are broken,

02:48.360 --> 02:50.120
 "'the electricity's out and it's raining,'

02:50.120 --> 02:52.120
 "'something like that."

02:52.120 --> 02:53.840
 And I thought that that quote was very interesting

02:53.840 --> 02:55.440
 because what it said was,

02:55.440 --> 02:57.600
 you have to be able to strip this thing down

02:57.600 --> 02:58.760
 farther and farther back

02:58.760 --> 03:01.080
 to get to something that is intrinsically musical.

03:01.080 --> 03:05.680
 So we were having a conversation just now about virtuosity.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.960
 We're talking about Eddie Van Halen and his recent passing.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.640
 And that affected me emotionally.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.600
 I don't know whether it affected you.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.600
 I was never a Van Halen, the group fan,

03:13.600 --> 03:18.600
 but I revered Eddie Van Halen's capacity for innovation.

03:18.600 --> 03:23.540
 I saw him like Rodney Mullen, the skateboarder.

03:23.540 --> 03:26.340
 I had dreamed of having the two of them on the same podcast

03:26.340 --> 03:27.800
 just to talk about what it's like

03:27.800 --> 03:30.700
 to totally discontinuously innovate.

03:30.700 --> 03:33.340
 And he posted a video of Spanish Fly, I think,

03:33.340 --> 03:34.160
 and saying like,

03:34.160 --> 03:36.120
 I didn't know the guitar could make those kinds of sounds.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.260
 Like, what is this voodoo magic?

03:37.260 --> 03:38.520
 What is it?

03:38.520 --> 03:39.440
 Well, this is the thing, right?

03:39.440 --> 03:43.600
 The arpeggios that he did on a single string are so fast

03:43.600 --> 03:46.980
 and the attacks from the hammer ons,

03:46.980 --> 03:51.020
 when they go at light speed as he did, particularly.

03:51.020 --> 03:52.240
 And the reason I chose that was,

03:52.240 --> 03:55.300
 is that I wanted to strip out the electronics

03:55.300 --> 03:56.780
 because part of the claim will be is

03:56.780 --> 03:57.980
 that he's a rock musician.

03:57.980 --> 04:01.380
 And a lot of the innovations had to do with things peculiar

04:01.380 --> 04:03.660
 to sort of the electrified setup.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.780
 His use of the whammy bar, for example,

04:05.780 --> 04:10.060
 or the Frankenstrat that he built from different pieces.

04:11.500 --> 04:15.700
 All of those aspects, in my opinion,

04:15.700 --> 04:19.740
 are just dwarfed by his innovation and his musicianship.

04:19.740 --> 04:21.620
 And that's why I chose Spanish Fly,

04:21.620 --> 04:22.660
 because everyone, of course,

04:22.660 --> 04:24.140
 will go to something like your eruption

04:24.140 --> 04:25.060
 or running with the devil,

04:25.060 --> 04:27.900
 which is the first things that they heard

04:27.900 --> 04:30.020
 that let them know that there was a new force erupting

04:30.020 --> 04:32.820
 out of Southern California that was Eddie Van Halen, right?

04:32.820 --> 04:36.620
 I mean, I'm in love with the story of it.

04:36.620 --> 04:40.300
 You're often so poetic about music.

04:40.300 --> 04:43.980
 Like it clearly touches your soul on many levels.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.460
 What is that?

04:45.460 --> 04:47.780
 Is it deeper than just rocking out

04:47.780 --> 04:52.060
 with the in your convertible Corvette 69?

04:52.060 --> 04:54.580
 I imagine Eric Weinstein is driving down

04:54.580 --> 04:58.420
 the California highways, blasting some kind of music.

04:58.420 --> 05:01.980
 Is it just like being able to be carefree

05:01.980 --> 05:03.220
 for moments of time?

05:03.220 --> 05:05.340
 Or is there something more fundamental

05:05.340 --> 05:08.980
 that connects to like the theory of everything

05:08.980 --> 05:11.700
 in physics and life and all of that?

05:11.700 --> 05:13.940
 How often do you have the chance, for example,

05:13.940 --> 05:17.820
 to hear mathematics performed as you do in Bach, right?

05:17.820 --> 05:19.820
 Like something with that kind of precision

05:19.820 --> 05:22.500
 and elegance that can't really be grasped,

05:22.500 --> 05:27.500
 where to go back to Leonard Cohen's famous line,

05:28.460 --> 05:31.420
 the baffled king composing, right?

05:31.420 --> 05:32.380
 Such a good song.

05:32.380 --> 05:35.300
 Such a good song, but it's also like individual verses

05:35.300 --> 05:38.140
 of that song are insanely important.

05:39.260 --> 05:43.340
 The baffled king is how we often make music.

05:43.340 --> 05:46.700
 We don't really understand what did we just do

05:46.700 --> 05:50.260
 that broke that person's heart sitting on the couch, right?

05:50.260 --> 05:52.240
 And so it's a very strange thing

05:52.240 --> 05:54.060
 that you should be able to have.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.500
 Think of it like you're a computer.

05:55.500 --> 06:00.500
 You've got this weird open music port, port 37.8, you know?

06:00.700 --> 06:03.220
 Like it's not even supposed to be there.

06:03.220 --> 06:05.260
 And suddenly somebody starts playing guitar

06:05.260 --> 06:07.540
 and they're making you feel things.

06:07.540 --> 06:10.260
 Or like in particular, particular instruments

06:10.260 --> 06:14.060
 like the violin, it's so difficult.

06:14.060 --> 06:15.180
 It's so unforgiving.

06:15.180 --> 06:16.960
 And when it gives up its secrets,

06:16.960 --> 06:19.780
 it just, you know, it wraps its fingers

06:19.780 --> 06:22.020
 around your heart and won't let go.

06:22.020 --> 06:24.980
 Sometimes I talk about head, heart, and loins.

06:24.980 --> 06:27.600
 When something can grab your head, heart, and your loins

06:27.600 --> 06:30.660
 at the same moment and integrate them,

06:32.180 --> 06:34.620
 there are very few opportunities to live like that.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.580
 And if you think about Eddie Van Halen,

06:36.580 --> 06:41.580
 as far as your head, the musical innovations

06:42.020 --> 06:43.980
 and the fact that he was drawing directly

06:43.980 --> 06:48.580
 from the classical canon really speaks to the idea

06:48.580 --> 06:53.380
 that maybe rock is what somebody like Jimi Hendrix saw it

06:53.380 --> 06:56.700
 as being, you know, an infinitely extensible medium.

06:56.700 --> 07:01.620
 In terms of heart, I always notice the smile on his face.

07:01.620 --> 07:05.380
 It's painful to look at an Eddie Van Halen solo now.

07:05.380 --> 07:07.580
 Like sometimes you'll see the cigarette dripping off

07:07.580 --> 07:09.580
 the side of his mouth and you're like,

07:09.580 --> 07:10.940
 that's gonna fucking kill you.

07:10.940 --> 07:12.340
 And I'm not even worried about it for you.

07:12.340 --> 07:13.740
 I'm worried about it for me.

07:13.740 --> 07:14.740
 You're gonna rob.

07:14.740 --> 07:16.660
 I don't even need to hear you play another note.

07:16.660 --> 07:19.100
 I just like knowing that you're in the world,

07:19.100 --> 07:22.020
 that there is somebody that everyone looks to that nobody,

07:22.020 --> 07:25.660
 I've never heard a guitarist say, eh, I don't know.

07:25.660 --> 07:26.860
 I think he was okay.

07:26.860 --> 07:28.340
 Like I've never heard it.

07:28.340 --> 07:31.540
 You can hate him, but you still think he was a genius.

07:31.540 --> 07:34.820
 There are very few people like that in the world.

07:34.820 --> 07:37.580
 And then loins, those leaps,

07:37.580 --> 07:39.900
 that guy was incredibly good looking

07:39.900 --> 07:43.060
 and, you know, skin tight pants, super athleticism.

07:43.060 --> 07:47.620
 He completely owned the male sexuality of the stage,

07:47.620 --> 07:50.060
 both being the completely dominant,

07:50.060 --> 07:52.020
 you know, sort of mythical alpha male.

07:52.020 --> 07:54.540
 I hate that expression, but there you are.

07:54.540 --> 07:58.420
 But also this kind of little boy with this mischievous smirk

07:58.420 --> 08:01.740
 and, you know, the sense that it all came together.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.020
 How could you not eat that up?

08:04.020 --> 08:05.900
 You could just imagine the millions

08:05.900 --> 08:07.900
 of like young teenage boys, gorgeous,

08:07.900 --> 08:11.100
 like playing air guitar in their room,

08:11.100 --> 08:13.700
 just that, yeah, basically dreaming

08:13.700 --> 08:15.220
 of being that kind of God,

08:17.500 --> 08:20.340
 the most perfect example of what a human being can be.

08:20.340 --> 08:22.060
 Yeah, it's fascinating to think.

08:22.060 --> 08:24.020
 It is, and then, you know,

08:24.020 --> 08:27.140
 as in many of the cases with these bands,

08:27.140 --> 08:30.700
 you get these multiple talents in the same outfit.

08:30.700 --> 08:33.500
 And I think that the original configuration

08:33.500 --> 08:34.580
 with David Lee Roth, I mean,

08:34.580 --> 08:38.100
 David Lee Roth is such a hot mess at all times.

08:38.100 --> 08:41.540
 I would love you to talk to David Lee Roth.

08:41.540 --> 08:46.540
 Like if the, that dance would be just gorgeous.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.980
 I don't know.

08:47.980 --> 08:48.820
 Can you handle it?

08:48.820 --> 08:49.660
 Can you ride that?

08:49.660 --> 08:50.500
 Probably not.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.340
 Yeah.

08:51.340 --> 08:54.260
 Probably not because I think he's very,

08:54.260 --> 08:57.220
 I get the feeling that he's very smart

08:57.220 --> 09:00.140
 and very dysregulated.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.300
 And I don't know that I could,

09:02.300 --> 09:04.860
 like bring him down to earth for a moment.

09:04.860 --> 09:07.460
 Well, I can also get pretty dysregulated, you know?

09:07.460 --> 09:10.500
 And so I don't know whether, it could be magic.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.700
 It could be a shit show.

09:11.700 --> 09:14.060
 I don't know what you thought of his appearance on Rogan.

09:14.060 --> 09:15.660
 That was an interesting one.

09:15.660 --> 09:17.940
 I loved it, but Joe and that,

09:17.940 --> 09:19.140
 and Joe does this sometimes,

09:19.140 --> 09:21.740
 sometimes he just sits back and listens

09:21.740 --> 09:24.820
 and he just lets like the music play,

09:24.820 --> 09:26.580
 which works really well.

09:26.580 --> 09:31.140
 I think you have a chance to kind of jump into the chaos

09:31.140 --> 09:32.820
 and then you'll just start.

09:32.820 --> 09:34.860
 And the places you will go,

09:34.860 --> 09:37.540
 you may not even talk about music for like hours.

09:37.540 --> 09:38.860
 It might just go to this,

09:38.860 --> 09:40.220
 cause he, I think lives in Japan.

09:40.220 --> 09:41.540
 Like there's a weird,

09:41.540 --> 09:45.020
 he's been an EMT after he was a rock star.

09:45.020 --> 09:47.220
 He chose to be kind of like,

09:47.220 --> 09:48.060
 I don't know.

09:48.060 --> 09:50.900
 You know, it's like there's depth to that man

09:50.900 --> 09:53.980
 that hasn't been explored by him either.

09:53.980 --> 09:56.260
 So that'll be an exciting conversation.

09:56.260 --> 09:58.140
 Can we go back to Larry Cohen?

09:58.140 --> 09:58.980
 Yeah.

09:58.980 --> 09:59.820
 Can we just,

09:59.820 --> 10:03.420
 the things I feel when I listen to Hallelujah

10:03.420 --> 10:05.780
 by Leonard Cohen or anything by him really,

10:05.780 --> 10:06.620
 but that one.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.860
 Do you really want to get into it?

10:08.860 --> 10:09.700
 Let's go.

10:09.700 --> 10:12.780
 What is it that song mean to you?

10:14.620 --> 10:15.820
 Is it love?

10:15.820 --> 10:17.140
 Oh boy.

10:17.140 --> 10:19.900
 Well, first of all, it's mystery.

10:19.900 --> 10:22.540
 Like it starts off about mystery.

10:22.540 --> 10:24.220
 So what are you doing?

10:24.220 --> 10:28.740
 You're doing this alternation between the two chords.

10:28.740 --> 10:30.420
 So three notes at the same time.

10:30.420 --> 10:33.900
 One is called the tonic,

10:33.900 --> 10:36.580
 or you have the major and the relative minor

10:36.580 --> 10:38.380
 and he's alternating between them.

10:38.380 --> 10:39.820
 There's only one note of difference

10:39.820 --> 10:41.140
 between those two chords.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.700
 One of them would be feeling sad.

10:42.700 --> 10:45.540
 One of them would be more joyous, typically described.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.300
 And so by altering one note,

10:48.300 --> 10:50.700
 it's the minimal amount to take you back and forth

10:50.700 --> 10:54.820
 between joy and happiness as that's encoded in us.

10:54.820 --> 10:55.980
 So he starts off with,

10:55.980 --> 10:57.220
 I heard there was a scene,

10:57.220 --> 10:58.500
 David played the please a little bit.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.500
 You don't really care for music, do you?

11:02.420 --> 11:03.740
 That's really interesting

11:03.740 --> 11:06.620
 because he's using this technique called Bethos, right?

11:06.620 --> 11:10.260
 So the alternation between the sublime

11:10.260 --> 11:13.460
 and kind of the guttural or ridiculous or the mundane, right?

11:13.460 --> 11:14.300
 So he's like.

11:15.340 --> 11:16.980
 There's a bitterness to it too.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.260
 Is it just play?

11:18.260 --> 11:19.900
 Well, the way I hear it, again,

11:19.900 --> 11:21.940
 a great song allows for different interpretations.

11:21.940 --> 11:23.260
 You happen to be asking me,

11:23.260 --> 11:24.460
 so I'm going to impart some stuff

11:24.460 --> 11:25.700
 that probably isn't in the song,

11:25.700 --> 11:26.660
 but why it speaks to me,

11:26.660 --> 11:28.980
 that's what makes it great.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.300
 The way I hear it is he doesn't believe the audience.

11:31.300 --> 11:32.740
 You don't really care for music, do you?

11:32.740 --> 11:34.220
 Then what are you doing listening to this?

11:34.220 --> 11:37.500
 You stupid idiots, of course you care for music.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.340
 You're too cool to care.

11:39.340 --> 11:41.500
 So I see through you and screw you.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.620
 That's the energy I get.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.420
 Then he does this weird thing.

11:46.420 --> 11:50.020
 It goes like this is where he should put the description

11:50.020 --> 11:51.660
 of where he is in the chord progression,

11:51.660 --> 11:53.300
 which is the tonic, right?

11:53.300 --> 11:54.140
 It goes like this.

11:54.140 --> 11:56.740
 And then he hits the fourth and the fifth,

11:56.740 --> 11:58.740
 which are the two other major elements,

11:58.740 --> 12:02.020
 the subdominant and the dominant in functional harmony.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.700
 So he's describing the chord progression

12:04.700 --> 12:07.060
 in real time in the lyrics.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.220
 There's two ways this can come about in other songs.

12:10.220 --> 12:14.580
 We had this example of every time we say goodbye.

12:14.580 --> 12:15.900
 Do you know this song?

12:15.900 --> 12:17.660
 Every time we say goodbye.

12:17.660 --> 12:20.540
 No, I think it was a Cole Porter, maybe,

12:20.540 --> 12:22.820
 or Gershwin, maybe Porter, I don't know.

12:22.820 --> 12:27.100
 I cry a little, there is no love song finer,

12:27.100 --> 12:32.100
 but how strange the change from major to minor, right?

12:32.500 --> 12:34.820
 Like it's a beautiful use of it.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.380
 Then there's times when it's duplicitous.

12:37.380 --> 12:39.120
 So for example, you'll have,

12:41.260 --> 12:42.660
 I guess my favorite examples of this

12:42.660 --> 12:45.340
 are Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire.

12:45.340 --> 12:48.340
 I fell into a burning ring of fire.

12:48.340 --> 12:53.020
 And then what does he do with the lyrics in the tune?

12:53.020 --> 12:55.620
 I went down, down, down.

12:55.620 --> 12:56.940
 He goes up, right?

12:56.940 --> 13:00.180
 And so the idea is like, oh, okay, that was a head fake.

13:00.180 --> 13:04.780
 And another one of these is Nina Simone's Feeling Good.

13:05.860 --> 13:07.340
 Oh, okay, so what do you get?

13:07.340 --> 13:12.340
 Birds flying high, you know how I feel.

13:12.340 --> 13:17.340
 Then sun up in the sky, you know how I feel.

13:18.740 --> 13:22.140
 That woman's voice, she doesn't give a damn yet.

13:22.140 --> 13:22.980
 She's just.

13:22.980 --> 13:26.300
 And I feel it, but then what's the, da dum, da dum.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.140
 It's like heavy stripping music.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.620
 It's, you're not in a good place.

13:30.620 --> 13:33.180
 You're probably in some strip club,

13:33.180 --> 13:34.460
 with the last of your money,

13:34.460 --> 13:39.180
 you're drinking lousy beer, some bad situation.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.380
 And she's feeling good?

13:40.380 --> 13:41.660
 No, it's funereal.

13:41.660 --> 13:43.540
 It's oppressive, right?

13:43.540 --> 13:45.580
 I never thought of that song that way.

13:45.580 --> 13:46.700
 Wow.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.260
 Well, you think of it as joyous?

13:48.260 --> 13:49.100
 Yeah.

13:49.100 --> 13:50.140
 No, no, no, if you think about it,

13:50.140 --> 13:53.220
 contrast it with Ray Charles, for example.

13:53.220 --> 13:55.260
 You know, do you know Lonely Avenue?

13:56.540 --> 14:00.060
 Well, my room has got two windows,

14:00.060 --> 14:02.820
 but the sunshine never comes through.

14:02.820 --> 14:04.300
 It's really depressed.

14:04.300 --> 14:07.980
 It's the same sort of vibe as Nina,

14:07.980 --> 14:09.780
 but she's claiming that she's in great shape.

14:09.780 --> 14:13.340
 So she's like a good case of the unreliable narrator.

14:13.340 --> 14:14.180
 Leonard Cohen, to me,

14:14.180 --> 14:16.020
 is talking about the unreliable audience.

14:16.020 --> 14:18.740
 That's too cool to be with the performer on stage.

14:18.740 --> 14:20.020
 There are things that go with the music,

14:20.020 --> 14:21.220
 like the Cole Porter stuff,

14:21.220 --> 14:23.460
 there's go against like the Johnny Cash.

14:23.460 --> 14:26.180
 I think these are the games that musicians play

14:26.180 --> 14:29.260
 that the rest of us only sort of notice subliminally.

14:30.180 --> 14:31.100
 Okay.

14:31.100 --> 14:33.180
 Fourth, the fifth, then he,

14:33.180 --> 14:36.020
 when he, he should say something about the relative minor

14:36.020 --> 14:38.100
 or the, he's giving you the secret,

14:38.100 --> 14:40.180
 the baffled king, in other words,

14:40.180 --> 14:42.300
 he doesn't know why it works.

14:42.300 --> 14:45.940
 Did Pachelbel know why Pachelbel's Canon would work?

14:45.940 --> 14:47.100
 It was a discovery.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.140
 That's the whole thing.

14:48.140 --> 14:52.700
 Like some music is discovered and some music is invented.

14:52.700 --> 14:56.260
 And he's talking about a musical discovery.

14:56.260 --> 14:59.060
 He's talking about the Pythagorean power

14:59.060 --> 15:01.980
 of the wave equation and then superimpose,

15:01.980 --> 15:05.900
 like there's two genius intellectual concepts behind music.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.900
 One of which is the wave equation.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.940
 Usually we solve it for a one dimensional medium

15:09.940 --> 15:11.940
 because we're talking about strings or air columns.

15:11.940 --> 15:15.620
 Occasionally you're talking about things like handpans

15:15.620 --> 15:19.180
 or steel drums or metallophones or gamelons, whatever.

15:19.180 --> 15:21.740
 And those have a wave equation too,

15:21.740 --> 15:23.740
 that's much more chaotic.

15:23.740 --> 15:25.740
 The other equation is this crazy thing

15:25.740 --> 15:29.780
 that two to the 19 twelfths is almost exactly equal to three,

15:29.780 --> 15:31.900
 which is what gave us even temperament.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.220
 And so the tension between those two things

15:34.220 --> 15:37.780
 is in fact one of these most beautiful stories

15:37.780 --> 15:39.260
 inside of that system.

15:40.220 --> 15:43.220
 That formula of the baffled king is a discovery.

15:43.220 --> 15:46.100
 It's not, he's not really composing it.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.460
 The reason he's baffled,

15:47.460 --> 15:50.660
 it's imagine that you took like a little brush

15:50.660 --> 15:55.380
 and you started brushing off a pyramid under the sands.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.660
 You might think that you created the pyramid

15:57.660 --> 16:00.300
 by your brushing, but in fact, if somebody else did it,

16:00.300 --> 16:02.860
 that's why you're baffled, right?

16:02.860 --> 16:04.140
 That's beautifully put, you're right.

16:04.140 --> 16:07.940
 And as creating one of the greatest songs of all time

16:07.940 --> 16:10.380
 and as he's doing it, he's baffled.

16:10.380 --> 16:13.260
 And he's within the song.

16:13.260 --> 16:15.660
 And he Leonard is baffled is my contention,

16:15.660 --> 16:19.180
 but he knows enough to know that he's baffled, right?

16:19.180 --> 16:20.940
 And so the idea is that he is composing,

16:20.940 --> 16:25.940
 he has the audacity to compose as David.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.580
 He's echoing David at a minimum.

16:30.580 --> 16:31.660
 And then in a later song,

16:31.660 --> 16:32.980
 which I really wish we would discuss,

16:32.980 --> 16:36.500
 that's totally dystopic and you will not like it at all,

16:36.500 --> 16:39.940
 is the future, which contains this line

16:39.940 --> 16:41.980
 that I think I used in my episode

16:41.980 --> 16:44.500
 with Roger Penrose on the portal.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.940
 Note the subtle plug.

16:45.940 --> 16:49.820
 The portal, the portal, the portal, the portal.

16:49.820 --> 16:51.940
 I'm the little Jew that wrote the Bible.

16:51.940 --> 16:54.100
 So there is this way in which Leonard Cohen,

16:54.100 --> 16:56.420
 I think is constantly coming to the idea

16:56.420 --> 16:59.940
 of being a biblical like scribe.

16:59.940 --> 17:01.500
 And I think this is one of the great things

17:01.500 --> 17:04.460
 that you see Dylan doing this with all along the watchtower.

17:04.460 --> 17:07.860
 You saw Warren Zevon, who we should talk much more about,

17:07.860 --> 17:10.140
 doing this with a song called I Was in the House

17:10.140 --> 17:11.180
 When the House Burned Down.

17:11.180 --> 17:12.380
 Do you know this thing?

17:12.380 --> 17:13.220
 No.

17:13.220 --> 17:14.040
 This is embarrassing.

17:14.040 --> 17:14.880
 Sweetheart.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.500
 This is a great day.

17:16.500 --> 17:19.340
 Warren Zevon is one of the most important songwriters

17:19.340 --> 17:20.180
 of our time.

17:20.180 --> 17:25.180
 And he's been largely forgotten by this generation.

17:26.540 --> 17:29.820
 But Bob Dylan would sing one of his songs in tribute.

17:29.820 --> 17:33.020
 I've heard Bob Dylan, you know,

17:33.020 --> 17:35.220
 very small number of songwriters really move him.

17:35.220 --> 17:40.220
 Woody Guthrie, Gordon Lightfoot, and Warren Zevon.

17:40.580 --> 17:43.020
 By the way, Bob Dylan, if you're out there,

17:43.020 --> 17:45.280
 appear on either one of our podcasts.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.300
 We need to get your voice into a new medium

17:47.300 --> 17:48.580
 for a new group.

17:48.580 --> 17:49.420
 Definitely.

17:49.420 --> 17:51.500
 This is a time for Bob Dylan, my friend.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.700
 Honestly, you've been doing an amazing job in this space.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.940
 One of the reasons I'm super excited to do this podcast

17:57.940 --> 18:01.700
 again is that I've learned some things

18:01.700 --> 18:03.220
 about what I don't do well.

18:03.220 --> 18:07.200
 And I also have sort of struggled with the question,

18:07.200 --> 18:08.700
 should I do those things better?

18:08.700 --> 18:10.460
 Because what if it's, you know,

18:10.460 --> 18:12.540
 I always use the same example of the fitted sheet

18:12.540 --> 18:14.740
 when you're trying to put a queen size fitted sheet

18:14.740 --> 18:15.980
 on a king size mattress.

18:15.980 --> 18:17.740
 He's like, okay, I got that corner squared away.

18:17.740 --> 18:19.340
 Then you get another corner that pops off

18:19.340 --> 18:21.280
 and they have to go back around.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.780
 I wonder whether I can improve my style in the ways in which,

18:24.780 --> 18:28.860
 you know, I think it's just a recognition of a difference.

18:28.860 --> 18:32.060
 You do a better job of getting to the soul

18:32.060 --> 18:35.420
 of a really top intellectual guest

18:35.420 --> 18:38.820
 and making them accessible and presenting them

18:38.820 --> 18:42.300
 as themselves for a huge number of people.

18:42.300 --> 18:45.260
 And I'd give my eye tooth to be able to do that.

18:45.260 --> 18:46.940
 Do you ever think about this?

18:46.940 --> 18:50.100
 Like, cause I think about what is the greatest

18:50.100 --> 18:52.500
 conversation I'll ever have.

18:52.500 --> 18:55.660
 You know, like in a sense of the portal,

18:55.660 --> 18:57.660
 not to reduce it to anything,

18:57.660 --> 19:00.820
 but there will be the greatest conversation.

19:00.820 --> 19:03.660
 You may have already had it, but it's very possible.

19:03.660 --> 19:07.260
 If enough people like me can keep twisting your arm

19:07.260 --> 19:09.140
 to keep doing the portal, please,

19:09.140 --> 19:12.060
 that is, there'll be an amazing conversation.

19:12.060 --> 19:16.020
 One of the questions that I ask myself is like,

19:16.020 --> 19:20.420
 who is the person that I'm especially equipped?

19:20.420 --> 19:23.040
 For some reason, I'm convinced on Putin.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.180
 There's something in my head that says,

19:25.180 --> 19:30.060
 I can do this man better than anyone else in this world.

19:30.060 --> 19:32.820
 I got this thought in my head about it, I don't know why.

19:32.820 --> 19:34.860
 And I'm convinced, but I think the universe works

19:34.860 --> 19:35.700
 in that way.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.140
 Like if it tells you, it's gonna happen.

19:38.140 --> 19:40.600
 The way I would say it is, is that almost everybody

19:40.600 --> 19:43.700
 who becomes a Supreme Court justice believes

19:43.700 --> 19:45.620
 at a very early age, they're going to become

19:45.620 --> 19:46.500
 a Supreme Court justice.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.740
 Many people believe at an early age that they can do it,

19:48.740 --> 19:49.820
 don't get there.

19:49.820 --> 19:52.000
 But of those who get there, almost all of them

19:52.000 --> 19:55.700
 had this sort of, well, I call it pathological

19:55.700 --> 19:56.940
 self confidence.

19:56.940 --> 20:01.040
 And I do think you have pathological self confidence

20:01.040 --> 20:02.540
 and you also have humility.

20:02.540 --> 20:05.600
 And most people would hear those as a contradiction.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.460
 I think that you would not be able to get away

20:07.460 --> 20:11.880
 with what you do if you didn't have the humility.

20:11.880 --> 20:15.500
 And so I think the great danger is that your equation

20:15.500 --> 20:18.740
 becomes unbalanced, that you either lose the humility

20:18.740 --> 20:23.740
 or you lose the humility overwhelms the ego and the drive.

20:24.020 --> 20:26.100
 Because right now you've got a Mexican standoff

20:26.100 --> 20:28.540
 in your mind and the rest of us are just benefiting.

20:28.540 --> 20:29.680
 That's beautifully put.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.180
 My Mexican standoffs aren't as stable as yours.

20:32.180 --> 20:35.280
 It's all reservoir dogs all the time.

20:36.140 --> 20:39.820
 But actually the person who that describes is Peter Thiel.

20:39.820 --> 20:42.260
 Peter Thiel thinks more, people always say like,

20:42.260 --> 20:44.260
 what does Peter think about X, Y, and Z, P, and Q?

20:44.260 --> 20:46.220
 It's like, well, do you want communist Peter?

20:46.220 --> 20:47.700
 Do you want hyper capitalist Peter?

20:47.700 --> 20:50.020
 He's got all these minds in there, oh my God, right?

20:50.020 --> 20:50.860
 On everything.

20:50.860 --> 20:52.900
 That's why he's successful is that he's got all these minds

20:52.900 --> 20:53.740
 fighting each other.

20:53.740 --> 20:56.100
 And so when people say Peter is this or Peter is that,

20:56.100 --> 20:59.940
 I just laugh because like nobody who knows him

20:59.940 --> 21:02.940
 would describe him as having thoughts at the level

21:02.940 --> 21:04.520
 that people are claiming.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.160
 And I do think that in my case,

21:12.200 --> 21:14.820
 there's also pathological epistemic humility.

21:14.820 --> 21:19.820
 Like just, I know how little I can do in one life.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.700
 I know how many things I've screwed up.

21:22.700 --> 21:25.180
 I know how many things I've got wrong.

21:25.180 --> 21:28.380
 And on the other hand, I know that if not,

21:28.380 --> 21:30.100
 it's like Hillel's questions,

21:30.100 --> 21:32.340
 if I'm not for myself, who will be for me?

21:32.340 --> 21:34.100
 And if I'm only for myself, what am I?

21:34.100 --> 21:35.180
 If not now, when?

21:36.900 --> 21:38.860
 At some level, there's a question about

21:39.980 --> 21:43.140
 if I don't decide that someone is capable

21:43.140 --> 21:45.220
 and that that somebody is me.

21:45.220 --> 21:49.100
 And if I apply that to everyone else on the planet,

21:49.100 --> 21:50.460
 then nobody's gonna do anything.

21:50.460 --> 21:52.580
 And so I do think that one of the things

21:52.580 --> 21:56.040
 that people like you and I get is who are you to say that?

21:57.500 --> 22:02.340
 F that, man, just sign me up for some Dunning Kruger.

22:03.940 --> 22:06.880
 Yeah, but it's multiple minds like you said.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.980
 Like this morning, I was feeling so good and confident

22:09.980 --> 22:12.280
 about I couldn't think no wrong.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.260
 And I remember last night clearly thinking

22:14.260 --> 22:16.780
 that I'm the dumbest human who's ever lived

22:16.780 --> 22:19.700
 and nothing I've ever said is worth anything.

22:19.700 --> 22:22.560
 What the fuck am I doing with my life?

22:22.560 --> 22:23.760
 Why am I scared?

22:23.760 --> 22:26.340
 I was terrified of this conversation.

22:26.340 --> 22:27.180
 Who the hell am I?

22:27.180 --> 22:28.020
 This conversation?

22:28.020 --> 22:29.300
 Because I'm an idiot.

22:29.300 --> 22:34.140
 And because, you know, Lex, but no, no, no, no.

22:34.140 --> 22:38.300
 But this morning, I was the baddest motherfucker

22:38.300 --> 22:39.420
 who's ever walked this earth.

22:39.420 --> 22:41.780
 So I was very conscious.

22:41.780 --> 22:44.340
 I think it was the coffee, I'm not sure, maybe some sleep.

22:44.340 --> 22:47.140
 This sounds very Russian and it involves multiple beverages,

22:47.140 --> 22:49.960
 some of them being alcoholic, others containing caffeine.

22:49.960 --> 22:53.620
 There's, in fact, I can't share the story behind it,

22:53.620 --> 22:56.180
 but there is a bottle of vodka in the fridge.

22:56.180 --> 22:57.660
 Okay.

22:57.660 --> 23:00.140
 So, I mean, I should have hit you for coffee

23:00.140 --> 23:02.580
 because this is a morning show here.

23:02.580 --> 23:05.020
 So I put out a call that we get a chance

23:05.020 --> 23:06.180
 to have this conversation

23:06.180 --> 23:08.500
 and people ask these wonderful questions.

23:08.500 --> 23:13.400
 A few people asked about depression and suicide.

23:16.020 --> 23:19.260
 This is a Russian program, so we have to go there.

23:19.260 --> 23:20.980
 And I think about Leonard Cohen

23:20.980 --> 23:25.980
 and one of the things that always kind of broke my heart

23:28.620 --> 23:31.540
 and kind of suffocated the hope I have for just,

23:33.820 --> 23:36.780
 I don't know, for love in a person's life

23:36.780 --> 23:39.900
 is to hear how much depression was a part

23:39.900 --> 23:42.900
 of Leonard Cohen's life and how much he suffered.

23:44.460 --> 23:47.260
 I guess one way, I'm not sure where we can go

23:47.260 --> 23:50.580
 with this question, but do you think about the places

23:50.580 --> 23:54.260
 that the mind can go, like these dark places?

23:54.260 --> 23:55.420
 Yeah.

23:55.420 --> 24:00.120
 Is there something like where the only escape out

24:00.120 --> 24:02.920
 is suicide, for example, that's the darkest version of it?

24:02.920 --> 24:07.380
 That, I really think suicide is a big place

24:07.380 --> 24:09.900
 in suicidal ideation and self harm

24:09.900 --> 24:12.460
 and we don't talk a lot about it.

24:14.180 --> 24:17.300
 It's a similar problem to trying to talk about trans.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.260
 These are umbrella categories.

24:19.260 --> 24:23.380
 And if the commonality is that somebody harms themselves,

24:23.380 --> 24:25.660
 but we don't know whether that's coming

24:25.660 --> 24:28.000
 because of a problem in brain chemistry,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.060
 because of an event in their life,

24:30.060 --> 24:34.500
 whether evolutionary programming for suicide

24:34.500 --> 24:37.580
 is weirdly normal, whether or not

24:37.580 --> 24:40.420
 it might have a religious motivation.

24:40.420 --> 24:43.620
 There's too many different forms of self harm.

24:43.620 --> 24:47.260
 It's something like the 10th largest killer thereabouts.

24:49.780 --> 24:53.380
 And I think that you can look at it from different angles.

24:53.380 --> 24:58.380
 I'm old enough to have had Pete Seeger come to my college

24:58.380 --> 25:03.380
 when I was at university and to watch his good humor

25:04.300 --> 25:06.180
 in the face of all adversity.

25:07.820 --> 25:10.900
 I think of Odetta, I used to go to Odetta concerts.

25:10.900 --> 25:13.340
 I don't know if you know who she is.

25:13.340 --> 25:15.340
 Okay, this is gonna be one of the better days of your life.

25:15.340 --> 25:17.980
 Check out Odetta when we're done with the interview.

25:19.180 --> 25:20.980
 She was a civil rights figure,

25:20.980 --> 25:25.980
 but also just had a profound voice and great musicianship.

25:25.980 --> 25:29.360
 These people were in the struggle, right?

25:29.360 --> 25:32.880
 And they saw lots of bad things happen

25:32.880 --> 25:34.960
 and they kept their humor about them.

25:34.960 --> 25:39.960
 And the thing is that you can take on the Weltschmerz,

25:41.760 --> 25:43.600
 the pain of the planet,

25:43.600 --> 25:46.520
 or you can try to do something else,

25:46.520 --> 25:48.240
 which is to be a happy warrior,

25:48.240 --> 25:51.520
 even if the odds are terrible

25:51.520 --> 25:55.200
 and the cost of failure is catastrophic.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.400
 So even when surrounded by darkness.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.380
 But the thing is with Leonard Cohen

26:00.380 --> 26:02.720
 is he created such beautiful music.

26:03.600 --> 26:07.260
 And yet it's like Anthony Bourdain, the same.

26:08.140 --> 26:11.400
 And yet they go to this dark place.

26:11.400 --> 26:15.400
 And it could be, it's easy to say it's just biochemistry.

26:16.720 --> 26:19.300
 There's a linkage between this highly generative,

26:19.300 --> 26:23.520
 creative side and in some cases,

26:23.520 --> 26:26.860
 dark depression, in other cases, not.

26:26.860 --> 26:29.400
 So you can't say that it's tied,

26:29.400 --> 26:32.180
 the genius and madness are always co traveling

26:32.180 --> 26:35.580
 or the beauty and pain are one in the same.

26:35.580 --> 26:38.380
 What you can say is that there's a cluster of people

26:38.380 --> 26:40.260
 that tell you that for that cluster,

26:40.260 --> 26:43.660
 there is a relationship between the darkness and the beauty.

26:43.660 --> 26:45.460
 And I do think that in part,

26:45.460 --> 26:47.960
 it's squaring circles that can't be squared.

26:47.960 --> 26:52.960
 We were just talking before about the inability

26:54.760 --> 26:56.560
 to serve two perfect systems,

26:56.560 --> 26:58.800
 the perfect system of the wave equation

26:58.800 --> 27:01.240
 and the perfect system of even temperament.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.600
 They're both perfect, they're not compatible.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.920
 And once you realize that there is perfection

27:07.920 --> 27:11.060
 and an inability to make contact with perfection,

27:11.060 --> 27:16.060
 I think you recognize that there is no solution

27:20.720 --> 27:21.560
 to this world.

27:23.080 --> 27:26.880
 Yeah, that's weird with the poets and musicians.

27:26.880 --> 27:29.840
 Do you want to say this is a particular thing that you do,

27:29.840 --> 27:32.080
 but then there's Spanish fly by Van Halen.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.960
 And then you realize, oh, well,

27:34.960 --> 27:37.920
 what do you get out of Spanish fly by Van Halen?

27:37.920 --> 27:40.640
 I think it's very singular because of the fact

27:40.640 --> 27:42.260
 that it's purely acoustic.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.280
 For some reason, I always,

27:44.280 --> 27:47.640
 I couldn't imagine Eddie Van Halen separate from the band

27:47.640 --> 27:51.080
 in front of thousands of people just screaming

27:51.080 --> 27:53.440
 and rocking out with lights everywhere.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.880
 And Spanish fly made me think like,

27:55.880 --> 27:57.680
 it made me imagine him sitting alone

27:57.680 --> 27:58.520
 on a couch in a room.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.560
 I think that's who he was, I really do.

28:00.560 --> 28:03.320
 I mean, believe me, I get it.

28:03.320 --> 28:04.620
 He was a rockstar, he was a rock god.

28:04.620 --> 28:06.120
 Got it, got it, got it, got it.

28:07.240 --> 28:10.080
 I'm almost positive that you can't get

28:10.080 --> 28:13.400
 to where he got to without being a complete introvert.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.840
 Yeah, it made me imagine

28:14.840 --> 28:19.840
 that there's some half naked supermodel walking around,

28:20.000 --> 28:24.440
 hoping that they can do their thing together.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.220
 And Eddie's completely disinterested.

28:26.220 --> 28:27.060
 He'd be with the guitar.

28:27.060 --> 28:28.360
 He'd be with the guitar, right?

28:28.360 --> 28:29.200
 Yeah.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.960
 Because honestly, at some level,

28:31.960 --> 28:35.040
 in one case, maybe you're conquesting,

28:35.040 --> 28:37.120
 maybe you're pursuing love and romance.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.920
 In the other case, you're talking about a relationship

28:39.920 --> 28:42.960
 to the order, the creator, the almighty,

28:42.960 --> 28:44.800
 whatever it is you want to call that substrate

28:44.800 --> 28:46.740
 that is reality.

28:46.740 --> 28:51.200
 And do I believe that Eddie Van Halen

28:51.200 --> 28:53.860
 and Jimi Hendrix and Paganini and Heifetz

28:53.860 --> 28:56.480
 jacked into the true essence of the world?

28:56.480 --> 28:57.720
 Yeah, they did.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.640
 I don't think it's as good as differential geometry.

29:00.640 --> 29:01.680
 I'm sorry.

29:01.680 --> 29:05.800
 I do think it's amazing for other reasons.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.960
 And thank God, because it's very typical

29:07.960 --> 29:10.320
 to communicate differential geometry at scale.

29:10.320 --> 29:13.140
 But the thing about eruption, for example,

29:13.140 --> 29:15.320
 what level do you want to come into eruption?

29:15.320 --> 29:18.200
 Do you want just the sheer majesty and pageantry?

29:18.200 --> 29:20.020
 Do you want the theatrics?

29:20.020 --> 29:21.880
 Like you could put him on wires

29:21.880 --> 29:24.880
 and set his pants on fire or whatever,

29:24.880 --> 29:27.460
 and it'd be totally in keeping with it.

29:27.460 --> 29:28.300
 On the other hand, you want to talk

29:28.300 --> 29:29.960
 to something completely precise

29:31.400 --> 29:33.640
 that shows off the virtuosity

29:33.640 --> 29:36.400
 of what's possible with the Stratocaster.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.160
 Everything works.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.000
 Multi axis.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.840
 But there's a precision to it,

29:40.840 --> 29:44.040
 which is very different than Hendrix.

29:44.040 --> 29:46.040
 There's a messiness to Hendrix that to me,

29:46.040 --> 29:49.360
 somebody who has OCD has always been a struggle.

29:49.360 --> 29:50.640
 How does Hendrix affect you?

29:50.640 --> 29:52.600
 I mean, let's have the Jimi Hendrix conversation.

29:52.600 --> 29:53.840
 I don't know that we can do anything to it

29:53.840 --> 29:56.120
 that hasn't already been done to it.

29:56.120 --> 29:56.960
 Maybe that's not true.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.960
 Maybe the idea is that every generation

29:58.960 --> 30:01.280
 has to have its Hendrix conversation,

30:01.280 --> 30:02.120
 and this is a long form part.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.600
 It's Jimi Hendrix experience.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.440
 Yeah.

30:04.440 --> 30:05.760
 Yeah, so funny.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.240
 I hear you stole it from Joe Rogan.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.080
 Yeah.

30:10.020 --> 30:11.520
 There's so many details.

30:11.520 --> 30:16.520
 One, it hurt my soul on so many levels

30:17.140 --> 30:20.120
 that you can put a thumb over the guitar

30:20.120 --> 30:23.480
 to play a note, to hold the note.

30:23.480 --> 30:27.700
 And it doesn't, because I want it to be the Russian virtuoso

30:27.700 --> 30:30.960
 that sits with his classical guitar in a perfect form,

30:30.960 --> 30:32.720
 plays really fast with the fingers,

30:32.720 --> 30:36.240
 and then you want the thumb to be perfectly relaxed

30:36.240 --> 30:37.080
 and supporting the neck.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.000
 So that's the Russian conservatory student.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.640
 Conservatory student, yeah.

30:40.640 --> 30:43.340
 Then there's the Russian wild man.

30:43.340 --> 30:44.180
 Which one is that?

30:44.180 --> 30:47.560
 Well, they're different Russian archetypes, right?

30:47.560 --> 30:50.440
 So the completely idiosyncratic Russian

30:50.440 --> 30:53.560
 is very different in a weird way from the,

30:55.480 --> 30:58.540
 I can do this backwards in any key in my sleep

30:58.540 --> 31:03.040
 and in any time signature that you just snap your fingers.

31:03.040 --> 31:08.040
 We've discussed my piano tuner in previous episodes.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.480
 No, no, that was offline conversation.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.640
 You told me the story.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.120
 I should tell you the story.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.440
 You should retell the story.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.840
 There I was in darkest Manhattan

31:16.840 --> 31:19.960
 with the world's shittiest, it wasn't even an upright,

31:19.960 --> 31:21.760
 it was a spinet piano.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.560
 A friend had given it to me.

31:23.560 --> 31:27.480
 The piano fell out of tune and I would have to tune it.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.920
 And the only tuner I knew was this Russian guy

31:29.920 --> 31:31.520
 and I hated dealing with him.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.840
 There was something about his attitude

31:32.840 --> 31:35.160
 that just really rubbed me the wrong way.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.320
 So anyway, my wife says, tune that thing.

31:37.320 --> 31:40.600
 So we get the piano tuner to come and he's tuning this.

31:40.600 --> 31:44.280
 He's like, are you sure you wanna tune this piece of shit?

31:44.280 --> 31:45.440
 Okay, fine.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.240
 So he's like, okay, it's your money.

31:48.320 --> 31:51.840
 The phone rings and I have the phone ringer set

31:51.840 --> 31:55.400
 on a landline to Paganini Caprice 24.

31:55.400 --> 31:58.440
 And immediately as the phone rings,

31:58.440 --> 32:02.000
 he figures out what key the phone ringer is

32:02.000 --> 32:05.560
 and which is not the key that like list composed

32:05.560 --> 32:09.160
 the variations on Caprice 24.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.480
 And he starts going into theme and variations

32:11.480 --> 32:14.840
 on Caprice 24 at some level I've never heard before,

32:14.840 --> 32:17.100
 just jaw dropping it.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.960
 And like the phone stops ringing

32:18.960 --> 32:20.600
 and we have this awkward silence.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.480
 I said, I didn't know you were such a great piano player.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.960
 And then he says one of these things

32:24.960 --> 32:28.280
 in Russian accented English hurts in a way

32:28.280 --> 32:29.120
 you can't imagine.

32:29.120 --> 32:31.960
 He said, no, you are the piano player.

32:31.960 --> 32:33.960
 I am merely the piano tuner.

32:33.960 --> 32:38.480
 And I was just like, oh man, through the heart.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.080
 You know, it's kind of reminiscent.

32:40.080 --> 32:41.400
 I'd love to hear actually your opinion.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.160
 This is reminiscent of the Good Will Hunting story.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.760
 What do you think about that?

32:45.760 --> 32:46.600
 That movie?

32:46.600 --> 32:47.440
 That movie.

32:47.440 --> 32:48.260
 What about it?

32:48.260 --> 32:49.100
 It's MIT.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.600
 Yeah, I guess when I think of that film,

32:51.600 --> 32:55.180
 I think about Matt Damon as a young guy,

32:56.220 --> 33:00.120
 risking everything, giving up Harvard.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.360
 I think probably the most accomplished group

33:02.360 --> 33:03.720
 of people in the world are people

33:03.720 --> 33:05.880
 who choose to give up Harvard voluntarily.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.400
 Beautiful, right?

33:08.400 --> 33:09.220
 That's true.

33:09.220 --> 33:10.060
 Bigger than Harvard.

33:10.060 --> 33:10.880
 That's very true.

33:10.880 --> 33:14.660
 Ives was one of these people, Bill Gates, of course.

33:18.160 --> 33:19.680
 And then oddly, you know.

33:19.680 --> 33:20.520
 Zuckerberg.

33:20.520 --> 33:21.340
 What?

33:21.340 --> 33:24.560
 But then Steve Jobs gave up a Reed,

33:24.560 --> 33:26.880
 and Reed is like the weirdest, craziest college

33:26.880 --> 33:27.720
 in the world.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.200
 People should pay much more attention to Reed.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.800
 And I'm sorry it's going through a hard time at the moment,

33:31.800 --> 33:33.880
 but what it was before the current craziness

33:33.880 --> 33:36.020
 is really an interesting story.

33:36.020 --> 33:38.840
 Irregardless, as we say in the 617 Area Code,

33:40.840 --> 33:43.720
 I think that a lot of my reaction

33:43.720 --> 33:47.240
 is to the real story of Matt Damon having this vision

33:47.240 --> 33:49.900
 and being the young guy to pull it off.

33:49.900 --> 33:52.480
 And I also think about Robin Williams

33:52.480 --> 33:57.480
 trying to explore heart through this lens of acting.

33:58.160 --> 34:03.040
 And as you and I, you've hung out with comedians.

34:04.040 --> 34:07.640
 They know that they already screwed up a bunch of people.

34:07.640 --> 34:08.460
 They do.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.160
 They're proud about it.

34:10.160 --> 34:11.760
 They really are.

34:11.760 --> 34:14.320
 The idea that Robin Williams, who I saw many years ago

34:14.320 --> 34:17.960
 when I was in LA in the comedy clubs around here,

34:17.960 --> 34:21.880
 he was a straight up crazy, dysregulated genius

34:21.880 --> 34:23.460
 in tremendous pain.

34:25.080 --> 34:28.880
 And his desire to do it earnestly through acting

34:28.880 --> 34:32.480
 rather than constantly by just sniping

34:32.480 --> 34:37.480
 or being a clown or showing us how fast his mind worked

34:37.960 --> 34:42.280
 relative to ours, I was really moved by that.

34:42.280 --> 34:45.760
 I thought that he brought some authenticity

34:45.760 --> 34:48.400
 and took a huge risk for a comedian to be that real.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.440
 And again, like you said, it doesn't always have to be,

34:52.440 --> 34:56.360
 but in that case, the madness and the genius were neighbors.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.560
 That one couldn't have been any other way.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.400
 Yeah.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.240
 No, because his mind,

35:01.240 --> 35:04.080
 the thing about seeing him in a comedy club

35:04.080 --> 35:07.240
 was that he would react to random stimulus

35:07.240 --> 35:08.880
 in the environment.

35:08.880 --> 35:09.720
 You know, it could be a heckler.

35:09.720 --> 35:10.880
 Sometimes you almost got the feeling

35:10.880 --> 35:11.920
 that he wanted a heckler

35:11.920 --> 35:16.840
 because it gave him something to play against, right?

35:16.840 --> 35:20.700
 He was infinitely, instantly inventive.

35:20.700 --> 35:24.300
 But I actually, to me, the best Robin Williams

35:24.300 --> 35:27.960
 is as he got closer and closer to the end of his life

35:27.960 --> 35:30.240
 because there was a sadness

35:30.240 --> 35:33.520
 and he's almost fighting the sadness

35:33.520 --> 35:36.200
 with this improvisational,

35:36.200 --> 35:40.320
 like the weapons he has is this wit and humor

35:40.320 --> 35:42.800
 and this dancing that he does with language.

35:42.800 --> 35:46.120
 But, and then sometimes when you just fall silent,

35:46.120 --> 35:48.320
 you can see the sadness.

35:48.320 --> 35:51.560
 And I don't know, there's something so beautiful about that.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.200
 It's like this bird with a broken wing

35:53.200 --> 35:55.440
 that's like trying to fly, you know,

35:55.440 --> 35:56.940
 and it's getting older and older.

35:56.940 --> 35:59.960
 And I mean, those,

36:01.160 --> 36:03.240
 he would have made a one hell of a podcast guest,

36:03.240 --> 36:04.600
 I'll tell you that.

36:04.600 --> 36:05.840
 That's a sad.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.980
 Yeah, I have some sadness that I really do think

36:07.980 --> 36:11.000
 that part of what we call podcasting

36:11.000 --> 36:13.480
 is actually just getting to know a soul

36:13.480 --> 36:14.720
 over and over again.

36:14.720 --> 36:19.720
 Like maybe the idea is that this is talking about depression

36:20.760 --> 36:25.160
 and sadness and heavy feelings

36:25.160 --> 36:27.060
 is not an American specialty.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.360
 Seeing that in context with the beauty of life

36:31.360 --> 36:33.040
 is a Russian specialty.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.980
 Like it is very much.

36:34.980 --> 36:38.000
 Russian specialty, sounds like a diner menu.

36:38.000 --> 36:38.840
 What?

36:38.840 --> 36:39.680
 Yeah.

36:39.680 --> 36:40.520
 You want the Russian specialty?

36:40.520 --> 36:45.520
 A big scoop of ice cream with tons of depression.

36:46.640 --> 36:49.360
 I do think that we're in a really terrifying

36:49.360 --> 36:51.520
 and depressing time.

36:51.520 --> 36:54.560
 And I think that part of it is that we don't know

36:54.560 --> 36:57.320
 if something huge is about to get started.

36:57.320 --> 36:59.280
 And we don't even know what this is.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.920
 I mean, we just sit here in this weird world

37:01.920 --> 37:04.480
 that is falling into some new state

37:04.480 --> 37:06.360
 and we're not even super curious.

37:06.360 --> 37:08.720
 It's like, what the hell just happened?

37:08.720 --> 37:09.920
 Everybody's got an answer.

37:09.920 --> 37:13.400
 And I'm positive that all of those answers are wrong.

37:13.400 --> 37:17.440
 Let's try to at least sneak up on the good answer.

37:17.440 --> 37:20.160
 So the central core of the answer is

37:20.160 --> 37:24.180
 that the US seemed to be the greatest thing in the world

37:24.180 --> 37:26.540
 in large measure because we hadn't noticed

37:27.520 --> 37:30.720
 that we were getting a benefit from having no plan,

37:30.720 --> 37:33.320
 not having to make a plan for low growth.

37:33.320 --> 37:38.040
 As long as we had growth, we were in great shape.

37:38.040 --> 37:42.860
 Let's imagine that you could run an experiment,

37:42.860 --> 37:44.560
 you have a billion copies of Earth

37:44.560 --> 37:47.320
 and you start the initial conditions slightly different.

37:48.280 --> 37:50.800
 On some giant number of planets,

37:50.800 --> 37:54.640
 a lot of the things that were discovered

37:54.640 --> 37:58.840
 from the 1800s through the end of the 20th century

37:58.840 --> 38:01.500
 are discovered in a period of time

38:01.500 --> 38:03.940
 because a lot of that just has to do with

38:03.940 --> 38:06.860
 once you crack the puzzle of getting better instruments,

38:06.860 --> 38:08.100
 you can see more.

38:08.100 --> 38:09.160
 And the more you can see,

38:09.160 --> 38:11.100
 the more you can make use of what you can see.

38:11.100 --> 38:13.880
 And it turns out there was lots of stuff to do

38:13.880 --> 38:18.880
 with like germs or electron orbitals

38:19.520 --> 38:22.960
 or spectrum, electromagnetic spectrum.

38:22.960 --> 38:25.400
 And so we got to do all of those things

38:25.400 --> 38:27.360
 and the US roughly corresponded

38:27.360 --> 38:30.520
 for a good chunk of its history with this bonanza.

38:30.520 --> 38:34.200
 And so of course we look like an amazing genius country.

38:34.200 --> 38:35.820
 We have no plan.

38:35.820 --> 38:37.440
 Imagine that you could sell a car,

38:37.440 --> 38:38.720
 you don't have to put in seat belts,

38:38.720 --> 38:40.720
 you don't have to put in airbags,

38:40.720 --> 38:43.320
 you don't have to put in rear view mirrors or sensors

38:43.320 --> 38:44.600
 or a rear view mirror.

38:44.600 --> 38:46.680
 You could save a lot of money on a car

38:46.680 --> 38:48.960
 by not putting in all of the stuff

38:48.960 --> 38:50.560
 to keep things from going wrong.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.220
 And I think that's what we had.

38:53.220 --> 38:57.660
 We had a machine that as long as growth was insanely good,

38:57.660 --> 39:01.320
 we plowed it back, the riches and spoils and then treasure

39:01.320 --> 39:04.800
 back into the system and made more genius stuff.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.060
 And we carried along a good chunk of humanity,

39:07.060 --> 39:09.320
 hundreds of millions of people.

39:09.320 --> 39:11.460
 We did not have a plan for what happens

39:11.460 --> 39:15.260
 when the growth goes below the stall speed of our society.

39:16.140 --> 39:19.000
 How confident should we be that the growth has slowed

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
 in a way that is permanent rather than a kind of slap

39:24.960 --> 39:26.320
 in the face where we...

39:26.320 --> 39:27.760
 It's not the right concept.

39:27.760 --> 39:31.600
 Right concept is, I try to use the same words

39:31.600 --> 39:33.320
 over and over again in case people see mold

39:33.320 --> 39:35.800
 because then the perseveration actually gets somewhere.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.000
 So I use this analogy of the orchard

39:38.000 --> 39:40.840
 because everyone talks about low hanging fruit.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.480
 They know the concept of low hanging fruit,

39:43.480 --> 39:47.220
 but they don't think in terms of orchards.

39:47.220 --> 39:48.740
 So they say things like,

39:48.740 --> 39:50.720
 you think we've picked all the low hanging fruit,

39:50.720 --> 39:53.960
 but I believe in the inventiveness of the human mind.

39:53.960 --> 39:58.640
 It's like, okay, that doesn't even work as an analogy.

39:58.640 --> 40:00.080
 What if the idea is we only picked

40:00.080 --> 40:01.760
 all the low hanging fruit here,

40:01.760 --> 40:03.320
 and then we're having this stupid argument

40:03.320 --> 40:04.480
 about low hanging fruit,

40:04.480 --> 40:06.880
 and we're not going and looking for new orchards.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.080
 We're not planting new orchards.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.800
 We're not looking for forests.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.840
 We're just sitting here arguing about low hanging fruit.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.200
 So my claim is there's probably a lot more low hanging fruit

40:14.200 --> 40:15.680
 and it's not here.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.720
 It's in other orchards.

40:16.720 --> 40:17.560
 It's in other orchards.

40:17.560 --> 40:20.020
 One of those turned out to be the digital orchard.

40:20.020 --> 40:24.320
 The digital orchard has not been as stagnant

40:24.320 --> 40:28.400
 as lots of these other, like the chemical orchard.

40:29.880 --> 40:33.520
 I have faith that there is a small percentage

40:33.520 --> 40:36.400
 of the population, but not zero,

40:36.400 --> 40:38.240
 that's looking for those other orchards.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.400
 Like I'm excited about one of those orchards,

40:40.400 --> 40:43.800
 which is, I believe there'll be robots in everybody's homes

40:43.800 --> 40:48.040
 and that will unlock some totally new thing.

40:48.040 --> 40:51.760
 Totally new set of technologies, ideas,

40:51.760 --> 40:54.520
 the way we live life, the productivity,

40:54.520 --> 40:57.560
 all the everything, it'll change everything.

40:57.560 --> 40:59.140
 So I'm excited about that orchard.

40:59.140 --> 41:01.240
 So I'm roaming that orchard

41:01.240 --> 41:05.520
 and wondering how the hell you kind of bring back

41:05.520 --> 41:08.520
 like the ant that finds a new source of food.

41:08.520 --> 41:11.520
 I'm trying to find an apple I can bring back to the.

41:11.520 --> 41:16.080
 Great, so you're in an explorer idiom.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.240
 And do you have faith that there's enough of those?

41:18.240 --> 41:20.080
 I don't think there are very many of us.

41:20.080 --> 41:22.040
 I mean, I'm one of them too.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.180
 How many does it take?

41:23.180 --> 41:24.080
 It takes one ant.

41:25.560 --> 41:26.400
 It takes one ant.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.680
 What are you talking about?

41:28.680 --> 41:31.720
 How many elons does it take to screw in a light bulb?

41:31.720 --> 41:35.200
 Okay, let's imagine that we went,

41:35.200 --> 41:39.400
 imagine some ant goes and finds a new source of food, right?

41:39.400 --> 41:42.320
 And then it comes back to the colony and it says,

41:42.320 --> 41:44.680
 hey, I think I found a new source of food.

41:44.680 --> 41:46.840
 And the initial reaction is,

41:46.840 --> 41:49.740
 you're not authorized to find new food.

41:49.740 --> 41:51.200
 What?

41:51.200 --> 41:52.680
 Why would you try to go find new food?

41:52.680 --> 41:54.160
 We're gonna remove you from Twitter.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.520
 Yeah, and by the way,

41:55.520 --> 41:56.960
 I think the fact that you think you're allowed

41:56.960 --> 41:59.400
 to go find new food shows how privileged you are as an ant.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.900
 Get out of the colony, kill him, kill him.

42:01.900 --> 42:04.720
 Well, that's probably not a great model

42:04.720 --> 42:06.400
 for finding new orchards.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.980
 And I think that what we find is that

42:08.980 --> 42:11.880
 where there's a system that allows somebody to ascend

42:11.880 --> 42:15.560
 without a lot of gatekeeping, you can have that.

42:15.560 --> 42:17.560
 But I saw this happen in hedge funds.

42:17.560 --> 42:22.560
 Hedge funds for a while hoovered up a lot of talent

42:22.840 --> 42:27.160
 because they were places that had funding and had freedom.

42:27.160 --> 42:32.000
 And in general, really smart people want to be free

42:32.000 --> 42:33.840
 and they don't wanna think a lot about

42:34.800 --> 42:37.280
 how they're gonna feed themselves.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.920
 They wanna get lost in their minds.

42:39.920 --> 42:42.800
 So you can either give them productive places to play,

42:42.800 --> 42:44.400
 dangerous places to play.

42:45.560 --> 42:47.360
 They're either gonna break into computers

42:47.360 --> 42:52.360
 or find vaccines for you or build bombs or build companies.

42:53.120 --> 42:58.120
 And we're not providing for the people who have to disrupt

42:58.320 --> 43:01.480
 and have to innovate and trying to channel that effort.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.980
 We're so focused on this other thing,

43:03.980 --> 43:06.120
 which is fairness and safety.

43:06.120 --> 43:08.280
 And fairness and safety, by the way, are really important.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.160
 I don't wanna denigrate them.

43:10.160 --> 43:12.880
 But the singular focus on fairness and safety

43:12.880 --> 43:17.680
 without, in the same breath, being focused on growth

43:17.680 --> 43:21.320
 and discovery and creation is gonna doom us

43:21.320 --> 43:23.600
 because what we're talking about is we're always talking

43:23.600 --> 43:25.580
 about divvying up the pie that is

43:25.580 --> 43:28.440
 as opposed to the pie that will be.

43:28.440 --> 43:30.760
 Imagine that you spent all your time trying to divvy up

43:30.760 --> 43:34.900
 the 13th century pie and you destroyed your ability

43:34.900 --> 43:36.340
 to get to the 20th century.

43:36.340 --> 43:38.100
 You'd be an idiot.

43:38.100 --> 43:42.000
 But one place I think I disagree with you

43:42.000 --> 43:45.020
 is I don't think you need that many people

43:45.020 --> 43:47.320
 to empower the geniuses, the innovators,

43:47.320 --> 43:50.800
 the people who refuse to spend most of their days

43:50.800 --> 43:52.200
 in meetings about fairness.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.760
 This is good.

43:53.760 --> 43:54.800
 Let's have a disagreement.

43:54.800 --> 43:57.960
 I think podcasting, whatever you call that medium,

43:57.960 --> 44:01.400
 is just one little example of a tool

44:01.400 --> 44:03.500
 that you can give power to,

44:03.500 --> 44:08.500
 like you and your podcast can have the next Elon Musk

44:09.060 --> 44:09.900
 and make him a star.

44:09.900 --> 44:11.140
 Now I see where you're going.

44:11.140 --> 44:11.980
 Okay.

44:11.980 --> 44:14.060
 There have been a series of places

44:14.060 --> 44:17.280
 for people to play and be free.

44:17.280 --> 44:19.900
 And we've lost them successively.

44:19.900 --> 44:21.440
 What's a good place you remember?

44:21.440 --> 44:23.200
 Because I disagree with you there too.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.540
 I think they're still there.

44:24.540 --> 44:25.620
 You can still play.

44:25.620 --> 44:28.180
 You interviewed Noam Chomsky.

44:28.180 --> 44:29.160
 Yes.

44:29.160 --> 44:30.000
 Okay.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.140
 Noam Chomsky comes from an era.

44:32.140 --> 44:33.120
 Where you can play?

44:33.120 --> 44:34.180
 Where you could play?

44:34.180 --> 44:35.020
 At MIT.

44:35.020 --> 44:36.180
 At MIT.

44:36.180 --> 44:37.000
 And you can't play.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.300
 This is where I disagree with you.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.420
 We've already had this.

44:39.420 --> 44:40.260
 But.

44:40.260 --> 44:43.700
 Go check the Clips channel for the Lex Friedman podcast.

44:43.700 --> 44:46.700
 I think I wasn't brave enough at that time

44:46.700 --> 44:48.780
 and I'm not really brave enough now.

44:48.780 --> 44:49.620
 Come on.

44:49.620 --> 44:50.440
 Because I don't.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.980
 Where's the vodka?

44:51.980 --> 44:54.620
 It's a feeling and people are gonna tear me apart.

44:54.620 --> 44:55.460
 Oh, what are you?

44:55.460 --> 44:58.220
 And you speak from emotion and facts.

44:58.220 --> 44:59.380
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

44:59.380 --> 45:00.220
 The feeling.

45:00.220 --> 45:01.040
 What podcast is this?

45:01.040 --> 45:01.880
 It's yours.

45:01.880 --> 45:02.720
 Yes.

45:02.720 --> 45:05.860
 Tell the people who are currently editing your brain,

45:05.860 --> 45:07.180
 because I saw that move right now.

45:07.180 --> 45:08.220
 Yeah.

45:08.220 --> 45:10.780
 That they should go find another podcast.

45:10.780 --> 45:11.620
 Right?

45:11.620 --> 45:13.740
 Let's get rid of some of your audience right now.

45:14.900 --> 45:16.460
 Please go find another podcast

45:16.460 --> 45:17.620
 if you're editing my brain.

45:17.620 --> 45:19.580
 Nevertheless, all the self doubt,

45:19.580 --> 45:20.860
 they're sitting in that brain.

45:20.860 --> 45:21.700
 So.

45:21.700 --> 45:22.520
 I can't stand to watch this.

45:22.520 --> 45:23.360
 But all right.

45:23.360 --> 45:25.600
 What is this self doubt loop that you're in?

45:25.600 --> 45:26.440
 The thing is,

45:27.620 --> 45:30.760
 when I walk the halls of MIT.

45:30.760 --> 45:32.000
 Yeah.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.460
 There's bureaucracy, there's administrators

45:34.460 --> 45:36.000
 that never have done anything interesting

45:36.000 --> 45:37.460
 in their entire lives.

45:37.460 --> 45:39.220
 There's meetings, there's.

45:39.220 --> 45:40.060
 All the usual crap.

45:40.060 --> 45:41.200
 All the usual crap.

45:41.200 --> 45:45.420
 But there's, in the eyes of individuals.

45:45.420 --> 45:46.260
 Yeah.

45:46.260 --> 45:48.460
 There's this glow of excitement

45:48.460 --> 45:49.700
 that has nothing to do with career.

45:49.700 --> 45:51.140
 I understand this.

45:51.140 --> 45:52.860
 And it's still a playground.

45:52.860 --> 45:55.700
 There's little pockets of playgrounds

45:55.700 --> 45:58.080
 from which genius can emerge still.

45:58.080 --> 46:01.340
 And they're unaffected by diversity meetings

46:01.340 --> 46:04.540
 or fairness meetings or blah, blah, blah.

46:04.540 --> 46:05.500
 I love to hear that.

46:05.500 --> 46:06.340
 Yeah?

46:06.340 --> 46:07.160
 Well, you don't think so?

46:07.160 --> 46:08.800
 I don't believe it.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.220
 Cause I've watched the change, Lex.

46:10.220 --> 46:11.320
 I've watched people.

46:11.320 --> 46:13.580
 We were all editing ourselves all the time.

46:13.580 --> 46:14.920
 I remember my old mind.

46:14.920 --> 46:16.140
 I liked it better.

46:17.300 --> 46:21.020
 All of this relentless focus on critical race theory

46:21.020 --> 46:25.060
 and critical theory, postmodernism, fairness,

46:25.060 --> 46:26.160
 social justice.

46:26.160 --> 46:29.720
 It's making many of us into worse people.

46:29.720 --> 46:30.920
 You think that's that?

46:30.920 --> 46:34.120
 Do you think the Matt Damon's of the character

46:34.120 --> 46:35.740
 is paying attention to any of that?

46:35.740 --> 46:36.580
 You think that has an effect?

46:36.580 --> 46:39.300
 Have you seen what happened to Matt Damon himself?

46:39.300 --> 46:41.980
 Matt Damon has tried to say various things at various times

46:41.980 --> 46:44.100
 that seemed to be relatively innocuous.

46:44.100 --> 46:45.500
 He can't speak.

46:45.500 --> 46:46.340
 Okay.

46:46.340 --> 46:48.400
 Well, let's not mix up.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.740
 Matt Damon is just an actor.

46:49.740 --> 46:50.920
 Well, I don't know.

46:50.920 --> 46:52.540
 He was just a Harvard student

46:52.540 --> 46:55.300
 who came up with his own genius screenplay,

46:55.300 --> 46:56.940
 acted and made it happen.

46:56.940 --> 46:57.780
 No.

46:57.780 --> 46:59.280
 No, we're somewhere else.

46:59.280 --> 47:01.780
 You don't think you can build a rocket company

47:01.780 --> 47:03.380
 out of MIT still?

47:03.380 --> 47:06.460
 I think that there are things that you can still do.

47:06.460 --> 47:07.360
 But we're losing them.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.780
 We lose them.

47:08.780 --> 47:10.740
 We keep losing them.

47:10.740 --> 47:12.380
 I would say the biggest problem,

47:13.300 --> 47:14.220
 here, let me just say,

47:14.220 --> 47:16.060
 what I think the solution would be

47:16.060 --> 47:21.060
 is to fire anybody who's not faculty,

47:22.460 --> 47:25.100
 especially young faculty should have way more power

47:25.100 --> 47:27.780
 and administration should have much less power.

47:27.780 --> 47:30.200
 Because right now, the administration,

47:31.120 --> 47:33.920
 which used some of the, who used to be faculty,

47:33.920 --> 47:37.060
 but they've lost the fire, the spark that gave them,

47:37.060 --> 47:39.860
 they've lost the memories of the playground.

47:39.860 --> 47:43.340
 And so the people that admire and love the playground,

47:43.340 --> 47:44.780
 like you could see it in their behavior,

47:44.780 --> 47:46.780
 should have way more power.

47:46.780 --> 47:49.880
 And so we should create a systems that give them power.

47:49.880 --> 47:50.720
 I think I'll take it.

47:50.720 --> 47:51.700
 You're very idealistic.

47:51.700 --> 47:52.540
 Yeah.

47:52.540 --> 47:54.500
 And you're very, you've got a huge heart.

47:55.580 --> 47:56.600
 It's a weird time.

47:56.600 --> 47:58.600
 Cause I don't want to dissuade you

47:58.600 --> 48:01.000
 from believing beautiful things.

48:02.160 --> 48:04.220
 Because I see how potent you are.

48:04.220 --> 48:05.740
 You do all these things,

48:05.740 --> 48:09.540
 Jiu Jitsu, guitar, podcasting, programming, computers,

48:11.480 --> 48:12.520
 et cetera, et cetera.

48:13.840 --> 48:14.840
 I don't think you're right.

48:14.840 --> 48:17.460
 I think we're in a really deeply screwed up place

48:17.460 --> 48:19.860
 where even the tiny number of,

48:19.860 --> 48:23.560
 let me give you an alternate version of this dystopia.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.580
 I do think that there are people who are capable

48:25.580 --> 48:27.100
 and there's still places to play

48:27.100 --> 48:30.620
 and cause things to happen that progress the story forward.

48:30.620 --> 48:33.700
 But if you look at the fire that some of the people are in

48:33.700 --> 48:35.780
 who fit that profile,

48:35.780 --> 48:38.480
 like how much crap has Elon Musk taken?

48:39.780 --> 48:42.880
 Quite considerable, right?

48:42.880 --> 48:46.340
 And not much admiration from the...

48:46.340 --> 48:50.280
 Craig Venter, Jim Watson.

48:51.560 --> 48:53.720
 These are very difficult people.

48:53.720 --> 48:57.240
 Steve Jobs is a very difficult guy, you know?

48:58.800 --> 49:01.440
 Yeah, it is a bit heartbreaking to me.

49:01.440 --> 49:03.640
 I mean, everybody is different generations.

49:03.640 --> 49:05.880
 I just, my mind is a little focused on Elon Musk

49:05.880 --> 49:08.360
 because he's the modern person.

49:08.360 --> 49:09.380
 Well, you know him.

49:09.380 --> 49:10.880
 I mean, he's a person to you.

49:11.880 --> 49:16.400
 It hurts my heart to see how few faculty

49:16.400 --> 49:21.400
 and people with Nobel prizes and so on admire Elon.

49:21.400 --> 49:26.400
 He gets a lot of fans from people that buy his products

49:28.720 --> 49:31.640
 and young minds just excited.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.560
 But why don't we as an institution,

49:33.560 --> 49:38.560
 why doesn't MIT say that somebody amongst us

49:39.980 --> 49:43.520
 will be the next Elon Musk and we want to encourage them?

49:43.520 --> 49:46.640
 Like say that, say that in meetings, say that.

49:46.640 --> 49:51.120
 Like that's success for us as MIT.

49:51.120 --> 49:54.080
 And they, instead there's this jealousy.

49:54.080 --> 49:56.920
 It's like, did you hear what Elon Musk tweeted?

49:56.920 --> 50:00.440
 Did you see, like how irresponsible is what he's doing?

50:00.440 --> 50:04.000
 How, like you're just saying all these things

50:04.000 --> 50:09.000
 that are just dripping with jealousy and basically...

50:09.200 --> 50:10.260
 I want what he's got.

50:10.260 --> 50:11.600
 That's the thing, right?

50:13.680 --> 50:14.760
 Here's the weird thing.

50:14.760 --> 50:17.220
 Rivalry has a different signature.

50:17.220 --> 50:21.680
 You see, when you know that you're never going to make it,

50:22.820 --> 50:25.080
 that's the position you take.

50:26.060 --> 50:29.900
 What is it in Kung Fu Panda, which you've watched now?

50:29.900 --> 50:31.040
 Yes. Yes.

50:31.040 --> 50:35.340
 What does Tai Lung say when he's looking

50:35.340 --> 50:37.740
 for the dragon warrior and the furious five

50:37.740 --> 50:39.680
 come to defeat him on the bridge?

50:40.980 --> 50:44.740
 One of them gives up Poe's name accidentally

50:44.740 --> 50:46.140
 and Tai Lung hears it.

50:46.140 --> 50:48.460
 Poe, so that is his name.

50:48.460 --> 50:50.460
 Finally, a worthy opponent.

50:50.460 --> 50:53.260
 Our battle will be legendary, right?

50:53.260 --> 50:54.740
 He's excited.

50:54.740 --> 50:56.320
 Why is that?

50:56.320 --> 50:58.040
 Well, you learn about this in boxing.

50:58.040 --> 51:01.500
 Sometimes you'll see a division or an MMA,

51:01.500 --> 51:03.960
 which is lousy with talent.

51:03.960 --> 51:05.340
 Just, you can't swing a cat

51:05.340 --> 51:07.700
 without hitting an amazing athlete.

51:09.120 --> 51:10.280
 Sometimes you'll have a division,

51:10.280 --> 51:12.760
 which at that particular moment has one star

51:12.760 --> 51:16.560
 and no real competition in that weight class or something.

51:16.560 --> 51:18.560
 That person is in bad shape

51:18.560 --> 51:23.480
 because you can't build a legend without the other.

51:24.780 --> 51:26.460
 When you think of Muhammad Ali,

51:26.460 --> 51:28.980
 what are the names that you immediately think of?

51:28.980 --> 51:31.380
 And you have to phrase your,

51:31.380 --> 51:33.200
 you have to think of the other heavyweights.

51:33.200 --> 51:34.480
 Liston.

51:34.480 --> 51:35.840
 Right.

51:35.840 --> 51:40.840
 So those opponents are in part what made Muhammad Ali

51:40.840 --> 51:42.320
 Muhammad Ali.

51:42.320 --> 51:47.320
 And that's why the Mayweather McGregor revelation that,

51:49.880 --> 51:53.400
 okay, this guy has got his opponent's picture in his house.

51:53.400 --> 51:54.600
 How weird is that?

51:55.560 --> 51:56.960
 Well, because without the opponent,

51:56.960 --> 51:58.280
 you may not be able to get there.

51:58.280 --> 52:03.280
 Now, I am not a huge fan of the wrong kinds of rivalries.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.920
 Do you have examples in mind?

52:06.920 --> 52:08.120
 Well, there are rivalries

52:08.120 --> 52:10.200
 where people take each other's credit cards

52:10.200 --> 52:12.880
 and take each other's credit and screw each other over.

52:12.880 --> 52:17.480
 And then there are other rivalries like the RNA Thai Club

52:17.480 --> 52:20.780
 where these guys were so in love with what they were doing

52:20.780 --> 52:22.460
 that they couldn't wait to share everything.

52:22.460 --> 52:25.840
 And like Nobel prizes were so abundant

52:25.840 --> 52:28.000
 that most people got Nobel prizes

52:28.000 --> 52:30.080
 just for being a member of the RNA Thai Club

52:30.080 --> 52:31.040
 and doing cool stuff.

52:31.040 --> 52:36.040
 And yeah, that's the golden kind of sweet spot.

52:36.040 --> 52:38.960
 Most of these people can't do what Elon's doing

52:38.960 --> 52:40.280
 because they can't break rules,

52:40.280 --> 52:41.800
 they can't take the pressure.

52:41.800 --> 52:43.160
 I'll tell you what really concerns me

52:43.160 --> 52:44.360
 about your perspective.

52:45.400 --> 52:48.120
 I think that there are a lot of genius ideas

52:48.120 --> 52:50.840
 inside of people who don't have the stomach

52:50.840 --> 52:53.520
 for conflict and derision.

52:53.520 --> 52:55.560
 And I think a lot of those people are female.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.960
 And I think that until we come up with a world

52:59.960 --> 53:02.680
 in which we can swat down the trolls,

53:02.680 --> 53:07.680
 or we can actually cause the trolls not to ruin everything.

53:07.680 --> 53:09.920
 And I don't necessarily mean by shutting them up,

53:09.920 --> 53:13.040
 I don't necessarily mean by being brutal to them,

53:13.040 --> 53:15.920
 but somehow separating off people who are working

53:15.920 --> 53:17.320
 and people who are trolling.

53:18.360 --> 53:21.360
 I think that we're losing a huge amount of human genius

53:21.360 --> 53:26.360
 in part because women in particular

53:26.360 --> 53:29.600
 are not necessarily going to push an idea

53:29.600 --> 53:32.840
 if it results in 10 years of being derided.

53:34.200 --> 53:37.360
 Very few men are willing to do that either.

53:37.360 --> 53:39.720
 But there are some of us who are so dumb

53:39.720 --> 53:43.000
 that we will pigheadedly stick to an idea for 10 years

53:43.000 --> 53:44.960
 even if the world collapses.

53:44.960 --> 53:47.080
 I don't think that there are as many women

53:47.080 --> 53:49.240
 who are going to make that calculation

53:49.240 --> 53:51.160
 even if they know the idea is correct.

53:51.160 --> 53:53.640
 And one of the things that I believe technology

53:53.640 --> 53:55.280
 can help us fight the trolls,

53:55.280 --> 53:57.360
 of all definitions of troll,

53:57.360 --> 54:00.360
 like I believe that a better Twitter can be built.

54:00.360 --> 54:02.840
 Interesting, I do not.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.560
 I don't believe that a Twitter successor can be built

54:05.560 --> 54:07.720
 that solves most of the problems.

54:07.720 --> 54:10.280
 I think you can always improve what we have,

54:10.280 --> 54:12.360
 but I don't think that converges in something

54:12.360 --> 54:14.360
 that really works because I think ultimately

54:14.360 --> 54:16.600
 the problem isn't Twitter, the problem is us.

54:17.760 --> 54:19.040
 For example, I've recently made

54:19.040 --> 54:21.760
 a very disturbing realization,

54:23.280 --> 54:26.360
 which is academics and social scientists

54:26.360 --> 54:30.280
 and academics and trolls have very many similar behaviors.

54:30.280 --> 54:31.720
 Absolutely.

54:31.720 --> 54:34.160
 It's largely a trolling community.

54:34.160 --> 54:38.520
 I tend to believe that the trolls are not,

54:38.520 --> 54:42.160
 it's like the Peter Thiel mini mind idea,

54:42.160 --> 54:45.080
 which in all of the trolls,

54:45.080 --> 54:47.800
 there's the possibility of goodness.

54:47.800 --> 54:50.240
 And all you have to do, not all you have to do,

54:50.240 --> 54:52.520
 what you have to do is create technology

54:52.520 --> 54:57.520
 that incentivizes them to embrace,

54:58.160 --> 55:00.160
 to discover, to embrace,

55:00.160 --> 55:04.240
 to practice the better angels of their nature.

55:04.240 --> 55:09.240
 And I believe that people actually want to do that.

55:10.120 --> 55:15.000
 The trolls is a short term dopamine rush

55:15.000 --> 55:20.000
 of childish toxicity that all of us want to overcome.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.280
 I believe that like deep within, we want to overcome that.

55:23.280 --> 55:27.400
 I try to keep myself from believing what you believe.

55:29.120 --> 55:30.960
 Because you'd be disappointed if it's not true.

55:30.960 --> 55:31.800
 Because it's dangerous,

55:31.800 --> 55:34.480
 because a lot of these people are implacable foes

55:34.480 --> 55:35.880
 and there aren't many of them,

55:35.880 --> 55:37.880
 but when you meet somebody who's like,

55:37.880 --> 55:39.800
 yeah, I just like screwing people up.

55:39.800 --> 55:40.880
 I'm here for the pain.

55:42.040 --> 55:44.520
 I just believe even in them, there's a good.

55:44.520 --> 55:47.480
 There's a wonderful book that I'm gonna recommend to you

55:47.480 --> 55:49.040
 where I hope this comes from.

55:49.040 --> 55:50.520
 Maybe I've got the source wrong,

55:50.520 --> 55:52.320
 but in any event, it's a great book

55:52.320 --> 55:55.440
 called Maximum City about Bombay.

55:56.400 --> 56:00.360
 And I believe the conceit is that the author

56:01.560 --> 56:04.120
 leaves Bombay as a kid and comes back as an adult

56:04.120 --> 56:06.520
 and he realizes he has to rediscover the city

56:06.520 --> 56:09.280
 because he can't live in the city he left.

56:09.280 --> 56:12.680
 So he gets in contact with all of the weird areas

56:12.680 --> 56:15.360
 of the city and one of them is the underworld.

56:15.360 --> 56:16.400
 He hangs out with the police,

56:16.400 --> 56:19.840
 but in the underworld, he's talking to contract killers.

56:19.840 --> 56:22.480
 And he says, you know, it's really weird.

56:22.480 --> 56:26.360
 Everybody pleads for their life right before I kill them.

56:26.360 --> 56:28.320
 And they always say this thing about,

56:28.320 --> 56:31.440
 I've got two kids at home.

56:32.560 --> 56:34.560
 He says, never say that to a contract killer

56:34.560 --> 56:37.640
 because we have terrible relationships with our parents.

56:37.640 --> 56:40.120
 Doesn't it dare us to do that?

56:40.120 --> 56:41.520
 And I was just thinking like, oh, wow.

56:41.520 --> 56:44.000
 So there's a minus sign in front of that statement.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.320
 You're sitting there saying, you know,

56:45.320 --> 56:46.960
 I've got a three year old, it's like,

56:46.960 --> 56:51.360
 okay, well, I'm gonna take this POS out of that kid's life.

56:51.360 --> 56:53.080
 Maybe I'll have a chance.

56:53.080 --> 56:54.880
 You don't know how people are wired.

56:56.080 --> 56:58.560
 And as much as I hate to say it,

56:58.560 --> 57:01.360
 there are people whose wiring is so disturbing

57:01.360 --> 57:03.320
 and so different from yours

57:03.320 --> 57:07.240
 that you will never guess why you can't reach them

57:07.240 --> 57:09.040
 or how much pleasure they may have gotten

57:09.040 --> 57:11.840
 because they may have gone over a point of no return.

57:11.840 --> 57:15.760
 Nevertheless, you are just a smart guy

57:15.760 --> 57:19.000
 who is using his intuition to make a hypothesis.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.480
 You do not know this for sure.

57:20.480 --> 57:21.560
 Nope.

57:21.560 --> 57:26.120
 And I am, you know, whatever the hell I am

57:27.480 --> 57:29.680
 that has a different hypothesis

57:29.680 --> 57:32.800
 that even in the darkest human beings

57:32.800 --> 57:36.920
 that seem to be only full of evil,

57:36.920 --> 57:39.560
 there's a good person there that could be discovered.

57:39.560 --> 57:42.720
 And that's one of the reasons I love doing your show

57:42.720 --> 57:45.760
 is that you have these beliefs, even as a Russian.

57:48.160 --> 57:49.400
 The Russian special.

57:49.400 --> 57:52.560
 As you know, the Russian, there is a weirdness

57:52.560 --> 57:55.720
 which is a total cynicism and total idealism

57:55.720 --> 57:56.880
 locked together, right?

57:56.880 --> 57:59.280
 That's very much a part of the Russian character.

58:00.680 --> 58:02.400
 The reason I kept bothering you,

58:02.400 --> 58:04.080
 kept bothering you to have this conversation

58:04.080 --> 58:09.080
 is I'm really worried about the next couple of months.

58:09.080 --> 58:10.560
 No kidding.

58:10.560 --> 58:13.760
 And if there's anybody in this world

58:13.760 --> 58:18.240
 that could help alleviate my worry

58:18.240 --> 58:22.000
 by at least walking along with me

58:22.000 --> 58:25.960
 through this worry of mine, it's you.

58:25.960 --> 58:29.120
 Do you think we're headed towards some kind of civil war?

58:30.160 --> 58:32.400
 Some kind of division that explodes

58:32.400 --> 58:34.880
 beyond just stuff on Twitter,

58:34.880 --> 58:39.040
 but something that's really destructive

58:39.040 --> 58:41.920
 to the fabric of our society?

58:41.920 --> 58:45.320
 Well, I believe we're in a revolution, as you know.

58:45.320 --> 58:46.920
 I've called it the no name revolution

58:46.920 --> 58:48.280
 or N squared revolution.

58:48.280 --> 58:50.160
 I've been talking about it for years.

58:51.320 --> 58:54.680
 I don't think, I think waiting for this

58:54.680 --> 58:57.160
 to be called a civil war is not smart.

58:58.160 --> 59:00.000
 Only history will call it such.

59:00.000 --> 59:00.840
 Fine.

59:00.840 --> 59:01.920
 But I think that the problem is

59:01.920 --> 59:03.200
 is that you're encountering things

59:03.200 --> 59:05.000
 that you've never seen trying to fit them

59:05.000 --> 59:06.880
 into things that you already know.

59:06.880 --> 59:07.720
 Right.

59:07.720 --> 59:08.560
 And.

59:08.560 --> 59:10.600
 But history repeats itself.

59:10.600 --> 59:12.000
 Yes, ish.

59:13.880 --> 59:15.640
 You don't see lessons from history in.

59:15.640 --> 59:16.480
 I do.

59:16.480 --> 59:17.320
 We see today.

59:17.320 --> 59:18.880
 But I don't see it repeating itself.

59:18.880 --> 59:22.000
 You know, the famous quote is that it rhymes.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.240
 It rhymes.

59:23.240 --> 59:27.440
 I mean, the thing I guess I'm speaking to is violence.

59:27.440 --> 59:28.280
 And.

59:28.280 --> 59:29.640
 We're in there.

59:29.640 --> 59:31.760
 The abstraction of violence.

59:31.760 --> 59:36.480
 Imagine you were coding up violence as an abstract class.

59:36.480 --> 59:37.320
 Okay.

59:38.120 --> 59:40.520
 Thank you for speaking to the audience.

59:40.520 --> 59:42.080
 Trying to lose these people.

59:42.080 --> 59:42.920
 Come with me.

59:44.800 --> 59:45.640
 Go on.

59:45.640 --> 59:46.480
 No, no, no.

59:46.480 --> 59:48.560
 Look, I've dealt with your audience

59:48.560 --> 59:51.640
 and your audience contains the smartest people around.

59:51.640 --> 59:54.120
 I guarantee you if I say some stuff,

59:54.120 --> 59:55.680
 first of all, any wrong thing that I'll say,

59:55.680 --> 59:56.560
 they're gonna detail.

59:56.560 --> 59:58.200
 So that'll be a little bit of catnip

59:58.200 --> 1:00:00.280
 to bring in the smart people.

1:00:00.280 --> 1:00:02.080
 But they'll also digest it for each other.

1:00:02.080 --> 1:00:04.440
 It's one of the great lessons of long form podcasting.

1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:07.560
 If you don't waste all your time explaining things,

1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:11.200
 that's the job of the audience to do amongst themselves.

1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:12.640
 They're happy doing the work.

1:00:12.640 --> 1:00:14.360
 And those who aren't, they leave.

1:00:14.360 --> 1:00:15.200
 Isn't that great?

1:00:15.200 --> 1:00:16.040
 They'll leave.

1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:18.440
 The people who don't wanna struggle will leave.

1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:20.160
 You can get rid of them.

1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:23.840
 I think that the point is you would want to say

1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:28.040
 violence is defined relative to a context.

1:00:28.040 --> 1:00:30.400
 So let's call it meta violence so that we don't get

1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:32.200
 into the problem.

1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:34.600
 We already have a term for physical violence, right?

1:00:34.600 --> 1:00:37.440
 So we have meta violence and physical violence.

1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:38.720
 I would say that physical violence

1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:40.600
 is subclassed from meta violence.

1:00:40.600 --> 1:00:43.200
 Meta violence is the disruption of a system.

1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:48.200
 It's sort of, for example, if a cell dies,

1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:52.280
 you can die through apoptosis or necrosis.

1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:55.400
 Apoptosis is controlled programmed cell death.

1:00:55.400 --> 1:00:59.960
 Necrosis is just like, okay, this didn't work.

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:02.200
 That was a violent disruption of the system.

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:05.760
 And this meta class is presumed in the documentation.

1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:07.600
 Is it all negative?

1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:10.120
 No, what are you talking about?

1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:12.200
 So this is part of the problem

1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:14.320
 in the madness of our age, right?

1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:19.320
 Which is if you open up a drawer in your cabinet,

1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:23.200
 right, in your kitchen,

1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:25.960
 and you see knives, spoons, and forks,

1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:28.600
 do you have a sense that the spoons are good utensils

1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:30.560
 and the knives or forks are bad utensils

1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:32.080
 because they're mean?

1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:34.800
 I mean, like if you start thinking in these terms,

1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.160
 that knife is there to do violence.

1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:43.040
 That's violence you want done, right?

1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:45.640
 When I cut a mango, I'm doing violence to the mango.

1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:48.760
 The mango expects that I will do violence to it

1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:51.400
 because otherwise I won't be able to get the meat

1:01:51.400 --> 1:01:56.400
 and it won't get its seed spread somewhere else.

1:01:56.560 --> 1:02:01.200
 So in part, violence is absolutely part of our story.

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:04.240
 So, okay, so there's this meta violence class.

1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:05.080
 Yeah.

1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:05.920
 And what's...

1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:08.560
 So the meta violence class is already,

1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:10.000
 it's a multiple inheritance pattern.

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.440
 Whatever's going on right now inherits from meta violence.

1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:16.000
 No, but there's certain subclasses

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:21.000
 that allow evil to emerge.

1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.880
 So what I'm specifically worried about is that...

1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:26.080
 What's on your mind, Lex?

1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:27.080
 What's really going on?

1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:27.920
 Okay.

1:02:29.160 --> 1:02:34.160
 I worry that amidst the chaos of these protests

1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:41.800
 or the chaos that could be created by the feeling

1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:47.120
 that the election does not represent the voice

1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:50.120
 of the people, like saying that whoever gets,

1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:51.880
 quote unquote, wins the election

1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:55.440
 according to some kind of reporting of the numbers

1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:58.960
 that come out, that's not going to represent

1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:02.840
 what people actually want to be the leader.

1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:05.160
 Like something in that narrative will create

1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:09.040
 so much division that people will resort

1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:12.520
 to literal violence, like protests that really...

1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:17.680
 That the United States loses its united aspect.

1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:21.800
 And because of that, because of that chaos and tension,

1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:26.800
 evil people, evil forces that my definition of evil

1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:32.040
 is just cruel human beings use that moment to attain power.

1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:37.920
 The kind of power that is ultimately goes against the ideal

1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:39.200
 of the United States.

1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:40.760
 That could be Donald Trump.

1:03:40.760 --> 1:03:42.520
 That could be another human being.

1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:43.880
 It doesn't really matter.

1:03:43.880 --> 1:03:47.760
 My worry is that love doesn't win out in this.

1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:49.960
 The unity doesn't win out in this.

1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:54.960
 And I feel like you and I have responsibility.

1:03:57.120 --> 1:03:58.880
 No kidding. Yeah, I know.

1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:03.760
 And so how do we let love win in this moment

1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:07.480
 of potential chaos? We're gonna have to fight for it.

1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:09.840
 You're gonna have to become a fighter.

1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:12.320
 You're gonna have to throw some serious punches

1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:13.760
 if that's what you want.

1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:15.240
 You have to be Muhammad Ali here

1:04:15.240 --> 1:04:19.480
 because the moment you start criticizing anything,

1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:23.240
 people, you have to be a masterful communicator because...

1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:24.480
 That's why you're here.

1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:31.120
 Look, Lex, in part, your decency is allowing you

1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:35.120
 to do things that you couldn't otherwise do.

1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:38.400
 I saw that you had Michael Malice on your podcast.

1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:39.520
 Yeah.

1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:43.240
 Now, Michael Malice is, I think of somebody

1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:47.280
 who at his best is extremely shrewd and insightful, yes?

1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:51.240
 He's also got this trolling game,

1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:53.560
 which he's quite open about and you talk to him about it,

1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:54.680
 which I can't stand.

1:04:55.760 --> 1:04:58.120
 And this is the idea, oh, grandpa doesn't get the internet.

1:04:58.120 --> 1:05:00.000
 Well, I'm grandpa, I don't get the internet.

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:01.880
 I don't love the trolling.

1:05:01.880 --> 1:05:06.880
 There are trolls of the past who were incredibly good.

1:05:07.640 --> 1:05:09.920
 I don't see any of the modern trolls

1:05:09.920 --> 1:05:12.920
 as being that kind of genius level trolling the people

1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:16.480
 who deserve it in the way that they deserve it.

1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:18.400
 Right now, what I see is that anything

1:05:18.400 --> 1:05:20.200
 that stands up gets cut down.

1:05:20.200 --> 1:05:21.040
 Yeah.

1:05:21.040 --> 1:05:22.160
 It's like anything earnest,

1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:25.960
 you have to turn it into cynicism and a meme.

1:05:25.960 --> 1:05:28.440
 It's this idea that the people who believe

1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:30.800
 that the world is chaos and has no point

1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:33.320
 are constantly trying to let you know,

1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:35.720
 don't try to use the internet for meaning,

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:39.120
 for decency, for goodness, because we are going to find out

1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:41.840
 that that's all sanctimonious hypocrisy.

1:05:41.840 --> 1:05:44.440
 And we will make you suffer.

1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:46.640
 So I do think that there's a lot

1:05:46.640 --> 1:05:48.320
 of sanctimonious hypocrisy in the world.

1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:52.200
 Some of it mine, some of it yours, but we all have it.

1:05:53.080 --> 1:05:55.360
 And the trolls somewhat remove that,

1:05:55.360 --> 1:05:57.740
 but it's not a judicious, kind, constructive,

1:05:57.740 --> 1:06:00.360
 compassionate, caring version most of the time.

1:06:00.360 --> 1:06:01.680
 And a lot of those trolls,

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:03.600
 and I have this feeling about Michael Malice,

1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:05.560
 I don't know whether it's right,

1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:08.960
 that there's somebody who deeply cares and loves beneath it

1:06:08.960 --> 1:06:11.880
 and that that's motivating some of the trolling behavior.

1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:13.680
 And you and I don't seem to be doing that.

1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:16.560
 I don't see you as almost ever trolling.

1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:19.760
 Now you and I, I'm very much against trolling.

1:06:19.760 --> 1:06:21.520
 I'm very much against trolling.

1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:23.920
 It doesn't mean that it's selective.

1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:25.680
 You know what, it's not even true.

1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:28.480
 Like everything we say, we say like,

1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:30.000
 I'm for it, I'm against it.

1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:33.000
 This isn't my native language.

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:33.920
 I speak nuance.

1:06:33.920 --> 1:06:35.520
 I don't speak this internet shit.

1:06:35.520 --> 1:06:40.520
 And the more I have to communicate through internet shit,

1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:44.360
 right, I almost never take a tweet seriously

1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:49.360
 if it contains the letters LMAO, LOL, RTFOL, you know, FOL.

1:06:51.120 --> 1:06:54.360
 There's an interesting effect where people say stuff

1:06:54.360 --> 1:06:56.320
 and then finish with LOL.

1:06:56.320 --> 1:06:59.680
 You put it beautifully that it indicates to me

1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:00.800
 that this is a person,

1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:03.280
 we've talked about like why I wear this stupid suit,

1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:06.720
 is like this is anti, this is to fight the LOL

1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:09.600
 at the end of sentences, is take,

1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:11.920
 it's like stand up for the words you're saying.

1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:14.640
 Don't finish stuff with LOL,

1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:17.240
 removing completely the responsibility of the content

1:07:17.240 --> 1:07:19.400
 of the sentence that preceded it.

1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:22.560
 Yeah, also choosing the outfit that works both

1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:24.480
 for Men in Black and the Blues Brothers,

1:07:24.480 --> 1:07:26.680
 not a terrible choice.

1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:28.960
 Okay, but getting back, look, Lex,

1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:31.080
 we're not in a position to do this.

1:07:31.080 --> 1:07:34.560
 You need to be seated in a different chair.

1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:37.120
 Your chair is the wrong chair.

1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:39.080
 You're in the wrong chair.

1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:41.320
 It's been so long.

1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:44.340
 All right, I want to talk about you and Joe Biden.

1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:49.400
 Joe Biden was a 29 year old guy

1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:52.820
 with nothing particular going on so far as I can tell.

1:07:54.200 --> 1:07:59.200
 Okay, I know people as impressive at age 29 as Joe Biden,

1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:04.200
 12 rows back, 3D, doesn't matter, huge number of people.

1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:09.320
 None of them my age can get to where he got to.

1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:10.580
 Like we're all morons.

1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:14.800
 Anytime somebody takes out,

1:08:14.800 --> 1:08:17.560
 like if you found Eddie Van Halen in a guitar shop,

1:08:19.020 --> 1:08:19.940
 you'd be angry.

1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:23.920
 What is this guy doing repairing guitars?

1:08:25.500 --> 1:08:29.100
 Then somebody will say, maybe he loves to repair guitars.

1:08:29.100 --> 1:08:30.760
 Yeah, I mean, what is your piano,

1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:32.200
 Russian piano tuner doing?

1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:33.560
 What is my Russian piano?

1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:35.560
 That was the whole point of that story,

1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:40.480
 which is what is it that happened in that life

1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:41.640
 that converted somebody?

1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:44.780
 And I find this, for example, with Russian doctors

1:08:44.780 --> 1:08:47.560
 who are technicians in offices now.

1:08:49.340 --> 1:08:52.340
 There's a huge amount of talent in the world

1:08:52.340 --> 1:08:54.800
 that's not sitting in its proper seat.

1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:57.780
 And quite honestly, I've gotten to the point

1:08:57.780 --> 1:09:00.020
 where my feeling is we've got to take the seats.

1:09:03.220 --> 1:09:05.020
 And maybe we don't sit in them.

1:09:05.020 --> 1:09:06.660
 Maybe the idea is that we take the seats

1:09:06.660 --> 1:09:09.500
 and we put some smart Gen Z person in the seat

1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:12.780
 and say, look, no chanting.

1:09:12.780 --> 1:09:15.500
 I don't wanna hear you say, no justice, no peace.

1:09:15.500 --> 1:09:20.020
 If there aren't verbs, if it rhymes, it's wrong.

1:09:20.020 --> 1:09:21.700
 Like I used to have this thing,

1:09:21.700 --> 1:09:23.500
 if it rhymed things that rhymed wrong,

1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:26.340
 if it rhymed things that rhyme are more true.

1:09:26.340 --> 1:09:28.980
 But like in general, if something starts out

1:09:28.980 --> 1:09:30.260
 one, two, three, four,

1:09:30.260 --> 1:09:32.180
 I don't wanna hear what the rest of your sentences.

1:09:32.180 --> 1:09:33.020
 Yeah.

1:09:34.540 --> 1:09:38.300
 But I feel like the responsibility that you carry,

1:09:38.300 --> 1:09:42.420
 that I carry, this is where Joe Rogan

1:09:42.420 --> 1:09:44.740
 generally removes himself from being,

1:09:44.740 --> 1:09:45.980
 I'm just a comedian.

1:09:45.980 --> 1:09:47.900
 This idea of I'm just a comedian.

1:09:47.900 --> 1:09:49.420
 We all do that.

1:09:49.420 --> 1:09:52.580
 But at this moment in history,

1:09:52.580 --> 1:09:55.260
 like history literally can pivot

1:09:55.260 --> 1:09:57.740
 on the words of a tattooed,

1:10:01.060 --> 1:10:04.300
 ripped 50 year old comedian.

1:10:04.300 --> 1:10:06.260
 And I think the same is true with you.

1:10:07.260 --> 1:10:10.420
 Okay, well, I'm interested and I care.

1:10:10.420 --> 1:10:11.580
 Speaking of lyrics,

1:10:13.340 --> 1:10:14.500
 there are many here among us

1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:17.020
 who feel that life has been a joke.

1:10:17.020 --> 1:10:18.420
 That's not us.

1:10:18.420 --> 1:10:19.400
 The hour is getting late.

1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:20.820
 That's not us.

1:10:20.820 --> 1:10:23.300
 In the song, the joker and the thief

1:10:23.300 --> 1:10:24.740
 are on opposite sides of Jesus

1:10:24.740 --> 1:10:26.600
 having this conversation over Jesus.

1:10:27.580 --> 1:10:28.940
 You and I, we've been through that.

1:10:28.940 --> 1:10:29.940
 That's not our fate.

1:10:29.940 --> 1:10:31.060
 That's somebody else's fate

1:10:31.060 --> 1:10:33.440
 to throw spitballs at the internet.

1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:34.580
 That's not your fate.

1:10:34.580 --> 1:10:35.820
 You're an earnest guy.

1:10:35.820 --> 1:10:36.780
 You're filled with love.

1:10:36.780 --> 1:10:38.500
 You're getting the most amazing podcasts.

1:10:38.500 --> 1:10:39.340
 Yes, you're broadcasting.

1:10:39.340 --> 1:10:40.740
 But you can win over the internet.

1:10:40.740 --> 1:10:42.180
 This is the point I'm trying to make

1:10:42.180 --> 1:10:44.780
 that you're saying I'm just a grandpa.

1:10:44.780 --> 1:10:45.620
 I don't get the internet.

1:10:45.620 --> 1:10:47.220
 No, I'm telling you, you're gonna get bigger

1:10:47.220 --> 1:10:49.240
 and then you're gonna get cut down.

1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:52.020
 You're gonna keep ascending for a while, Lex.

1:10:52.020 --> 1:10:53.700
 And then you're saying, and naturally there's a...

1:10:53.700 --> 1:10:55.740
 I'm telling you, I watch the same process.

1:10:55.740 --> 1:10:57.900
 People get up to a certain level.

1:10:57.900 --> 1:10:59.180
 And one of the things that's going on,

1:10:59.180 --> 1:11:01.380
 in my opinion, with Joe Rogan,

1:11:01.380 --> 1:11:03.940
 is that when Joe Rogan starts to talk

1:11:03.940 --> 1:11:06.980
 about his misgivings about Joe Biden,

1:11:06.980 --> 1:11:09.860
 in a way that you find at any bar in America,

1:11:11.020 --> 1:11:13.520
 about cognitive decline in a 77 year old

1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:16.420
 who's about to be 78, I believe in November,

1:11:16.420 --> 1:11:20.300
 we have never had anything remotely as insane

1:11:20.300 --> 1:11:25.300
 as a 78 year old person slated to win the White House.

1:11:26.020 --> 1:11:29.740
 And you're saying when that idea is being communicated,

1:11:29.740 --> 1:11:32.020
 is there something about the disc concept

1:11:32.020 --> 1:11:33.660
 that you talk about, the system naturally starts to...

1:11:33.660 --> 1:11:35.380
 Some bad thing happens to Joe

1:11:35.380 --> 1:11:37.360
 or one of Joe's close associates.

1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:42.820
 The ability to destroy people who become inconvenient

1:11:42.820 --> 1:11:44.180
 has been documented.

1:11:44.180 --> 1:11:47.240
 This is what we have done in the past.

1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:49.180
 Whether we are doing it now, we don't know,

1:11:49.180 --> 1:11:53.000
 because we are not doing this church committee too.

1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.560
 In order to know whether or not

1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:57.080
 you are currently destroying American citizens

1:11:57.080 --> 1:11:59.400
 as we did in the past and as we have documented,

1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:02.040
 as we found out in 1976,

1:12:03.340 --> 1:12:05.600
 the federal government destroyed Americans

1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:07.480
 who had political beliefs

1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:11.440
 that the government didn't want to continue.

1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:14.920
 And I don't know whether you are grasping that.

1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:18.000
 One interpretation of why Jon Stewart

1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.480
 and why Joe Rogan and why Bill Maher,

1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:25.000
 all these people to some extent hide behind, it's a joke.

1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:25.840
 Yeah.

1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:29.240
 It's because they're trying to find a protected class.

1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:32.720
 Is there some place I can stand and speak the truth

1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:35.660
 which does not result in my being garbage collected?

1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:37.400
 Interesting.

1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:38.440
 I guess you're right.

1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:43.280
 My intuition is you can stand, as you gain more power,

1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:46.760
 you can stand behind your words.

1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:49.640
 There's a fight over Joe Rogan right now.

1:12:49.640 --> 1:12:52.780
 I mean, I've talked about it for a few years now.

1:12:52.780 --> 1:12:55.600
 People did not understand how big that program was.

1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:57.560
 People didn't understand long form podcasting.

1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:01.880
 I was derided by people who I think of as being very shrewd

1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:07.360
 for believing in these podcasts as a major force.

1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:09.200
 And most of the people who derided me have said,

1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:11.400
 wow, did I not get things?

1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:13.280
 It's like if you started to propose,

1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:17.400
 you wanted to do the Sopranos

1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:20.480
 in the era of 30 minute sitcoms.

1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:22.800
 Like, you don't get it, man.

1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:24.480
 The American people, they're not interested

1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:25.880
 in these long plot storylines.

1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:27.160
 That's your weird thing?

1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:28.840
 Nobody cares, dude.

1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:31.880
 Everybody just wants short, fast, memorable.

1:13:31.880 --> 1:13:33.960
 And like, okay, so if you do that,

1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:35.440
 you totally miss the opportunity.

1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:38.160
 And the savvy people used to say,

1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:40.160
 kid, let me tell you, nobody ever lost a dime

1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:43.000
 underestimating the intelligence of the American people.

1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.200
 Well, that was totally wrong

1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:46.920
 because they didn't calculate opportunity costs.

1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:50.600
 I have been talking about the problem of Joe for a long time.

1:13:51.560 --> 1:13:54.000
 The problem is, is that when the system wakes up,

1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:55.520
 they're gonna wanna control it.

1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:58.960
 And they come up with new different mechanisms

1:13:58.960 --> 1:13:59.880
 of doing that.

1:13:59.880 --> 1:14:03.200
 I guess one interesting one is cancel culture.

1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:05.640
 Well, look at the number of people around Joe

1:14:05.640 --> 1:14:07.520
 who they've come after since they realized

1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:09.480
 that Joe was really big.

1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:14.480
 Joey Diaz, Brian Callan, Chris Delia.

1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:22.440
 Now, I'm not saying that those are all related,

1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:27.960
 but I do notice that there are at least correlations

1:14:28.440 --> 1:14:29.960
 between when Joe says something

1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:33.280
 when something bad happens in Joe's universe.

1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:36.280
 It's easier for me to believe that that's happening

1:14:36.280 --> 1:14:38.880
 when it's happening around Joe himself.

1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:42.520
 But I'm worried about my friend.

1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:45.520
 And I don't necessarily wanna push him

1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:48.800
 towards being more if he doesn't want it.

1:14:48.800 --> 1:14:51.760
 Because I don't wanna conscript people.

1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:52.640
 He's got a great life.

1:14:52.640 --> 1:14:53.920
 He's got a great situation.

1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:56.200
 He's done a huge service.

1:14:56.200 --> 1:14:57.040
 Thank God.

1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:01.760
 How much do I owe Joe just for what he's done for you

1:15:01.760 --> 1:15:03.360
 to say nothing of what he's done for me

1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:06.680
 or for Brett or for Sam or any of these people?

1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:10.640
 And I'd like to think that we all try to give back,

1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:12.880
 but I'm worried about Joe.

1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:15.080
 He's not worried.

1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:18.280
 One of the inspiring things about Joe

1:15:18.280 --> 1:15:21.520
 is he's in this war alone.

1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:25.800
 And the way he fights the war is by just enjoying life.

1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:27.960
 Well, that's his thing, as long as he stays close

1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:30.000
 to things that he loves and being,

1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.760
 one of the things is he's honest about his drug use.

1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:34.760
 He loves to hunt.

1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:36.440
 So he's just, he does a certain amount

1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:40.320
 of like semi vice signaling upfront.

1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:41.520
 And then you just also know him.

1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:43.640
 This is why every time they try to take him down,

1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:45.160
 you use the N word.

1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:50.840
 Unfortunately, everybody knows who Joe is.

1:15:50.840 --> 1:15:55.840
 And yes, he doesn't act as if he went to a fancy

1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:58.440
 finishing school, right?

1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:00.160
 That's not his energy.

1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:02.280
 The fact that you've got some super smart guy

1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:04.240
 who always pretends to be a meathead,

1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:06.640
 just like, hey, I'm a comedian.

1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:08.680
 It's like all these defenses and disguises.

1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:11.040
 Okay, you've got this super smart guy

1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:14.440
 who he's admitted to most of the things

1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:17.040
 that you can take him down for.

1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:19.920
 And because everybody's been effectively in his den

1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:23.000
 his basement, think about that studio is his basement.

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:24.920
 People have hung out with Joe so many hours

1:16:24.920 --> 1:16:26.800
 that you can't tell them something about Joe

1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:27.640
 where they're gonna say, wow,

1:16:27.640 --> 1:16:28.800
 I'm gonna believe the New York Times

1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:31.080
 and not the hundreds of hours I've spent

1:16:31.080 --> 1:16:32.040
 on the Joe Rogan experience.

1:16:32.040 --> 1:16:35.200
 But the cool thing is that this is what inspires me

1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:37.960
 is that the way he's waging war against the system,

1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:40.640
 it's just by being a good person

1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:44.640
 and talking enough hours in a week

1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:48.680
 where that message like bleeds throughout the words

1:16:48.680 --> 1:16:49.920
 and the gaps between.

1:16:49.920 --> 1:16:51.880
 And that's so inspiring to me

1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:55.000
 that the good people can win by just being good.

1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.680
 And he's kind and he's tough.

1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:00.320
 And he also, he's no pushover.

1:17:01.880 --> 1:17:05.400
 I always worry a little bit when I sit down in my chair.

1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:07.520
 You still get scared that he'll call you

1:17:07.520 --> 1:17:09.640
 on some kind of bullshit that you weren't even aware of?

1:17:09.640 --> 1:17:12.160
 No, the first time I was on the show,

1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:14.400
 the energy wasn't great between us.

1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:16.520
 And it was in a sober October situation.

1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:18.120
 So I think I hadn't understood that

1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:20.200
 and maybe our egos got a little bit off.

1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:23.800
 I don't know.

1:17:23.800 --> 1:17:25.440
 I mean, I was having fun,

1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:28.640
 but maybe it was just too complicated life forms

1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:29.560
 getting to know each other.

1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:32.680
 The first one was probably,

1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:37.600
 yeah, that made me a little nervous for the future.

1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:40.480
 But then, Joe and I have become friends,

1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:42.440
 although sometimes we have miscommunications

1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:46.040
 like on Yom Kippur, I texted him and I said,

1:17:46.040 --> 1:17:50.120
 Joe, I want to apologize for ways I've let you down

1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:51.920
 as a friend that haven't been there for you

1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:54.760
 and appreciate everything you've done for me all this time.

1:17:54.760 --> 1:17:56.360
 Like I get this text back like,

1:17:56.360 --> 1:17:57.800
 what the fuck is your problem?

1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:00.000
 You're great, dude.

1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.360
 I don't know what bad place you're in, but cheer up.

1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:04.640
 It's like, Joe, don't you have any Jews in your life

1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:07.640
 that apologize for what they've done?

1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:09.600
 He was just like, dude, have you lost your mind?

1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:11.160
 What the hell's gotten into you?

1:18:11.160 --> 1:18:16.160
 Yeah, what do you think about the Spotify thing?

1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:18.560
 What about it?

1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:19.400
 Ask me a question.

1:18:19.400 --> 1:18:23.160
 He's now, as opposed to being just a comedian

1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:26.120
 with the podcast, he now is just a comedian

1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:28.840
 with the podcast who stepped like in the middle

1:18:28.840 --> 1:18:31.400
 of the center of cancel culture,

1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:33.880
 which is like, I know Spotify is in Sweden,

1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:37.120
 but they represent Silicon Valley.

1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:40.880
 They represent the very kind of structures.

1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:43.680
 They contain and represent the kind of structures

1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:47.180
 that threatened to destroy the Elans of the world.

1:18:48.560 --> 1:18:52.560
 And he just like stepped like with his Alex Jones

1:18:52.560 --> 1:18:56.560
 and his Joey Diaz just strolled right into the middle of it.

1:18:56.560 --> 1:18:58.920
 Yeah, I think it's awesome.

1:18:58.920 --> 1:18:59.920
 I love it.

1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:04.440
 But do you think he's strong enough to, I don't know.

1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:06.400
 I mean, I don't even know the right way to ask this,

1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:08.960
 but is he strong enough to persevere?

1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:10.040
 It's a bit interesting.

1:19:10.040 --> 1:19:13.080
 It's like when a lion decides, wow,

1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:14.520
 that honey badger looks tasty.

1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:17.280
 I'm gonna swallow it whole, see what happens.

1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:18.880
 Because I talked to him offline.

1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:22.320
 He really seems to be willing to give away the 100 million,

1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:24.100
 which gives him so much power.

1:19:24.100 --> 1:19:29.100
 Oh, I don't, it's a powerful thing to be able to say,

1:19:29.320 --> 1:19:33.240
 I don't, yeah, to the honey badger.

1:19:33.240 --> 1:19:35.500
 He just strolls in, but he's willing to walk away

1:19:35.500 --> 1:19:36.340
 from anything in this world.

1:19:36.340 --> 1:19:38.640
 Well, he's gonna walk out the other side of the lion.

1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:40.780
 I don't think he's gonna go out the way he came in.

1:19:40.780 --> 1:19:41.620
 Yeah.

1:19:41.620 --> 1:19:42.560
 Well, you know what it is?

1:19:42.560 --> 1:19:44.760
 It's Tommy Lee Jones entering the bug.

1:19:45.620 --> 1:19:47.920
 This is like a giant alien, he just walks into it?

1:19:47.920 --> 1:19:49.760
 He just, he gets swallowed by the bug

1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:52.020
 and he blasts out from the inside.

1:19:52.020 --> 1:19:53.680
 I have it as Tommy Lee Jones.

1:19:53.680 --> 1:19:55.680
 Yeah, that's Joe Rogan to you.

1:19:55.680 --> 1:19:58.040
 Yeah, is that my feeling is that Spotify

1:19:58.040 --> 1:19:59.600
 doesn't understand what they're messing with.

1:19:59.600 --> 1:20:01.960
 I could be wrong, but I'm not.

1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:02.800
 No, you're right.

1:20:02.800 --> 1:20:03.620
 I'm right.

1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:07.060
 Because Joe doesn't need anything, man.

1:20:07.060 --> 1:20:08.760
 I mean, this is the weird thing about it.

1:20:08.760 --> 1:20:10.480
 It's like, I'm sure that he loves all his toys,

1:20:10.480 --> 1:20:11.400
 whatever, blah, blah, blah.

1:20:11.400 --> 1:20:12.700
 He's a rich guy.

1:20:12.700 --> 1:20:14.160
 Yes, he's got a few money.

1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:16.680
 He had a few money a long time ago.

1:20:16.680 --> 1:20:21.220
 And you're not, you know, the other thing about,

1:20:21.220 --> 1:20:23.680
 it's a bit weird being friends with a dude like that.

1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:24.520
 It just is.

1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:26.960
 Cause like you call him up or he'll call you up

1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:29.200
 and he's like, what's going on in your life?

1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:30.100
 I don't know.

1:20:30.100 --> 1:20:32.000
 Kind of depressed, trying to get some math done.

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:33.480
 What are you up?

1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:34.720
 Oh dude, I can cheer you up.

1:20:34.720 --> 1:20:37.780
 I just came off of a 29,000 person stadium.

1:20:38.600 --> 1:20:40.000
 It's like, oh cool.

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:40.840
 How'd you do that?

1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:41.680
 Oh, I don't know.

1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:43.280
 I just announced it on Instagram a few days ago

1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:44.560
 and it filled up.

1:20:44.560 --> 1:20:46.900
 Just like, oh damn.

1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:51.200
 I mean, that thing is so powerful.

1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:52.040
 So there you go.

1:20:52.040 --> 1:20:54.360
 I mean, you could be that too.

1:20:54.360 --> 1:20:57.440
 The instant Joe takes an interest in politics

1:20:57.440 --> 1:20:58.280
 and saving the world.

1:20:58.280 --> 1:20:59.780
 You might destroy all of that.

1:20:59.780 --> 1:21:01.360
 It's going bye bye.

1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:02.200
 I promise you.

1:21:02.200 --> 1:21:04.040
 I just disagree with you.

1:21:04.040 --> 1:21:05.960
 I mean, cause you have to do it.

1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:07.760
 Like you've said this many times before.

1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:11.720
 I'll bet you, I'll bet you a bottle of Stoli

1:21:11.720 --> 1:21:14.840
 that you can get, if you get Joe Rogan

1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:16.440
 to get highly politically active

1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:18.940
 and call out the system for all the bullshit that it is

1:21:18.940 --> 1:21:21.040
 in a very pointed and determined fashion

1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:26.300
 and he doesn't get destroyed, I'll give you the vodka.

1:21:26.300 --> 1:21:27.140
 The vodka?

1:21:27.140 --> 1:21:27.960
 Yeah.

1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:29.880
 That sounds like a pretty damn good deal.

1:21:29.880 --> 1:21:32.320
 But you've said this, I mean.

1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:36.800
 No living heroes, my friend, no living heroes.

1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:37.680
 I just.

1:21:37.680 --> 1:21:39.320
 No living heroes.

1:21:39.320 --> 1:21:40.800
 It's just difficult.

1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:42.360
 You just have to be good at it.

1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:45.000
 I mean, if you just say generic political things.

1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:45.840
 No, no.

1:21:46.800 --> 1:21:48.120
 You're going to be taken down.

1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:50.200
 But if you're. The more heroic you are,

1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:52.580
 the more beautiful you are,

1:21:52.580 --> 1:21:54.840
 the more you will be made to suffer.

1:21:54.840 --> 1:21:56.600
 If they cannot get you on reputation.

1:21:56.600 --> 1:21:59.040
 If Jesus himself came down.

1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:00.540
 I don't know if I ever read.

1:22:00.540 --> 1:22:02.680
 I probably have never read to you the hit piece

1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:03.780
 I did on Jesus.

1:22:04.620 --> 1:22:05.460
 You don't know about this?

1:22:05.460 --> 1:22:06.300
 No, I did not know.

1:22:06.300 --> 1:22:09.860
 I did hit pieces on all of the best people in the world.

1:22:09.860 --> 1:22:11.020
 Wow.

1:22:11.020 --> 1:22:14.120
 So whoever it was who cured cancer,

1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:16.840
 discovered new particles or whatever it is,

1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:18.600
 I did a hit piece against them to prove

1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:22.680
 that I can do it to anybody around anything at any time.

1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:24.840
 Except Eddie Van Halen is what we're talking about.

1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:26.600
 Well, Eddie Van Halen is now dead.

1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:31.140
 But if this was a situation, you know, hot for teacher,

1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:33.760
 canceled.

1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:35.040
 Disrespectful.

1:22:35.040 --> 1:22:36.280
 Absolutely.

1:22:38.440 --> 1:22:43.440
 Also, you know, packaging female objectification

1:22:43.840 --> 1:22:44.880
 for young men.

1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:47.660
 Clearly Eddie Van Halen is one of the worst people alive.

1:22:47.660 --> 1:22:52.660
 But the skill, the incredible inspiration

1:22:53.100 --> 1:22:55.740
 that is just radiating from his music

1:22:55.740 --> 1:22:57.240
 inspires so many millions

1:22:57.240 --> 1:23:00.040
 that they will fight those canceled pieces.

1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:01.240
 This is your thing.

1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:03.620
 You have this idea that there's a war between good and evil

1:23:03.620 --> 1:23:06.960
 and the good has already been designated the winner.

1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:08.360
 And it's not true.

1:23:08.360 --> 1:23:11.520
 But your belief that it's true.

1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:13.040
 Fake it till you make it, no?

1:23:13.040 --> 1:23:16.560
 I mean, you gotta, it's motivating both of us.

1:23:16.560 --> 1:23:18.500
 Like I also believe that we're gonna win

1:23:18.500 --> 1:23:20.220
 because if I don't, then I can't get out of bed

1:23:20.220 --> 1:23:22.100
 and it's pretty heavy at the moment.

1:23:22.100 --> 1:23:27.100
 Do you think 2021 can make us feel good

1:23:28.740 --> 1:23:31.120
 about the trajectory of society?

1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:36.040
 So like where we emerge from this year feeling good.

1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:38.520
 Like there's a smile on Eric Weinstein's face

1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:40.360
 and the next time we talk,

1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:42.780
 we'll be doing some kind of duet on guitar

1:23:42.780 --> 1:23:45.960
 and not having this worried look on our faces.

1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:48.440
 No.

1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:51.480
 Okay, but you've also promised

1:23:51.480 --> 1:23:53.840
 you're going to somehow end this in a positive.

1:23:54.840 --> 1:23:57.640
 Okay, so how do you turn the no around?

1:23:57.640 --> 1:23:59.360
 What's the U turn from the no?

1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:03.060
 Until we get some actually decent people

1:24:03.060 --> 1:24:06.240
 in the right chairs who are not constantly thinking

1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:09.360
 about their next paycheck, I don't see a solution.

1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:13.280
 Let me just say what the prerequisites for a solution are

1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:15.720
 and to let you know why I don't think it's coming.

1:24:18.520 --> 1:24:21.360
 First of all, both of these political parties,

1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:24.580
 the leadership of them is disgusting and has to go.

1:24:24.580 --> 1:24:26.620
 They're tearing us apart.

1:24:26.620 --> 1:24:28.900
 They lack the will to be Americans.

1:24:28.900 --> 1:24:32.200
 They don't understand the subtlety of the project.

1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:34.080
 They're simply the people who figured out

1:24:34.080 --> 1:24:37.640
 how to inhabit the seats and that is their great achievement.

1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:43.780
 I believe that in order to solve this,

1:24:43.780 --> 1:24:45.280
 you need people who can integrate,

1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:47.520
 who are not partisan at the level

1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:50.040
 of the partisan warriors that we're seeing,

1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:52.560
 people who believe in dividing the pies of the future

1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:56.320
 rather than the present pie as our main task as Americans

1:24:56.320 --> 1:24:58.000
 because we are built around growth.

1:24:58.000 --> 1:24:59.060
 I'm sorry to say it.

1:25:02.760 --> 1:25:06.160
 You need an ability to have subtle conversations

1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:07.960
 and you need the ability to exclude.

1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:13.280
 And at the moment, everyone knows inclusion is good,

1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:14.480
 which it isn't.

1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:16.200
 It's like saying, well, water is good.

1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:18.780
 If I say water is good, everybody will agree with me.

1:25:18.780 --> 1:25:20.780
 It's not, people drown.

1:25:22.340 --> 1:25:24.600
 People need to get dehydrated.

1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:26.760
 It can be life saving or life ending.

1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:28.440
 It isn't good or bad.

1:25:28.440 --> 1:25:30.320
 Inclusion is not good or bad.

1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:31.720
 Inclusion is just inclusion.

1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:33.620
 Exclusion is part of inclusion.

1:25:34.580 --> 1:25:37.760
 We've taught people that they can reason through the world

1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:43.840
 as sub cocker spaniels.

1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:45.840
 They just bark things at each other.

1:25:45.840 --> 1:25:48.480
 I'm for safety.

1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:49.720
 I'm for inclusion.

1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:51.080
 I'm for growth.

1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:52.520
 Oh, really?

1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:55.600
 Do you guys use verbs, dependent clauses?

1:25:55.600 --> 1:25:57.280
 Are there compound complex sentences?

1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:01.000
 Where are we in this sea of nonsense?

1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:03.940
 You have to be able to build a place

1:26:03.940 --> 1:26:06.400
 where you have smart, talented people

1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:10.700
 who represent a diverse group of correct opinions.

1:26:10.700 --> 1:26:13.200
 You need to get rid of almost all of the people

1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:15.200
 who have opinions that are antithetical

1:26:15.200 --> 1:26:17.660
 to what we're trying to accomplish.

1:26:17.660 --> 1:26:20.680
 You need to give them insulation, which we're terrified

1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:21.820
 because we don't trust anybody.

1:26:21.820 --> 1:26:23.320
 So everything has to be transparent.

1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:24.280
 If you're going to the bathroom,

1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:25.800
 I want those walls to be plexiglass

1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:27.000
 so I can see what you're doing.

1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.300
 It's like, that's too much transparency.

1:26:29.300 --> 1:26:32.200
 We have too much and not enough at the same time.

1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:36.640
 And then in essence, you need to ensure

1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:39.200
 that people aren't worried about feeding their family

1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:41.140
 every four seconds for being real.

1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:43.540
 None of that is happening.

1:26:43.540 --> 1:26:47.240
 And our billionaires, our billionaires are pathetic.

1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:48.960
 What is the point of billionaires

1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:52.000
 if you're not going to do billionaire type cool stuff

1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:57.000
 like saying, F you, and I'm going to throw $3 billion

1:26:57.720 --> 1:27:02.720
 at the project of restoring the national conversation?

1:27:05.220 --> 1:27:06.740
 I don't grasp this.

1:27:06.740 --> 1:27:09.040
 What is the point of creating obscene wealth

1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:10.500
 if we don't have anyone smart enough

1:27:10.500 --> 1:27:12.840
 and caring enough to use it?

1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:16.120
 So I agree with that last part for sure.

1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:20.440
 Let me slightly push back on the idea

1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:22.800
 that the leaders themselves are broken.

1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:27.080
 I feel like this goes to the Joe Rogan,

1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:31.880
 Joe Biden and Trump having a debate on that program.

1:27:31.880 --> 1:27:36.880
 I feel like Joe Biden has a lot of really interesting ideas

1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:40.600
 that he's almost forgot how to communicate.

1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:44.080
 He's been fake for so long within the system.

1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:45.480
 Hillary was fake for too long.

1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:47.480
 I'm sure she had real ideas at the beginning

1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:50.600
 that she still was campaigning on decades later.

1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:54.920
 But if the system, if the platforms empowered you

1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:56.760
 to search, to be honest, to be real,

1:27:56.760 --> 1:27:59.560
 to search for those ideas within yourself,

1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:02.600
 like long form conversations do,

1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:05.880
 then even the Donald Trump and Joe Biden leaders

1:28:05.880 --> 1:28:10.640
 we have now would take this country to a better place

1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:12.840
 that would unite people.

1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:15.440
 So like, we can keep the current Congress.

1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:17.680
 We just need to create better platforms.

1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:19.080
 This is going to the intuition

1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:21.400
 that there's good in Donald Trump.

1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:24.760
 There's depth and complexity and intelligence.

1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:26.240
 And the same with Joe Biden.

1:28:26.240 --> 1:28:28.060
 There's good in Joe Biden.

1:28:28.060 --> 1:28:30.300
 And it's just, we're not incentivizing.

1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:35.000
 I mean, there's several things I think are broken.

1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:36.320
 One of them is Twitter.

1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:38.080
 The other is journalism.

1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:41.480
 It's just the platforms of us communicating with each other.

1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:43.240
 One of the reasons that I try to come up

1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:45.800
 with unifying explanations is that,

1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:49.640
 if you look at the number of wildfires in California,

1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:51.920
 let's say, that we've just seen,

1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:53.800
 if you treat them all as spontaneous,

1:28:53.800 --> 1:28:57.000
 uncorrelated instances, it feels like,

1:28:57.000 --> 1:28:58.640
 oh my God, it's just whack a mole.

1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:00.620
 Every time I send a fire truck here,

1:29:00.620 --> 1:29:02.100
 there's a fire over there.

1:29:02.100 --> 1:29:03.640
 So you want to come up with something

1:29:03.640 --> 1:29:06.400
 like a central theory, which is,

1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:07.840
 why do I suddenly have a problem

1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:09.960
 when I hadn't had a problem before?

1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:12.560
 So I look for these unifying explanations.

1:29:12.560 --> 1:29:15.480
 And I found one the other day that really speaks to me.

1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:18.200
 I mean, people are very frustrated

1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:20.140
 because they've been trained to think about this

1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:21.960
 incorrectly, in my opinion.

1:29:21.960 --> 1:29:25.160
 But here's the graph that you need to look at.

1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:29.560
 On the x axis is time by year.

1:29:29.560 --> 1:29:34.560
 And on the y axis is something like average age of a human.

1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:40.120
 The title of the graph is any desirable situation

1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:41.580
 involving institutions.

1:29:44.600 --> 1:29:48.580
 So that could be CEO, it could be tenured professor.

1:29:50.320 --> 1:29:53.480
 It could be who's getting grants.

1:29:53.480 --> 1:30:01.360
 It could be the age at which people win Nobel Prizes.

1:30:01.360 --> 1:30:04.260
 University presidents, all these things go up.

1:30:05.560 --> 1:30:08.440
 In other words, for a long period of time,

1:30:08.440 --> 1:30:12.440
 the average age of the person in a desirable situation

1:30:12.440 --> 1:30:16.400
 has been increasing something like nine months for every 12.

1:30:19.100 --> 1:30:22.080
 Those graphs have to go down at some point.

1:30:22.080 --> 1:30:27.080
 The specter of having five people all born in the 1940s

1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:33.160
 as the final entrance in the presidential context,

1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:36.300
 that makes no sense.

1:30:36.300 --> 1:30:38.540
 Think about how bizarre a thing

1:30:38.540 --> 1:30:40.420
 that nobody's even really talking about.

1:30:40.420 --> 1:30:44.600
 The last five people were all ancient

1:30:45.720 --> 1:30:47.060
 by presidential standards.

1:30:47.060 --> 1:30:49.600
 Not one, not two, but five.

1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:54.020
 We are talking about a contest between somebody

1:30:54.020 --> 1:30:56.520
 who is the oldest of the baby boomers,

1:30:57.660 --> 1:30:58.900
 the very beginning of the baby boom,

1:30:58.900 --> 1:31:02.700
 summer of 46th birthday, fighting somebody

1:31:02.700 --> 1:31:05.060
 who is in the silent generation.

1:31:05.060 --> 1:31:08.800
 The silent generation guy in a town hall in Florida

1:31:08.800 --> 1:31:11.480
 gets this question from a Gen Z guy saying,

1:31:12.640 --> 1:31:14.100
 what's going on with my future?

1:31:14.100 --> 1:31:18.220
 Joe Biden has the audacity to say,

1:31:18.220 --> 1:31:20.020
 I'm a transitional president.

1:31:20.020 --> 1:31:21.980
 You guys are the highly educated one.

1:31:22.860 --> 1:31:25.500
 When has any generation in history needed

1:31:25.500 --> 1:31:29.420
 a transitional 78 year old person to take office?

1:31:29.420 --> 1:31:31.300
 It's bizarre, it's preposterous.

1:31:31.300 --> 1:31:35.180
 That graph is the graph we can't talk about.

1:31:35.180 --> 1:31:38.340
 That graph is the graph of our destruction.

1:31:39.580 --> 1:31:44.580
 Because it has the, you can make a one line argument,

1:31:44.580 --> 1:31:49.580
 which sounds like ageism, which isn't a very good argument.

1:31:50.380 --> 1:31:51.220
 No.

1:31:51.220 --> 1:31:54.580
 But what it does is, is it muddles the conversation.

1:31:54.580 --> 1:31:56.680
 And you always have to ask yourself the question,

1:31:56.680 --> 1:31:58.700
 if this conversation becomes muddled,

1:31:58.700 --> 1:32:01.440
 who wins as a result of the muddling?

1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:04.140
 Well, it's a battle, but let's just win it.

1:32:04.140 --> 1:32:05.420
 Let's win the battle.

1:32:05.420 --> 1:32:06.260
 You give.

1:32:06.260 --> 1:32:07.380
 Are you running?

1:32:07.380 --> 1:32:09.340
 For sure, I'll run.

1:32:09.340 --> 1:32:11.140
 I was born in Russia, can't run.

1:32:11.140 --> 1:32:13.860
 So, but we Russians can hack elections,

1:32:13.860 --> 1:32:15.660
 so we'll figure it out.

1:32:15.660 --> 1:32:17.660
 This is me officially announcing my run for president.

1:32:17.660 --> 1:32:20.520
 I was born in St. Petersburg, Florida.

1:32:23.100 --> 1:32:23.940
 Yeah.

1:32:23.940 --> 1:32:25.820
 Lex, what is it that you really wanna ask?

1:32:25.820 --> 1:32:30.060
 I think, I wanna put some responsibility on the portal.

1:32:30.060 --> 1:32:31.060
 The portal.

1:32:31.060 --> 1:32:32.740
 The portal.

1:32:32.740 --> 1:32:37.740
 That the portal gives power to the people in that graph.

1:32:38.980 --> 1:32:41.140
 Like, cause you put it quite brilliantly

1:32:41.140 --> 1:32:44.700
 that the people that move the world,

1:32:44.700 --> 1:32:46.220
 their age has been going up.

1:32:47.080 --> 1:32:49.780
 And not move the world, but put in the position

1:32:49.780 --> 1:32:52.160
 where they get the chance to affect the world.

1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:57.760
 These new platforms, I think Twitter falls in them,

1:32:57.760 --> 1:33:00.300
 give power to the younger people.

1:33:00.300 --> 1:33:01.980
 It doesn't have to be about age necessarily,

1:33:01.980 --> 1:33:04.140
 but the younger thinking people.

1:33:04.140 --> 1:33:06.740
 So that's a promising thing.

1:33:06.740 --> 1:33:09.220
 And you are like, you're like Gandalf.

1:33:09.220 --> 1:33:11.900
 You get to pick your Frodo's or whatever.

1:33:11.900 --> 1:33:14.140
 I'm not very good with the analogy,

1:33:14.140 --> 1:33:16.180
 but the whole point is for you as Gandalf.

1:33:16.180 --> 1:33:18.100
 I don't know that I make that much sense.

1:33:18.100 --> 1:33:20.020
 Gandalf makes sense.

1:33:20.020 --> 1:33:22.340
 I don't know if people know how to fit me

1:33:22.340 --> 1:33:24.040
 into this ecosystem.

1:33:24.940 --> 1:33:26.420
 I think there's something in my presentation

1:33:26.420 --> 1:33:27.660
 that people find very confusing.

1:33:27.660 --> 1:33:28.500
 No, figure it out.

1:33:28.500 --> 1:33:30.900
 I disagree with you, but you need to look at the mirror

1:33:30.900 --> 1:33:32.960
 and think like, what is it?

1:33:32.960 --> 1:33:36.100
 Is it, maybe you need a mustache.

1:33:36.100 --> 1:33:36.940
 I don't know.

1:33:36.940 --> 1:33:41.900
 But there's something about figuring out

1:33:41.900 --> 1:33:43.740
 how to be a charismatic communicator in this.

1:33:43.740 --> 1:33:45.220
 And that's the responsibility.

1:33:45.220 --> 1:33:48.620
 You said like finishing sentences with the LOL

1:33:48.620 --> 1:33:50.060
 is painful for your soul.

1:33:50.060 --> 1:33:52.140
 Yeah, that's just how somebody lets me know.

1:33:52.140 --> 1:33:54.540
 I don't have to take their opinion seriously.

1:33:54.540 --> 1:33:55.920
 Yeah, it's still the language,

1:33:55.920 --> 1:33:58.340
 the way that people are communicating

1:33:58.340 --> 1:33:59.480
 and you're swimming that wave.

1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:01.500
 You have a big platform.

1:34:01.500 --> 1:34:02.660
 I have a growing platform.

1:34:02.660 --> 1:34:05.260
 It feels like this is the place to give power.

1:34:05.260 --> 1:34:07.460
 I agree, but we're gonna get swatted down.

1:34:07.460 --> 1:34:08.520
 I just don't think so.

1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:09.360
 You're wrong.

1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:10.820
 Why are you afraid of the big?

1:34:10.820 --> 1:34:13.100
 Like this is, I've studied it.

1:34:13.100 --> 1:34:17.160
 Because I've studied, let me ask you a question, Lex.

1:34:18.880 --> 1:34:21.820
 I believe that every society is supposed to have

1:34:21.820 --> 1:34:25.500
 a collection of what I call break glass

1:34:25.500 --> 1:34:27.120
 in case of emergency people.

1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:29.560
 Yeah.

1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:31.540
 These are people who are universally loved

1:34:31.540 --> 1:34:33.060
 and trusted by your society.

1:34:33.060 --> 1:34:35.500
 For example, David Attenborough,

1:34:35.500 --> 1:34:39.300
 the great British naturalist and presenter,

1:34:39.300 --> 1:34:40.620
 recently came on Instagram.

1:34:40.620 --> 1:34:42.140
 He's worried about the planet.

1:34:43.100 --> 1:34:46.540
 And I said, look, there are very few of these people left.

1:34:46.540 --> 1:34:48.380
 Let's pay attention, find out what he has to say.

1:34:48.380 --> 1:34:49.660
 Maybe he's gonna be an ass.

1:34:49.660 --> 1:34:50.500
 Maybe he's gonna be in it.

1:34:50.500 --> 1:34:52.620
 Maybe he's gonna say wrong things, don't know.

1:34:52.620 --> 1:34:56.400
 Tell me about your top 10 universal American heroes.

1:34:57.220 --> 1:34:58.860
 This is not a rhetorical question.

1:34:58.860 --> 1:35:00.420
 No.

1:35:00.420 --> 1:35:02.000
 Give me five.

1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:03.900
 Okay, everybody looks to that person and says,

1:35:03.900 --> 1:35:05.640
 yep, the best of us.

1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:08.740
 Probably follow that person.

1:35:08.740 --> 1:35:11.500
 Well, everybody's an interesting concept.

1:35:11.500 --> 1:35:14.660
 I mean, Elon Musk is very divisive, right?

1:35:14.660 --> 1:35:16.940
 But I'm talking about overwhelmingly people

1:35:16.940 --> 1:35:21.580
 would follow that person if that person gave a rousing,

1:35:21.580 --> 1:35:25.660
 intelligent speech that said, we must act now

1:35:25.660 --> 1:35:27.360
 because we're in dire straits.

1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:30.000
 I think a lot of people fall in that category.

1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:33.940
 For me, it would be in the tech world,

1:35:33.940 --> 1:35:34.780
 in the engineering world.

1:35:34.780 --> 1:35:35.620
 No, no, no, no, no.

1:35:35.620 --> 1:35:36.440
 Tell me his names.

1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:37.280
 Elon Musk.

1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:38.120
 Elon Musk.

1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:42.040
 The Rock.

1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:45.860
 I'm thinking like, who is the most eloquent actor?

1:35:45.860 --> 1:35:48.340
 So like, you think celebrities, so people with platforms.

1:35:48.340 --> 1:35:50.140
 I didn't say celebrities, but you have to be well known.

1:35:50.140 --> 1:35:55.140
 I believe like, yeah, so this goes to Joe Rogan.

1:35:55.140 --> 1:35:55.980
 Hmm.

1:35:59.580 --> 1:36:02.100
 First two did not really impress me

1:36:02.100 --> 1:36:03.840
 as being what I said, but okay.

1:36:05.780 --> 1:36:08.220
 Elon several years ago would have.

1:36:08.220 --> 1:36:10.300
 Can you try to?

1:36:10.300 --> 1:36:11.420
 Joe Rogan has.

1:36:11.420 --> 1:36:12.300
 Why do they fail?

1:36:12.300 --> 1:36:13.380
 Why does Elon fail?

1:36:13.380 --> 1:36:14.940
 Lots of people treat Joe Rogan

1:36:14.940 --> 1:36:17.500
 as if he's some sort of right wing racist

1:36:17.500 --> 1:36:19.640
 because they've never watched his program.

1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:20.660
 They don't know who his friends are.

1:36:20.660 --> 1:36:22.020
 I don't know.

1:36:22.020 --> 1:36:24.820
 Oh, but when I thought you said everybody,

1:36:24.820 --> 1:36:29.180
 I thought you meant a large enough people

1:36:29.180 --> 1:36:31.120
 where a huge change can happen,

1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:33.580
 not actually literally everybody.

1:36:33.580 --> 1:36:34.420
 Because I think.

1:36:34.420 --> 1:36:35.680
 I mean people who've pulled off,

1:36:35.680 --> 1:36:38.520
 like people who've pulled off something

1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:41.720
 where everybody's convinced that that person just deeply.

1:36:44.460 --> 1:36:47.020
 I mean, I think I've told you this story before,

1:36:47.020 --> 1:36:52.020
 but the one time I've seen the power of a figure like this,

1:36:52.020 --> 1:36:55.320
 I mean, very few times I've been in a large crowd

1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:57.600
 and I've seen people just moved

1:36:57.600 --> 1:36:59.280
 where they would do almost anything good,

1:36:59.280 --> 1:37:01.960
 bad and different because they were primed.

1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:06.440
 One was a Rolling Stones concert.

1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:09.840
 The other one was Nelson Mandela coming to Boston.

1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:13.760
 And man, you've never seen anything like this.

1:37:13.760 --> 1:37:15.360
 You check out the photos from the banks

1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:18.200
 of the Charles River when Nelson Mandela came.

1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:23.200
 There are people that you need in your dark hours

1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:26.080
 and we can't agree on who they are.

1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:29.360
 And as soon as they emerge, we tar them with shit.

1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:31.380
 We get out the shit branch.

1:37:31.380 --> 1:37:32.220
 Yeah.

1:37:32.220 --> 1:37:33.040
 I just disagree with you.

1:37:33.040 --> 1:37:33.880
 So I think.

1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:35.680
 What do we disagree about here?

1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:37.520
 I think it doesn't matter who it is.

1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:40.560
 I think really good speeches are needed.

1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:41.400
 And I think a lot.

1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:42.580
 Who's gonna give them?

1:37:42.580 --> 1:37:44.320
 I saw Killer Mike try to give a good speech.

1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:45.160
 Yeah, he did.

1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:46.000
 Wow.

1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:46.960
 In Atlanta, right?

1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:47.800
 Yeah, he did.

1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:49.320
 That was something.

1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:50.260
 Very impressed.

1:37:50.260 --> 1:37:51.100
 Yeah.

1:37:51.100 --> 1:37:54.040
 Even Killer Mike immediately gets into this.

1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:54.860
 Sell out.

1:37:57.480 --> 1:38:01.140
 Yeah, but he didn't take up the responsibility.

1:38:01.140 --> 1:38:02.080
 I would say.

1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:02.920
 He didn't.

1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:05.820
 Of going bigger.

1:38:05.820 --> 1:38:07.700
 So he was speaking to the community.

1:38:07.700 --> 1:38:08.540
 And he was doing what he.

1:38:08.540 --> 1:38:11.240
 On this particular moment, he's exceptional at it.

1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:13.640
 And he was speaking to this particular moment.

1:38:13.640 --> 1:38:16.200
 He didn't take it a step farther,

1:38:16.200 --> 1:38:21.200
 which is like giving the same speech,

1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:23.200
 but bigger than race.

1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:25.900
 Bigger than this particular moment,

1:38:25.900 --> 1:38:29.420
 but more about the American project.

1:38:29.420 --> 1:38:31.640
 You know the guy who landed the plane in the Hudson?

1:38:31.640 --> 1:38:32.480
 Yes.

1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:33.320
 Yeah, there you go.

1:38:33.320 --> 1:38:34.140
 That's a good example.

1:38:34.140 --> 1:38:37.280
 So that guy until we screw him up

1:38:38.380 --> 1:38:40.240
 is the kind of thing that I'm talking about.

1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:41.160
 Yeah, exactly.

1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:42.000
 Okay.

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.520
 I mean, Jaco, maybe that's another.

1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:44.600
 Jaco's pretty good.

1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:45.440
 Can't really tell.

1:38:45.440 --> 1:38:46.260
 Is he a Democrat?

1:38:46.260 --> 1:38:47.100
 Is he a Republican?

1:38:47.100 --> 1:38:47.920
 I don't know.

1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:48.760
 He's an American.

1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:49.600
 That's for damn sure.

1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:50.420
 Yeah.

1:38:50.420 --> 1:38:51.260
 And I think there's a lot of folks.

1:38:51.260 --> 1:38:52.600
 And then, you know.

1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:54.440
 No, I think Jaco, there aren't.

1:38:54.440 --> 1:38:56.280
 That's one of the reasons why Jaco's so special.

1:38:56.280 --> 1:38:57.120
 That's so important.

1:38:57.120 --> 1:38:57.940
 Yeah.

1:38:57.940 --> 1:39:02.940
 Your podcast, The Portal, is something in my little universe

1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:06.920
 is something a lot of people really love.

1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:08.440
 And it moves them.

1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:11.080
 They draw a lot of meaning from it.

1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:14.760
 And also, especially in difficult times.

1:39:16.760 --> 1:39:21.760
 It gives them a comfort of through like this kind of,

1:39:21.760 --> 1:39:23.000
 it's not just nuance.

1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:26.000
 There's like, even when you're talking about chaos,

1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:28.880
 there's love underneath all of it.

1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:30.880
 And I think people would draw a lot of meaning from it,

1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:35.880
 which is why they are wondering why you haven't been doing

1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:40.880
 I'm wondering why you haven't been doing that many podcasts

1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:45.240
 or you haven't done it in maybe a month and a half

1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:49.360
 or two months in this most difficult of times.

1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:50.900
 Is there a good reason?

1:39:52.420 --> 1:39:53.560
 Yeah.

1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:55.120
 There are lots of good reasons.

1:39:56.560 --> 1:39:58.580
 So the first one is kind of weird,

1:39:58.580 --> 1:40:01.480
 which is everybody assumes that everyone wants to be famous.

1:40:01.480 --> 1:40:05.840
 And if you say, I don't want to be famous,

1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:06.920
 it's like, oh, you're just saying that

1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:09.120
 because you want to be everyone to think you're famous.

1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:09.960
 You're not that famous.

1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:10.780
 You know, okay.

1:40:12.760 --> 1:40:16.780
 I don't love being as well known as I've become.

1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:21.400
 There's lots of things that are fun about it.

1:40:21.400 --> 1:40:23.080
 It's wonderful that you can go to,

1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:24.400
 I can go to any city in the world

1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:27.000
 and there are portal listeners there.

1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:28.720
 All I need to do is put out a tweet

1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:30.760
 and 20 people show up for a drink.

1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:31.760
 And they're amazing people.

1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:36.240
 And they're almost, I mean, you can see my live Q and A's

1:40:36.240 --> 1:40:37.440
 on my Instagram page.

1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:38.800
 If you go to Eric R. Weinstein,

1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:40.440
 I just pick somebody randomly

1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:43.080
 and I was really worried about it at first.

1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:45.560
 And you know, maybe I should be worried about it,

1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:47.880
 but in general, people all over the world

1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:49.080
 are just so positive.

1:40:49.080 --> 1:40:50.300
 And so, you know.

1:40:51.380 --> 1:40:55.160
 And thoughtful and have a story that's kind of self selected.

1:40:55.160 --> 1:40:56.000
 Right?

1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:56.820
 Yeah.

1:40:56.820 --> 1:40:58.080
 But I don't like the fame.

1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:00.220
 The thing we just described comes with the fame.

1:41:00.220 --> 1:41:01.320
 It's a beautiful thing.

1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:03.680
 You know, you're worried that it's getting.

1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:04.520
 It's ephemeral.

1:41:04.520 --> 1:41:09.240
 It'll, look Lex, it'll turn on you in a heartbeat.

1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:10.080
 Yeah.

1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:11.760
 It'll turn on you in a heartbeat.

1:41:11.760 --> 1:41:14.480
 And the other problem is I don't,

1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:16.940
 I don't like my audience being my audience.

1:41:16.940 --> 1:41:18.080
 I want to get closer to them.

1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:18.960
 I want to talk to them.

1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:21.040
 I want to find out what is this doing in your life?

1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:24.720
 My house fills up with art that people send me.

1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:27.360
 The lightest thing is an effects pedal

1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:28.760
 called something like, I don't know,

1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:33.120
 bow tie overdrive from a guy in Mexico, right?

1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:33.960
 Yeah.

1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:36.920
 You play electric, by the way, in a tiny little tangent.

1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:37.840
 Do you play electric?

1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:40.960
 I have a Stratocaster, but it doesn't have a strap

1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:42.960
 and I don't know what to do with it and I have a bad amp.

1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:46.800
 So you should, you should, you should hook me up with the.

1:41:46.800 --> 1:41:48.220
 We'll find it a home maybe.

1:41:48.220 --> 1:41:49.240
 Okay.

1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:52.140
 You're starting to sense that this is too much.

1:41:52.140 --> 1:41:54.640
 No, I want to be, I want to be here.

1:41:54.640 --> 1:42:00.640
 I want to do the work very simply.

1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:03.680
 I don't have an ability to fully explain myself.

1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:06.880
 I don't want to claim that I don't love the fact that how

1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:09.080
 much love do we get from these programs?

1:42:09.080 --> 1:42:14.080
 Like I, the generically people are incredibly generous.

1:42:16.240 --> 1:42:19.000
 You know, people have begged me, set up a Patreon account

1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.960
 and I haven't been able to do it.

1:42:21.960 --> 1:42:22.980
 I should do it.

1:42:22.980 --> 1:42:24.320
 I've said to everybody, it's a business.

1:42:24.320 --> 1:42:24.880
 It's a business.

1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:28.880
 It's a business, but like they're so used to being defrauded.

1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:31.600
 When somebody starts thinking about monetary incentives, my,

1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:34.600
 my goal was to say, I'm going to keep talking to you about you.

1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:37.480
 You wonder why I started doing ads on my show was because I

1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:41.360
 wanted people to think from the get go, this is a business.

1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:46.400
 This is what I sound like when I'm selling, but you know, like

1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:49.000
 you see I've lost weight.

1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:52.120
 A lot of that is due to athletic greens, athletic greens, you

1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:57.880
 know, um, code, uh, what's the, I don't know what my promo code

1:42:57.880 --> 1:43:01.720
 is for athletic greens, probably athletic greens.com slash portal,

1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:05.080
 but doesn't that portal, but you know, Fitbit who doesn't

1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:08.200
 advertise has also been instrumental as well as a guy

1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:12.280
 named Steven Cates, who, you know, was a fan from the show,

1:43:12.280 --> 1:43:14.080
 found me on the street and just said, I'm a trainer.

1:43:14.080 --> 1:43:15.040
 I want to help train you.

1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:18.200
 And it's got me on a, on a good, uh, good path.

1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:21.880
 So, you know, that's one paid advertiser and two people on

1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:24.880
 I'm calling out just because there are, you know, two, two

1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:28.640
 outfits, Steven Cates and Fitbit that have changed my life.

1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:30.720
 I wanted people to say, you know, you don't have to be

1:43:30.720 --> 1:43:31.920
 afraid of advertising.

1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:37.240
 If I do it in this way, this is powering your show, but the

1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:40.400
 whole issue of money is weird because people have these crazy

1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:41.680
 feelings like, Oh wow.

1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:42.960
 I knew he was a shill.

1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:44.960
 He's a grifter, you know?

1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:45.880
 Okay.

1:43:45.880 --> 1:43:46.880
 I didn't love that.

1:43:46.880 --> 1:43:48.040
 I didn't love the issue.

1:43:48.040 --> 1:43:50.360
 So I didn't set up a Patreon.

1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:56.120
 The security issues for talking and being me are significant.

1:43:56.120 --> 1:44:00.920
 And I don't have the kind of money to hire around the clock.

1:44:00.920 --> 1:44:04.960
 I mean, I, I desperately want to get to a level of wealth

1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:07.160
 where I don't have to think about money.

1:44:07.160 --> 1:44:09.840
 I don't think it's, you know, some people want money because

1:44:09.840 --> 1:44:12.240
 they, they, they need it for status.

1:44:12.240 --> 1:44:16.560
 I think I can handle status if I want it doing this, I don't

1:44:16.560 --> 1:44:18.360
 want the status necessarily.

1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:21.880
 And I don't want, I'd want the status, but I don't want the

1:44:21.880 --> 1:44:23.040
 fame that goes with it.

1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:25.480
 I want the money.

1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:28.720
 I don't want to be seen as this is about money because it's

1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:32.840
 about a substance and drink, you know, all of those things.

1:44:33.120 --> 1:44:36.520
 That's part of, I haven't solved these issues.

1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:39.960
 I've been feeling bad because people say, where's the portal

1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:40.160
 work?

1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:40.720
 We're desperate.

1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:41.800
 These are difficult times.

1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:45.120
 We have an election coming up and it's just like, do you

1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:48.160
 think for a moment that I want to explain that I actually got

1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:50.440
 really uncomfortable being as well known as I was?

1:44:50.440 --> 1:44:51.600
 And then what is it that I want?

1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:54.360
 Because I want to be better known and less well known at

1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:55.000
 the same time.

1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.880
 It doesn't, there's nothing the audience can do.

1:44:56.880 --> 1:44:58.320
 I don't want the audience to be the audience.

1:44:58.320 --> 1:44:59.640
 That doesn't make sense to people.

1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:02.560
 I want it to be a business, but I don't think people need to

1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:04.920
 fear a business of the businesses open about being a

1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:09.400
 business that, and then that's all to the side, what you're

1:45:09.400 --> 1:45:13.920
 seeing now in front of the election is an incredibly

1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:20.160
 meta violent period in our online existence, and I believe

1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:23.280
 that anybody who attempts to say these two parties are

1:45:23.280 --> 1:45:25.720
 completely screwed at the moment.

1:45:25.720 --> 1:45:29.160
 The leadership of these parties is unsalvageable, unworkable.

1:45:30.200 --> 1:45:33.080
 Everyone hears that from inside the two party system.

1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:34.720
 Oh, I get it.

1:45:34.920 --> 1:45:36.720
 He's trying to subtract votes off of Biden.

1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:37.360
 Oh, I get it.

1:45:37.400 --> 1:45:38.560
 He's trying to scuttle Trump.

1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:39.960
 Oh, I get it.

1:45:40.200 --> 1:45:42.840
 This is a play for his show because he's trying to plug

1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:46.560
 in to discuss there's a bill Hicks routine on marketing.

1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:48.960
 Have you ever seen this brilliant?

1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:53.200
 I recommend it to everyone where he comes out on stage and

1:45:53.200 --> 1:45:55.480
 he says, are there any people in marketing and sales in the

1:45:55.480 --> 1:45:55.880
 audience?

1:45:56.200 --> 1:45:56.720
 Woo.

1:45:56.720 --> 1:45:57.000
 Yeah.

1:45:57.240 --> 1:45:58.560
 It's like, okay, great.

1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:00.640
 Can you do us all a favor and die?

1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:02.160
 And like, everybody laughs.

1:46:02.560 --> 1:46:04.120
 He's like, no, I'm not laughing.

1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:05.160
 I'm seeing being serious.

1:46:05.160 --> 1:46:06.920
 So he's talked about how marketing is horrible.

1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:09.040
 So you're like, where's this act going?

1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:11.160
 Then he gets to the point of it.

1:46:11.160 --> 1:46:15.120
 It's like, oh, I know how you marketing people think bills

1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:17.560
 going after that, uh, resentment dollar.

1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:18.520
 That's good dollar.

1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:20.520
 Let's get that resentment anti marketing dollar.

1:46:20.560 --> 1:46:20.840
 Yeah.

1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:21.840
 It's like, no, that's not what I'm saying.

1:46:21.840 --> 1:46:22.840
 I really hate marketers.

1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:23.800
 Oh, that's good.

1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:25.080
 It's the authenticity dollar.

1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:31.040
 You can't escape this kind of negative marketing thought.

1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:36.840
 And I guess that gets to the issue that I don't want to be

1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:41.960
 destroyed in advance of this election. I don't think it's a

1:46:41.960 --> 1:46:47.400
 good use of my relationship to my audience to be broadcasting

1:46:47.560 --> 1:46:50.960
 how completely ridiculous Donald Trump and Joe Biden are as

1:46:50.960 --> 1:46:53.040
 candidates for the president of the United States.

1:46:53.040 --> 1:46:53.760
 Full stop.

1:46:54.120 --> 1:46:55.600
 None of this makes any sense.

1:46:55.640 --> 1:46:59.160
 These moderators of these pseudo debates were in the wrong

1:46:59.160 --> 1:47:00.880
 format with the wrong people.

1:47:01.480 --> 1:47:04.240
 No part of this makes a wit of sense.

1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:07.200
 Can I try to push back several claims?

1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:15.720
 One is I don't believe the systems as they stand now can

1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:20.160
 destroy their equine voice, the voice you're a child.

1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:24.520
 I'm sorry to say that, but, well, let me, well, it's also

1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:28.280
 possible. It's entirely possible that you're the child.

1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:29.160
 Okay.

1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:33.120
 Because a child would say you would call other people a child.

1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:40.800
 Yeah. Get in the first blow reveal the tell because the only

1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:43.840
 power they have is to attack you psychologically.

1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:44.360
 No.

1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:51.320
 Well, I believe that the army of people that love you is much

1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:57.280
 more powerful than mainstream media, than people that you

1:47:57.280 --> 1:47:59.920
 might hear it say ridiculous things that you just said,

1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:05.400
 which has tried to reduce you, like the marketing thinking.

1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:07.600
 I just believe there's an army.

1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:12.640
 Maybe there's a better term of people that see you for who

1:48:12.640 --> 1:48:16.680
 you are and a hungry, like I'm not disputing those things.

1:48:17.160 --> 1:48:21.120
 And what I'm saying, I would venture to say as your therapist

1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:28.400
 that you're actually, uh, the battle is all in your mind.

1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:33.600
 All in your mind that you have found these demons in the

1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:39.120
 system, and they're just a tiny minority and it's all in your

1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:42.400
 mind. They cannot actually remove.

1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:47.920
 They're not strong enough to remove the voice of Eric Weinstein

1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:49.040
 to silence the voice.

1:48:49.040 --> 1:48:50.080
 I love this.

1:48:51.080 --> 1:48:55.480
 This is some of the best fiction writing I've ever heard.

1:48:55.480 --> 1:49:00.360
 Let me tell you, I have relatives who've known me my entire

1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:04.040
 life, where one article in the New York Times, they will

1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:04.960
 believe that over me.

1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:10.720
 My contention is that it has no power except to affect your

1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:13.600
 psychology. What you have to do is the Rogan thing, which is

1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:15.240
 laugh. Just laugh.

1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:16.680
 I am laughing.

1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:18.040
 I know, but more.

1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:20.040
 I'm telling you something.

1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:20.360
 Yes.

1:49:20.360 --> 1:49:20.800
 Okay.

1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:23.640
 The way this works is through ruin.

1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:27.480
 Ruin can come to anyone.

1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:29.320
 There's no one who cannot be ruined.

1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:35.400
 Every single person is signed up right now to be ruined by

1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:35.960
 the system.

1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:40.520
 Don't you understand that you have more power than the system?

1:49:40.520 --> 1:49:42.760
 You can ruin the system.

1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:45.480
 Your Twitter account, the podcast.

1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:47.560
 I'm telling you about the Army.

1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:50.000
 I agree that my Twitter account, my pocket.

1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:53.000
 But what we've seen, for example, you saw what happened

1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:54.840
 to Brett's Articles of Unity project.

1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:55.840
 Yes.

1:49:55.840 --> 1:49:56.360
 Okay.

1:49:56.360 --> 1:49:59.920
 What happened on the Twitter side?

1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:00.520
 What happened?

1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:03.160
 What happened?

1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:05.120
 Well, actually, say the word and say the word.

1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:07.800
 It was blocked or removed from Twitter.

1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:08.280
 Suspended.

1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:09.400
 Account suspended.

1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:14.360
 And I have a direct line to Jack.

1:50:14.360 --> 1:50:14.720
 Yeah.

1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:15.240
 Okay.

1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:20.160
 So I'm talking to the CEO who I am crazy enough to still

1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:20.680
 believe in.

1:50:20.680 --> 1:50:21.800
 Good.

1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:22.520
 I do, too.

1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:25.720
 I believe somehow there's a very strange thing going on

1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:27.200
 with Jack Dorsey.

1:50:27.200 --> 1:50:32.800
 I cannot possibly reconcile the actions with the person I've...

1:50:32.800 --> 1:50:37.000
 That is a next level mind in there.

1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.800
 I don't know it well enough to say that it's all next level.

1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:41.880
 I'm not claiming he doesn't have any blind spots.

1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:43.840
 Every smart person I know has blind spots.

1:50:43.840 --> 1:50:44.880
 I don't know what he's up against.

1:50:44.880 --> 1:50:46.600
 Blah, blah, blah.

1:50:46.600 --> 1:50:50.040
 There's no way that the Jack Dorsey that I've talked to and

1:50:50.040 --> 1:50:53.720
 the Jack Dorsey that interacted over Articles of Unity can be

1:50:53.720 --> 1:50:55.400
 the same person.

1:50:55.400 --> 1:50:58.040
 He is constrained by that company in some way that

1:50:58.040 --> 1:50:59.320
 doesn't make sense to me.

1:50:59.320 --> 1:51:01.640
 Either that or he's the most duplicitous person on earth and

1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:02.560
 I'm not believing it.

1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:03.560
 I just don't buy it.

1:51:03.560 --> 1:51:04.480
 Okay?

1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:05.480
 Yeah.

1:51:05.480 --> 1:51:07.240
 Something horrible is happening.

1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:14.560
 My claim is I can remove you functionally from the chessboard

1:51:14.560 --> 1:51:18.600
 in a tiny number of moves, no matter who you are, no matter

1:51:18.600 --> 1:51:21.400
 how virtuous or how much of a bastard you've been your entire

1:51:21.400 --> 1:51:25.120
 life, it doesn't take more than three or four moves to

1:51:25.120 --> 1:51:27.800
 basically neuter you as a force.

1:51:27.800 --> 1:51:28.000
 Yeah.

1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:31.520
 And I disagree that if that's possible, that means I'm not

1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:32.840
 very good at chess.

1:51:32.840 --> 1:51:36.680
 Like Unity 2020 was removed from Twitter because it's not

1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:39.720
 good enough, not within the system.

1:51:39.720 --> 1:51:45.080
 Like the army of people that feel the brilliance of the idea

1:51:45.080 --> 1:51:46.400
 was too small.

1:51:46.400 --> 1:51:49.600
 Okay, but fear, uncertainty and doubt is the name of the

1:51:49.600 --> 1:51:51.040
 game, the coin of the realm.

1:51:51.040 --> 1:51:53.680
 Psychology though, it's not real power.

1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:55.160
 It just affects the mind.

1:51:55.160 --> 1:51:57.800
 Okay, I have a reading assignment for you because you're

1:51:57.800 --> 1:52:01.240
 Russian, you'll really enjoy this.

1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:04.920
 As part of the great American tobacco settlement, the Tobacco

1:52:04.920 --> 1:52:08.200
 Institute had to disgorge its archives of all of its

1:52:08.200 --> 1:52:11.680
 strategies, all of its skullduggery and put it on the

1:52:11.680 --> 1:52:15.600
 web for all time so that we can all understand how the tobacco

1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:19.960
 companies got together and destroyed people, right?

1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:22.520
 You see tobacco destroys people.

1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:26.160
 You can see, you know, Scientology destroys people.

1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:31.680
 There are various vindictive organizations that will not

1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:36.880
 tolerate reality in opposition to them.

1:52:36.880 --> 1:52:38.480
 Let's take them down.

1:52:38.480 --> 1:52:39.080
 Okay.

1:52:39.080 --> 1:52:40.320
 That's what I'm trying to tell you is...

1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:41.440
 Okay, no.

1:52:41.440 --> 1:52:43.840
 So why aren't you doing the podcast to return?

1:52:43.840 --> 1:52:49.240
 Because that's one of the weapons of war.

1:52:49.240 --> 1:52:52.680
 Well, first of all, if you're at war, I don't want to

1:52:52.680 --> 1:52:57.880
 discuss strategy on a podcast, right?

1:52:57.880 --> 1:52:59.120
 But that's your misunderstanding.

1:52:59.120 --> 1:53:01.960
 What did Montgomery say about Rommel?

1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:06.120
 But wasn't his line, I read your book, you beautiful bastard.

1:53:06.120 --> 1:53:07.760
 It's like, why are you using the tactics that you

1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:09.560
 already explained?

1:53:09.560 --> 1:53:10.120
 Okay.

1:53:10.120 --> 1:53:13.000
 So one of the things I'm doing is I'm not having a strategic

1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:16.360
 conversation with you and several hundred thousand of

1:53:16.360 --> 1:53:20.360
 our closest friends.

1:53:20.360 --> 1:53:27.280
 I pulled back because this is not the battle that I know

1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:28.640
 what I'm doing.

1:53:28.640 --> 1:53:31.880
 I do not feel passionately enough about defeating Donald

1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:34.760
 Trump to elect Joe Biden, even if that's the way I'm going

1:53:34.760 --> 1:53:39.760
 to ultimately vote, right?

1:53:39.760 --> 1:53:42.560
 I don't believe in the Biden Democratic Party.

1:53:42.560 --> 1:53:45.360
 I don't believe in the Trump Republican Party.

1:53:45.360 --> 1:53:48.480
 So, yes, it's an incredibly consequential election.

1:53:48.480 --> 1:53:52.000
 But to me, it's like the Crips and the Bloods and the Latin

1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:56.720
 Kings fighting over the right to extort a business and the

1:53:56.720 --> 1:54:00.520
 business trying to figure out who it wants to do the extorting.

1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:03.360
 But don't you think, listen, there's very few people that

1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:05.760
 are as good with the English language as you.

1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:12.000
 Don't you think it's possible to draw a line in between that

1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:18.520
 finds how we find our common humanity that ensures a better

1:54:18.520 --> 1:54:23.520
 2021 without having to say like Donald Trump is evil or Joe

1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:27.240
 Biden is incompetent or any of that, just somehow draw a

1:54:27.240 --> 1:54:28.240
 beautiful line?

1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:30.520
 I am seeing people in so much pain.

1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:34.320
 This election is chewing up the integrity of everyone who

1:54:34.320 --> 1:54:36.840
 comments on it, Lex.

1:54:36.840 --> 1:54:38.280
 Maybe they're not good enough.

1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:39.280
 They're not good enough.

1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:41.600
 No, but the hope is...

1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:42.600
 Do you believe in me?

1:54:42.600 --> 1:54:43.600
 Yes.

1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:44.600
 You do?

1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:45.600
 Yes.

1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:46.880
 Listen to me very carefully.

1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:51.040
 My spider sense, my intuition that has allowed me to survive

1:54:51.040 --> 1:54:56.240
 in the space, I've been mouthing off since the 80s, tells me

1:54:56.240 --> 1:55:01.520
 this is a super dangerous time for smart people to be spending

1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:06.920
 the dry powder because the election doesn't make sense.

1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:09.640
 Doesn't mean that I don't have a sense that one outcome would

1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:12.400
 be better than the other probably, but the variance on

1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:16.040
 that, I'm not even positive that I'm right.

1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:20.040
 These two options are so completely inappropriate to the

1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:22.640
 world of 2020.

1:55:22.640 --> 1:55:26.040
 What we need is so diametrically opposed to more boomers and

1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:30.460
 more silent generation people trying to sort out a highly

1:55:30.460 --> 1:55:36.160
 technical world being mediated through social media.

1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:37.760
 We need more exclusion.

1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:39.880
 We need more actual elites.

1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:42.400
 The people we've called the elites are not the elite.

1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:43.400
 They need to go.

1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:44.400
 Yeah.

1:55:44.400 --> 1:55:45.880
 We need excellence, competence.

1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:49.440
 We need people who can be trusted behind closed doors and we need

1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:55.040
 to close the doors so we can't see what those people are doing.

1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:56.040
 Here's the thing.

1:55:56.040 --> 1:55:59.680
 Imagine that you had a bunch of people who'd all seen action

1:55:59.680 --> 1:56:03.560
 in combat, had all volunteered to be part of the armed services,

1:56:03.560 --> 1:56:06.160
 had all come from backgrounds where they didn't need to.

1:56:06.160 --> 1:56:09.040
 So you were convinced that these people had put their lives on

1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:12.680
 the line for their country, not for a payday.

1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:15.520
 Imagine you had 10 of these people with technical backgrounds,

1:56:15.520 --> 1:56:22.360
 men, women, black, white, Muslim, Jew, doesn't matter.

1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:26.880
 I would trust those people and I'd close the door.

1:56:26.880 --> 1:56:29.200
 I don't want to know what they talked about.

1:56:29.200 --> 1:56:33.440
 I don't want transparency into all of their negotiations.

1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:36.640
 I want to know that they're patriotic, that they see something in the world

1:56:36.640 --> 1:56:40.080
 bigger than themselves and their family fortunes.

1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:42.400
 I want to know that they're courageous.

1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:45.920
 I want to know that they've got all of our well being and I'm willing

1:56:45.920 --> 1:56:46.920
 to roll the dice.

1:56:46.920 --> 1:56:49.720
 And if they screw us over, I'd rather go down like that.

1:56:49.720 --> 1:56:50.720
 Okay.

1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:53.680
 So I disagree with you there because there's a difference in those

1:56:53.680 --> 1:56:59.480
 and Jocko because you're not speaking to people with credentials.

1:56:59.480 --> 1:57:02.480
 No, I'm talking about self credentialed people.

1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:04.600
 I view Jocko as self credentialed.

1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:08.440
 But the biggest, the powerful thing about Jocko is he's not only self credentialed,

1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:12.840
 but he's been real with people.

1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:17.920
 The magical thing about Jocko isn't his book, isn't his life story is he's been

1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:21.760
 talking on a podcast for a long, there's something real that happens.

1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:22.760
 Okay.

1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:28.000
 So if you took everybody, if you took Dan Crenshaw and Tulsi Gabbard and you took

1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:35.360
 Jocko Willing and maybe Jesse Ventura, right, you can take, you can take Bernie

1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:36.360
 Sanders.

1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:37.360
 Yeah.

1:57:37.360 --> 1:57:38.840
 Who's, you know, a lone voice.

1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:45.080
 You take all of these people who've like really just risked, like why do we trust?

1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:48.920
 Why is Katherine Hepburn the best that Hollywood ever produced?

1:57:48.920 --> 1:57:54.240
 Because she told Hollywood to go fuck itself hard.

1:57:54.240 --> 1:57:58.200
 They gave her four Academy awards and she said, love you, sweeties.

1:57:58.200 --> 1:58:01.560
 I'm going to use them as the doorstop for the bathrooms in my house.

1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:02.560
 See that skill.

1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:05.320
 That's, uh, that's, that's just, that's what you were talking about.

1:58:05.320 --> 1:58:06.320
 Yeah.

1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:07.320
 Be Katherine Hepburn.

1:58:07.320 --> 1:58:11.640
 Audrey Hepburn is pretty amazing, but Katherine Hepburn is next level.

1:58:11.640 --> 1:58:12.640
 Right?

1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:14.680
 Well, you, I mean, that's what you're trying to say to me.

1:58:14.680 --> 1:58:15.680
 Yeah.

1:58:15.680 --> 1:58:16.680
 Okay.

1:58:16.680 --> 1:58:17.680
 I'm trying to figure it out, Lex.

1:58:17.680 --> 1:58:18.680
 Okay.

1:58:18.680 --> 1:58:19.680
 I don't have the answer yet.

1:58:19.680 --> 1:58:23.760
 What I do know is that this election is chewing people up and I mean two separate things.

1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:29.080
 One that parties don't have enough integrity that if you comment either for or against,

1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:33.440
 there's a short sequence where you make a comment that's nuanced.

1:58:33.440 --> 1:58:36.320
 You get referenced to something, right?

1:58:36.320 --> 1:58:41.640
 Like, you know, take this thing about, you know, find people on both sides.

1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:49.080
 That is non resolved after N years, whether the context should be reported or not.

1:58:49.080 --> 1:58:55.060
 We are in some situation in which Democrats and Republicans are primed to fight each other.

1:58:55.060 --> 1:58:59.760
 The way introducing two ants from two different ant colonies always produces a battle.

1:58:59.760 --> 1:59:00.760
 Yeah.

1:59:00.760 --> 1:59:01.760
 Okay.

1:59:01.760 --> 1:59:07.400
 I don't want to be in that fray because those people are going to kill each other mindlessly

1:59:07.400 --> 1:59:08.920
 like robots.

1:59:08.920 --> 1:59:13.720
 And until the election is concluded, like I, do I think this is dire?

1:59:13.720 --> 1:59:14.720
 Yes.

1:59:14.720 --> 1:59:15.720
 Could it be make or break?

1:59:15.720 --> 1:59:16.720
 Absolutely.

1:59:16.720 --> 1:59:17.720
 I'm not saying that.

1:59:17.720 --> 1:59:18.720
 Do I know which way this goes?

1:59:18.720 --> 1:59:22.520
 I can make an excellent argument that we need to elect Joe Biden right now.

1:59:22.520 --> 1:59:26.840
 We've got a situation which can only be cured by voting for Joe Biden.

1:59:26.840 --> 1:59:31.240
 I can make another argument that we could have a situation that can only be cured by

1:59:31.240 --> 1:59:33.620
 defeating Joe Biden right now.

1:59:33.620 --> 1:59:37.400
 And all of the things that the modern democratic party represents.

1:59:37.400 --> 1:59:38.840
 Yeah.

1:59:38.840 --> 1:59:44.740
 I don't have, you know, it's, it's not the lady and the tiger we're choosing between

1:59:44.740 --> 1:59:45.980
 the tiger and the tiger.

1:59:45.980 --> 1:59:48.920
 It's the Sumatran tiger versus the Siberian tiger, right?

1:59:48.920 --> 1:59:54.400
 I'm trying to think, well, which tiger can I, do I have a better chance against, um,

1:59:54.400 --> 2:00:00.440
 the key problem for us politically is that we have to divorce the concept of the center

2:00:00.440 --> 2:00:04.040
 and moderation from kleptocracy.

2:00:04.040 --> 2:00:08.300
 Every time we try to say something like we need more moderate solutions, we need more

2:00:08.300 --> 2:00:10.120
 pluralistic solution.

2:00:10.120 --> 2:00:14.540
 People will say, wow, you just want to hand us right back into the swamp, don't you?

2:00:14.540 --> 2:00:20.740
 The swamp people cause the moderates and the swamp people are the same people, right?

2:00:20.740 --> 2:00:23.200
 So then we have these two crazy wings.

2:00:23.200 --> 2:00:25.320
 We can't have crazy right wing people.

2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:27.880
 I don't want any Tiki torch BS.

2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:29.560
 We can't have crazy left wing.

2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:32.000
 Don't attack my courthouse.

2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:35.240
 Really don't attack my courthouse and we can't have moderates.

2:00:35.240 --> 2:00:39.480
 It's like, okay, how do we install our children and, and rape pillage and get these speaking

2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:44.680
 fees when we're out of office and become, you know, cozy with the things when we're

2:00:44.680 --> 2:00:49.240
 supposed to be regulating them and then, you know, become their lobbyists, you know, immediately

2:00:49.240 --> 2:00:54.120
 when we leave office, all of this stuff, we need an entirely different system.

2:00:54.120 --> 2:00:57.200
 And I can't talk about that at the moment.

2:00:57.200 --> 2:01:01.080
 When I talk, people say, oh wow, so you're going to sit this one out cause you're a pussy

2:01:01.080 --> 2:01:02.760
 because you're a coward.

2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:03.760
 Great to know Eric.

2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:06.160
 We thought better of you by click.

2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:07.500
 I don't know what to do.

2:01:07.500 --> 2:01:10.440
 But are you thinking of what to do?

2:01:10.440 --> 2:01:11.440
 Yeah.

2:01:11.440 --> 2:01:13.680
 Oh, you better believe it.

2:01:13.680 --> 2:01:20.440
 Look, Brett, Brett had this idea of unity 2020 and I told him it was a wrong idea.

2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:23.160
 I didn't tell him that unity 2024 was a wrong idea.

2:01:23.160 --> 2:01:25.860
 I didn't tell him that unity 2028 is a wrong idea.

2:01:25.860 --> 2:01:29.360
 And if I were to make the case that he was right and I was wrong, cause he's now shuttered

2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:31.840
 the thing, right?

2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:36.200
 I would say that the case to be made that he was correct was, is that by doing this

2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:39.500
 in 2020, we found out what we were up against.

2:01:39.500 --> 2:01:43.940
 It's good to know that Twitter can turn this off at the drop of a hat.

2:01:43.940 --> 2:01:45.200
 Great to know.

2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:53.140
 It's good to know as we learned that you cannot have meetings of vice of presidential candidates

2:01:53.140 --> 2:01:59.620
 in a primary that are not approved of by the party, right?

2:01:59.620 --> 2:02:03.180
 Like they've got this thing figured out so we don't have any way in.

2:02:03.180 --> 2:02:09.560
 And now unity 2024 makes sense because unity 2020 was tried.

2:02:09.560 --> 2:02:10.560
 Okay.

2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:16.400
 I don't know that we get to 2024 under all circumstances and some we do and some we don't.

2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:20.620
 There's, there's a game theoretic thing that I'm not sure you're accounting for, but you,

2:02:20.620 --> 2:02:21.620
 you probably are.

2:02:21.620 --> 2:02:32.700
 But let me just make an argument is Jack Dorsey very likely listens to your podcasts and wait,

2:02:32.700 --> 2:02:34.700
 this is the power of these words.

2:02:34.700 --> 2:02:41.980
 Something deep went wrong, but we can change it with the power of words.

2:02:41.980 --> 2:02:44.060
 Something went wrong at Twitter.

2:02:44.060 --> 2:02:46.100
 They have so much division on their platform.

2:02:46.100 --> 2:02:47.180
 That's what I'm trying to say.

2:02:47.180 --> 2:02:48.620
 They've gotten, it's not wrong.

2:02:48.620 --> 2:02:50.460
 They just don't know they're understaffed.

2:02:50.460 --> 2:02:53.900
 No, they have an insoluble problem.

2:02:53.900 --> 2:02:54.900
 Difficult to solve.

2:02:54.900 --> 2:02:55.900
 They have an insoluble problem.

2:02:55.900 --> 2:03:00.580
 This is where you and I disagree because, well, all right, I'd like to create a competitor.

2:03:00.580 --> 2:03:05.860
 So then, you know, give it to me, create the competitor, show me that you actually have

2:03:05.860 --> 2:03:10.100
 understood this because my guess is, is that most of the things that you'll think about,

2:03:10.100 --> 2:03:13.580
 I mean, I can tell you things I've talked to Jack about, which I know would make Twitter

2:03:13.580 --> 2:03:15.580
 much better.

2:03:15.580 --> 2:03:23.220
 However, I, I think that this problem of instantaneous communication across the planet and you subtract

2:03:23.220 --> 2:03:28.380
 off all sorts of context and mutual self knowledge, the problem is us.

2:03:28.380 --> 2:03:29.940
 It's not the platforms.

2:03:29.940 --> 2:03:34.500
 We're thinking about a technological solution and I'm saying the problem is, is that we

2:03:34.500 --> 2:03:37.140
 are ultimately the product.

2:03:37.140 --> 2:03:40.140
 And I just disagree with that and there's a lot of, that's probably could save that

2:03:40.140 --> 2:03:41.140
 for tomorrow.

2:03:41.140 --> 2:03:47.060
 I look forward to spending summers in your villa when you, when you debut this product

2:03:47.060 --> 2:03:50.580
 and I would love to angel invest in it.

2:03:50.580 --> 2:03:54.860
 By the way, in terms of money, I'll never have a villa.

2:03:54.860 --> 2:03:55.860
 Yeah.

2:03:55.860 --> 2:03:58.500
 No, I will always give away everything I own.

2:03:58.500 --> 2:04:01.460
 No, sorry.

2:04:01.460 --> 2:04:06.420
 Invest into like things like you mentioned, awesome things.

2:04:06.420 --> 2:04:12.620
 Invest fine, but a little bit of a vuncular advice.

2:04:12.620 --> 2:04:20.340
 Don't pledge to be the person who disgorges themselves of security.

2:04:20.340 --> 2:04:21.900
 Money is freedom.

2:04:21.900 --> 2:04:22.900
 That's what it is.

2:04:22.900 --> 2:04:25.700
 It's a big hunking pile of freedom.

2:04:25.700 --> 2:04:26.700
 Okay.

2:04:26.700 --> 2:04:30.460
 You can choose to use it as the freedom to imprison you if you don't, you know, so you

2:04:30.460 --> 2:04:33.740
 can use it as freedom to make yourself a prisoner of your money.

2:04:33.740 --> 2:04:39.740
 But generally speaking, Lex money is freedom and your voice is important.

2:04:39.740 --> 2:04:46.260
 At least retain the amount of money security you need to follow Joe's advice.

2:04:46.260 --> 2:04:51.460
 What is the point of f you money if you don't say f you, the number of people who have f

2:04:51.460 --> 2:04:56.260
 you money who don't say f you indicates the number of people who chose the freedom of

2:04:56.260 --> 2:04:59.140
 their wealth to create a prison.

2:04:59.140 --> 2:05:03.980
 They built a prison with the freedom they had and they walked into it, locked the door.

2:05:03.980 --> 2:05:06.640
 I think it's too difficult not to create it.

2:05:06.640 --> 2:05:09.820
 The reason I want to give away the money is because I just know my own psychology and

2:05:09.820 --> 2:05:11.980
 you create prisons.

2:05:11.980 --> 2:05:19.780
 Our human mind just creates those prisons that f you money is enough for basic shelter

2:05:19.780 --> 2:05:20.780
 and basic food.

2:05:20.780 --> 2:05:23.680
 That's, that's the optimal if you don't have kids yet.

2:05:23.680 --> 2:05:25.860
 This is a, okay, this is the problem.

2:05:25.860 --> 2:05:26.860
 This is why I'm sitting.

2:05:26.860 --> 2:05:32.800
 So this is me, single Lex speaking, but future Lex, future Lex.

2:05:32.800 --> 2:05:38.180
 I'm talking to future Lex, single, single present Lex, please don't listen.

2:05:38.180 --> 2:05:39.180
 Don't be an ass.

2:05:39.180 --> 2:05:44.540
 You're going to need some money and don't make these pledges to say on a podcast.

2:05:44.540 --> 2:05:47.020
 I'm saying I want to save you from yourself.

2:05:47.020 --> 2:05:51.940
 You need money to do many of the beautiful things that we're counting on you to do.

2:05:51.940 --> 2:05:56.860
 Don't F it up.

2:05:56.860 --> 2:05:58.780
 Can I talk to you about Roger Penrose?

2:05:58.780 --> 2:05:59.780
 Sure.

2:05:59.780 --> 2:06:05.740
 You've talked to Roger on the portal, but also in between the lines and offline, just

2:06:05.740 --> 2:06:09.660
 everything you've said about Roger Penrose for people who don't know.

2:06:09.660 --> 2:06:18.200
 He just recently, a few days ago, won the 2020 shared the 2020 Nobel prize for physics,

2:06:18.200 --> 2:06:24.500
 but it's clear to me that he had like a deep personal impact on you, a connection with

2:06:24.500 --> 2:06:30.720
 you in terms of both your love of mathematics, just the way you see the world.

2:06:30.720 --> 2:06:32.660
 This is the Eddie Van Halen conversation.

2:06:32.660 --> 2:06:36.060
 This was clearly somebody who's profound in your worldview.

2:06:36.060 --> 2:06:38.020
 Can you talk about Roger?

2:06:38.020 --> 2:06:43.380
 Can you talk about what it means that he won this highest of prizes just in general?

2:06:43.380 --> 2:06:44.380
 Let's celebrate the man.

2:06:44.380 --> 2:06:45.380
 Yeah.

2:06:45.380 --> 2:06:46.380
 Okay.

2:06:46.380 --> 2:06:47.980
 So first of all, there are two other people who won this prize.

2:06:47.980 --> 2:06:48.980
 I'm sorry.

2:06:48.980 --> 2:06:54.380
 I just didn't happen to know who they were before they won.

2:06:54.380 --> 2:07:02.340
 Roger is a very, it is not Roger in particular, but the class from which Roger comes that

2:07:02.340 --> 2:07:04.340
 is so important.

2:07:04.340 --> 2:07:14.740
 So I would put Roger in the class of Feynman, Einstein, Dirac, Yang, um, put Whitten in

2:07:14.740 --> 2:07:15.740
 there.

2:07:15.740 --> 2:07:24.700
 I mean, Whitten is a special case, but Whitten is weirdly the reverse of the Roger Penrose

2:07:24.700 --> 2:07:25.700
 story, right?

2:07:25.700 --> 2:07:29.580
 Because Whitten is the first physicist to win a mathematical Fields Medal, the highest

2:07:29.580 --> 2:07:32.100
 honor in mathematics.

2:07:32.100 --> 2:07:36.140
 Penrose is in some sense, a mathematician who's now won the Nobel prize.

2:07:36.140 --> 2:07:41.700
 So it's a perfect sort of a couplet.

2:07:41.700 --> 2:07:45.460
 Roger's class means everything to me.

2:07:45.460 --> 2:07:48.300
 That's the highest achievement of the human mind.

2:07:48.300 --> 2:07:56.060
 I would probably throw Bach in with Feynman and Dirac and company, right?

2:07:56.060 --> 2:07:59.400
 I think that he was so inventive.

2:07:59.400 --> 2:08:01.700
 It was very frustrating to watch this career.

2:08:01.700 --> 2:08:06.140
 It was a little bit frustrating to watch Feynman's career.

2:08:06.140 --> 2:08:14.620
 Feynman was so good and had he been born slightly different and a slightly different time, I

2:08:14.620 --> 2:08:21.460
 believe his claim on physics would be far greater.

2:08:21.460 --> 2:08:26.240
 I feel like Penrose in some sense came up a very difficult path because you see Einstein

2:08:26.240 --> 2:08:30.500
 effectively solved most of the most important problems in general relativity right at the

2:08:30.500 --> 2:08:32.060
 beginning.

2:08:32.060 --> 2:08:36.720
 As a result, the children of Einstein are impoverished because there wasn't as much

2:08:36.720 --> 2:08:39.700
 to pick off of the trees and sell at the market.

2:08:39.700 --> 2:08:44.600
 Whereas Bohr and Planck didn't do nearly as good of a job with quantum theory.

2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:47.260
 So there's lots to do in quantum theory.

2:08:47.260 --> 2:08:55.980
 I think that Roger affected me personally by a diagram that I saw in a paper of Herman

2:08:55.980 --> 2:08:58.220
 Gluck at the University of Pennsylvania.

2:08:58.220 --> 2:09:04.860
 It was the first picture I'd ever seen of the Hopf vibration sketched and that weirdly

2:09:04.860 --> 2:09:10.340
 I brought that to the Rogan program in order to sort of convey the wonder.

2:09:10.340 --> 2:09:14.300
 It was recapitulating my own journey.

2:09:14.300 --> 2:09:21.020
 I think I probably saw that at like age 16 or something and it just flipped my mind.

2:09:21.020 --> 2:09:26.980
 Roger is incredibly visual, he's incredibly geometric, he's incredibly sui generis, he

2:09:26.980 --> 2:09:29.340
 just does his own thing.

2:09:29.340 --> 2:09:31.220
 He's got lots of bets.

2:09:31.220 --> 2:09:36.500
 None of them had really come through the way you would hope and I think they stretched

2:09:36.500 --> 2:09:38.860
 the rules to be blunt about it.

2:09:38.860 --> 2:09:39.860
 To give him the prize.

2:09:39.860 --> 2:09:40.860
 Yeah, I do.

2:09:40.860 --> 2:09:46.140
 You said this thing on Twitter which is beautiful that every once in a while comes a human being

2:09:46.140 --> 2:09:52.700
 that gives value to the prize versus the prize giving value to the human.

2:09:52.700 --> 2:09:54.060
 Two different kinds of prizes.

2:09:54.060 --> 2:09:59.340
 The reason that we care about the Nobel Prize isn't because of Alfred Nobel.

2:09:59.340 --> 2:10:10.460
 It's because it came along at the right time to reward Einstein, Dirac, Schrodinger, Feynman.

2:10:10.460 --> 2:10:15.160
 Most of the people who should have won, won.

2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:21.700
 Most of the awards are not good in the sense that they don't really follow.

2:10:21.700 --> 2:10:26.820
 The prize is used to rewrite history, that's the problem.

2:10:26.820 --> 2:10:30.760
 You should have a love hate relationship with it because on the one hand it does focus the

2:10:30.760 --> 2:10:35.140
 world on what really matters and on the other hand it distorts what really matters and both

2:10:35.140 --> 2:10:38.120
 of those functions take place simultaneously.

2:10:38.120 --> 2:10:44.700
 In this case, I think that they violated their own rules slightly so it wasn't really clearly

2:10:44.700 --> 2:10:50.540
 a case of a prediction and a discovery in the typical fashion.

2:10:50.540 --> 2:10:56.420
 We better give this award to somebody of that highest caliber to make sure that the prize

2:10:56.420 --> 2:10:59.980
 is fully funded with prestige going forward.

2:10:59.980 --> 2:11:04.420
 That's sort of my weird speculative guess as to what happened.

2:11:04.420 --> 2:11:10.900
 So Roger's getting on in years and the person should be alive so I think they bent the rules

2:11:10.900 --> 2:11:14.700
 and I think they couldn't have bent it for a better person and I hope they will not bend

2:11:14.700 --> 2:11:18.580
 the rules out of weakness but out of strength in the future.

2:11:18.580 --> 2:11:26.140
 It would be great to get Madame Wu and Emmy Nerder a posthumous prize along with Doug

2:11:26.140 --> 2:11:35.060
 Prasher, George Sudarshan and George Zweig as well as Ernst Stuckelberg Nobel Prizes.

2:11:35.060 --> 2:11:42.780
 There have been some terrible omissions, the first two being females who revolutionized

2:11:42.780 --> 2:11:50.300
 our view of the world and I take a very dim view of people pushing for prizes for people

2:11:50.300 --> 2:11:55.320
 from ethnic groups or genders or whatever in order to make it plural and inclusive.

2:11:55.320 --> 2:11:59.900
 If it's not following the work and I feel very clear that in a few cases we know there

2:11:59.900 --> 2:12:06.220
 was a real problem with the Nobel committee because we have stunning accomplishments and

2:12:06.220 --> 2:12:11.460
 try to get through a day as a physicist with that Nerder's theorem and try to imagine the

2:12:11.460 --> 2:12:16.500
 universe without Madame Wu's discovery that left and right don't appear to be symmetric.

2:12:16.500 --> 2:12:23.460
 I mean these are terrible omissions and they're a huge blot on science for not being more

2:12:23.460 --> 2:12:25.540
 inclusive when it matters.

2:12:25.540 --> 2:12:30.300
 Yeah so just like you said the Nobel Prize is plagued by omissions as much as...

2:12:30.300 --> 2:12:31.620
 And distortions and dilutions.

2:12:31.620 --> 2:12:35.940
 For example, Dirac and Schrodinger were I believe given the prize in the same year.

2:12:35.940 --> 2:12:39.380
 There's no reason that those two people needed to dilute each other.

2:12:39.380 --> 2:12:45.660
 The same thing with you know Dyson was an omission, Tominaga probably got included in

2:12:45.660 --> 2:12:50.260
 part because we had an opportunity to show that something had happened on both sides

2:12:50.260 --> 2:12:53.780
 of the Pacific after the war.

2:12:53.780 --> 2:13:00.500
 But I don't think we needed to dilute Weinberg or Feynman or Schwinger.

2:13:00.500 --> 2:13:01.900
 It makes me somewhat sick.

2:13:01.900 --> 2:13:07.020
 All of these people are such important giants and it has to do with the field I think not

2:13:07.020 --> 2:13:12.740
 wanting to create luminaries and superstars who could have defended the field from budget

2:13:12.740 --> 2:13:14.980
 cuts and worldly pressures.

2:13:14.980 --> 2:13:20.820
 So I think it's really important that we have absolute superstars because we produce superstars.

2:13:20.820 --> 2:13:26.180
 We acknowledge them, we don't dilute them and that we bend the rules to make sure that

2:13:26.180 --> 2:13:33.100
 the prize stays funded with the prestige that comes from giving it to the Roger Penrose's,

2:13:33.100 --> 2:13:36.740
 Albert Einstein's and Paul Dirac's of the world.

2:13:36.740 --> 2:13:39.820
 Can we talk a little bit about evil?

2:13:39.820 --> 2:13:41.020
 Sure.

2:13:41.020 --> 2:13:49.540
 I haven't actually talked to you about this topic and it's been sitting on my mind mostly

2:13:49.540 --> 2:13:56.700
 because everybody at MIT is quiet about it, which is Jeffrey Epstein.

2:13:56.700 --> 2:14:02.380
 I didn't get a chance to experience what MIT was like at the time when Jeffrey Epstein

2:14:02.380 --> 2:14:15.320
 was part of this, but I'd love to try to understand how evil was allowed to flourish in a place

2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:18.860
 that I love.

2:14:18.860 --> 2:14:24.380
 Whether you think, maybe let me ask the question this way.

2:14:24.380 --> 2:14:35.420
 Was it the man evil or was the system evil or is evil too strong a word?

2:14:35.420 --> 2:14:44.920
 Because what I see is the presence of this particular human being in the eyes of many

2:14:44.920 --> 2:14:55.380
 destroyed the reputations of many really strong scientists and also weakened the ability,

2:14:55.380 --> 2:15:04.060
 like weakened the institution of MIT by making everybody quiet, like almost making them unable

2:15:04.060 --> 2:15:09.620
 to say anything interesting or difficult.

2:15:09.620 --> 2:15:14.380
 And what is that and what am I supposed to?

2:15:14.380 --> 2:15:15.380
 We don't know.

2:15:15.380 --> 2:15:18.140
 Why is everyone quiet about Jeff?

2:15:18.140 --> 2:15:19.140
 We don't know.

2:15:19.140 --> 2:15:22.500
 Obviously I want to scream about it too, right?

2:15:22.500 --> 2:15:26.460
 And I probably have said too much about Jeffrey Epstein.

2:15:26.460 --> 2:15:29.500
 Look, something horrible happened.

2:15:29.500 --> 2:15:34.740
 I don't know what it is, but something horrible happened.

2:15:34.740 --> 2:15:40.100
 And you know, at the one thing that, okay, let's just do this.

2:15:40.100 --> 2:15:47.420
 The first thing I need to do is I need to get rid of this woke crap about power differentials.

2:15:47.420 --> 2:15:54.980
 In general, you can talk about hypergamy and power differentials are Russell conjugates

2:15:54.980 --> 2:16:01.300
 of the same concept, just the way particular proportions and symmetries are mathematically

2:16:01.300 --> 2:16:08.000
 provable to be attractive in females to males.

2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:14.220
 Male attractiveness is largely determined by male competence and ability to amass power

2:16:14.220 --> 2:16:18.220
 and success and all these sorts of things.

2:16:18.220 --> 2:16:25.300
 The relationship between consenting adults is quite frankly not something I want to sort

2:16:25.300 --> 2:16:33.880
 out the relationship between the sexuality of adults and minors.

2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:46.660
 And particularly, you know, there's the 17, 18 issue that's very different than 12, 13.

2:16:46.660 --> 2:16:52.620
 We're talking about really sick depravity with respect to what it appears that Jeffrey

2:16:52.620 --> 2:16:56.220
 Epstein was involved in at some level.

2:16:56.220 --> 2:17:01.260
 I believe this story is super complicated in part because I think one thing Jeffrey

2:17:01.260 --> 2:17:09.900
 Epstein was doing was providing money, encouragement, and support to scientists.

2:17:09.900 --> 2:17:15.820
 Another thing he was doing, I believe, was giving tax advice to very rich people.

2:17:15.820 --> 2:17:26.320
 I believe another thing he was doing was hooking very wealthy people up with young adult females.

2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:36.300
 Another thing he was doing, I think, was doing stuff with children that will curl your toes.

2:17:36.300 --> 2:17:39.780
 So there's an entire spectrum of different stuff.

2:17:39.780 --> 2:17:46.100
 And at the moment, nobody can pull apart or deconflate anything because the woke thing

2:17:46.100 --> 2:17:54.020
 comes over it and says, I think it's disgusting that a 43 year old billionaire would be partying

2:17:54.020 --> 2:17:58.540
 with a 23 year old.

2:17:58.540 --> 2:18:00.100
 I don't want to adjudicate that.

2:18:00.100 --> 2:18:05.020
 I'm worried about 12 and 14 year olds that we're not talking about.

2:18:05.020 --> 2:18:08.460
 I don't think MIT was deep into pedophilia.

2:18:08.460 --> 2:18:10.460
 My guess is that that did not happen.

2:18:10.460 --> 2:18:18.260
 I don't think that the scientists were the targets of the really sick depraved stuff.

2:18:18.260 --> 2:18:19.900
 It's my guess.

2:18:19.900 --> 2:18:24.940
 My guess is that what you're looking at was a government construct.

2:18:24.940 --> 2:18:28.500
 It may have been our government, it may have been a joint government project, maybe somebody

2:18:28.500 --> 2:18:29.500
 else's government.

2:18:29.500 --> 2:18:31.300
 I don't know.

2:18:31.300 --> 2:18:37.140
 I believe that in part, we don't really understand Robert Maxwell.

2:18:37.140 --> 2:18:39.580
 Sorry, who's Robert Maxwell?

2:18:39.580 --> 2:18:44.700
 Ghislaine Maxwell's father was very active in scientific publishing.

2:18:44.700 --> 2:18:46.500
 I don't know where peer review came from.

2:18:46.500 --> 2:18:50.300
 I would love to run down the relationship between peer review and Robert Maxwell.

2:18:50.300 --> 2:18:56.100
 I would love to run down the missing fortune of Robert Maxwell and the mysterious fortune

2:18:56.100 --> 2:19:00.700
 of Jeffrey Epstein because I don't think Jeffrey Epstein ever ran a hedge fund.

2:19:00.700 --> 2:19:04.900
 I don't think he was a money advisor the way people claimed.

2:19:04.900 --> 2:19:06.540
 There's two things I want to talk about.

2:19:06.540 --> 2:19:14.060
 One is the shallow conversations of woke identity politics that you're referring to seems to

2:19:14.060 --> 2:19:22.140
 be removing everyone's ability, no, everyone's willingness to talk about like, what the hell

2:19:22.140 --> 2:19:25.260
 is this person and how is he allowed?

2:19:25.260 --> 2:19:30.180
 Most importantly, how do we prevent it in the future?

2:19:30.180 --> 2:19:36.060
 From the individual perspective, the question for me is the same question I ask about 1930s

2:19:36.060 --> 2:19:37.060
 Nazi Germany.

2:19:37.060 --> 2:19:41.700
 I've been reading way too much probably or not enough about that period currently.

2:19:41.700 --> 2:19:47.260
 If I was in Germany at that time, what is the heroic action to take?

2:19:47.260 --> 2:19:51.620
 When I think about MIT with Jeffrey Epstein, what is the heroic action to take?

2:19:51.620 --> 2:19:53.420
 We're not talking about virtue signaling action.

2:19:53.420 --> 2:19:54.600
 You wouldn't know what to do.

2:19:54.600 --> 2:19:57.060
 I would not know what you're up against, Lex.

2:19:57.060 --> 2:19:58.840
 You're not hearing me.

2:19:58.840 --> 2:20:02.140
 The problem here is what was Jeffrey Epstein?

2:20:02.140 --> 2:20:05.940
 Well, that question might be the heroic action to take.

2:20:05.940 --> 2:20:06.940
 That's all I'm trying to say.

2:20:06.940 --> 2:20:08.340
 I'm just trying to get my first question.

2:20:08.340 --> 2:20:10.980
 You have to map the silence with Jeffrey Epstein.

2:20:10.980 --> 2:20:16.020
 What you're describing is a map of the silence at MIT.

2:20:16.020 --> 2:20:24.140
 Well, is there a map of the silence in Washington state around Jeffrey Epstein, the Bay Area,

2:20:24.140 --> 2:20:26.180
 New York City?

2:20:26.180 --> 2:20:31.600
 The amount of silence around Jeffrey Epstein should be telling you everything.

2:20:31.600 --> 2:20:36.500
 The number of dogs that don't bark is like nothing we've ever seen.

2:20:36.500 --> 2:20:40.340
 You're exactly correct, but I want to know what is it telling us?

2:20:40.340 --> 2:20:49.620
 Because what it's telling me is not some kind of conspiracy, but more a disappointing weakness.

2:20:49.620 --> 2:20:50.620
 Not some kind of conspiracy?

2:20:50.620 --> 2:20:52.900
 It's not some kind of conspiracy, but...

2:20:52.900 --> 2:20:55.060
 You've got to be kidding.

2:20:55.060 --> 2:20:58.820
 You're so afraid of saying the word conspiracy that you don't think it's a conspiracy?

2:20:58.820 --> 2:21:04.660
 I personally, I just think it's people who I thought were my heroes just being weak.

2:21:04.660 --> 2:21:06.020
 No.

2:21:06.020 --> 2:21:08.180
 Be of good cheer, sir.

2:21:08.180 --> 2:21:09.180
 A cheer?

2:21:09.180 --> 2:21:10.180
 Be of good cheer.

2:21:10.180 --> 2:21:11.180
 Be of good cheer.

2:21:11.180 --> 2:21:12.180
 Yeah.

2:21:12.180 --> 2:21:13.180
 You think that there's a conspiracy?

2:21:13.180 --> 2:21:15.180
 I think there is a conspiracy.

2:21:15.180 --> 2:21:18.460
 That'd be a very impressive one.

2:21:18.460 --> 2:21:20.180
 That's the scale of it.

2:21:20.180 --> 2:21:25.580
 I tend to believe that large scale can only be an emergent phenomena.

2:21:25.580 --> 2:21:26.580
 Really?

2:21:26.580 --> 2:21:27.580
 I find this so fascinating.

2:21:27.580 --> 2:21:28.580
 Yeah.

2:21:28.580 --> 2:21:35.140
 Because I always see you as like a logic and love drive your soul.

2:21:35.140 --> 2:21:36.140
 You're very logical.

2:21:36.140 --> 2:21:37.140
 You're relentless.

2:21:37.140 --> 2:21:38.660
 You've got a lot of love in your heart.

2:21:38.660 --> 2:21:41.780
 I believe that if you would review the video, where is it from?

2:21:41.780 --> 2:21:47.180
 Dubai or Abu Dhabi of the mysterious hit on the hotel guest?

2:21:47.180 --> 2:21:48.180
 You ever seen this thing?

2:21:48.180 --> 2:21:49.180
 No.

2:21:49.180 --> 2:21:50.180
 What happened?

2:21:50.180 --> 2:21:57.460
 It's the assassination in 2010, 10 years ago, of Mahmoud Al Mabou, something like that,

2:21:57.460 --> 2:22:07.580
 in Dubai where I believe 26 separate individuals on multiple teams are shown converging coming

2:22:07.580 --> 2:22:15.440
 in from all over the world on false passports, pretending to be tennis players or business

2:22:15.440 --> 2:22:19.740
 people or vacationers.

2:22:19.740 --> 2:22:27.940
 All of these teams have different functions and they murder this guy in his hotel room.

2:22:27.940 --> 2:22:35.180
 The Dubai, I guess, chief of police or security officer was so angered that he put together

2:22:35.180 --> 2:22:39.740
 this amazing video that says, we can completely detail what you did.

2:22:39.740 --> 2:22:42.640
 We caught you on closed circuit TV.

2:22:42.640 --> 2:22:46.860
 We don't know exactly who you are because your disguises and your false passports, but

2:22:46.860 --> 2:22:51.100
 yeah, 26 people converged to kill one.

2:22:51.100 --> 2:22:53.520
 No, I don't believe you.

2:22:53.520 --> 2:23:02.820
 I don't believe after COINTELPRO and Operation Paperclip and Operation Mockingbird.

2:23:02.820 --> 2:23:07.620
 I don't know whether I should even bring up Rex 84.

2:23:07.620 --> 2:23:11.660
 To not believe in conspiracies is an idiocy.

2:23:11.660 --> 2:23:18.220
 So you have a sense that evil can be as competent or more competent.

2:23:18.220 --> 2:23:22.660
 First of all, when evil wants to operate at scale, it needs to make sure that people don't

2:23:22.660 --> 2:23:25.140
 try to figure out evil.

2:23:25.140 --> 2:23:32.380
 When evil operates at scale, from first principles, you have to realize that evil must not want

2:23:32.380 --> 2:23:35.140
 it investigated.

2:23:35.140 --> 2:23:42.200
 The most efficient way to keep yourself from being investigated, if you are an evil institutional

2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:47.700
 player who needs to do this repeatedly, is to invest in a world in which no one can afford

2:23:47.700 --> 2:23:49.940
 to say the word conspiracy.

2:23:49.940 --> 2:23:54.500
 You'll notice that there is a special radioactivity around the word conspiracy.

2:23:54.500 --> 2:23:56.140
 We have provable conspiracies.

2:23:56.140 --> 2:23:57.820
 We have admitted to conspiracies.

2:23:57.820 --> 2:24:00.020
 You have been invited to conspiracy.

2:24:00.020 --> 2:24:01.260
 There is no shortage.

2:24:01.260 --> 2:24:02.860
 Conspiracies are everywhere.

2:24:02.860 --> 2:24:04.220
 Some of them are mundane.

2:24:04.220 --> 2:24:11.740
 Some of them are like price fixing cartels, or trade groups, or generally speaking, conspiracies.

2:24:11.740 --> 2:24:19.540
 So the first thing you have to realize is that all of us are in a memetic complex where

2:24:19.540 --> 2:24:23.940
 you can be taken off the chessboard by saying, conspiracy theorists, get done.

2:24:23.940 --> 2:24:25.000
 It's like a one line proof.

2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:26.220
 We don't have to listen to Lex.

2:24:26.220 --> 2:24:30.500
 He said he was a conspiracy theorist on this show.

2:24:30.500 --> 2:24:32.600
 That is partially distorting our conversation.

2:24:32.600 --> 2:24:37.060
 If you want to ask me about Jeffrey Epstein, you have to agree with me that that is a logical

2:24:37.060 --> 2:24:41.220
 description of what you would have to have if you wanted to commit conspiracies is that

2:24:41.220 --> 2:24:46.380
 you have to make sure that people are dissuaded from investigating this.

2:24:46.380 --> 2:24:53.300
 But it's a fascinatingly difficult idea then because the world with conspiracy theories

2:24:53.300 --> 2:24:58.900
 and the world without conspiracy theories to the shallow glance looks the same.

2:24:58.900 --> 2:25:00.160
 Well, my point.

2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:08.460
 There is responsible conspiracy theorize where you look at the history of unearthed conspiracies

2:25:08.460 --> 2:25:12.460
 and just like you would with any other topic, just think about how different the rules in

2:25:12.460 --> 2:25:20.100
 your mind are for conspiracy theorizing versus X theorizing where X can be anything, right?

2:25:20.100 --> 2:25:28.420
 It's like if I say to you, um, I can say the statement that average weight is not the same

2:25:28.420 --> 2:25:31.940
 between widely separated populations.

2:25:31.940 --> 2:25:37.660
 You'd say, yeah, I'd say average height is not the same between widely separated populations.

2:25:37.660 --> 2:25:38.660
 You'd say, yeah.

2:25:38.660 --> 2:25:44.700
 Then I say, in fact, no continuous variable that has that shows variation should be expected

2:25:44.700 --> 2:25:46.780
 to be identical between widely separate.

2:25:46.780 --> 2:25:52.300
 Of course they're like IQ, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, right?

2:25:52.300 --> 2:25:56.800
 So we have a violent reaction to specific topics.

2:25:56.800 --> 2:26:02.940
 So the first thing I want to do is just to notice that conspiracy has that built into

2:26:02.940 --> 2:26:05.240
 everyone's mind.

2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:06.620
 That's really important to state.

2:26:06.620 --> 2:26:13.100
 Yeah, that's, it's very interesting that, and as a prerequisite, as you're saying, that

2:26:13.100 --> 2:26:14.100
 would be the first step.

2:26:14.100 --> 2:26:20.620
 If you wanted to pull off a conspiracy in a competent way, that's, you would have to

2:26:20.620 --> 2:26:21.620
 first convince the world.

2:26:21.620 --> 2:26:27.500
 I just watched the film 1971 about my favorite conspiracy of all time, I highly recommend

2:26:27.500 --> 2:26:34.680
 it 1971 well, the film is entitled 1971 and it's about the citizens committee to investigate

2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:43.000
 the FBI, which was a run by a student of Murray Gelman, a physicist and broke into FBI offices

2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:48.800
 in Pennsylvania to steal files, which allowed freedom of information requests that discovered

2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:49.800
 a huge conspiracy.

2:26:49.800 --> 2:26:55.700
 It was a conspiracy that unearthed a conspiracy inside the federal government, a double conspiracy

2:26:55.700 --> 2:27:00.620
 story, which launched multiple conspiracies.

2:27:00.620 --> 2:27:05.620
 I think that the problem with modern Americans is that they are so timid that they don't

2:27:05.620 --> 2:27:10.860
 even learn about the history of conspiracies that we have absolutely proven.

2:27:10.860 --> 2:27:19.360
 So with that done, Jeff Epstein, in my opinion, represented somebody's construction.

2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:21.500
 I don't think that scary to think about.

2:27:21.500 --> 2:27:22.500
 Yeah.

2:27:22.500 --> 2:27:24.940
 Well, what part of the story isn't scary?

2:27:24.940 --> 2:27:31.020
 I in part did something which I imagine may get me destroyed because I was more worried

2:27:31.020 --> 2:27:37.700
 about being destroyed by somebody else I had a conversation with around Jeff Epstein, right?

2:27:37.700 --> 2:27:41.580
 So I'm just trying to like get, let it be known that I don't know anything more than

2:27:41.580 --> 2:27:43.300
 I've already said.

2:27:43.300 --> 2:27:51.600
 Now, your friends at MIT, their problem is that Jeff Epstein showed up as the only person

2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:58.100
 capable of continuing US scientific tradition.

2:27:58.100 --> 2:28:04.260
 You see, the US scientific tradition is a little bit like the Russian.

2:28:04.260 --> 2:28:09.200
 It's combative, okay?

2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:12.460
 And we're a free society and we act like a free society.

2:28:12.460 --> 2:28:15.780
 We're a rich society and we research like we're a rich society.

2:28:15.780 --> 2:28:21.180
 That is historically, and then came the 1970s and William Proxmire and the Golden Fleece

2:28:21.180 --> 2:28:25.540
 Awards and the idea that we have to, we're paying too much and these are welfare queens

2:28:25.540 --> 2:28:28.060
 and lab coats and blah, blah, blah, blah.

2:28:28.060 --> 2:28:31.460
 We need more transparency, more oversight.

2:28:31.460 --> 2:28:37.480
 Everything went to hell and the national culture of US science was lost.

2:28:37.480 --> 2:28:43.420
 The thing that produced all this prosperity and security and power was lost.

2:28:43.420 --> 2:28:52.860
 And then Jeff Epstein shows up and a tiny number of funders, maybe Fred Kavli, maybe

2:28:52.860 --> 2:28:59.660
 Yuri Milner, maybe who else would be in this category?

2:28:59.660 --> 2:29:05.480
 Peter Thiel to an extent, Howard Hughes would be the largest of these things, which has

2:29:05.480 --> 2:29:12.300
 different grant structures than the NIH, gave people a modicum of risk taking ability.

2:29:12.300 --> 2:29:20.060
 Okay, well, when Jeff Epstein showed up, everybody wanted to take risk in science.

2:29:20.060 --> 2:29:24.300
 And suddenly a charismatic billionaire says, hey, I can make that work for you.

2:29:24.300 --> 2:29:27.860
 Here's $100,000, go research something crazy.

2:29:27.860 --> 2:29:34.640
 Well, that money was supposed to be provided by the federal government under the terms

2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:39.100
 of the endless frontier compact between the federal government and the universities and

2:29:39.100 --> 2:29:42.100
 the federal government and the taxpayers Welch.

2:29:42.100 --> 2:29:43.780
 Okay.

2:29:43.780 --> 2:29:50.540
 So that's one place to lay the blame for Jeff Epstein as at the failure of the federal government

2:29:50.540 --> 2:29:53.020
 to honor its commitment.

2:29:53.020 --> 2:29:54.020
 Yeah.

2:29:54.020 --> 2:29:55.020
 Right.

2:29:55.020 --> 2:29:57.960
 So the universities became psychopathic.

2:29:57.960 --> 2:30:02.500
 It's not like everybody doesn't remember what we're supposed to be doing to be moral, but

2:30:02.500 --> 2:30:04.980
 the point was there wasn't enough money to be moral.

2:30:04.980 --> 2:30:11.480
 So it was time to, uh, to eye each other as a source of protein, as I like to say.

2:30:11.480 --> 2:30:17.780
 And in that process, Jeffrey Epstein said, Hey, come to my world.

2:30:17.780 --> 2:30:22.000
 We can do it like we used to do.

2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:28.900
 So in part, my point is, is that almost none of your colleagues at MIT have that kind of

2:30:28.900 --> 2:30:35.760
 religious commitment to science that they're willing to go down with ship science.

2:30:35.760 --> 2:30:41.060
 The Galileo Galilei thing became very important to science because occasionally you just have

2:30:41.060 --> 2:30:48.340
 to say, look, this isn't about me and you, there isn't enough money in the world to buy

2:30:48.340 --> 2:30:53.340
 the kind of legacy I want to leave to this planet.

2:30:53.340 --> 2:30:56.660
 This is one of the great things about science, you know, potentially it's worth dying for

2:30:56.660 --> 2:31:00.500
 yeah.

2:31:00.500 --> 2:31:03.380
 I'm glad you said it.

2:31:03.380 --> 2:31:08.140
 Science is one of the things that is best that's worth dying for.

2:31:08.140 --> 2:31:17.300
 I mean, I'm not eager to martyr myself, but I've certainly risked my health, my fortune,

2:31:17.300 --> 2:31:26.860
 you know, I've, I've destroyed myself economically over science and, um, and my, my, my, my need

2:31:26.860 --> 2:31:30.760
 to oppose these sons of bitches in chaired professorships who are destroying our system

2:31:30.760 --> 2:31:32.940
 along with everyone else.

2:31:32.940 --> 2:31:38.980
 Let me, um, bring in grandmaster into this.

2:31:38.980 --> 2:31:41.620
 Oogway, master Oogway.

2:31:41.620 --> 2:31:45.100
 I think he's a grandmaster.

2:31:45.100 --> 2:31:46.940
 That would make him a chess playing turtle.

2:31:46.940 --> 2:31:52.460
 Well, I've read some wikipedia and she was a master.

2:31:52.460 --> 2:31:58.300
 There's apparently only one grandmaster and that's anyway, is the phrase grandmaster ever

2:31:58.300 --> 2:31:59.300
 uttered in the script?

2:31:59.300 --> 2:32:00.300
 I don't think so.

2:32:00.300 --> 2:32:01.300
 I don't think so.

2:32:01.300 --> 2:32:02.300
 But there's a story.

2:32:02.300 --> 2:32:05.420
 Oh, there's, there's off off script cannon.

2:32:05.420 --> 2:32:08.820
 I'm going to call Glenn burger right now and find out if any of this is true.

2:32:08.820 --> 2:32:09.820
 All right.

2:32:09.820 --> 2:32:16.220
 You're not supposed to call up my journalistic integrity, um, but master Oogway, master Oogway

2:32:16.220 --> 2:32:20.780
 he says a couple of things I'd like to bring up with you.

2:32:20.780 --> 2:32:27.740
 So one as part of a longer quote recommends, uh, that you should, uh, find a battle worth

2:32:27.740 --> 2:32:31.900
 fighting.

2:32:31.900 --> 2:32:35.820
 We've talked about several battles just now.

2:32:35.820 --> 2:32:42.300
 What is the battle worth fighting for, for Eric Weinstein in the next few months, in

2:32:42.300 --> 2:32:43.700
 the next year?

2:32:43.700 --> 2:32:52.940
 There's only one, well, it's, it's the Moses, it's the Moses thing.

2:32:52.940 --> 2:32:53.940
 It's time to go.

2:32:53.940 --> 2:32:54.940
 It's time to leave.

2:32:54.940 --> 2:32:57.100
 This place is over to get off the planet.

2:32:57.100 --> 2:33:03.600
 I, yeah, I, I, I freak people out when I say that, but like, look at your world.

2:33:03.600 --> 2:33:06.460
 You just got introduced to the problem of a virus.

2:33:06.460 --> 2:33:11.420
 Wait, wait till it's fusion devices and you understand what it means to have one interconnected

2:33:11.420 --> 2:33:17.100
 planet with no uncorrelated experiments happening anywhere else.

2:33:17.100 --> 2:33:18.100
 You know?

2:33:18.100 --> 2:33:26.260
 So do you see the foray, your work in physics and maybe like the echoes of it in a ship

2:33:26.260 --> 2:33:28.540
 Elon?

2:33:28.540 --> 2:33:34.880
 Everybody who has a possible plan to avoid what is coming if we don't have one should

2:33:34.880 --> 2:33:41.700
 work on the plan that he, she thinks best, right?

2:33:41.700 --> 2:33:43.880
 So Elon wants to do rockets.

2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:45.020
 People misinterpret me.

2:33:45.020 --> 2:33:51.740
 I meta Eric says, I don't think that's a smart plan.

2:33:51.740 --> 2:33:59.260
 Regular Eric says all people who have hope should do that thing.

2:33:59.260 --> 2:34:00.260
 Yeah.

2:34:00.260 --> 2:34:05.020
 At least it's Mars, man, at least it's the moon and Mars and maybe Titan and whatever.

2:34:05.020 --> 2:34:08.220
 And I don't think it'll work and it doesn't make sense and it looks silly, but that's

2:34:08.220 --> 2:34:09.980
 exactly the kind of fight worth fighting.

2:34:09.980 --> 2:34:14.420
 But it's, it's the kind of fits for the same reason that I went on Brett's unity, 2020

2:34:14.420 --> 2:34:17.200
 thing when I didn't think it had a hope in hell and people are, you know, are making

2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:18.200
 fun of it.

2:34:18.200 --> 2:34:22.640
 It's like, we got to do things that make, that make us feel dumb and silly and childish

2:34:22.640 --> 2:34:24.780
 that it possibly have a hope of working.

2:34:24.780 --> 2:34:25.780
 Okay.

2:34:25.780 --> 2:34:27.260
 So everybody should do something.

2:34:27.260 --> 2:34:31.500
 My version of this, I am the most hopeful about because I wouldn't have chosen to do

2:34:31.500 --> 2:34:37.000
 if I thought that Daniel Schmack did burgers wisdom project was a better hope.

2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:39.000
 I do that.

2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:41.740
 It's more down to earth in a certain way.

2:34:41.740 --> 2:34:43.900
 I just think that it's more probable.

2:34:43.900 --> 2:34:49.540
 Look, we got from a powered flight with the Wright brothers and wind tunnels to sending

2:34:49.540 --> 2:34:55.580
 back images from the surface of Titan via Huygens Cassini in less than a century.

2:34:55.580 --> 2:34:56.580
 Okay.

2:34:56.580 --> 2:35:02.660
 So what we can do if we can change the laws of physics is something we can't even conceive

2:35:02.660 --> 2:35:03.660
 of.

2:35:03.660 --> 2:35:11.900
 It may be that it buys us nothing and at least we'll, we will know why we died on this planet

2:35:11.900 --> 2:35:13.140
 as a small aside.

2:35:13.140 --> 2:35:19.700
 I think this is not the right time to take the full journey, but I feel like you'll guide

2:35:19.700 --> 2:35:22.620
 me like master way did.

2:35:22.620 --> 2:35:24.300
 And I'm the Kung Fu Panda.

2:35:24.300 --> 2:35:27.820
 They only have one conversation.

2:35:27.820 --> 2:35:33.120
 We're on our, like, we didn't, we didn't, well, we're, we're, we're Jews and they weren't.

2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:37.900
 So we talked too much, but the guide doesn't have to be with words.

2:35:37.900 --> 2:35:40.700
 You don't think Poe was Jewish?

2:35:40.700 --> 2:35:41.700
 It's debatable.

2:35:41.700 --> 2:35:46.820
 We'll have to go back to the Wikipedia.

2:35:46.820 --> 2:35:55.600
 Is there, um, that you would guide me through some more intuition about the source code,

2:35:55.600 --> 2:35:58.060
 the source code of our universe.

2:35:58.060 --> 2:36:03.500
 Can you comment on where, since we last spoke, where your thinking has been, has roamed around

2:36:03.500 --> 2:36:08.300
 geometric unity around that work in physics in this fight?

2:36:08.300 --> 2:36:15.460
 I'm trying to figure out when to release it and how, I mean, I've released the video and

2:36:15.460 --> 2:36:19.860
 the video, quite honestly, I think it has a very bizarre reaction.

2:36:19.860 --> 2:36:23.180
 I think one of the things that I've learned from the video, cause the video is coming

2:36:23.180 --> 2:36:31.060
 up on half a million views on YouTube alone to say nothing of the, um, the audio, but

2:36:31.060 --> 2:36:34.740
 yeah, it produced a very strange reaction.

2:36:34.740 --> 2:36:41.460
 One of the things I don't think that I properly understood is that most physicists don't talk

2:36:41.460 --> 2:36:46.700
 in this geometric language.

2:36:46.700 --> 2:36:52.900
 I thought that more of the physics world probably had converted over into manifolds, bundles,

2:36:52.900 --> 2:36:57.180
 differential forms, connections, curvature, tensors, et cetera.

2:36:57.180 --> 2:37:02.260
 And I, I saw a lot of the comments would say things like, I have a PhD in theoretical physics

2:37:02.260 --> 2:37:05.220
 and I'm not even familiar with all of these concepts.

2:37:05.220 --> 2:37:11.980
 And I think that was probably a distortion coming from living in Cambridge, Massachusetts

2:37:11.980 --> 2:37:14.860
 for almost 20 years.

2:37:14.860 --> 2:37:16.340
 So what's the solution to that?

2:37:16.340 --> 2:37:21.300
 Well, I mean, I can make this make as much sense as anybody needs to.

2:37:21.300 --> 2:37:31.300
 My problem is my calculation is that as long as the boomers are still in charge, the same

2:37:31.300 --> 2:37:35.980
 people have these perverse incentives on them where they've invested in these programs that

2:37:35.980 --> 2:37:36.980
 didn't work.

2:37:36.980 --> 2:37:41.860
 So they're extremely hostile and kind of difficult to deal with.

2:37:41.860 --> 2:37:47.300
 The fact that I'm not a physicist, um, has its own set of issues, which is that effectively

2:37:47.300 --> 2:37:48.520
 it's like the hermit kingdom.

2:37:48.520 --> 2:37:55.180
 They don't get any visitors and they don't necessarily want somebody, you know, rolling

2:37:55.180 --> 2:37:56.980
 up and saying, I know how to do physics.

2:37:56.980 --> 2:37:58.300
 So I'm, I'm always very clear.

2:37:58.300 --> 2:38:01.820
 I'm not a physicist.

2:38:01.820 --> 2:38:06.180
 That said, if I wait too long, I don't know that theoretical physics is really going to

2:38:06.180 --> 2:38:12.220
 exist after the boomers because everyone in you, I think you had Wolfram on your program.

2:38:12.220 --> 2:38:16.020
 I don't remember whether he said this to you or Brian Keating, but he said something like

2:38:16.020 --> 2:38:17.260
 everybody got discouraged.

2:38:17.260 --> 2:38:20.820
 It was too hard.

2:38:20.820 --> 2:38:21.820
 Can't do that.

2:38:21.820 --> 2:38:22.820
 Guys.

2:38:22.820 --> 2:38:23.820
 We cannot do that.

2:38:23.820 --> 2:38:27.500
 There's something about the renormalization revolution that innervated the physics community

2:38:27.500 --> 2:38:31.740
 because it taught them just because you can see in this energy regime doesn't mean you

2:38:31.740 --> 2:38:36.300
 can extrapolate somewhere else unless you understand how, you know, coupling constants

2:38:36.300 --> 2:38:41.740
 run and what kind of a UV fixed points exist, blah, blah, blah.

2:38:41.740 --> 2:38:46.020
 Somehow that discouraged people from guessing from believing everything became an effective

2:38:46.020 --> 2:38:47.020
 theory.

2:38:47.020 --> 2:38:51.740
 The beauty of the effective theory wasn't taken to be really the beauty of the universe,

2:38:51.740 --> 2:38:53.420
 just the beauty of an energy level.

2:38:53.420 --> 2:38:58.940
 So I think that renormalization was one of the most important revolutions that ever happened

2:38:58.940 --> 2:38:59.940
 in science.

2:38:59.940 --> 2:39:04.300
 And also its interpretation by the physics community was catastrophic.

2:39:04.300 --> 2:39:10.200
 Well, the story I'm telling myself is that in part I'm waiting for them to get weaker.

2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:12.380
 But on the other hand, I don't know that we have any time left.

2:39:12.380 --> 2:39:19.800
 And so are you also thinking about ways of, uh, you know, you know, the, the podcast medium

2:39:19.800 --> 2:39:24.820
 is revolutionary for public for discourse for what, I mean, I don't even know the right

2:39:24.820 --> 2:39:25.820
 words for it.

2:39:25.820 --> 2:39:30.700
 Are you thinking of revolutionary ideas for re energizing the physics community?

2:39:30.700 --> 2:39:36.980
 So basically for communicating, look, I have a fantasy, okay?

2:39:36.980 --> 2:39:40.040
 My fantasy is that all of these things are the same problem.

2:39:40.040 --> 2:39:46.960
 And it goes back to this thing that I read about in, in Fineman's, um, books about Tartaglia.

2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:50.060
 They asked him this question, like, what's the greatest thing that ever happened in math?

2:39:50.060 --> 2:39:52.900
 And he says, Tartaglia is solution of the cubic.

2:39:52.900 --> 2:39:55.860
 It's just like the weirdest answer.

2:39:55.860 --> 2:39:58.100
 So you're like, okay, I'll bite.

2:39:58.100 --> 2:40:00.380
 Why is it Tartaglia solution of the cubic?

2:40:00.380 --> 2:40:04.260
 And he said, because it was the first time a modern person had done something profound

2:40:04.260 --> 2:40:06.300
 that the ancients had failed to do.

2:40:06.300 --> 2:40:09.460
 I was like, Oh, I got it.

2:40:09.460 --> 2:40:14.460
 It's the thing that opens up new psychology that says maybe things are possible again.

2:40:14.460 --> 2:40:22.500
 It's a new orchard, new orchard, new farmers, new people who can find fruit that they can

2:40:22.500 --> 2:40:23.820
 pick.

2:40:23.820 --> 2:40:27.460
 And once you have one person do that, very often you get many, like one of the things

2:40:27.460 --> 2:40:29.660
 that we were talking about with Eddie Van Halen.

2:40:29.660 --> 2:40:35.260
 The reason that he created a revolution and somebody like Roy Buchanan did not is that

2:40:35.260 --> 2:40:36.960
 you could follow Eddie Van Halen.

2:40:36.960 --> 2:40:38.220
 You couldn't pioneer it.

2:40:38.220 --> 2:40:42.340
 And maybe you couldn't play as well and as cleanly and as fast and as inventively, but

2:40:42.340 --> 2:40:47.180
 you could follow once you understand that there is a tapping principle.

2:40:47.180 --> 2:40:53.340
 It was just the beginning of something called percussive guitar.

2:40:53.340 --> 2:41:00.300
 My belief is that once we start innovating in the present, everything will come because

2:41:00.300 --> 2:41:04.820
 everything that around us is screwed up on that.

2:41:04.820 --> 2:41:10.580
 Let me with one last question, bring back master Oogway, the probably the most famous

2:41:10.580 --> 2:41:17.660
 quote of his, right, with yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery, but today is a gift.

2:41:17.660 --> 2:41:20.660
 That is why it is called the present.

2:41:20.660 --> 2:41:21.660
 It's very beautiful.

2:41:21.660 --> 2:41:27.420
 Although I would have gone with quit, don't quit, noodles, don't noodles.

2:41:27.420 --> 2:41:33.420
 I feel like people need to know way too much context for that to make sense.

2:41:33.420 --> 2:41:34.420
 It's your audience.

2:41:34.420 --> 2:41:35.740
 To hell with context.

2:41:35.740 --> 2:41:36.740
 Yep.

2:41:36.740 --> 2:41:37.740
 They'll figure it out.

2:41:37.740 --> 2:41:41.820
 Let me ask, what are you grateful for today?

2:41:41.820 --> 2:41:44.060
 What is your present?

2:41:44.060 --> 2:41:52.020
 We've talked about a lot of dark things, but what brings you joy to your heart that I can't

2:41:52.020 --> 2:41:55.420
 believe I'm lucky enough to have this?

2:41:55.420 --> 2:42:04.420
 You know, Nyla and Zev, my wife, Pia, the fact that we've got our health, all the little

2:42:04.420 --> 2:42:08.460
 things, saying grace after meals.

2:42:08.460 --> 2:42:13.720
 You're coming over for Friday night Shabbat dinner, so we'll bench together and say grace.

2:42:13.720 --> 2:42:23.940
 It's important to just, like this bottle of water in front of me, I made a point of just

2:42:23.940 --> 2:42:27.500
 thinking about how wonderful it is that there's a quenching bottle that happens to be placed

2:42:27.500 --> 2:42:30.060
 in front of me because somebody cared.

2:42:30.060 --> 2:42:37.300
 That small thing made a difference to me.

2:42:37.300 --> 2:42:40.820
 I still have strength for the fight so far.

2:42:40.820 --> 2:42:43.060
 I think that's something I'm grateful for.

2:42:43.060 --> 2:42:51.100
 I can't believe that I'm not more beaten down after all of this nonsense.

2:42:51.100 --> 2:42:54.220
 I have the most interesting set of friends.

2:42:54.220 --> 2:42:56.940
 I really do.

2:42:56.940 --> 2:43:01.980
 I'm not that rich by monetary standards, but if there were friend billionaires, Forbes

2:43:01.980 --> 2:43:07.300
 would be all over my ass.

2:43:07.300 --> 2:43:12.540
 I just can't believe who I can talk to, you know, at the drop of a hat.

2:43:12.540 --> 2:43:22.500
 And I'm really grateful.

2:43:22.500 --> 2:43:28.880
 I think this is the end of something profound, and it's the beginning of whatever is next.

2:43:28.880 --> 2:43:30.820
 And whatever is next could be terminal.

2:43:30.820 --> 2:43:32.740
 Whatever is next could be amazing.

2:43:32.740 --> 2:43:37.820
 Whatever is next could be a return to the horrors of the early 20th century that doesn't

2:43:37.820 --> 2:43:45.260
 manage to go totally catastrophic, but takes hundreds of millions of lives in the process.

2:43:45.260 --> 2:43:50.900
 I'm grateful to having half of my life in the rearview mirror.

2:43:50.900 --> 2:43:54.820
 Maybe it took place in a bubble, and maybe it was unsustainable.

2:43:54.820 --> 2:44:00.100
 But it was nice to be able to move around the world without a mask.

2:44:00.100 --> 2:44:05.780
 It was nice to be able to see a little bit of the world, even if it was from a cot in

2:44:05.780 --> 2:44:09.340
 a hostel in some country.

2:44:09.340 --> 2:44:10.340
 To fall in love.

2:44:10.340 --> 2:44:11.340
 Absolutely.

2:44:11.340 --> 2:44:15.180
 It was a good life.

2:44:15.180 --> 2:44:17.620
 Find the last Indian Jewish girl left.

2:44:17.620 --> 2:44:19.580
 Who knew?

2:44:19.580 --> 2:44:21.900
 You're a lucky guy.

2:44:21.900 --> 2:44:23.100
 Well, let me just say…

2:44:23.100 --> 2:44:26.540
 Actually, there's something I wanted to just say before you get to that.

2:44:26.540 --> 2:44:29.060
 I forgot to say something.

2:44:29.060 --> 2:44:34.540
 Falling in love with an intellectual collaborator is a special thing that not everybody gets

2:44:34.540 --> 2:44:36.340
 a chance to do.

2:44:36.340 --> 2:44:44.020
 I think when I met Pia, I fell deeply in love with her, all her normal characteristics.

2:44:44.020 --> 2:44:50.780
 Pia and I had an antagonistic relationship around geometry and economics.

2:44:50.780 --> 2:44:55.820
 And then weirdly, just like in a buddy picture where in the first half of the film they hate

2:44:55.820 --> 2:45:01.140
 each other, the two fields were fighting with each other, cats and dogs, and finally the

2:45:01.140 --> 2:45:04.900
 sexual tension clearly was so thick you could cut it with a knife.

2:45:04.900 --> 2:45:08.940
 And we came up with geometric marginalism, which is this other theory, not geometric

2:45:08.940 --> 2:45:18.140
 unity, which allowed me to inhabit space with somebody who I already knew intimately and

2:45:18.140 --> 2:45:23.700
 had fallen in love with, and to see the quality and beauty of their mind and to play and to

2:45:23.700 --> 2:45:24.700
 dance.

2:45:24.700 --> 2:45:29.660
 It's sort of the intellectual version of the tango, one of the most romantic periods

2:45:29.660 --> 2:45:32.740
 of my life that doesn't fall into most people's experience.

2:45:32.740 --> 2:45:38.140
 So that was a chance to see something totally unexpected, haven't really had it since

2:45:38.140 --> 2:45:42.820
 because she doesn't want to revisit the material, but something I'm super grateful for that's

2:45:42.820 --> 2:45:45.580
 very particular and unique.

2:45:45.580 --> 2:45:53.700
 But to flip the tables on you, for hundreds of thousands, I think millions of people,

2:45:53.700 --> 2:46:02.780
 I can speak, me and them are really grateful, one, that you exist, and two, sorry, for your

2:46:02.780 --> 2:46:14.140
 podcast and I do hope your voice in some form continues to reverberate, I think, at least

2:46:14.140 --> 2:46:19.900
 in the 2021s and beyond, even if it takes a brief pause.

2:46:19.900 --> 2:46:21.660
 We're pausing at the moment.

2:46:21.660 --> 2:46:26.260
 We've recorded some for future episodes and I'm recording for you.

2:46:26.260 --> 2:46:28.260
 I really appreciate that.

2:46:28.260 --> 2:46:34.620
 But earnestness trades at a discount at the moment because it's easy to make fun of it.

2:46:34.620 --> 2:46:38.980
 One of the things I like best about you is that you and I are both fairly earnest.

2:46:38.980 --> 2:46:43.580
 We may joke and jab, but honestly, there's a project here and a world to win, as they

2:46:43.580 --> 2:46:45.100
 say.

2:46:45.100 --> 2:46:52.940
 The thing that I want my and your listeners to know is that I'm not stepping away from

2:46:52.940 --> 2:47:01.260
 the podcast because I don't appreciate that people really want more.

2:47:01.260 --> 2:47:05.220
 This is hugely financially costly to me.

2:47:05.220 --> 2:47:12.500
 I want to make sure you guys are getting the best that I can do, and destroying myself

2:47:12.500 --> 2:47:16.060
 right in front of an election, I think Lex is incorrect.

2:47:16.060 --> 2:47:20.380
 I think that the forces that are trying to make sure that there aren't any planes in

2:47:20.380 --> 2:47:27.580
 the sky that aren't either colored red or colored blue is a big danger given how angry

2:47:27.580 --> 2:47:29.140
 I am at the system.

2:47:29.140 --> 2:47:32.260
 I don't want to be removed from the chess board because if nobody's going to talk about

2:47:32.260 --> 2:47:33.900
 Jeff Epstein, there need to be people.

2:47:33.900 --> 2:47:38.060
 If nobody's going to talk about various things that we've talked about on these programs,

2:47:38.060 --> 2:47:39.900
 I want to make sure that I'm there.

2:47:39.900 --> 2:47:42.420
 Do I think that this is potentially an existential election?

2:47:42.420 --> 2:47:43.420
 Yes.

2:47:43.420 --> 2:47:45.820
 Am I positive that I know that my way to bet is the right way out?

2:47:45.820 --> 2:47:47.420
 No, I'm not.

2:47:47.420 --> 2:47:48.420
 I don't know, people.

2:47:48.420 --> 2:47:49.980
 I just don't know.

2:47:49.980 --> 2:47:55.780
 Where we are right now seems so dumb and so catastrophic in terms of how it is chewing

2:47:55.780 --> 2:48:03.020
 up smart people that I decided it's really not about cowardice because it's hard for

2:48:03.020 --> 2:48:04.260
 me to restrain myself.

2:48:04.260 --> 2:48:07.900
 I have so many reactions every day.

2:48:07.900 --> 2:48:12.300
 This is really about trying to plan for all of our futures to make sure that I'm around.

2:48:12.300 --> 2:48:16.280
 I had a huge concern that what happened to Brett's Articles of Unity was going to happen

2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:17.280
 to Brett.

2:48:17.280 --> 2:48:19.380
 It was going to happen to the YouTube channels.

2:48:19.380 --> 2:48:22.840
 I want to make sure that we don't have all of our eggs in one basket.

2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:27.020
 So if something goes wrong over there, that's the whole idea of the intellectual dark web,

2:48:27.020 --> 2:48:31.020
 which is at some level a loose confederation.

2:48:31.020 --> 2:48:35.220
 It can become a strong confederation if somebody wants to back it and make it work.

2:48:35.220 --> 2:48:40.380
 It can dissolve so that there really isn't anything.

2:48:40.380 --> 2:48:46.580
 The thing is to be hard to kill because ultimately, when the hit pieces come, they don't come

2:48:46.580 --> 2:48:48.660
 for what it is that they're angry at you about.

2:48:48.660 --> 2:48:51.740
 They come for where they can get you.

2:48:51.740 --> 2:48:59.660
 It's very important that right in front of an election, the desire of the old system

2:48:59.660 --> 2:49:06.180
 to defend itself through reputational destruction is one of the most pernicious aspects of the

2:49:06.180 --> 2:49:07.360
 new America.

2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:14.440
 We have to fight the ability to destroy reputations as a means of institutions keeping individuals

2:49:14.440 --> 2:49:20.300
 with podcasts and the ability to reach millions through Substack out of their domain.

2:49:20.300 --> 2:49:22.380
 I don't surrender this domain to them.

2:49:22.380 --> 2:49:26.980
 They have plenty of weaponry with which to fight us, and I believe that they could remove

2:49:26.980 --> 2:49:28.740
 you or me in an instant.

2:49:28.740 --> 2:49:32.980
 By the end of today, if they wanted us off the chessboard, we would be off the chessboard.

2:49:32.980 --> 2:49:34.960
 I know that's not your perspective.

2:49:34.960 --> 2:49:41.440
 My goal is to stay here as long as possible to make sure that you have enough of a counterbalancing

2:49:41.440 --> 2:49:48.620
 set of ideas and to let and help other podcasters start.

2:49:48.620 --> 2:49:56.540
 My hope is that that works, but long heroism, short martyrdom is a good motto for anyone,

2:49:56.540 --> 2:50:01.620
 and I try to remember the short martyrdom part of that.

2:50:01.620 --> 2:50:03.180
 First of all, beautifully put.

2:50:03.180 --> 2:50:08.100
 Second of all, a way to end the conversation and the disagreement, which is how you hook

2:50:08.100 --> 2:50:11.260
 them for the next conversation to be continued.

2:50:11.260 --> 2:50:12.260
 And Lex says …

2:50:12.260 --> 2:50:15.420
 Eric, it's a huge honor.

2:50:15.420 --> 2:50:16.420
 Thank you once again.

2:50:16.420 --> 2:50:19.060
 Lex, really appreciate it every time we get together.

2:50:19.060 --> 2:50:20.620
 Thanks, buddy.

2:50:20.620 --> 2:50:24.460
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Eric Weinstein, and thank you to our

2:50:24.460 --> 2:50:25.460
 sponsors.

2:50:25.460 --> 2:50:30.020

2:50:30.020 --> 2:50:31.020
 and readability.

2:50:31.020 --> 2:50:37.380
 Sunbasket, a meal delivery service I use to add healthy variety to my culinary life.

2:50:37.380 --> 2:50:43.380
 SEMrush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool I've ever come across.

2:50:43.380 --> 2:50:46.420
 I don't like looking at numbers, but someone should.

2:50:46.420 --> 2:50:48.600
 It helps you make good decisions.

2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:54.500
 And finally, ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years to protect my privacy on the

2:50:54.500 --> 2:50:55.980
 internet.

2:51:12.220 --> 2:51:18.540
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Leonard Cohen in the song titled, Hallelujah.

2:51:18.540 --> 2:51:24.780
 Well, maybe there's a God above, but all I've ever learned from love was how to shoot

2:51:24.780 --> 2:51:27.140
 somebody who outdrew you.

2:51:27.140 --> 2:51:32.580
 And it's not a cry that you hear at night, it's not somebody who's seen the light,

2:51:32.580 --> 2:51:37.740
 it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.

2:51:37.740 --> 2:52:04.380
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
