00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
 If one site is hacked, you can just unleash all hell.

00:03.520 --> 00:06.800
 We have stumbled into this new era

00:06.800 --> 00:08.960
 of mutually assured digital destruction.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.200
 How far are people willing to go?

00:11.200 --> 00:13.040
 You can capture their location,

00:13.040 --> 00:16.160
 you can capture their contacts

00:16.160 --> 00:19.120
 that record their telephone calls, record their camera

00:19.120 --> 00:20.780
 without them knowing about it.

00:20.780 --> 00:24.400
 Basically, you can put an invisible ankle bracelet

00:24.400 --> 00:26.000
 on someone without them knowing.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
 You could sell that to a zero day broker for $2 million.

00:34.280 --> 00:37.360
 The following is a conversation with Nicole Perlroth,

00:37.360 --> 00:40.120
 cybersecurity journalist and author

00:40.120 --> 00:42.560
 of This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends,

00:42.560 --> 00:44.920
 The Cyber Weapons Arm Race.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.960
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.100
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:49.100 --> 00:50.360
 in the description.

00:50.360 --> 00:54.320
 And now, dear friends, here's Nicole Perlroth.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.580
 You've interviewed hundreds of cybersecurity hackers,

00:58.580 --> 01:01.020
 activists, dissidents, computer scientists,

01:01.020 --> 01:03.740
 government officials, forensic investigators,

01:03.740 --> 01:05.700
 and mercenaries.

01:05.700 --> 01:09.420
 So let's talk about cybersecurity and cyber war.

01:09.420 --> 01:10.500
 Start with the basics.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.540
 What is a zero day vulnerability?

01:13.540 --> 01:16.800
 And then a zero day exploit or attack?

01:18.080 --> 01:22.580
 So at the most basic level, let's say I'm a hacker

01:22.580 --> 01:27.580
 and I find a bug in your iPhone iOS software

01:28.020 --> 01:31.220
 that no one else knows about, especially Apple.

01:31.220 --> 01:34.340
 That's called a zero day because the minute it's discovered,

01:34.340 --> 01:36.520
 engineers have had zero days to fix it.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.880
 If I can study that zero day,

01:40.880 --> 01:44.900
 I could potentially write a program to exploit it.

01:44.900 --> 01:48.820
 And that program would be called a zero day exploit.

01:48.820 --> 01:53.820
 And for iOS, the dream is that you craft a zero day exploit

01:54.260 --> 01:57.340
 that can remotely exploit someone else's iPhone

01:57.340 --> 01:59.900
 without them ever knowing about it.

01:59.900 --> 02:01.860
 And you can capture their location,

02:01.860 --> 02:04.960
 you can capture their contacts

02:04.960 --> 02:06.820
 that record their telephone calls,

02:06.820 --> 02:09.580
 record their camera without them knowing about it.

02:09.580 --> 02:13.200
 Basically, you can put an invisible ankle bracelet

02:13.200 --> 02:15.020
 on someone without them knowing.

02:15.020 --> 02:17.180
 And you can see why that capability,

02:17.180 --> 02:20.460
 that zero day exploit would have immense value

02:20.460 --> 02:23.700
 for a spy agency or a government

02:23.700 --> 02:27.660
 that wants to monitor its critics or dissidents.

02:27.660 --> 02:30.560
 And so there's a very lucrative market now

02:30.560 --> 02:32.060
 for zero day exploits.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.420
 So you said a few things there.

02:33.420 --> 02:37.640
 One is iOS, why iOS, which operating system,

02:37.640 --> 02:40.180
 which one is the sexier thing to try to get to

02:40.180 --> 02:42.700
 or the most impactful thing?

02:42.700 --> 02:45.460
 And the other thing you mentioned is remote

02:45.460 --> 02:47.720
 versus like having to actually come

02:47.720 --> 02:49.300
 in physical contact with it.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.860
 Is that the distinction?

02:50.860 --> 02:54.500
 So iPhone exploits have just been

02:54.500 --> 02:58.240
 a government's number one priority.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.580
 Recently, actually the price

03:00.580 --> 03:03.500
 of an Android remote zero day exploit,

03:03.500 --> 03:06.540
 something that can get you into Android phones

03:06.540 --> 03:08.100
 is actually higher.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.960
 The value of that is now higher on this underground market

03:10.960 --> 03:15.360
 for zero day exploits than an iPhone iOS exploit.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.700
 So things are changing.

03:16.700 --> 03:20.040
 So there's probably more Android devices,

03:20.040 --> 03:21.740
 so that's why it's better.

03:21.740 --> 03:23.220
 But then the iPhone side,

03:24.380 --> 03:26.160
 so I'm an Android person,

03:26.160 --> 03:28.300
 because I'm a man of the people.

03:28.300 --> 03:31.140
 But it seems like all the elites use iPhone,

03:31.140 --> 03:33.020
 all the people at nice dinner parties.

03:33.020 --> 03:37.260
 So is that the reason that the more powerful people

03:37.260 --> 03:38.780
 use iPhones, is that why?

03:38.780 --> 03:39.780
 I don't think so.

03:39.780 --> 03:42.460
 I actually, so it was about two years ago

03:42.460 --> 03:43.660
 that the prices flipped.

03:43.660 --> 03:46.740
 It used to be that if you could craft

03:46.740 --> 03:51.740
 a remote zero click exploit for iOS,

03:53.340 --> 03:55.420
 then that was about as good as it gets.

03:55.420 --> 04:00.420
 You could sell that to a zero day broker for $2 million.

04:01.740 --> 04:04.700
 The caveat is you can never tell anyone about it,

04:04.700 --> 04:07.180
 because the minute you tell someone about it,

04:07.180 --> 04:08.880
 Apple learns about it,

04:08.880 --> 04:12.540
 they patch it in that $2.5 million investment

04:12.540 --> 04:16.100
 that that zero day broker just made goes to dust.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.980
 So a couple of years ago,

04:18.980 --> 04:20.780
 and don't quote me on the prices,

04:20.780 --> 04:25.780
 but an Android zero click remote exploit

04:25.900 --> 04:29.020
 for the first time topped the iOS.

04:29.020 --> 04:32.180
 And actually a lot of people's read on that

04:32.180 --> 04:35.860
 was that it might be a sign

04:35.860 --> 04:40.260
 that Apple security was falling,

04:40.260 --> 04:43.060
 and that it might actually be easier

04:43.060 --> 04:46.700
 to find an iOS zero day exploit

04:46.700 --> 04:48.940
 than find an Android zero day exploit.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.140
 The other thing is market share.

04:51.140 --> 04:54.700
 There are just more people around the world that use Android.

04:54.700 --> 04:58.540
 And a lot of governments that are paying top dollar

04:58.540 --> 05:01.320
 for zero day exploits these days

05:01.320 --> 05:05.260
 are deep pocketed governments in the Gulf

05:05.260 --> 05:06.940
 that wanna use these exploits

05:06.940 --> 05:10.780
 to monitor their own citizens, monitor their critics.

05:10.780 --> 05:12.380
 And so it's not necessarily

05:12.380 --> 05:14.620
 that they're trying to find elites,

05:14.620 --> 05:17.260
 it's that they wanna find out who these people are

05:17.260 --> 05:18.500
 that are criticizing them

05:18.500 --> 05:21.180
 or perhaps planning the next Arab Spring.

05:21.180 --> 05:23.260
 So in your experience,

05:23.260 --> 05:24.940
 are most of these attacks targeted

05:24.940 --> 05:26.500
 to cover a large population,

05:26.500 --> 05:29.100
 or is there attacks that are targeted

05:29.100 --> 05:31.300
 towards specific individuals?

05:31.300 --> 05:32.740
 So I think it's both.

05:32.740 --> 05:36.980
 Some of the zero day exploits that have fetched top dollar

05:36.980 --> 05:39.340
 that I've heard of in my reporting in the United States

05:39.340 --> 05:41.260
 were highly targeted.

05:41.260 --> 05:43.640
 There was a potential terrorist attack.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.460
 They wanted to get into this person's phone.

05:45.460 --> 05:48.060
 It had to be done in the next 24 hours.

05:48.060 --> 05:50.860
 They approached hackers and say, we'll pay you

05:50.860 --> 05:53.780
 X millions of dollars if you can do this.

05:53.780 --> 05:55.820
 But then you look at,

05:55.820 --> 06:00.740
 when we've discovered iOS zero day exploits in the wild,

06:00.740 --> 06:03.660
 some of them have been targeting large populations

06:03.660 --> 06:05.240
 like Uyghurs.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.060
 So a couple of years ago,

06:07.060 --> 06:10.260
 there was a watering hole attack.

06:10.260 --> 06:12.140
 Okay, what's a watering hole attack?

06:12.140 --> 06:13.260
 There's a website,

06:13.260 --> 06:17.860
 it was actually had information aimed at Uyghurs

06:17.860 --> 06:20.960
 and you could access it all over the world.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.260
 And if you visited this website,

06:24.140 --> 06:29.140
 it would drop an iOS zero day exploit onto your phone.

06:29.140 --> 06:32.220
 And so anyone that visited this website

06:32.220 --> 06:34.460
 that was about Uyghurs anywhere,

06:34.460 --> 06:37.400
 I mean, Uyghurs, Uyghurs living abroad,

06:37.400 --> 06:42.060
 basically the Uyghur diaspora would have gotten infected

06:42.060 --> 06:43.940
 with this zero day exploit.

06:43.940 --> 06:48.940
 So in that case, they were targeting huge swaths

06:49.200 --> 06:51.720
 of this one population or people interested

06:51.720 --> 06:54.780
 in this one population, basically in real time.

06:54.780 --> 06:59.340
 So who are these attackers?

06:59.340 --> 07:02.660
 From the individual level to the group level,

07:02.660 --> 07:05.180
 psychologically speaking, what's their motivation?

07:05.180 --> 07:07.420
 Is it purely money?

07:07.420 --> 07:09.220
 Is it the challenge?

07:09.220 --> 07:10.620
 Are they malevolent?

07:10.620 --> 07:12.220
 Is it power?

07:12.220 --> 07:15.460
 These are big philosophical human questions, I guess.

07:15.460 --> 07:20.380
 So these are the questions I set out to answer for my book.

07:20.380 --> 07:25.380
 I wanted to know, are these people that are just after money?

07:26.900 --> 07:29.680
 If they're just after money, how do they sleep at night?

07:29.680 --> 07:31.900
 Not knowing whether that zero day exploit

07:31.900 --> 07:34.720
 they just sold to a broker is being used

07:34.720 --> 07:38.140
 to basically make someone's life a living hell.

07:38.140 --> 07:41.820
 And what I found was there's kind of this long sorted history

07:41.820 --> 07:43.660
 to this question.

07:43.660 --> 07:46.900
 It started out in the 80s and 90s

07:46.900 --> 07:51.180
 when hackers were just finding holes and bugs and software

07:51.180 --> 07:54.340
 for curiosity's sake, really as a hobby.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.780
 And some of them would go to the tech companies

07:56.780 --> 08:01.740
 like Microsoft or Sun Microsystems at the time or Oracle.

08:01.740 --> 08:04.500
 And they'd say, hey, I just found this zero day

08:04.500 --> 08:08.100
 in your software and I can use it to break into NASA.

08:08.100 --> 08:11.180
 And the general response at the time wasn't,

08:11.180 --> 08:13.940
 thank you so much for pointing out this flaw

08:13.940 --> 08:17.260
 and our software, we'll get it fixed as soon as possible.

08:17.260 --> 08:21.220
 It was, don't ever poke around our software ever again

08:21.220 --> 08:24.180
 or we'll stick our general counsel on you.

08:24.180 --> 08:29.180
 And that was really sort of the common thread for years.

08:30.380 --> 08:34.420
 And so hackers who set out to do the right thing

08:34.420 --> 08:37.640
 were basically told to shut up

08:37.640 --> 08:40.140
 and stop doing what you're doing.

08:40.140 --> 08:44.900
 And what happened next was they basically started trading

08:44.900 --> 08:46.220
 this information online.

08:46.220 --> 08:48.180
 Now, when you go back and interview people

08:48.180 --> 08:53.020
 from those early days, they all tell a very similar story,

08:53.020 --> 08:57.520
 which is they're curious, they're tinkerers.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.740
 They remind me of like the kid down the block

08:59.740 --> 09:03.780
 that was constantly poking around the hood of his dad's car.

09:03.780 --> 09:06.140
 They just couldn't help themselves.

09:06.140 --> 09:09.500
 They wanted to figure out how a system is designed

09:09.500 --> 09:11.900
 and how they could potentially exploit it

09:11.900 --> 09:13.120
 for some other purpose.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.960
 It doesn't have to be good or bad.

09:15.820 --> 09:20.660
 But they were basically kind of beat down for so long

09:20.660 --> 09:22.980
 by these big tech companies

09:22.980 --> 09:26.640
 that they started just silently trading them

09:26.640 --> 09:28.100
 with other hackers.

09:28.100 --> 09:32.660
 And that's how you got these really heated debates

09:32.660 --> 09:34.800
 in the 90s about disclosure.

09:35.780 --> 09:38.200
 Should you just dump these things online

09:38.200 --> 09:40.360
 because any script kitty can pick them up

09:40.360 --> 09:42.600
 and use it for all kinds of mischief.

09:43.540 --> 09:46.140
 But don't you wanna just stick a middle finger

09:46.140 --> 09:47.300
 to all these companies

09:47.300 --> 09:50.060
 that are basically threatening you all the time.

09:50.060 --> 09:53.620
 So there was this really interesting dynamic at play.

09:53.620 --> 09:57.100
 And what I learned in the course of doing my book

09:57.100 --> 10:01.740
 was that government agencies and their contractors

10:01.740 --> 10:06.020
 sort of tapped into that frustration and that resentment.

10:06.020 --> 10:09.140
 And they started quietly reaching out to hackers

10:09.140 --> 10:11.120
 on these forums.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.860
 And they said, hey, you know that zero day

10:13.860 --> 10:14.940
 you just dropped online,

10:14.940 --> 10:17.980
 could you come up with something custom for me?

10:17.980 --> 10:20.060
 And I'll pay you six figures for it

10:20.060 --> 10:22.280
 so long as you shut up and never tell anyone

10:22.280 --> 10:24.740
 that I paid you for this.

10:24.740 --> 10:27.060
 And that's what happened.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.420
 So throughout the 90s,

10:28.420 --> 10:31.460
 there was a bunch of boutique contractors

10:31.460 --> 10:34.680
 that started reaching out to hackers on these forums

10:34.680 --> 10:37.340
 and saying, hey, I'll pay you six figures

10:37.340 --> 10:39.640
 for that bug you were trying to get Microsoft

10:39.640 --> 10:41.420
 to fix for free.

10:41.420 --> 10:45.560
 And sort of so began or so catalyzed this market

10:45.560 --> 10:48.020
 where governments and their intermediaries

10:48.020 --> 10:50.420
 started reaching out to these hackers

10:50.420 --> 10:53.060
 and buying their bugs for free.

10:53.060 --> 10:54.180
 And in those early days,

10:54.180 --> 10:57.620
 I think a lot of it was just for quiet counterintelligence,

10:57.620 --> 11:00.040
 traditional espionage.

11:00.040 --> 11:04.260
 But as we started baking the software,

11:04.260 --> 11:07.060
 Windows software, Schneider Electric,

11:07.060 --> 11:11.300
 Siemens industrial software into our nuclear plants

11:11.300 --> 11:14.940
 and our factories and our power grid

11:14.940 --> 11:18.700
 and our petrochemical facilities and our pipelines,

11:18.700 --> 11:22.060
 those same zero days came to be just as valuable

11:22.060 --> 11:25.120
 for sabotage and war planning.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.220
 Does the fact that the market sprung up

11:27.220 --> 11:28.480
 and you can now make a lot of money

11:28.480 --> 11:31.820
 change the nature of the attackers that came to the table

11:31.820 --> 11:34.500
 or grow the number of attackers?

11:34.500 --> 11:35.700
 I mean, what is, I guess,

11:35.700 --> 11:40.540
 you told the psychology of the hackers in the 90s,

11:40.540 --> 11:43.980
 what is the culture today and where is it heading?

11:43.980 --> 11:47.100
 So I think there are people who will tell you

11:47.100 --> 11:49.060
 they would never sell a zero day

11:49.060 --> 11:52.060
 to a zero day broker or a government.

11:52.060 --> 11:54.540
 One, because they don't know how it's gonna get used

11:54.540 --> 11:56.340
 when they throw it over the fence.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.780
 Most of these get rolled into classified programs

11:58.780 --> 12:01.260
 and you don't know how they get used.

12:01.260 --> 12:02.700
 If you sell it to a zero day broker,

12:02.700 --> 12:05.500
 you don't even know which nation state might use it

12:06.900 --> 12:09.300
 or potentially which criminal group might use it

12:09.300 --> 12:11.380
 if you sell it on the dark web.

12:11.380 --> 12:15.400
 The other thing that they say is that

12:15.400 --> 12:17.980
 they wanna be able to sleep at night.

12:17.980 --> 12:19.900
 And they lose a lot of sleep

12:19.900 --> 12:22.140
 if they found out their zero day was being used

12:22.140 --> 12:24.820
 to make a dissident's life living hell.

12:25.980 --> 12:28.500
 But there are a lot of people, good people,

12:28.500 --> 12:32.620
 who also say, no, this is not my problem.

12:32.620 --> 12:35.380
 This is the technology company's problem.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.020
 If they weren't writing new bugs

12:37.020 --> 12:39.160
 into their software every day,

12:39.160 --> 12:41.060
 then there wouldn't be a market.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.860
 Then there wouldn't be a problem.

12:42.860 --> 12:44.780
 But they continue to write bugs

12:44.780 --> 12:46.180
 into their software all the time

12:46.180 --> 12:48.300
 and they continue to profit off that software.

12:48.300 --> 12:53.300
 So why shouldn't I profit off my labor too?

12:53.540 --> 12:55.740
 And one of the things that has happened,

12:55.740 --> 12:57.980
 which is I think a positive development

12:57.980 --> 13:02.260
 over the last 10 years, are bug bounty programs.

13:02.260 --> 13:05.020
 Companies like Google and Facebook

13:05.020 --> 13:07.460
 and then Microsoft and finally Apple,

13:07.460 --> 13:10.180
 which resisted it for a really long time,

13:10.180 --> 13:14.780
 have said, okay, we are gonna shift our perspective

13:14.780 --> 13:15.700
 about hackers.

13:15.700 --> 13:18.960
 We're no longer going to treat them as the enemy here.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.340
 We're going to start paying them

13:20.340 --> 13:23.800
 for what it's essentially free quality assurance.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.800
 And we're gonna pay them good money in some cases,

13:26.800 --> 13:28.900
 six figures in some cases.

13:28.900 --> 13:32.380
 We're never gonna be able to bid against a zero day broker

13:32.380 --> 13:34.740
 who sells to government agencies.

13:34.740 --> 13:38.900
 But we can reward them and hopefully get to that bug earlier

13:38.900 --> 13:40.980
 where we can neutralize it

13:40.980 --> 13:43.060
 so that they don't have to spend another year

13:43.060 --> 13:44.760
 developing the zero day exploit.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.180
 And in that way, we can keep our software more secure.

13:48.180 --> 13:53.060
 But every week I get messages from some hacker that says,

13:53.060 --> 13:55.940
 you know, I tried to see this zero day exploit

13:55.940 --> 13:58.020
 that was just found in the wild,

13:58.020 --> 14:00.380
 being used by this nation state.

14:00.380 --> 14:04.560
 I tried to tell Microsoft about this two years ago

14:04.560 --> 14:08.900
 and they were gonna pay me peanuts so it never got fixed.

14:08.900 --> 14:12.700
 There are all sorts of those stories that can continue on.

14:12.700 --> 14:16.700
 And I think just generally,

14:16.700 --> 14:19.860
 hackers are not very good at diplomacy.

14:19.860 --> 14:24.620
 They tend to be pretty snipey, technical crowd.

14:24.620 --> 14:28.220
 And very philosophical in my experience.

14:28.220 --> 14:31.860
 But diplomacy is not their strong suit.

14:31.860 --> 14:33.660
 Oh, there almost has to be a broker

14:33.660 --> 14:35.940
 between companies and hackers.

14:35.940 --> 14:37.980
 We can translate effectively,

14:37.980 --> 14:39.540
 just like you have a zero day broker

14:39.540 --> 14:41.740
 between governments and hackers.

14:41.740 --> 14:43.100
 You have to speak their language.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.900
 Yeah, and there have been some of those companies

14:45.900 --> 14:47.780
 who've risen up to meet that demand.

14:47.780 --> 14:50.340
 And HackerOne is one of them.

14:50.340 --> 14:52.440
 Bugcrowd is another.

14:52.440 --> 14:55.180
 Cynak has an interesting model, so that's a company

14:55.180 --> 14:59.900
 that you pay for a private bug bounty program essentially.

14:59.900 --> 15:04.460
 So you pay this company, they tap hackers all over the world

15:04.460 --> 15:07.580
 to come hack your software, hack your system.

15:07.580 --> 15:10.840
 And then they'll quietly tell you what they found.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.740
 And I think that's a really positive development.

15:13.740 --> 15:16.300
 And actually, the Department of Defense

15:16.300 --> 15:20.480
 hired all three of those companies I just mentioned

15:20.480 --> 15:22.020
 to help secure their systems.

15:22.020 --> 15:24.180
 Now I think they're still a little timid

15:24.180 --> 15:25.820
 in terms of letting those hackers

15:25.820 --> 15:30.300
 into the really sensitive, high side classified stuff.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.060
 But you know, baby steps.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.740
 Just to understand what you were saying,

15:34.740 --> 15:37.780
 you think it's impossible for companies

15:37.780 --> 15:40.540
 to financially compete with the zero day brokers,

15:40.540 --> 15:42.020
 with governments.

15:42.020 --> 15:47.020
 So like the defense can't outpay the hackers?

15:47.740 --> 15:51.860
 It's interesting, they shouldn't outpay them.

15:51.860 --> 15:53.900
 Because what would happen

15:53.900 --> 15:58.900
 if they started offering $2.5 million at Apple

15:59.220 --> 16:02.300
 for any zero day exploit

16:02.300 --> 16:04.700
 that governments would pay that much for,

16:04.700 --> 16:06.340
 is their own engineers would say,

16:06.340 --> 16:10.280
 why the hell am I working for less than that

16:10.280 --> 16:12.400
 and doing my nine to five every day?

16:12.400 --> 16:14.700
 So you would create a perverse incentive.

16:14.700 --> 16:18.480
 And I didn't think about that until I started this research

16:18.480 --> 16:20.500
 and I realized, okay, yeah, that makes sense.

16:20.500 --> 16:25.300
 You don't want to incentivize offense so much

16:25.300 --> 16:27.260
 that it's to your own detriment.

16:27.260 --> 16:29.540
 And so I think what they have though,

16:29.540 --> 16:32.660
 what the companies have on government agencies,

16:32.660 --> 16:36.140
 is if they pay you, you get to talk about it.

16:36.140 --> 16:38.180
 You know, you get the street cred.

16:38.180 --> 16:41.260
 You get to brag about the fact you just found

16:41.260 --> 16:45.340
 that $2.5 million, you know, iOS zero day

16:45.340 --> 16:47.100
 that no one else did.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.780
 And if you sell it to a broker,

16:48.780 --> 16:50.100
 you never get to talk about it.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.300
 And I think that really does eat at people.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.100
 Can I ask you a big philosophical question

16:55.100 --> 16:56.460
 about human nature here?

16:57.300 --> 17:00.780
 So if you have, I mean, what you've seen,

17:00.780 --> 17:03.420
 if a human being has a zero day,

17:03.420 --> 17:08.420
 they found a zero day vulnerability that can hack into,

17:09.300 --> 17:11.980
 I don't know, what's the worst thing you can hack into?

17:11.980 --> 17:14.900
 Something that could launch nuclear weapons.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.980
 Which percentage of the people in the world

17:16.980 --> 17:20.620
 that have the skill would not share that with anyone,

17:20.620 --> 17:23.420
 with any bad party?

17:23.420 --> 17:27.740
 I guess how many people are completely devoid

17:27.740 --> 17:31.740
 of ethical concerns in your sense?

17:31.740 --> 17:36.340
 So my belief is all the ultra competent people

17:36.340 --> 17:39.580
 or very, very high percentage of ultra competent people

17:39.580 --> 17:41.540
 are also ethical people.

17:41.540 --> 17:42.940
 That's been my experience.

17:42.940 --> 17:45.860
 But then again, my experience is narrow.

17:45.860 --> 17:48.500
 What's your experience been like?

17:48.500 --> 17:52.620
 So this was another question I wanted to answer.

17:53.620 --> 17:57.740
 Who are these people who would sell a zero day exploit

17:57.740 --> 18:01.420
 that would neutralize a Schneider Electric safety lock

18:01.420 --> 18:03.100
 at a petrochemical plant?

18:03.100 --> 18:05.380
 Basically the last thing you would need to neutralize

18:05.380 --> 18:07.980
 before you trigger some kind of explosion.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.100
 Who would sell that?

18:11.300 --> 18:14.140
 And I got my answer,

18:14.140 --> 18:16.740
 well, the answer was different.

18:16.740 --> 18:19.820
 A lot of people said, I would never even look there

18:19.820 --> 18:21.020
 because I don't even wanna know.

18:21.020 --> 18:22.980
 I don't even wanna have that capability.

18:22.980 --> 18:26.540
 I don't even wanna have to make that decision

18:26.540 --> 18:29.900
 about whether I'm gonna profit off of that knowledge.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.780
 I went down to Argentina

18:31.780 --> 18:36.780
 and this whole kind of moral calculus I had in my head

18:36.940 --> 18:39.220
 was completely flipped around.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.580
 So just to back up for a moment.

18:41.580 --> 18:46.420
 So Argentina actually is a real hacker's paradise.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.740
 People grew up in Argentina and I went down there,

18:50.740 --> 18:54.180
 I guess I was there around 2015, 2016,

18:54.180 --> 18:56.540
 but you still couldn't get an iPhone.

18:57.420 --> 18:58.860
 They didn't have Amazon Prime.

18:58.860 --> 19:00.780
 You couldn't get access to any of the apps

19:00.780 --> 19:02.540
 we all take for granted.

19:02.540 --> 19:05.220
 To get those things in Argentina as a kid,

19:05.220 --> 19:07.540
 you have to find a way to hack them.

19:07.540 --> 19:12.020
 And the whole culture is really like a hacker culture.

19:12.020 --> 19:15.220
 They say it's really like a MacGyver culture.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.540
 You have to figure out how to break into something

19:17.540 --> 19:19.420
 with wire and tape.

19:19.420 --> 19:24.380
 And that means that there are a lot of really good hackers

19:24.380 --> 19:29.380
 in Argentina who specialize in developing zero to exploits.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.980
 And I went down to this Argentina conference

19:33.980 --> 19:35.700
 called Echo Party.

19:35.700 --> 19:39.420
 And I asked the organizer, okay, can you introduce me

19:39.420 --> 19:43.020
 to someone who's selling zero to exploits to governments?

19:43.020 --> 19:44.940
 And he was like, just throw a stone.

19:46.340 --> 19:48.860
 Throw a stone anywhere and you're gonna hit someone.

19:48.860 --> 19:52.100
 And all over this conference, you saw these guys

19:52.100 --> 19:54.060
 who were clearly from these Gulf States

19:54.060 --> 19:55.620
 who only spoke Arabic.

19:55.620 --> 19:59.300
 What are they doing at a young hacking conference

19:59.300 --> 20:01.060
 in Buenos Aires?

20:01.060 --> 20:05.100
 And so I went out to lunch with kind of this godfather

20:05.100 --> 20:07.260
 of the hacking scene there.

20:07.260 --> 20:10.180
 And I asked this really dumb question

20:10.180 --> 20:13.100
 and I'm still embarrassed about how I phrased it.

20:13.100 --> 20:16.540
 But I said, so will these guys only sell

20:16.540 --> 20:20.300
 these zero to exploits to good Western governments?

20:20.300 --> 20:22.300
 And he said, Nicole, last time I checked,

20:22.300 --> 20:25.820
 the United States wasn't a good Western government.

20:25.820 --> 20:28.180
 The last country that bombed another country

20:28.180 --> 20:31.820
 into oblivion wasn't China or Iran,

20:31.820 --> 20:33.540
 it was the United States.

20:33.540 --> 20:36.700
 So if we're gonna go by your whole moral calculus,

20:36.700 --> 20:39.580
 just know that we have a very different calculus down here

20:39.580 --> 20:44.180
 and we'd actually rather sell to Iran or Russia

20:44.180 --> 20:46.580
 or China maybe than the United States.

20:46.580 --> 20:48.820
 And that just blew me away.

20:48.820 --> 20:51.820
 Like, wow, he's like, we'll just sell

20:51.820 --> 20:53.900
 to whoever brings us the biggest bag of cash.

20:53.900 --> 20:57.900
 Have you checked into our inflation situation recently?

20:57.900 --> 21:02.500
 So I had some of those like reality checks along the way.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.980
 We tend to think of things as is this moral,

21:05.980 --> 21:08.780
 is this ethical, especially as journalists.

21:08.780 --> 21:11.020
 And we kind of sit on our high horse sometimes

21:11.020 --> 21:13.640
 and write about a lot of things

21:13.640 --> 21:16.360
 that seem to push the moral bounds.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.700
 But in this market, which is essentially

21:18.700 --> 21:22.820
 an underground market that the one rule is like fight club.

21:22.820 --> 21:24.420
 No one talks about fight club.

21:24.420 --> 21:25.920
 First rule of the zero day market,

21:25.920 --> 21:29.200
 nobody talks about the zero day market on both sides

21:29.200 --> 21:30.900
 because the hacker doesn't wanna lose

21:30.900 --> 21:33.900
 their $2.5 million bounty.

21:33.900 --> 21:36.840
 And governments roll these into classified programs

21:36.840 --> 21:39.160
 and they don't want anyone to know what they have.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.180
 So no one talks about this thing.

21:41.180 --> 21:43.820
 And when you're operating in the dark like that,

21:43.820 --> 21:46.980
 it's really easy to put aside your morals sometimes.

21:48.500 --> 21:52.020
 Can I, as a small tangent, ask you, by way of advice,

21:52.020 --> 21:55.540
 you must have done some incredible interviews.

21:55.540 --> 21:58.280
 And you've also spoken about how serious

21:58.280 --> 22:01.420
 you take protecting your sources.

22:01.420 --> 22:04.420
 If you were to give me advice for interviewing

22:04.420 --> 22:08.000
 when you're recording on mic with a video camera,

22:10.220 --> 22:13.060
 how is it possible to get into this world?

22:13.060 --> 22:16.080
 Like is it basically impossible?

22:16.080 --> 22:19.020
 So you've spoken with a few people,

22:19.020 --> 22:23.300
 what is it like the godfather of cyber war, cyber security?

22:23.300 --> 22:25.220
 So people that are already out.

22:25.220 --> 22:28.400
 And they still have to be pretty brave to speak publicly.

22:29.820 --> 22:32.700
 But is it virtually impossible to really talk to anybody

22:32.700 --> 22:34.580
 who is a current hacker?

22:34.580 --> 22:37.700
 Are you always like 10, 20 years behind?

22:37.700 --> 22:38.700
 It's a good question.

22:38.700 --> 22:40.820
 And this is why I'm a print journalist.

22:41.900 --> 22:45.900
 But when I've seen people do it,

22:45.900 --> 22:49.220
 it's always the guy who's behind the shadows,

22:49.220 --> 22:51.780
 whose voice has been altered.

22:51.780 --> 22:53.380
 When they've gotten someone on camera,

22:53.380 --> 22:55.120
 that's usually how they do it.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.980
 Very, very few people talk in this space.

22:58.980 --> 23:02.020
 And there's actually a pretty well known case study

23:02.020 --> 23:04.420
 in why you don't talk publicly in this space

23:04.420 --> 23:05.860
 and you don't get photographed.

23:05.860 --> 23:07.380
 And that's the gruck.

23:07.380 --> 23:12.060
 So the gruck is or was this zero day broker,

23:12.060 --> 23:15.220
 South African guy, lives in Thailand.

23:15.220 --> 23:18.840
 And right when I was starting on this subject

23:18.840 --> 23:22.680
 at the New York Times, he'd given an interview to Forbes.

23:22.680 --> 23:25.540
 And he talked about being a zero day broker.

23:25.540 --> 23:29.140
 And he even posed next to this giant duffel bag

23:29.140 --> 23:31.700
 filled with cash, ostensibly.

23:31.700 --> 23:35.460
 And later he would say he was speaking off the record.

23:35.460 --> 23:38.000
 He didn't understand the rules of the game.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
 But what I heard from people who did business with him

23:41.000 --> 23:43.080
 was that the minute that that story came out,

23:43.080 --> 23:45.280
 he became PNG'd.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.540
 No one did business with him.

23:47.540 --> 23:50.060
 His business plummeted by at least half.

23:50.060 --> 23:52.100
 No one wants to do business with anyone

23:52.100 --> 23:54.180
 who's going to get on camera and talk

23:54.180 --> 23:58.180
 about how they're selling zero days to governments.

23:58.180 --> 23:59.700
 It puts you at danger.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.620
 And I did hear that he got some visits

24:01.620 --> 24:04.020
 from some security folks.

24:04.020 --> 24:06.940
 And that's another thing for these people to consider.

24:06.940 --> 24:12.300
 If they have those zero day exploits at their disposal,

24:12.300 --> 24:16.400
 they become a huge target for nation states

24:16.400 --> 24:18.460
 all over the world.

24:18.460 --> 24:20.780
 Talk about having perfect opsec.

24:20.780 --> 24:23.540
 You better have some perfect opsec

24:23.540 --> 24:26.300
 if people know that you have access to those zero day

24:26.300 --> 24:27.860
 exploits.

24:27.860 --> 24:33.500
 Which sucks because, I mean, transparency here

24:33.500 --> 24:36.380
 would be really powerful for educating the world

24:36.380 --> 24:40.100
 and also inspiring other engineers to do good.

24:40.100 --> 24:43.820
 It just feels like when you operate in the shadows,

24:43.820 --> 24:46.720
 it doesn't help us move in the positive direction in terms

24:46.720 --> 24:48.900
 of getting more people on the defense side

24:48.900 --> 24:50.620
 versus on the attack side.

24:50.620 --> 24:52.060
 But of course, what can you do?

24:52.060 --> 24:53.660
 I mean, the best you can possibly do

24:53.660 --> 24:57.060
 is have great journalists, just like you did,

24:57.060 --> 24:58.900
 interview and write books about it,

24:58.900 --> 25:01.020
 and integrate the information you get

25:01.020 --> 25:02.900
 while hiding the sources.

25:02.900 --> 25:07.860
 Yeah, and I think what HackerOne has told me was, OK,

25:07.860 --> 25:09.340
 let's just put away the people that

25:09.340 --> 25:13.980
 are finding and developing zero day exploits all day long.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.540
 Let's put that aside.

25:15.540 --> 25:19.620
 What about however many millions of programmers

25:19.620 --> 25:22.340
 all over the world who've never even heard of a zero day

25:22.340 --> 25:23.300
 exploit?

25:23.300 --> 25:26.620
 Why not tap into them and say, hey, we'll

25:26.620 --> 25:31.540
 start paying you if you can find a bug in United Airlines

25:31.540 --> 25:36.900
 software or in Schneider Electric or in Ford or Tesla?

25:36.900 --> 25:39.940
 And I think that is a really smart approach.

25:39.940 --> 25:43.900
 Let's go find this untapped army of programmers

25:43.900 --> 25:47.780
 to neutralize these bugs before the people who will continue

25:47.780 --> 25:50.820
 to sell these to governments can find them and exploit them.

25:50.820 --> 25:53.180
 OK, I have to ask you about this.

25:53.180 --> 25:55.740
 From a personal side, it's funny enough,

25:55.740 --> 25:59.260
 after we agreed to talk, I've gotten,

25:59.260 --> 26:03.700
 for the first time in my life, was a victim of a cyber attack.

26:06.380 --> 26:07.500
 So this is ransomware.

26:07.500 --> 26:08.540
 It's called Deadbolt.

26:08.540 --> 26:10.020
 People can look it up.

26:10.020 --> 26:14.140
 I have a QNAP device for basically kind

26:14.140 --> 26:15.580
 of coldish storage.

26:15.580 --> 26:20.300
 So it's about 60 terabytes with 50 terabytes of data on it

26:20.300 --> 26:21.700
 in RAID 5.

26:21.700 --> 26:27.100
 And apparently, about 4,000 to 5,000 QNAP devices

26:27.100 --> 26:30.660
 were hacked and taken over with this ransomware.

26:30.660 --> 26:35.580
 And what ransomware does there is it goes file by file,

26:35.580 --> 26:39.060
 almost all the files on the QNAP storage device,

26:39.060 --> 26:40.420
 and encrypts them.

26:40.420 --> 26:43.660
 And then there's this very eloquently and politely

26:43.660 --> 26:48.300
 written page that pops up, describes what happened.

26:48.300 --> 26:50.020
 All your files have been encrypted.

26:50.020 --> 26:52.580
 This includes but is not limited to photos, documents,

26:52.580 --> 26:53.780
 and spreadsheets.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.180
 Why me?

26:56.180 --> 26:57.940
 This is a lot of people commented

26:57.940 --> 27:00.740
 about how friendly and eloquent this is.

27:00.740 --> 27:01.780
 And I have to commend them.

27:01.780 --> 27:05.980
 It is, and it's pretty user friendly.

27:05.980 --> 27:06.580
 Why me?

27:06.580 --> 27:08.060
 This is not a personal attack.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.980
 You have been targeted because of the inadequate security

27:10.980 --> 27:15.100
 provided by your vendor, QNAP.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.380
 What now?

27:16.380 --> 27:19.780
 You can make a payment of exactly 0.03 Bitcoin,

27:19.780 --> 27:23.380
 which is about $1,000, to the following address.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.020
 Once the payment has been made, we'll

27:25.020 --> 27:27.500
 follow up with transaction to the same address,

27:27.500 --> 27:28.580
 blah, blah, blah.

27:28.580 --> 27:31.500
 They give you instructions of what happens next,

27:31.500 --> 27:32.940
 and they'll give you a decryption key

27:32.940 --> 27:34.620
 that you can then use.

27:34.620 --> 27:38.860
 And then there's another message for QNAP that says,

27:38.860 --> 27:41.220
 all your affected customers have been targeted using

27:41.220 --> 27:43.860
 a zero day vulnerability in your product.

27:43.860 --> 27:48.380
 We offer you two options to mitigate this and future damage.

27:48.380 --> 27:51.700
 One, make a Bitcoin payment of 5 Bitcoin

27:51.700 --> 27:54.260
 to the following address, and that

27:54.260 --> 27:58.460
 will reveal to QNAP the, I'm summarizing things here,

27:58.460 --> 28:00.180
 what the actual vulnerability is.

28:00.180 --> 28:03.860
 Or you can make a Bitcoin payment of 50 Bitcoin

28:03.860 --> 28:06.980
 to get a master decryption key for all your customers.

28:06.980 --> 28:10.260
 50 Bitcoin is about $1.8 million.

28:10.260 --> 28:11.900
 OK.

28:11.900 --> 28:18.100
 So first of all, on a personal level, this one hurt for me.

28:18.100 --> 28:22.140
 There's, I mean, I learned a lot because I wasn't,

28:22.140 --> 28:26.980
 for the most part, backing up much of that data

28:26.980 --> 28:30.820
 because I thought I can afford to lose that data.

28:30.820 --> 28:32.500
 It's not horrible.

28:32.500 --> 28:35.900
 I mean, I think you've spoken about the crown jewels,

28:35.900 --> 28:38.380
 like making sure there's things you really protect.

28:38.380 --> 28:42.380
 And I have, you know, I'm very conscious,

28:42.380 --> 28:45.060
 security wise, on the crown jewels.

28:45.060 --> 28:48.060
 But there's a bunch of stuff, like, you know,

28:48.060 --> 28:49.900
 personal videos that are not, like,

28:49.900 --> 28:51.900
 I don't have anything creepy, but just, like,

28:51.900 --> 28:55.420
 fun things I did that because they're very large or 4K

28:55.420 --> 28:57.340
 or something like that, I kept them on there,

28:57.340 --> 28:59.700
 thinking RAID 5 will protect it.

28:59.700 --> 29:05.100
 You know, just I lost a bunch of stuff, including raw footage

29:05.100 --> 29:08.300
 from interviews and all that kind of stuff.

29:08.300 --> 29:09.540
 So it's painful.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.660
 And I'm sure there's a lot of painful stuff

29:11.660 --> 29:15.540
 like that for the 4,000 to 5,000 people that use QNAP.

29:15.540 --> 29:18.420
 And there's a lot of interesting ethical questions here.

29:18.420 --> 29:20.620
 Do you pay them?

29:20.620 --> 29:23.220
 Does QNAP pay them?

29:23.220 --> 29:26.260
 Do the individuals pay them, especially when

29:26.260 --> 29:29.020
 you don't know if it's going to work or not?

29:29.020 --> 29:30.220
 Do you wait?

29:30.220 --> 29:35.860
 So QNAP said that, please don't pay them.

29:35.860 --> 29:38.860
 We're working very hard day and night to solve this.

29:41.980 --> 29:44.060
 It's so philosophically interesting to me

29:44.060 --> 29:46.500
 because I also project onto them thinking,

29:46.500 --> 29:48.220
 what is their motivation?

29:48.220 --> 29:51.900
 Because the way they phrased it, on purpose, perhaps,

29:51.900 --> 29:54.820
 but I'm not sure if that actually reflects their real motivation,

29:54.820 --> 29:59.220
 is maybe they're trying to help themselves sleep at night,

29:59.220 --> 30:01.260
 basically saying, this is not about you.

30:01.260 --> 30:04.300
 This is about the company with the vulnerabilities.

30:04.300 --> 30:07.260
 Just like you mentioned, this is the justification they have.

30:07.260 --> 30:09.500
 But they're hurting real people.

30:09.500 --> 30:10.460
 They hurt me.

30:10.460 --> 30:14.460
 But I'm sure there's a few others that are really hurt.

30:14.460 --> 30:18.540
 And the zero day factor is a big one.

30:18.540 --> 30:22.260
 Their QNAP right now is trying to figure out

30:22.260 --> 30:25.500
 what the hell is wrong with their system that would let this in.

30:25.500 --> 30:30.140
 And even if they pay, if they still don't know where the zero

30:30.140 --> 30:32.700
 day is, what's to say that they won't just hit them again

30:32.700 --> 30:34.220
 and hit you again?

30:34.220 --> 30:36.500
 So that really complicates things.

30:36.500 --> 30:40.860
 And that is a huge advancement for ransomware.

30:40.860 --> 30:44.700
 It's really only been, I think, in the last 18 months

30:44.700 --> 30:48.380
 that we've ever really seen ransomware exploit zero days

30:48.380 --> 30:49.220
 to pull these off.

30:49.220 --> 30:54.700
 Usually, 80% of them, I think the data shows 80% of them

30:54.700 --> 30:58.420
 come down to a lack of two factor authentication.

30:58.420 --> 31:01.380
 So when someone gets hit by a ransomware attack,

31:01.380 --> 31:04.340
 they don't have two factor authentication on.

31:04.340 --> 31:07.580
 Their employees were using stupid passwords.

31:07.580 --> 31:09.660
 You can mitigate that in the future.

31:09.660 --> 31:10.820
 This one, they don't know.

31:10.820 --> 31:11.780
 They probably don't know.

31:11.780 --> 31:12.260
 Yeah.

31:12.260 --> 31:14.500
 And I guess it's zero click because I

31:14.500 --> 31:16.180
 didn't have to do anything.

31:16.180 --> 31:21.780
 The only thing, well, here's the thing.

31:21.780 --> 31:26.180
 I did basics of I put it behind a firewall.

31:26.180 --> 31:27.900
 I followed instructions.

31:27.900 --> 31:30.300
 But I didn't really pay attention.

31:30.300 --> 31:34.180
 So maybe there's a misconfiguration of some sort

31:34.180 --> 31:36.220
 that's easy to make.

31:36.220 --> 31:40.100
 It's difficult. We have a personal NAS.

31:40.100 --> 31:43.900
 So I'm not willing to say that I did

31:43.900 --> 31:47.100
 everything I possibly could.

31:47.100 --> 31:49.780
 But I did a lot of reasonable stuff.

31:49.780 --> 31:51.500
 And they still hit it with zero clicks.

31:51.500 --> 31:52.500
 I didn't have to do anything.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.100
 Yeah, well, it's like a zero day.

31:54.100 --> 31:56.980
 And it's a supply chain attack.

31:56.980 --> 31:59.220
 You're getting hit from your supplier.

31:59.220 --> 32:01.700
 You're getting hit because of your vendor.

32:01.700 --> 32:04.260
 And it's also a new thing for ransomware groups

32:04.260 --> 32:07.620
 to go to the individuals to pressure them to pay.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.860
 There was this really interesting case.

32:09.860 --> 32:13.660
 I think it was in Norway where there was a mental health

32:13.660 --> 32:16.140
 clinic that got hit.

32:16.140 --> 32:18.900
 And the cybercriminals were going to the patients

32:18.900 --> 32:22.020
 themselves to say, pay this, or we're

32:22.020 --> 32:25.420
 going to release your psychiatric records.

32:25.420 --> 32:28.180
 I mean, talk about hell.

32:28.180 --> 32:31.980
 In terms of whether to pay, that is on the cheaper

32:31.980 --> 32:33.660
 end of the spectrum.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.540
 From the individual or from the company?

32:35.540 --> 32:36.660
 Both.

32:36.660 --> 32:42.980
 We've seen, for instance, there was an Apple supplier in Taiwan.

32:42.980 --> 32:43.940
 They got hit.

32:43.940 --> 32:47.300
 And the ransom demand was $50 million.

32:47.300 --> 32:49.420
 I'm surprised it's only $1.8 million.

32:49.420 --> 32:52.100
 I'm sure it's going to go up.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.300
 And it's hard.

32:53.300 --> 32:57.060
 There's obviously governments, and maybe in this case,

32:57.060 --> 32:58.860
 the company are going to tell you,

32:58.860 --> 33:02.060
 we recommend you don't pay or please don't pay.

33:02.060 --> 33:06.300
 But the reality on the ground is that some businesses

33:06.300 --> 33:07.940
 can't operate.

33:07.940 --> 33:09.620
 Some countries can't function.

33:09.620 --> 33:15.860
 I mean, the underreported storyline of Colonial Pipeline

33:15.860 --> 33:19.740
 was after the company got hit and took

33:19.740 --> 33:22.140
 the preemptive step of shutting down the pipeline

33:22.140 --> 33:24.180
 because their billing systems were frozen,

33:24.180 --> 33:27.500
 they couldn't charge customers downstream.

33:27.500 --> 33:30.140
 My colleague David Zanger and I got our hands

33:30.140 --> 33:35.740
 on a classified assessment that said that as a country,

33:35.740 --> 33:38.500
 we could have only afforded two to three more days

33:38.500 --> 33:40.620
 of Colonial Pipeline being down.

33:40.620 --> 33:42.020
 And it was really interesting.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.660
 I thought it was the gas and the jet fuel, but it wasn't.

33:45.660 --> 33:47.420
 We were sort of prepared for that.

33:47.420 --> 33:48.980
 It was the diesel.

33:48.980 --> 33:52.220
 Without the diesel, the refineries couldn't function,

33:52.220 --> 33:54.900
 and it would have totally screwed up the economy.

33:54.900 --> 33:59.500
 And so there was almost this national security

33:59.500 --> 34:04.500
 economic impetus for them to pay this ransom.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.180
 And the other one I always think about is Baltimore.

34:07.180 --> 34:09.060
 When the city of Baltimore got hit,

34:09.060 --> 34:11.420
 I think the initial ransom demand

34:11.420 --> 34:13.860
 was something around $76,000.

34:13.860 --> 34:16.820
 It may have even started smaller than that.

34:16.820 --> 34:20.020
 And Baltimore stood its ground and didn't pay.

34:20.020 --> 34:25.140
 But ultimately, the cost to remediate was $18 million.

34:25.140 --> 34:26.780
 That's a lot for the city of Baltimore.

34:26.780 --> 34:29.620
 That's money that could have gone to public school education

34:29.620 --> 34:32.500
 and roads and public health.

34:32.500 --> 34:35.740
 And instead, it just went to rebuilding these systems

34:35.740 --> 34:36.340
 from scratch.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.820
 And so a lot of residents in Baltimore

34:38.820 --> 34:43.540
 were like, why the hell didn't you pay the $76,000?

34:43.540 --> 34:46.020
 So it's not obvious.

34:46.020 --> 34:48.140
 It's easy to say, don't pay.

34:48.140 --> 34:48.740
 Because why?

34:48.740 --> 34:52.940
 You're funding their R&D for the next go round.

34:52.940 --> 34:56.980
 But it's too often, it's too complicated.

34:56.980 --> 35:00.460
 So on the individual level, just like the way

35:00.460 --> 35:03.300
 I feel personally from this attack,

35:03.300 --> 35:05.300
 have you talked to people that were kind of victims

35:05.300 --> 35:09.700
 in the same way I was, but maybe more dramatic ways or so on,

35:09.700 --> 35:13.340
 in the same way that violence hurts people?

35:13.340 --> 35:15.260
 How much does this hurt people in your sense

35:15.260 --> 35:16.700
 and the way you researched it?

35:16.700 --> 35:23.060
 The worst ransomware attack I've covered on a personal level

35:23.060 --> 35:28.020
 was an attack on a hospital in Vermont.

35:28.020 --> 35:30.420
 And you think of this as like, OK,

35:30.420 --> 35:31.780
 it's hitting their IT networks.

35:31.780 --> 35:34.660
 They should still be able to treat patients.

35:34.660 --> 35:37.380
 But it turns out that cancer patients

35:37.380 --> 35:39.260
 couldn't get their chemo anymore.

35:39.260 --> 35:43.020
 Because the protocol of who gets what is very complicated.

35:43.020 --> 35:47.100
 And without it, nurses and doctors couldn't access it.

35:47.100 --> 35:50.500
 So they were turning chemo patients away,

35:50.500 --> 35:52.180
 cancer patients away.

35:52.180 --> 35:55.660
 One nurse told us, I don't know why people

35:55.660 --> 35:58.380
 aren't screaming about this, that the only thing I've

35:58.380 --> 36:00.100
 seen that even compares to what we're

36:00.100 --> 36:02.060
 seeing at this hospital right now

36:02.060 --> 36:04.460
 was when I worked in the burn unit

36:04.460 --> 36:06.980
 after the Boston Marathon bombing.

36:06.980 --> 36:10.540
 They really put it in these super dramatic terms.

36:10.540 --> 36:15.020
 And last year there was a report in the Wall Street Journal

36:15.020 --> 36:20.700
 where they attributed an infant death to a ransomware attack

36:20.700 --> 36:25.220
 because a mom came in and whatever device

36:25.220 --> 36:28.460
 they were using to monitor the fetus

36:28.460 --> 36:30.780
 wasn't working because of the ransomware attack.

36:30.780 --> 36:33.580
 And so they attributed this infant death

36:33.580 --> 36:34.660
 to the ransomware attack.

36:34.660 --> 36:39.100
 Now on a bigger scale but less personal,

36:39.100 --> 36:41.300
 when there was the NotPetya attack.

36:41.300 --> 36:46.980
 So this was an attack by Russia on Ukraine

36:46.980 --> 36:51.420
 that came at them through a supplier, a tax software

36:51.420 --> 36:53.860
 company in that case, that didn't just

36:53.860 --> 36:57.820
 hit any government agency or business in Ukraine

36:57.820 --> 36:59.660
 that used this tax software.

36:59.660 --> 37:02.780
 It actually hit any business all over the world that

37:02.780 --> 37:07.340
 had even a single employee working remotely in Ukraine.

37:07.340 --> 37:10.980
 So it hit Maersk, the shipping company, hit Pfizer,

37:10.980 --> 37:14.580
 hit FedEx, but the one I will never forget is Merck.

37:14.580 --> 37:17.740
 It paralyzed Merck's factories.

37:17.740 --> 37:20.260
 I mean, it really created an existential crisis

37:20.260 --> 37:21.620
 for the company.

37:21.620 --> 37:25.380
 Merck had to tap into the CDC's emergency supplies

37:25.380 --> 37:27.780
 of the Gardasil vaccine that year

37:27.780 --> 37:30.220
 because their whole vaccine production line had been

37:30.220 --> 37:32.140
 paralyzed in that attack.

37:32.140 --> 37:36.020
 Imagine if that was going to happen right now

37:36.020 --> 37:39.820
 to Pfizer or Moderna or Johnson and Johnson.

37:39.820 --> 37:41.220
 Imagine.

37:41.220 --> 37:46.100
 I mean, that would really create a global cyber terrorist

37:46.100 --> 37:47.260
 attack, essentially.

37:47.260 --> 37:49.340
 And that's almost unintentional.

37:49.340 --> 37:51.740
 I thought for a long time, I always

37:51.740 --> 37:54.860
 labeled it as collateral damage.

37:54.860 --> 37:59.780
 But actually, just today, there was a really impressive threat

37:59.780 --> 38:04.260
 researcher at Cisco, which has this threat intelligence

38:04.260 --> 38:07.220
 division called Talos, who said, stop calling it

38:07.220 --> 38:08.940
 collateral damage.

38:08.940 --> 38:12.900
 They could see who was going to get hit before they

38:12.900 --> 38:15.580
 deployed that malware.

38:15.580 --> 38:17.940
 It wasn't collateral damage.

38:17.940 --> 38:19.060
 It was intentional.

38:19.060 --> 38:23.180
 They meant to hit any business that did business with Ukraine.

38:23.180 --> 38:26.300
 It was to send a message to them, too.

38:26.300 --> 38:28.660
 So I don't know if that's accurate.

38:28.660 --> 38:31.500
 I always thought of it as sort of the sloppy collateral

38:31.500 --> 38:34.820
 damage, but it definitely made me think.

38:34.820 --> 38:37.020
 So how much of this between states

38:37.020 --> 38:42.980
 is going to be a part of war, these kinds of attacks

38:42.980 --> 38:48.700
 on Ukraine between Russia and US, Russia and China,

38:48.700 --> 38:51.100
 China and US?

38:51.100 --> 38:53.260
 Let's look at China and US.

38:53.260 --> 38:56.860
 Do you think China and US are going

38:56.860 --> 39:01.740
 to escalate something that would be called a war purely

39:01.740 --> 39:04.260
 in the space of cyber?

39:04.260 --> 39:12.260
 I believe any geopolitical conflict from now on

39:12.260 --> 39:17.260
 is guaranteed to have some cyber element to it.

39:17.260 --> 39:19.180
 The Department of Justice recently

39:19.180 --> 39:21.740
 declassified a report that said China has been hacking

39:21.740 --> 39:24.340
 into our pipelines, and it's not for intellectual property

39:24.340 --> 39:25.300
 theft.

39:25.300 --> 39:29.180
 It's to get a foothold so that if things escalate in Taiwan,

39:29.180 --> 39:31.460
 for example, they are where they need

39:31.460 --> 39:33.260
 to be to shut our pipelines down.

39:33.260 --> 39:35.260
 And we just got a little glimpse of what

39:35.260 --> 39:39.340
 that looked like with Colonial Pipeline and the panic buying

39:39.340 --> 39:42.460
 and the jet fuel shortages and that assessment I just

39:42.460 --> 39:44.580
 mentioned about the diesel.

39:44.580 --> 39:47.180
 So they're there.

39:47.180 --> 39:49.260
 They've gotten there.

39:49.260 --> 39:54.260
 Anytime I read a report about new aggression from fighter

39:54.260 --> 39:57.020
 jets, Chinese fighter jets in Taiwan,

39:57.020 --> 40:00.580
 or what's happening right now with Russia's buildup

40:00.580 --> 40:04.540
 on the Ukraine border, or India, Pakistan,

40:04.540 --> 40:07.420
 I'm always looking at it through a cyber lens.

40:07.420 --> 40:11.420
 And it really bothers me that other people aren't,

40:11.420 --> 40:15.500
 because there is no way that these governments

40:15.500 --> 40:17.780
 and these nation states are not going

40:17.780 --> 40:23.660
 to use their access to gain some advantage in those conflicts.

40:23.660 --> 40:27.780
 And I'm now in a position where I'm

40:27.780 --> 40:32.180
 an advisor to the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security

40:32.180 --> 40:33.740
 Agency at DHS.

40:33.740 --> 40:37.500
 So I'm not saying anything classified here.

40:37.500 --> 40:41.140
 But I just think that it's really important

40:41.140 --> 40:45.980
 to understand just generally what the collateral damage

40:45.980 --> 40:49.900
 could be for American businesses and critical infrastructure

40:49.900 --> 40:54.020
 in any of these escalated conflicts around the world.

40:54.020 --> 40:57.860
 Because just generally, our adversaries

40:57.860 --> 41:01.300
 have learned that they might never

41:01.300 --> 41:04.620
 be able to match us in terms of our traditional military

41:04.620 --> 41:08.020
 spending on traditional weapons and fighter jets.

41:08.020 --> 41:10.820
 But we have a very soft underbelly

41:10.820 --> 41:12.860
 when it comes to cyber.

41:12.860 --> 41:17.380
 80% or more of America's critical infrastructure,

41:17.380 --> 41:23.460
 so pipelines, power grid, nuclear plants, water systems,

41:23.460 --> 41:26.740
 is owned and operated by the private sector.

41:26.740 --> 41:31.540
 And for the most part, there is nothing out there legislating

41:31.540 --> 41:35.660
 that those companies share the fact they've been breached.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.660
 They don't even have to tell the government they've been hit.

41:38.660 --> 41:40.460
 There's nothing mandating that they even

41:40.460 --> 41:44.740
 meet a bare minimum standard of cybersecurity.

41:44.740 --> 41:46.620
 And that's it.

41:46.620 --> 41:49.380
 So even when there are these attacks, most of the time,

41:49.380 --> 41:51.380
 we don't even know about it.

41:51.380 --> 41:54.260
 So that is, if you were going to design a system

41:54.260 --> 41:57.940
 to be as blind and vulnerable as possible,

41:57.940 --> 42:00.580
 that's pretty good.

42:00.580 --> 42:02.620
 That's what it looks like is what we have here

42:02.620 --> 42:04.340
 in the United States.

42:04.340 --> 42:08.340
 And everyone here is just operating like,

42:08.340 --> 42:12.140
 let's just keep hooking up everything for convenience.

42:12.140 --> 42:14.740
 Software eats the world.

42:14.740 --> 42:18.580
 Let's just keep going for cost, for convenience sake,

42:18.580 --> 42:20.660
 just because we can.

42:20.660 --> 42:24.340
 And when you study these issues and you study these attacks

42:24.340 --> 42:29.340
 and you study the advancement and the uptick in frequency

42:29.340 --> 42:34.660
 and the lower barrier to entry that we see every single year,

42:34.660 --> 42:39.740
 you realize just how dumb software eats world is.

42:39.740 --> 42:43.100
 And no one has ever stopped to pause and think,

42:43.100 --> 42:47.940
 should we be hooking up these systems to the internet?

42:47.940 --> 42:49.700
 They've just been saying, can we?

42:49.700 --> 42:51.140
 Let's do it.

42:51.140 --> 42:52.460
 And that's a real problem.

42:52.460 --> 42:55.740
 And just in the last year, we've seen a record number

42:55.740 --> 42:56.860
 of zero day attacks.

42:56.860 --> 42:59.220
 I think there were 80 last year, which

42:59.220 --> 43:03.140
 is probably more than double what it was in 2019.

43:03.140 --> 43:06.940
 A lot of those were nation states.

43:06.940 --> 43:10.300
 We live in a world with a lot of geopolitical hot points

43:10.300 --> 43:11.500
 right now.

43:11.500 --> 43:15.060
 And where those geopolitical hot points are

43:15.060 --> 43:19.060
 are places where countries have been investing heavily

43:19.060 --> 43:21.660
 in offensive cyber tools.

43:21.660 --> 43:25.300
 If you're a nation state, the goal

43:25.300 --> 43:29.380
 would be to maximize the footprint of zero day,

43:29.380 --> 43:33.260
 like super secret zero day that nobody is aware of.

43:33.260 --> 43:37.420
 And whenever war is initiated, the huge negative effects

43:37.420 --> 43:39.900
 of shutting down infrastructure or any kind of zero day

43:39.900 --> 43:41.780
 is the chaos it creates.

43:41.780 --> 43:43.540
 So if you just, there's a certain threshold

43:43.540 --> 43:45.260
 when you create the chaos.

43:45.260 --> 43:46.460
 The market's plummeted.

43:46.460 --> 43:51.020
 Just everything goes to hell.

43:51.020 --> 43:52.860
 I mean, it's not just zero days.

43:52.860 --> 43:56.660
 We make it so easy for threat actors.

43:56.660 --> 44:00.420
 I mean, we're not using two factor authentication.

44:00.420 --> 44:02.700
 We're not patching.

44:02.700 --> 44:04.860
 There was the shell shock vulnerability

44:04.860 --> 44:08.220
 that was discovered a couple of years ago.

44:08.220 --> 44:11.220
 It's still being exploited because so many people

44:11.220 --> 44:13.900
 haven't fixed it.

44:13.900 --> 44:17.060
 So the zero days are really the sexy stuff.

44:17.060 --> 44:19.700
 And what really drew me to the zero day market

44:19.700 --> 44:24.460
 was the moral calculus we talked about, particularly

44:24.460 --> 44:26.740
 from the US government's point of view.

44:26.740 --> 44:31.980
 How do they justify leaving these systems so vulnerable

44:31.980 --> 44:34.940
 when we use them here and we're baking

44:34.940 --> 44:36.580
 more of our critical infrastructure

44:36.580 --> 44:38.620
 with this vulnerable software?

44:38.620 --> 44:41.580
 It's not like we're using one set of technology

44:41.580 --> 44:43.740
 and Russia is using another and China is using this.

44:43.740 --> 44:45.980
 We're all using the same technology.

44:45.980 --> 44:49.020
 So when you find a zero day in Windows,

44:49.020 --> 44:52.340
 you're not just leaving it open so you can spy on Russia

44:52.340 --> 44:54.540
 or implant yourself in the Russian grid.

44:54.540 --> 44:58.820
 You're leaving Americans vulnerable too.

44:58.820 --> 45:02.180
 But zero days are like, that is the secret sauce.

45:02.180 --> 45:04.980
 That's the superpower.

45:04.980 --> 45:07.900
 And I always say every country now,

45:07.900 --> 45:09.380
 with the exception of Antarctica,

45:09.380 --> 45:11.900
 someone added the Vatican to my list,

45:11.900 --> 45:16.700
 is trying to find offensive hacking tools and zero days

45:16.700 --> 45:17.500
 to make them work.

45:17.500 --> 45:20.620
 And those that don't have the skills

45:20.620 --> 45:23.460
 now have this market that they can tap into,

45:23.460 --> 45:26.380
 where $2.5 million, that's chump change

45:26.380 --> 45:27.900
 for a lot of these nation states.

45:27.900 --> 45:29.820
 It's a hell of a lot less than trying

45:29.820 --> 45:32.940
 to build the next fighter jet.

45:32.940 --> 45:34.460
 But yeah, the goal is chaos.

45:34.460 --> 45:38.420
 I mean, why did Russia turn off the lights twice in Ukraine?

45:39.620 --> 45:42.700
 I think part of it is chaos.

45:42.700 --> 45:46.220
 I think part of it is to sow the seeds of doubt

45:46.220 --> 45:47.920
 in their current government.

45:47.920 --> 45:50.380
 Your government can't even keep your lights on.

45:50.380 --> 45:52.760
 Why are you sticking with them?

45:52.760 --> 45:56.340
 Come over here and we'll keep your lights on at least.

45:56.340 --> 45:58.300
 There's like a little bit of that.

45:58.300 --> 46:04.620
 Nuclear weapons seems to have helped prevent nuclear war.

46:04.620 --> 46:08.260
 Is it possible that we have so many vulnerabilities

46:08.260 --> 46:11.260
 and so many attack vectors on each other

46:11.260 --> 46:15.220
 that you will kind of achieve the same kind of equilibrium

46:15.220 --> 46:16.940
 like mutually shared destruction?

46:17.740 --> 46:18.700
 Yeah.

46:18.700 --> 46:20.700
 That's one hopeful solution to this.

46:20.700 --> 46:23.760
 Do you have any hope for this particular solution?

46:23.760 --> 46:26.480
 You know, nuclear analogies always tend to fall apart

46:26.480 --> 46:27.500
 when it comes to cyber,

46:27.500 --> 46:30.940
 mainly because you don't need fissile material.

46:30.940 --> 46:33.260
 You know, you just need a laptop and the skills

46:33.260 --> 46:34.580
 and you're in the game.

46:34.580 --> 46:36.840
 So it's a really low barrier to entry.

46:38.180 --> 46:40.900
 The other thing is attribution is harder.

46:40.900 --> 46:44.260
 And we've seen countries muck around with attribution.

46:44.260 --> 46:47.100
 We've seen, you know, nation states piggyback

46:47.100 --> 46:50.020
 on other countries spy operations and just sit there

46:50.020 --> 46:53.340
 and siphon out whatever they're getting.

46:53.340 --> 46:56.120
 We learned some of that from the Snowden documents.

46:56.120 --> 46:58.860
 We've seen Russia hack into Iran's command

46:58.860 --> 47:01.340
 and control attack servers.

47:01.340 --> 47:05.380
 We've seen them hit a Saudi petrochemical plant

47:05.380 --> 47:08.140
 where they did neutralize the safety locks at the plant

47:08.140 --> 47:10.120
 and everyone assumed that it was Iran,

47:10.120 --> 47:13.600
 given Iran had been targeting Saudi oil companies forever.

47:13.600 --> 47:15.180
 But nope, it turned out that it was

47:15.180 --> 47:17.720
 a graduate research institute outside Moscow.

47:17.720 --> 47:20.220
 So you see countries kind of playing around

47:20.220 --> 47:21.060
 with attribution.

47:21.060 --> 47:22.220
 Why?

47:22.220 --> 47:25.340
 I think because they think, okay, if I do this,

47:25.340 --> 47:27.760
 like how am I gonna cover up that it came from me

47:27.760 --> 47:30.840
 because I don't wanna risk the response.

47:30.840 --> 47:33.140
 So people are sort of dancing around this.

47:33.140 --> 47:34.940
 It's just in a very different way.

47:34.940 --> 47:39.580
 And, you know, at the times I'd covered the Chinese hacks

47:39.580 --> 47:42.820
 of infrastructure companies like pipelines.

47:42.820 --> 47:46.100
 I'd covered the Russian probes of nuclear plants.

47:46.100 --> 47:50.060
 I'd covered the Russian attacks on the Ukraine grid.

47:50.060 --> 47:53.820
 And then in 2018, my colleague David Sanger and I

47:53.820 --> 47:57.100
 covered the fact that US Cyber Command

47:57.100 --> 47:59.580
 had been hacking into the Russian grid

47:59.580 --> 48:02.180
 and making a pretty loud show of it.

48:02.180 --> 48:05.220
 And when we went to the National Security Council,

48:05.220 --> 48:06.780
 because that's what journalists do

48:06.780 --> 48:08.080
 before they publish a story,

48:08.080 --> 48:11.380
 they give the other side a chance to respond,

48:11.380 --> 48:14.460
 I assumed we would be in for that really awkward,

48:14.460 --> 48:17.060
 painful conversation where they would say,

48:17.060 --> 48:20.260
 you will have blood on your hands if you publish this story.

48:20.260 --> 48:22.940
 And instead they gave us the opposite answer.

48:22.940 --> 48:25.100
 They said, we have no problem

48:25.100 --> 48:27.140
 with you publishing this story.

48:27.140 --> 48:28.020
 Why?

48:28.020 --> 48:29.340
 Well, they didn't say it out loud,

48:29.340 --> 48:33.120
 but it was pretty obvious they wanted Russia to know

48:33.120 --> 48:35.300
 that we're hacking into their power grid too,

48:35.300 --> 48:38.420
 and they better think twice before they do to us

48:38.420 --> 48:40.180
 what they had done to Ukraine.

48:40.180 --> 48:44.620
 So yeah, you know, we have stumbled into this new era

48:44.620 --> 48:47.740
 of mutually assured digital destruction.

48:47.740 --> 48:52.740
 I think another sort of quasi norm we've stumbled into

48:54.500 --> 48:57.660
 is proportional responses.

48:57.660 --> 49:00.540
 There's this idea that if you get hit,

49:00.540 --> 49:03.480
 you're allowed to respond proportionally

49:03.480 --> 49:05.780
 at a time and place of your choosing.

49:05.780 --> 49:08.420
 That is how the language always goes.

49:08.420 --> 49:12.880
 That's what Obama said after North Korea hit Sony.

49:12.880 --> 49:15.640
 We will respond at a time and place of our choosing.

49:15.640 --> 49:20.640
 But no one really knows like what that response looks like.

49:21.100 --> 49:22.740
 And so what you see a lot of the time

49:22.740 --> 49:27.140
 are just these like, just short of war attacks.

49:27.140 --> 49:29.300
 You know, Russia turned off the power in Ukraine,

49:29.300 --> 49:31.840
 but it wasn't like it stayed off for a week.

49:31.840 --> 49:34.800
 You know, it stayed off for a number of hours.

49:34.800 --> 49:39.620
 You know, NotPetya hit those companies pretty hard,

49:39.620 --> 49:41.340
 but no one died, you know?

49:41.340 --> 49:44.520
 And the question is, what's gonna happen when someone dies?

49:44.520 --> 49:49.520
 And can a nation state masquerade as a cyber criminal group,

49:49.780 --> 49:51.580
 as a ransomware group?

49:51.580 --> 49:53.500
 And that's what really complicates

49:53.500 --> 49:57.140
 coming to some sort of digital Geneva convention.

49:57.140 --> 50:01.140
 Like there's been a push from Brad Smith at Microsoft.

50:01.140 --> 50:03.660
 We need a digital Geneva convention.

50:03.660 --> 50:06.060
 And on its face, it sounds like a no brainer.

50:06.060 --> 50:08.880
 Yeah, why wouldn't we all agree to stop hacking

50:08.880 --> 50:11.140
 into each other's civilian hospital systems,

50:11.140 --> 50:15.580
 elections, power grid, pipelines?

50:15.580 --> 50:19.780
 But when you talk to people in the West,

50:19.780 --> 50:22.460
 officials in the West, they'll say, we would never,

50:22.460 --> 50:25.540
 we'd love to agree to it, but we'd never do it

50:25.540 --> 50:30.540
 when you're dealing with Xi or Putin or Kim Jong Un.

50:30.580 --> 50:35.280
 Because a lot of times, they outsource these operations

50:35.280 --> 50:37.100
 to cyber criminals.

50:37.100 --> 50:39.120
 In China, we see a lot of these attacks

50:39.120 --> 50:43.100
 come from this loose satellite network of private citizens

50:43.100 --> 50:46.720
 that work at the behest of the Ministry of State Security.

50:46.720 --> 50:51.380
 So how do you come to some sort of state to state agreement

50:51.380 --> 50:55.740
 when you're dealing with transnational actors

50:55.740 --> 50:59.180
 and cyber criminals, where it's really hard to pin down

50:59.180 --> 51:01.700
 whether that person was acting alone

51:01.700 --> 51:05.020
 or whether they were acting at the behest of the MSS

51:05.020 --> 51:06.600
 or the FSB.

51:06.600 --> 51:09.480
 And a couple of years ago, I remember,

51:09.480 --> 51:11.780
 can't remember if it was before or after NotPetya,

51:11.780 --> 51:14.780
 but Putin said, hackers are like artists

51:14.780 --> 51:18.140
 who wake up in the morning in a good mood and start painting.

51:18.140 --> 51:21.420
 In other words, I have no say over what they do or don't do.

51:21.420 --> 51:24.340
 So how do you come to some kind of norm

51:24.340 --> 51:26.940
 when that's how he's talking about these issues

51:26.940 --> 51:30.180
 and he's just decimated Merck and Pfizer

51:30.180 --> 51:34.220
 and another however many thousand companies?

51:34.220 --> 51:37.620
 That is the fundamental difference between nuclear weapons

51:37.620 --> 51:40.420
 and cyber attacks is the attribution

51:40.420 --> 51:42.580
 or one of the fundamental differences.

51:42.580 --> 51:45.220
 If you can fix one thing in the world

51:45.220 --> 51:47.220
 in terms of cybersecurity

51:47.220 --> 51:48.980
 that would make the world a better place,

51:48.980 --> 51:51.160
 what would you fix?

51:51.160 --> 51:54.140
 So you're not allowed to fix like authoritarian regimes

51:54.140 --> 51:55.460
 and you can't.

51:55.460 --> 51:57.980
 You have to keep that,

51:57.980 --> 52:00.620
 you have to keep human nature as it is.

52:00.620 --> 52:05.100
 In terms of on the security side, technologically speaking,

52:05.100 --> 52:06.540
 you mentioned there's no regulation

52:06.540 --> 52:09.020
 on companies in United States.

52:10.020 --> 52:14.860
 What if you could just fix with the snap of a finger,

52:14.860 --> 52:15.740
 what would you fix?

52:15.740 --> 52:19.840
 Two factor authentication, multifactor authentication.

52:19.840 --> 52:24.780
 It's ridiculous how many of these attacks come in

52:24.780 --> 52:27.640
 because someone didn't turn on multifactor authentication.

52:27.640 --> 52:30.740
 I mean, Colonial Pipeline, okay?

52:30.740 --> 52:34.300
 They took down the biggest conduit

52:34.300 --> 52:35.860
 for gas, jet fuel and diesel

52:35.860 --> 52:39.180
 to the East Coast of the United States of America, how?

52:39.180 --> 52:42.180
 Because they forgot to deactivate an old employee account

52:42.180 --> 52:44.700
 whose password had been traded on the dark web

52:44.700 --> 52:48.020
 and they'd never turned on two factor authentication.

52:48.020 --> 52:50.140
 This water treatment facility outside Florida

52:50.140 --> 52:51.700
 was hacked last year.

52:51.700 --> 52:53.220
 How did it happen?

52:53.220 --> 52:56.500
 They were using Windows XP from like a decade ago

52:56.500 --> 52:59.300
 that can't even get patches if you want it to

52:59.300 --> 53:01.700
 and they didn't have two factor authentication.

53:01.700 --> 53:02.700
 Time and time again,

53:02.700 --> 53:06.740
 if they just switched on two factor authentication,

53:06.740 --> 53:08.340
 some of these attacks wouldn't have been possible.

53:08.340 --> 53:10.080
 Now, if I could snap my fingers,

53:10.080 --> 53:11.780
 that's the thing I would do right now.

53:11.780 --> 53:15.100
 But of course, this is a cat and mouse game

53:15.100 --> 53:17.560
 and then the attackers onto the next thing.

53:17.560 --> 53:21.700
 But I think right now that is like bar none.

53:21.700 --> 53:24.660
 That is just, that is the easiest, simplest way

53:24.660 --> 53:25.900
 to deflect the most attacks.

53:25.900 --> 53:29.780
 And the name of the game right now isn't perfect security.

53:29.780 --> 53:32.220
 Perfect security is impossible.

53:32.220 --> 53:34.340
 They will always find a way in.

53:34.340 --> 53:35.460
 The name of the game right now

53:35.460 --> 53:39.060
 is make yourself a little bit harder to attack

53:39.060 --> 53:41.480
 than your competitor than anyone else out there

53:41.480 --> 53:44.320
 so that they just give up and move along.

53:44.320 --> 53:46.540
 And maybe if you are a target

53:46.540 --> 53:50.500
 for an advanced nation state or the SVR,

53:51.500 --> 53:53.860
 you're gonna get hacked no matter what.

53:53.860 --> 53:57.740
 But you can make cyber criminal groups deadbolt, is it?

53:57.740 --> 53:59.820
 You can make their jobs a lot harder

54:00.780 --> 54:03.180
 simply by doing the bare basics.

54:03.180 --> 54:05.260
 And the other thing is stop reusing your passwords.

54:05.260 --> 54:08.060
 But if I only get one, then two factor authentication.

54:08.060 --> 54:10.460
 So what is two factor authentication?

54:10.460 --> 54:13.260
 Factor one is what, logging in with a password.

54:13.260 --> 54:15.900
 And factor two is like have another device

54:15.900 --> 54:18.420
 or another channel through which you can confirm,

54:18.420 --> 54:19.500
 yeah, that's me.

54:19.500 --> 54:23.700
 Yes, usually this happens through some kind of text.

54:23.700 --> 54:26.740
 You get your one time code from Bank of America

54:26.740 --> 54:28.700
 or from Google.

54:28.700 --> 54:31.460
 The better way to do it is spend $20

54:31.460 --> 54:34.260
 buying yourself a Fido key on Amazon.

54:34.260 --> 54:36.100
 That's a hardware device.

54:36.100 --> 54:39.500
 And if you don't have that hardware device with you,

54:39.500 --> 54:41.300
 then you're not gonna get in.

54:41.300 --> 54:43.820
 And the whole goal is, I mean, basically,

54:43.820 --> 54:46.060
 my first half of my decade at The Times

54:46.060 --> 54:49.100
 was spent covering like the copy.

54:49.100 --> 54:51.380
 It was like Home Depot got breached,

54:51.380 --> 54:54.420
 News at 11, Target, Neumann Marcus,

54:54.420 --> 54:58.420
 like who wasn't hacked over the course of those five years?

54:58.420 --> 55:01.100
 And a lot of those companies that got hacked,

55:01.100 --> 55:02.220
 what did hackers take?

55:02.220 --> 55:05.500
 They took the credentials, they took the passwords.

55:05.500 --> 55:08.820
 They can make a pretty penny selling them on the dark web

55:08.820 --> 55:11.540
 and people reuse their passwords.

55:11.540 --> 55:15.580
 So you get one from God knows who, I don't know,

55:15.580 --> 55:19.340
 LastPass, worst case example, actually LastPass.

55:19.340 --> 55:21.860
 But you get one and then you go test it

55:21.860 --> 55:23.420
 on their email account.

55:23.420 --> 55:25.580
 And you go test it on their brokerage account

55:25.580 --> 55:28.620
 and you test it on their cold storage account.

55:28.620 --> 55:29.580
 That's how it works.

55:29.580 --> 55:32.900
 But if you have multi factor authentication,

55:32.900 --> 55:34.500
 then they can't get in

55:34.500 --> 55:36.740
 because they might have your password,

55:36.740 --> 55:38.060
 but they don't have your phone,

55:38.060 --> 55:39.740
 they don't have your Fido key.

55:41.180 --> 55:42.700
 So you keep them out.

55:42.700 --> 55:46.540
 And I get a lot of alerts that tell me

55:46.540 --> 55:49.820
 someone is trying to get into your Instagram account

55:49.820 --> 55:52.060
 or your Twitter account or your email account.

55:52.060 --> 55:55.820
 And I don't worry because I use multi factor authentication.

55:55.820 --> 55:57.180
 They can try all day.

55:58.380 --> 56:03.380
 Okay, I worry a little bit, but it's the simplest thing to do

56:03.820 --> 56:05.060
 and we don't even do it.

56:05.060 --> 56:06.860
 Well, there's an interface aspect to it

56:06.860 --> 56:09.820
 because it's pretty annoying if it's implemented poorly.

56:11.420 --> 56:13.060
 So actually bad implementation

56:13.060 --> 56:16.420
 of two factor authentication, not just bad,

56:16.420 --> 56:19.060
 but just something that adds friction

56:19.060 --> 56:21.380
 is a security vulnerability, I guess,

56:21.380 --> 56:23.500
 because it's really annoying.

56:23.500 --> 56:27.620
 Like I think MIT for a while had two factor authentication.

56:27.620 --> 56:28.580
 It was really annoying.

56:28.580 --> 56:33.020
 I just, like the number of times it pings you,

56:33.020 --> 56:38.020
 like it asks to reauthenticate across multiple subdomains.

56:39.300 --> 56:41.780
 Like it just feels like a pain.

56:42.780 --> 56:44.140
 I don't know what the right balance there.

56:44.140 --> 56:48.700
 Yeah, it feels like friction in our frictionless society.

56:48.700 --> 56:51.060
 It feels like friction, it's annoying.

56:51.060 --> 56:54.540
 That's security's biggest problem, it's annoying.

56:54.540 --> 56:57.900
 We need the Steve Jobs of security to come along

56:57.900 --> 56:59.620
 and we need to make it painless.

56:59.620 --> 57:02.100
 And actually on that point,

57:02.100 --> 57:07.100
 Apple has probably done more for security than anyone else

57:07.340 --> 57:10.900
 simply by introducing biometric authentication,

57:10.900 --> 57:13.660
 first with the fingerprint and then with face ID.

57:13.660 --> 57:17.460
 And it's not perfect, but if you think just eight years ago,

57:17.460 --> 57:20.420
 everyone was running around with either no passcode

57:20.420 --> 57:23.580
 and optional passcode or four digit passcode on their phone

57:23.580 --> 57:26.140
 that anyone, think of what you can get

57:26.140 --> 57:29.100
 when you get someone's iPhone, if you steal someone's iPhone

57:29.100 --> 57:32.620
 and props to them for introducing the fingerprint

57:32.620 --> 57:33.660
 and face ID.

57:33.660 --> 57:36.980
 And again, it wasn't perfect, but it was a huge step forward.

57:36.980 --> 57:40.220
 Now it's time to make another huge step forward.

57:41.140 --> 57:42.900
 I wanna see the password die.

57:42.900 --> 57:46.900
 I mean, it's gotten us as far as it was ever gonna get us.

57:46.900 --> 57:49.580
 And I hope whatever we come up with next

57:49.580 --> 57:52.380
 is not gonna be annoying, is gonna be seamless.

57:52.380 --> 57:55.060
 When I was at Google, that's what we worked on is,

57:55.060 --> 57:57.060
 and there's a lot of ways to call it

57:57.060 --> 57:59.900
 active authentication, passive authentication.

57:59.900 --> 58:02.500
 So basically you use biometric data,

58:02.500 --> 58:05.980
 not just like a fingerprint, but everything from your body

58:05.980 --> 58:09.140
 to identify who you are, like movement patterns.

58:09.140 --> 58:12.700
 So it basically create a lot of layers of protection

58:12.700 --> 58:15.460
 where it's very difficult to fake,

58:15.460 --> 58:20.460
 including like face unlock, checking that it's your actual

58:20.580 --> 58:23.020
 face, like the liveness tests.

58:23.020 --> 58:26.220
 So like from video, so unlocking it with video,

58:26.220 --> 58:30.020
 voice, the way you move the phone,

58:31.020 --> 58:33.220
 the way you take it out of the pocket, that kind of thing.

58:33.220 --> 58:34.980
 All of those factors.

58:34.980 --> 58:37.300
 It's a really hard problem though.

58:37.300 --> 58:42.020
 And ultimately, it's very difficult to beat the password

58:42.020 --> 58:43.540
 in terms of security.

58:43.540 --> 58:46.140
 Well, there's a company that I actually will call out

58:46.140 --> 58:48.180
 and that's Abnormal Security.

58:48.180 --> 58:51.420
 So they work on email attacks.

58:51.420 --> 58:56.420
 And it was started by a couple of guys who were doing,

58:56.620 --> 58:59.340
 I think, ad tech at Twitter.

58:59.340 --> 59:02.500
 So ad technology now, like it's a joke

59:02.500 --> 59:03.980
 how much they know about us.

59:03.980 --> 59:06.580
 You always hear the conspiracy theories that

59:06.580 --> 59:08.940
 you saw someone's shoes and next thing you know,

59:08.940 --> 59:10.380
 it's on your phone.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.220
 It's amazing what they know about you.

59:13.660 --> 59:15.780
 And they're basically taking that

59:16.660 --> 59:19.700
 and they're applying it to attacks.

59:19.700 --> 59:22.740
 So they're saying, okay, if you're,

59:22.740 --> 59:24.940
 this is what your email patterns are.

59:24.940 --> 59:26.360
 It might be different for you and me

59:26.360 --> 59:28.620
 because we're emailing strangers all the time.

59:29.660 --> 59:30.980
 But for most people,

59:30.980 --> 59:33.900
 their email patterns are pretty predictable.

59:33.900 --> 59:38.380
 And if something strays from that pattern, that's abnormal

59:38.380 --> 59:41.740
 and they'll block it, they'll investigate it.

59:41.740 --> 59:43.920
 And that's great.

59:43.920 --> 59:48.640
 Let's start using that kind of targeted ad technology

59:48.640 --> 59:50.540
 to protect people.

59:50.540 --> 59:52.980
 And yeah, I mean, it's not gonna get us away

59:52.980 --> 59:56.300
 from the password and using multifactor authentication,

59:56.300 --> 59:59.980
 but the technology is out there

59:59.980 --> 1:00:02.100
 and we just have to figure out how to use it

1:00:02.100 --> 1:00:05.680
 in a really seamless way because it doesn't matter

1:00:05.680 --> 1:00:07.580
 if you have the perfect security solution

1:00:07.580 --> 1:00:08.420
 if no one uses it.

1:00:08.420 --> 1:00:10.380
 I mean, when I started at the times

1:00:10.380 --> 1:00:12.220
 when I was trying to be really good

1:00:12.220 --> 1:00:14.900
 about protecting sources,

1:00:14.900 --> 1:00:17.740
 I was trying to use PGP encryption

1:00:17.740 --> 1:00:19.820
 and it's like, it didn't work.

1:00:19.820 --> 1:00:22.420
 The number of mistakes I would probably make

1:00:22.420 --> 1:00:27.100
 just trying to email someone with PGP just wasn't worth it.

1:00:27.100 --> 1:00:32.100
 And then Signal came along and Signal made it wicker.

1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:34.700
 They made it a lot easier

1:00:34.700 --> 1:00:37.020
 to send someone an encrypted text message.

1:00:37.020 --> 1:00:42.020
 So we have to start investing in creative minds,

1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:45.420
 in good security design.

1:00:45.420 --> 1:00:48.020
 I really think that's the hack that's gonna get us

1:00:48.020 --> 1:00:50.100
 out of where we are today.

1:00:50.100 --> 1:00:52.460
 What about social engineering?

1:00:52.460 --> 1:00:56.760
 Do you worry about this sort of hacking people?

1:00:57.800 --> 1:01:00.940
 Yes, I mean, this is the worst nightmare

1:01:00.940 --> 1:01:04.200
 of every chief information security officer out there.

1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:09.020
 Social engineering, we work from home now.

1:01:10.100 --> 1:01:15.100
 I saw this woman posted online about how her husband,

1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:16.780
 it went viral today,

1:01:16.780 --> 1:01:20.020
 but it was her husband had this problem at work.

1:01:20.020 --> 1:01:22.460
 They hired a guy named John

1:01:22.460 --> 1:01:26.060
 and now the guy that shows up for work every day

1:01:26.060 --> 1:01:27.540
 doesn't act like John.

1:01:29.620 --> 1:01:31.060
 I mean, think about that.

1:01:31.060 --> 1:01:34.000
 Like think about the potential for social engineering

1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.780
 in that context.

1:01:35.780 --> 1:01:38.940
 You apply for a job and you put on a pretty face,

1:01:38.940 --> 1:01:40.380
 you hire an actor or something,

1:01:40.380 --> 1:01:42.660
 and then you just get inside the organization

1:01:42.660 --> 1:01:45.700
 and get access to all that organization's data.

1:01:45.700 --> 1:01:47.420
 A couple of years ago,

1:01:47.420 --> 1:01:51.420
 Saudi Arabia planted spies inside Twitter.

1:01:51.420 --> 1:01:52.260
 Why?

1:01:52.260 --> 1:01:54.460
 Probably because they were trying to figure out

1:01:54.460 --> 1:01:55.380
 who these people were

1:01:55.380 --> 1:01:58.220
 who were criticizing the regime on Twitter.

1:01:58.220 --> 1:02:00.020
 They couldn't do it with a hack from the outside,

1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:02.260
 so why not plant people on the inside?

1:02:02.260 --> 1:02:04.540
 And that's like the worst nightmare.

1:02:04.540 --> 1:02:09.540
 And it also, unfortunately, creates all kinds of xenophobia

1:02:09.780 --> 1:02:11.340
 at a lot of these organizations.

1:02:11.340 --> 1:02:14.780
 I mean, if you're gonna have to take that into consideration,

1:02:14.780 --> 1:02:16.700
 then organizations are gonna start looking

1:02:16.700 --> 1:02:19.420
 really skeptically and suspiciously

1:02:19.420 --> 1:02:22.180
 at someone who applies for that job from China.

1:02:23.020 --> 1:02:25.760
 And we've seen that go really badly

1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:28.540
 at places like the Department of Commerce,

1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:31.180
 where they basically accuse people of being spies

1:02:31.180 --> 1:02:32.020
 that aren't spies.

1:02:32.020 --> 1:02:35.380
 So it is the hardest problem to solve,

1:02:35.380 --> 1:02:37.380
 and it's never been harder to solve

1:02:37.380 --> 1:02:39.180
 than right at this very moment

1:02:39.180 --> 1:02:41.320
 when there's so much pressure for companies

1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:43.940
 to let people work remotely.

1:02:43.940 --> 1:02:45.520
 That's actually why I'm single.

1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:48.420
 I'm suspicious that China and Russia,

1:02:48.420 --> 1:02:49.700
 every time I meet somebody,

1:02:49.700 --> 1:02:52.980
 are trying to plant and get insider information,

1:02:52.980 --> 1:02:54.740
 so I'm very, very suspicious.

1:02:54.740 --> 1:02:57.620
 I keep putting the touring test in front, no.

1:02:57.620 --> 1:03:02.620
 No, I have a friend who worked inside NSA

1:03:02.700 --> 1:03:04.840
 and was one of their top hackers,

1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:08.540
 and he's like, every time I go to Russia,

1:03:08.540 --> 1:03:10.820
 I get hit on by these 10s.

1:03:10.820 --> 1:03:12.240
 And I come home, my friends are like,

1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:13.780
 I'm sorry, you're not a 10.

1:03:13.780 --> 1:03:17.020
 Like, it's a common story.

1:03:17.020 --> 1:03:20.940
 I mean, it's difficult to trust humans

1:03:20.940 --> 1:03:23.340
 in this day and age online.

1:03:23.340 --> 1:03:27.460
 So we're working remotely, that's one thing,

1:03:27.460 --> 1:03:31.620
 but just interacting with people on the internet,

1:03:31.620 --> 1:03:35.300
 sounds ridiculous, but because of this podcast in part,

1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:37.920
 I've gotten to meet some incredible people,

1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:42.380
 but it makes you nervous to trust folks,

1:03:43.300 --> 1:03:47.260
 and I don't know how to solve that problem.

1:03:48.100 --> 1:03:51.460
 So I'm talking with Mark Zuckerberg,

1:03:51.460 --> 1:03:53.460
 who dreams about creating the metaverse.

1:03:55.540 --> 1:03:56.820
 What do you do about that world

1:03:56.820 --> 1:04:01.460
 where more and more our lives is in the digital sphere?

1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:05.300
 Like, one way to phrase it is,

1:04:05.300 --> 1:04:10.060
 most of our meaningful experiences at some point

1:04:10.060 --> 1:04:15.060
 will be online, like falling in love, getting a job,

1:04:15.780 --> 1:04:19.860
 or experiencing a moment of happiness with a friend,

1:04:19.860 --> 1:04:23.060
 with a new friend made online, all of those things.

1:04:23.060 --> 1:04:25.500
 Like, more and more, the fun we do,

1:04:25.500 --> 1:04:28.940
 the things that make us love life will happen online,

1:04:28.940 --> 1:04:32.940
 and if those things have an avatar that's digital,

1:04:32.940 --> 1:04:35.820
 that's like a way to hack into people's minds,

1:04:35.820 --> 1:04:39.500
 whether it's with AI or kind of troll farms

1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:40.940
 or something like that.

1:04:40.940 --> 1:04:43.340
 I don't know if there's a way to protect against that.

1:04:43.340 --> 1:04:48.340
 That might fundamentally rely on our faith

1:04:49.420 --> 1:04:51.940
 in how good human nature is.

1:04:51.940 --> 1:04:54.900
 So if most people are good, we're going to be okay,

1:04:54.900 --> 1:04:59.220
 but if people will tend towards manipulation

1:04:59.220 --> 1:05:03.300
 and malevolent behavior in search of power,

1:05:03.300 --> 1:05:04.540
 then we're screwed.

1:05:05.540 --> 1:05:07.860
 So I don't know if you can comment

1:05:07.860 --> 1:05:10.380
 on how to keep the metaverse secure.

1:05:10.380 --> 1:05:13.660
 Yeah, I mean, all I thought about

1:05:13.660 --> 1:05:16.700
 when you were talking just now was my three year old son.

1:05:16.700 --> 1:05:17.540
 Yeah.

1:05:19.540 --> 1:05:22.500
 He asked me the other day, what's the internet, mom?

1:05:22.500 --> 1:05:25.300
 And I just almost wanted to cry.

1:05:25.300 --> 1:05:29.500
 You know, I don't want that for him.

1:05:29.500 --> 1:05:32.420
 I don't want all of his most meaningful experiences

1:05:32.420 --> 1:05:33.260
 to be online.

1:05:33.260 --> 1:05:35.340
 You know, by the time that happens,

1:05:36.900 --> 1:05:39.540
 how do you know that person's human,

1:05:39.540 --> 1:05:41.540
 that avatar's human?

1:05:41.540 --> 1:05:42.860
 You know, I believe in free speech.

1:05:42.860 --> 1:05:46.740
 I don't believe in free speech for robots and bots.

1:05:46.740 --> 1:05:51.660
 And like, look what just happened over the last six years.

1:05:51.660 --> 1:05:53.860
 You know, we had bots pretending

1:05:53.860 --> 1:05:56.860
 to be Black Lives Matter activists

1:05:56.860 --> 1:05:59.300
 just to sow some division,

1:05:59.300 --> 1:06:01.700
 or, you know, Texas secessionists,

1:06:01.700 --> 1:06:06.580
 or, you know, organizing anti Hillary protests,

1:06:06.580 --> 1:06:08.980
 or just to sow more division,

1:06:08.980 --> 1:06:12.420
 to tie us up in our own politics

1:06:12.420 --> 1:06:15.660
 so that we're so paralyzed we can't get anything done.

1:06:15.660 --> 1:06:17.220
 We can't make any progress

1:06:17.220 --> 1:06:19.940
 and we definitely can't handle our adversaries

1:06:19.940 --> 1:06:21.580
 and their longterm thinking.

1:06:22.980 --> 1:06:25.260
 It really scares me.

1:06:25.260 --> 1:06:28.300
 And here's where I just come back to.

1:06:28.300 --> 1:06:32.220
 Just because we can create the metaverse,

1:06:32.220 --> 1:06:36.380
 you know, just because it sounds like the next logical step

1:06:36.380 --> 1:06:39.860
 in our digital revolution,

1:06:39.860 --> 1:06:43.940
 do I really want my child's most significant moments

1:06:43.940 --> 1:06:45.540
 to be online?

1:06:45.540 --> 1:06:47.940
 They weren't for me, you know?

1:06:47.940 --> 1:06:51.940
 So maybe I'm just stuck in that old school thinking,

1:06:51.940 --> 1:06:54.580
 or maybe I've seen too much.

1:06:54.580 --> 1:06:58.420
 And I'm really sick of being

1:06:58.420 --> 1:07:01.740
 the guinea pig parent generation for these things.

1:07:01.740 --> 1:07:04.380
 I mean, it's hard enough with screen time.

1:07:04.380 --> 1:07:09.380
 Like thinking about how to manage the metaverse as a parent

1:07:10.260 --> 1:07:13.660
 to a young boy, like I can't even let my head go there.

1:07:13.660 --> 1:07:16.300
 That's so terrifying for me.

1:07:16.300 --> 1:07:21.300
 But we've never stopped any new technology

1:07:21.300 --> 1:07:23.980
 just because it introduces risks.

1:07:23.980 --> 1:07:27.860
 We've always said, okay, the promise of this technology

1:07:27.860 --> 1:07:31.700
 means we should keep going, keep pressing ahead.

1:07:31.700 --> 1:07:35.500
 We just need to figure out new ways to manage that risk.

1:07:35.500 --> 1:07:39.900
 And you know, that's the blockchain right now.

1:07:39.900 --> 1:07:44.820
 Like when I was covering all of these ransomware attacks,

1:07:44.820 --> 1:07:48.660
 I thought, okay, this is gonna be it for cryptocurrency.

1:07:48.660 --> 1:07:51.380
 You know, governments are gonna put the kibosh down.

1:07:51.380 --> 1:07:54.380
 They're gonna put the hammer down and say enough is enough.

1:07:54.380 --> 1:07:56.900
 Like we have to put this genie back in the bottle

1:07:56.900 --> 1:07:58.540
 because it's enabled ransomware.

1:07:58.540 --> 1:08:02.700
 I mean, five years ago, they would hijack your PC

1:08:02.700 --> 1:08:05.500
 and they'd say, go to the local pharmacy,

1:08:05.500 --> 1:08:08.340
 get a eGift card and tell us what the pin is.

1:08:08.340 --> 1:08:10.420
 And then we'll get your $200.

1:08:10.420 --> 1:08:13.420
 Now it's pay us, you know, five Bitcoin.

1:08:13.420 --> 1:08:16.140
 And so there's no doubt cryptocurrencies

1:08:16.140 --> 1:08:17.820
 enabled ransomware attacks,

1:08:17.820 --> 1:08:22.540
 but after the Colonial Pipeline ransom was seized,

1:08:22.540 --> 1:08:25.700
 because if you remember, the FBI was actually able to go in

1:08:25.700 --> 1:08:28.100
 and claw some of it back from DarkSide,

1:08:28.100 --> 1:08:30.260
 which was the ransomware group that hid it.

1:08:31.140 --> 1:08:34.060
 And I spoke to these guys at TRM Labs.

1:08:34.060 --> 1:08:37.460
 So they're one of these blockchain intelligence companies.

1:08:37.460 --> 1:08:38.660
 And a lot of people that work there

1:08:38.660 --> 1:08:40.860
 used to work at the treasury.

1:08:40.860 --> 1:08:42.140
 And what they said to me was,

1:08:42.140 --> 1:08:46.420
 yeah, cryptocurrency has enabled ransomware,

1:08:46.420 --> 1:08:51.420
 but to track down that ransom payment would have taken,

1:08:52.100 --> 1:08:54.780
 you know, if we were dealing with fiat currency,

1:08:54.780 --> 1:08:58.340
 would have taken us years to get to that one bank account

1:08:58.340 --> 1:09:01.500
 or belonging to that one front company in the Seychelles.

1:09:01.500 --> 1:09:04.060
 And now thanks to the blockchain,

1:09:04.060 --> 1:09:08.340
 we can track the movement of those funds in real time.

1:09:08.340 --> 1:09:09.500
 And you know what?

1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:11.980
 You know, these payments are not as anonymous

1:09:11.980 --> 1:09:13.300
 as people think.

1:09:13.300 --> 1:09:16.660
 Like we still can use our old hacking ways and zero days

1:09:16.660 --> 1:09:19.540
 and, you know, old school intelligence methods

1:09:19.540 --> 1:09:21.780
 to find out who owns that private wallet

1:09:21.780 --> 1:09:23.460
 and how to get to it.

1:09:23.460 --> 1:09:27.620
 So it's a curse in some ways and that it's an enabler,

1:09:27.620 --> 1:09:29.420
 but it's also a blessing.

1:09:29.420 --> 1:09:31.220
 And they said that same thing to me

1:09:31.220 --> 1:09:32.060
 that I just said to you.

1:09:32.060 --> 1:09:37.060
 They said, we've never shut down a promising new technology

1:09:37.460 --> 1:09:39.140
 because it introduced risk.

1:09:39.140 --> 1:09:42.660
 We just figured out how to manage that risk.

1:09:42.660 --> 1:09:44.380
 And I think that's where the conversation

1:09:44.380 --> 1:09:45.820
 unfortunately has to go,

1:09:45.820 --> 1:09:50.820
 is how do we in the metaverse use technology to fix things?

1:09:53.580 --> 1:09:56.980
 So maybe we'll finally be able to, not finally,

1:09:56.980 --> 1:10:00.940
 but figure out a way to solve the identity problem

1:10:00.940 --> 1:10:03.380
 on the internet, meaning like a blue check mark

1:10:03.380 --> 1:10:06.940
 for actual human and connect it to identity

1:10:06.940 --> 1:10:11.340
 or like a fingerprint so you can prove your you.

1:10:11.340 --> 1:10:15.740
 And yet do it in a way that doesn't involve the company

1:10:15.740 --> 1:10:17.540
 having all your data.

1:10:17.540 --> 1:10:20.740
 So giving you, allowing you to maintain control

1:10:20.740 --> 1:10:23.780
 over your data, or if you don't,

1:10:23.780 --> 1:10:25.940
 then there's a complete transparency

1:10:25.940 --> 1:10:28.860
 of how that data is being used, all those kinds of things.

1:10:28.860 --> 1:10:31.980
 And maybe as you educate more and more people,

1:10:32.900 --> 1:10:36.060
 they would demand in a capitalist society

1:10:36.060 --> 1:10:38.420
 that the companies that they give their data to

1:10:38.420 --> 1:10:40.980
 will respect that data.

1:10:40.980 --> 1:10:43.580
 Yeah, I mean, there is this company,

1:10:43.580 --> 1:10:48.500
 and I hope they succeed, their name's PII Ono, Piano.

1:10:48.500 --> 1:10:52.140
 And they wanna create a vault for your personal information

1:10:52.140 --> 1:10:54.380
 inside every organization.

1:10:54.380 --> 1:10:57.940
 And ultimately, if I'm gonna call Delta Airlines

1:10:57.940 --> 1:10:59.380
 to book a flight,

1:10:59.380 --> 1:11:02.420
 they don't need to know my social security number.

1:11:02.420 --> 1:11:05.460
 They don't need to know my birth date.

1:11:05.460 --> 1:11:08.860
 They're just gonna send me a one time token to my phone.

1:11:08.860 --> 1:11:11.700
 My phone's gonna say, or my Fido key is gonna say,

1:11:11.700 --> 1:11:13.460
 yep, it's her.

1:11:13.460 --> 1:11:16.820
 And then we're gonna talk about my identity like a token,

1:11:16.820 --> 1:11:17.660
 some random token.

1:11:17.660 --> 1:11:20.060
 They don't need to know exactly who I am.

1:11:20.060 --> 1:11:23.780
 They just need to know the system trust that I am,

1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:27.900
 who I say I am, but they don't get access to my PII data.

1:11:27.900 --> 1:11:30.340
 They don't get access to my social security number,

1:11:30.340 --> 1:11:34.780
 my location, or the fact I'm a Times journalist.

1:11:34.780 --> 1:11:37.380
 I think that's the way the world's gonna go.

1:11:37.380 --> 1:11:40.780
 We have, enough is enough on sort of

1:11:40.780 --> 1:11:44.100
 losing our personal information everywhere,

1:11:44.100 --> 1:11:48.900
 letting data marketing companies track our every move.

1:11:48.900 --> 1:11:51.020
 They don't need to know who I am.

1:11:51.020 --> 1:11:52.500
 Okay, I get it.

1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:57.460
 We're stuck in this world where the internet runs on ads.

1:11:57.460 --> 1:11:59.940
 So ads are not gonna go away,

1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:03.020
 but they don't need to know I'm Nicole Perlora.

1:12:03.020 --> 1:12:06.580
 They can know that I am token number, you know,

1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:08.660
 X567.

1:12:08.660 --> 1:12:11.020
 And they can let you know what they know

1:12:11.020 --> 1:12:14.020
 and give you control about removing the things they know.

1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:15.820
 Yeah, right to be forgotten.

1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:17.940
 To me, you should be able to walk away

1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:20.260
 with a single press of a button.

1:12:20.260 --> 1:12:22.060
 And I also believe that most people,

1:12:22.060 --> 1:12:25.220
 given the choice to walk away, won't walk away.

1:12:25.220 --> 1:12:28.540
 They'll just feel better about having the option

1:12:28.540 --> 1:12:30.700
 to walk away when they understand the trade offs.

1:12:30.700 --> 1:12:32.560
 If you walk away, you're not gonna get

1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:34.140
 some of the personalized experiences

1:12:34.140 --> 1:12:35.980
 that you would otherwise get,

1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:38.580
 like a personalized feed and all those kinds of things.

1:12:38.580 --> 1:12:40.900
 But the freedom to walk away is,

1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:44.220
 I think, really powerful.

1:12:44.220 --> 1:12:45.460
 And obviously, what you're saying,

1:12:45.460 --> 1:12:48.620
 it's definitely, there's all of these HTML forms

1:12:48.620 --> 1:12:51.220
 where you have to enter your phone number and email

1:12:51.220 --> 1:12:54.740
 and private information from Delta, every single airline.

1:12:55.780 --> 1:12:56.780
 New York Times.

1:12:58.860 --> 1:13:00.580
 I have so many opinions on this.

1:13:00.580 --> 1:13:03.420
 Just the friction and the sign up

1:13:03.420 --> 1:13:04.840
 and all of those kinds of things.

1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:07.200
 I should be able to, this has to do with everything.

1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:08.860
 This has to do with payment, too.

1:13:09.820 --> 1:13:11.780
 Payment should be trivial.

1:13:11.780 --> 1:13:13.220
 It should be one click,

1:13:13.220 --> 1:13:16.980
 and one click to unsubscribe and subscribe,

1:13:16.980 --> 1:13:19.540
 and one click to provide all of your information

1:13:19.540 --> 1:13:21.700
 that's necessary for the subscription service,

1:13:21.700 --> 1:13:24.140
 for the transaction service, whatever that is,

1:13:24.140 --> 1:13:25.940
 getting a ticket, as opposed to,

1:13:25.940 --> 1:13:28.140
 I have all of these fake phone numbers and emails

1:13:28.140 --> 1:13:29.380
 that I use in Alta Sign Up,

1:13:29.380 --> 1:13:34.320
 because you never know if one site is hacked,

1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:37.560
 then it's just going to propagate to everything else.

1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:38.780
 Yeah.

1:13:38.780 --> 1:13:41.080
 And there's low hanging fruit,

1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:44.420
 and I hope Congress does something.

1:13:44.420 --> 1:13:46.620
 And frankly, I think it's negligent they haven't

1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:51.620
 on the fact that elderly people are getting spammed to death

1:13:51.980 --> 1:13:56.460
 on their phones these days with fake car warranty scams.

1:13:56.460 --> 1:13:59.500
 And I mean, my dad was in the hospital last year,

1:13:59.500 --> 1:14:02.060
 and I was in the hospital room, and his phone kept buzzing,

1:14:02.060 --> 1:14:07.060
 and I look at it, and it's just spam attack after spam attack,

1:14:08.220 --> 1:14:13.180
 people nonstop calling about his freaking car warranty,

1:14:13.180 --> 1:14:15.980
 why they're trying to get his social security number,

1:14:15.980 --> 1:14:17.660
 they're trying to get his PII,

1:14:17.660 --> 1:14:19.860
 they're trying to get this information.

1:14:19.860 --> 1:14:24.020
 We need to figure out how to put those people

1:14:24.020 --> 1:14:28.700
 in jail for life, and we need to figure out

1:14:28.700 --> 1:14:32.500
 why in the hell we are being required

1:14:32.500 --> 1:14:36.980
 or asked to hand over our social security number

1:14:36.980 --> 1:14:39.900
 and our home address and our passport,

1:14:39.900 --> 1:14:43.320
 all of that information to every retailer who asks.

1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:45.200
 I mean, that's insanity.

1:14:46.300 --> 1:14:49.740
 And there's no question they're not protecting it

1:14:49.740 --> 1:14:54.740
 because it keeps showing up in spam or identity theft

1:14:55.060 --> 1:14:57.060
 or credit card theft or worse.

1:14:57.060 --> 1:15:00.200
 Well, spam is getting better, and maybe I need to,

1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:02.580
 as a side note, make a public announcement.

1:15:02.580 --> 1:15:07.360
 Please clip this out, which is if you get an email

1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:11.420
 or a message from Lex Friedman saying how much

1:15:12.380 --> 1:15:16.900
 I, Lex, appreciate you and love you and so on,

1:15:16.900 --> 1:15:19.640
 and please connect with me on my WhatsApp number

1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:23.420
 and I will give you Bitcoin or something like that,

1:15:23.420 --> 1:15:25.020
 please do not click.

1:15:25.020 --> 1:15:29.040
 And I'm aware that there's a lot of this going on,

1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:30.120
 a very large amount.

1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:32.180
 I can't do anything about it.

1:15:32.180 --> 1:15:33.800
 This is on every single platform.

1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:36.020
 It's happening more and more and more,

1:15:36.020 --> 1:15:40.960
 which I've been recently informed that they're not emailing.

1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:42.920
 So it's cross platform.

1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:46.060
 They're taking people's, they're somehow,

1:15:46.060 --> 1:15:50.500
 this is fascinating to me because they are taking people

1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:53.860
 who comment on various social platforms

1:15:53.860 --> 1:15:56.060
 and they somehow reverse engineer.

1:15:56.060 --> 1:15:57.780
 They figure out what their email is

1:15:57.780 --> 1:16:00.780
 and they send an email to that person saying,

1:16:00.780 --> 1:16:04.060
 from Lex Friedman, and it's like a heartfelt email

1:16:04.060 --> 1:16:05.180
 with links.

1:16:05.180 --> 1:16:07.460
 It's fascinating because it's cross platform now.

1:16:07.460 --> 1:16:11.060
 It's not just a spam bot that's messaging

1:16:11.060 --> 1:16:13.500
 and a comment that's in a reply.

1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:16.420
 They are saying, okay, this person cares

1:16:16.420 --> 1:16:18.520
 about this other person on social media.

1:16:18.520 --> 1:16:20.460
 So I'm going to find another channel,

1:16:20.460 --> 1:16:22.660
 which in their mind probably increases

1:16:22.660 --> 1:16:26.880
 and it does the likelihood that they'll get the people

1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:28.980
 to click and they do.

1:16:28.980 --> 1:16:30.180
 I don't know what to do about that.

1:16:30.180 --> 1:16:32.180
 It makes me really, really sad,

1:16:32.180 --> 1:16:33.740
 especially with podcasting.

1:16:33.740 --> 1:16:36.780
 There's an intimacy that people feel connected

1:16:36.780 --> 1:16:37.820
 and they get really excited.

1:16:37.820 --> 1:16:40.480
 Okay, cool, I wanna talk to Lex.

1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:43.860
 And they click.

1:16:45.400 --> 1:16:50.400
 And I get angry at the people that do this.

1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:55.800
 I mean, it's like the John that gets hired,

1:16:55.800 --> 1:16:57.260
 the fake employee.

1:16:57.260 --> 1:16:58.520
 I mean, I don't know what to do about that.

1:16:58.520 --> 1:17:02.200
 I mean, I suppose the solution is education.

1:17:02.200 --> 1:17:04.880
 It's telling people to be skeptical

1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:07.020
 on the stuff they click.

1:17:07.020 --> 1:17:09.520
 That balance with the technology solution

1:17:09.520 --> 1:17:14.080
 of creating maybe like two factor authentication

1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:17.840
 and maybe helping identify things

1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:20.320
 that are likely to be spam, I don't know.

1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:21.960
 But then the machine learning there is tricky

1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:24.360
 because you don't wanna add a lot of extra friction

1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:28.160
 that just annoys people because they'll turn it off.

1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:30.680
 Because you have the accept cookies thing, right?

1:17:30.680 --> 1:17:32.400
 That everybody has to click on now,

1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:34.920
 so now they completely ignore the accept cookies.

1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:39.920
 This is very difficult to find that frictionless security.

1:17:42.200 --> 1:17:43.760
 You mentioned Snowden.

1:17:43.760 --> 1:17:48.320
 You've talked about looking through the NSA documents

1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:51.980
 he leaked and doing the hard work of that.

1:17:51.980 --> 1:17:54.480
 What do you make of Edward Snowden?

1:17:54.480 --> 1:17:56.680
 What have you learned from those documents?

1:17:56.680 --> 1:17:57.980
 What do you think of him?

1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:02.400
 In the long arc of history,

1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:05.480
 is Edward Snowden a hero or a villain?

1:18:05.480 --> 1:18:07.480
 I think he's neither.

1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:11.440
 I have really complicated feelings about Edward Snowden.

1:18:12.880 --> 1:18:15.740
 On the one hand, I'm a journalist at heart

1:18:15.740 --> 1:18:19.560
 and more transparency is good.

1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:22.560
 And I'm grateful for the conversations

1:18:22.560 --> 1:18:26.180
 that we had in the post Snowden era

1:18:26.180 --> 1:18:29.600
 about the limits to surveillance

1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:33.080
 and how critical privacy is.

1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:35.600
 And when you have no transparency

1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:38.040
 and you don't really know in that case

1:18:38.040 --> 1:18:40.040
 what our secret courts were doing,

1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:45.640
 how can you truly believe that our country

1:18:45.640 --> 1:18:47.840
 is taking our civil liberties seriously?

1:18:48.900 --> 1:18:51.280
 So on the one hand, I'm grateful

1:18:51.280 --> 1:18:54.900
 that he cracked open these debates.

1:18:54.900 --> 1:18:59.900
 On the other hand, when I walked into the storage closet

1:19:02.980 --> 1:19:05.900
 of classified NSA secrets,

1:19:05.900 --> 1:19:09.460
 I had just spent two years

1:19:09.460 --> 1:19:14.220
 covering Chinese cyber espionage almost every day.

1:19:14.220 --> 1:19:19.220
 And the sort of advancement of Russian attacks

1:19:19.380 --> 1:19:23.180
 that were just getting worse and worse and more destructive.

1:19:23.180 --> 1:19:27.380
 And there were no limits to Chinese cyber espionage

1:19:27.380 --> 1:19:30.660
 and Chinese surveillance of its own citizens.

1:19:30.660 --> 1:19:32.800
 And there seemed to be no limit

1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:37.240
 to what Russia was willing to do in terms of cyber attacks

1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:41.260
 and also in some cases assassinating journalists.

1:19:41.260 --> 1:19:43.980
 So when I walked into that room,

1:19:43.980 --> 1:19:46.700
 there was a part of me quite honestly

1:19:46.700 --> 1:19:50.000
 that was relieved to know that the NSA

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:53.500
 was as good as I hoped they were.

1:19:53.500 --> 1:19:58.420
 And we weren't using that knowledge to,

1:19:58.420 --> 1:20:02.220
 as far as I know, assassinate journalists.

1:20:03.260 --> 1:20:06.240
 We weren't using our access

1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:11.000
 to take out pharmaceutical companies.

1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:15.580
 For the most part, we were using it for traditional espionage.

1:20:15.580 --> 1:20:18.860
 Now, that set of documents also set me

1:20:18.860 --> 1:20:22.020
 on the journey of my book because to me,

1:20:22.020 --> 1:20:26.060
 the American people's reaction to the Snowden documents

1:20:26.060 --> 1:20:28.860
 was a little bit misplaced.

1:20:28.860 --> 1:20:29.860
 They were upset

1:20:29.860 --> 1:20:33.980
 about the phone call metadata collection program.

1:20:33.980 --> 1:20:36.340
 Angela Merkel, I think rightfully was upset

1:20:36.340 --> 1:20:38.320
 that we were hacking her cell phone.

1:20:39.340 --> 1:20:42.540
 But in sort of the spy eat spy world,

1:20:42.540 --> 1:20:44.320
 hacking world leaders cell phones

1:20:44.320 --> 1:20:47.300
 is pretty much what most spy agencies do.

1:20:47.300 --> 1:20:51.580
 And there wasn't a lot that I saw in those documents

1:20:51.580 --> 1:20:56.580
 that was beyond what I thought a spy agency does.

1:20:56.580 --> 1:21:01.000
 And I think if there was another 9 11 tomorrow,

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:05.740
 God forbid, we would all say, how did the NSA miss this?

1:21:05.740 --> 1:21:07.900
 Why weren't they spying on those terrorists?

1:21:07.900 --> 1:21:10.780
 Why weren't they spying on those world leaders?

1:21:10.780 --> 1:21:13.140
 And there's some of that too.

1:21:13.140 --> 1:21:17.740
 But I think that there was great damage done

1:21:17.740 --> 1:21:21.660
 to the US's reputation.

1:21:22.900 --> 1:21:25.500
 I think we really lost our halo

1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:30.460
 in terms of a protector of civil liberties.

1:21:30.460 --> 1:21:33.680
 And I think a lot of what was reported

1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:36.980
 was unfortunately reported in a vacuum.

1:21:36.980 --> 1:21:41.980
 That was my biggest gripe that we were always reporting,

1:21:41.980 --> 1:21:45.200
 the NSA has this program and here's what it does.

1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:48.680
 And the NSA is in Angela Merkel's cell phone

1:21:48.680 --> 1:21:50.760
 and the NSA can do this.

1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:55.660
 And no one was saying, and by the way,

1:21:57.040 --> 1:22:00.220
 China has been hacking into our pipelines

1:22:00.220 --> 1:22:01.480
 and they've been making off

1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:04.120
 with all of our intellectual property.

1:22:04.120 --> 1:22:07.600
 And Russia has been hacking into our energy infrastructure

1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:11.340
 and they've been using the same methods to spy on track.

1:22:11.340 --> 1:22:13.960
 And in many cases, kill their own journalists.

1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:15.780
 And the Saudis have been doing this

1:22:15.780 --> 1:22:17.340
 to their own critics and dissidents.

1:22:17.340 --> 1:22:21.240
 And so you can't talk about any of these countries

1:22:21.240 --> 1:22:22.760
 in isolation.

1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:25.880
 It is really like spy out there.

1:22:25.880 --> 1:22:29.080
 And so I just have complicated feelings.

1:22:29.080 --> 1:22:30.920
 And the other thing is, and I'm sorry,

1:22:30.920 --> 1:22:32.040
 this is a little bit of a tangent,

1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:37.040
 but the amount of documents that we had,

1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:39.840
 like thousands of documents,

1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:41.920
 most of which were just crap,

1:22:41.920 --> 1:22:46.560
 but had people's names on them.

1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:48.940
 Part of me wishes that those documents

1:22:48.940 --> 1:22:53.040
 had been released in a much more targeted, limited way.

1:22:53.040 --> 1:22:56.400
 It's just a lot of it just felt like a PowerPoint

1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:58.620
 that was taken out of context.

1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:03.040
 And you just sort of wish

1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:05.920
 that there had been a little bit more thought

1:23:05.920 --> 1:23:07.760
 into what was released.

1:23:07.760 --> 1:23:10.120
 Because I think a lot of the impact from someone

1:23:10.120 --> 1:23:13.420
 was just the volume of the reporting.

1:23:13.420 --> 1:23:17.100
 But I think based on what I saw personally,

1:23:18.480 --> 1:23:20.400
 there was a lot of stuff that I just,

1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:24.140
 I don't know why that particular thing got released.

1:23:24.140 --> 1:23:26.800
 As a whistleblower, what's a better way to do it?

1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:28.160
 Because I mean, there's fear,

1:23:28.160 --> 1:23:33.160
 it takes a lot of effort to do a more targeted release.

1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:35.000
 If there's proper channels,

1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:38.240
 you're afraid that those channels will be manipulated

1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:39.480
 by who do you trust.

1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:43.560
 What's a better way to do this, do you think?

1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:46.600
 As a journalist, this is almost like a journalistic question.

1:23:46.600 --> 1:23:49.620
 Reveal some fundamental flaw in the system

1:23:49.620 --> 1:23:50.840
 without destroying the system.

1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:54.840
 I bring up, again, Mark Zuckerberg and Metta,

1:23:54.840 --> 1:23:57.720
 there was a whistleblower

1:23:57.720 --> 1:24:02.080
 that came out about Instagram internal studies.

1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:06.960
 And I also torn about how to feel about that whistleblower.

1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:10.800
 Because from a company perspective, that's an open culture.

1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:13.800
 How can you operate successfully

1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:14.880
 if you have an open culture

1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:17.900
 where any one whistleblower can come out,

1:24:17.900 --> 1:24:19.360
 out of context, take a study,

1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:21.800
 whether it represents a larger context or not,

1:24:22.720 --> 1:24:25.400
 and the press eats it up.

1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:27.960
 And then that creates a narrative

1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:30.240
 that is just like with the NSA,

1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:33.800
 you said it's out of context, very targeted,

1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:36.720
 to where, well, Facebook is evil, clearly,

1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:38.860
 because of this one leak.

1:24:38.860 --> 1:24:40.520
 It's really hard to know what to do there,

1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:42.040
 because we're now in a society

1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:44.320
 that's deeply distrust institutions.

1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:49.120
 And so narratives by whistleblowers make that whistleblower

1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:52.240
 and their forthcoming book very popular.

1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:54.080
 And so there's a huge incentive

1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:56.800
 to take stuff out of context and to tell stories

1:24:56.800 --> 1:25:00.360
 that don't represent the full context, the full truth.

1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:03.120
 It's hard to know what to do with that,

1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:06.940
 because then that forces Facebook and Meta and governments

1:25:06.940 --> 1:25:09.780
 to be much more conservative, much more secretive.

1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:14.600
 It's like a race to the bottom, I don't know.

1:25:14.600 --> 1:25:16.280
 I don't know if you can comment on any of that,

1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:19.320
 how to be a whistleblower ethically and properly.

1:25:20.760 --> 1:25:23.400
 I don't know, I mean, these are hard questions.

1:25:23.400 --> 1:25:27.240
 And even for myself, in some ways,

1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:31.720
 I think of my book as sort of blowing the whistle

1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:33.960
 on the underground zero day market.

1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:38.840
 But it's not like I was in the market myself.

1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:41.440
 It's not like I had access to classified data

1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:43.440
 when I was reporting out that book.

1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:46.800
 As I say in the book, listen,

1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:49.500
 I'm just trying to scrape the surface here,

1:25:49.500 --> 1:25:53.000
 so we can have these conversations before it's too late.

1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:57.080
 And I'm sure there's plenty in there

1:25:57.080 --> 1:26:01.760
 that someone who's US intelligence agencies

1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:04.080
 preeminent zero day broker probably

1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:05.940
 has some voodoo doll of me out there.

1:26:05.940 --> 1:26:10.940
 And you're never gonna get it 100%.

1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:14.880
 But I really applaud whistleblowers

1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:19.040
 like the whistleblower who blew the whistle

1:26:19.040 --> 1:26:22.320
 on the Trump call with Zelensky.

1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:25.320
 I mean, people needed to know about that,

1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:27.840
 that we were basically, in some ways,

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:32.840
 blackmailing an ally to try to influence an election.

1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:37.280
 I mean, they went through the proper channels.

1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:39.480
 They weren't trying to profit off of it, right?

1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:42.120
 There was no book that came out afterwards

1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:44.100
 from that whistleblower.

1:26:44.100 --> 1:26:45.780
 That whistleblower's not like,

1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:47.920
 they went through the channels.

1:26:47.920 --> 1:26:51.160
 They're not living in Moscow, let's put it that way.

1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:53.000
 Can I ask you a question, you mentioned NSA,

1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:54.500
 one of the things that showed

1:26:56.240 --> 1:26:58.240
 is they're pretty good at what they do.

1:27:00.340 --> 1:27:03.520
 Again, this is a touchy subject, I suppose,

1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:06.300
 but there's a lot of conspiracy theories

1:27:06.300 --> 1:27:08.040
 about intelligence agencies.

1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:11.200
 From your understanding of intelligence agencies,

1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:16.020
 the CIA, NSA, and the equivalent of in other countries,

1:27:16.940 --> 1:27:20.040
 are they, one question, this could be a dangerous question,

1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:23.600
 are they competent, are they good at what they do?

1:27:24.740 --> 1:27:28.920
 And two, are they malevolent in any way?

1:27:30.600 --> 1:27:32.680
 Sort of, I recently had a conversation

1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:35.180
 about tobacco companies.

1:27:35.180 --> 1:27:39.560
 They kind of see their customers as dupes,

1:27:39.560 --> 1:27:43.320
 like they can just play games with people.

1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:46.440
 Conspiracy theories tell that similar story

1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:48.540
 about intelligence agencies,

1:27:48.540 --> 1:27:51.680
 that they're interested in manipulating the populace

1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:54.920
 for whatever ends the powerful,

1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:59.920
 in dark rooms, cigarette smoke, cigar smoke filled rooms.

1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:04.620
 What's your sense?

1:28:04.620 --> 1:28:09.620
 Do these conspiracy theories have any truth to them?

1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:14.440
 Or are intelligence agencies, for the most part,

1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:15.720
 good for society?

1:28:15.720 --> 1:28:18.640
 Okay, well, that's an easy one.

1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:19.480
 Is it?

1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:23.720
 No, I think it depends which intelligence agency.

1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:25.800
 Think about the Mossad.

1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:30.800
 They're killing every Iranian nuclear scientist they can

1:28:32.700 --> 1:28:37.700
 over the years, but have they delayed the time horizon

1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:40.520
 before Iran gets the bomb?

1:28:40.520 --> 1:28:41.360
 Yeah.

1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:45.840
 Have they probably staved off terror attacks

1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:46.820
 on their own citizens?

1:28:46.820 --> 1:28:47.660
 Yeah.

1:28:48.680 --> 1:28:53.320
 You know, none of these, intelligence is intelligence.

1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:56.400
 You know, you can't just say like they're malevolent

1:28:56.400 --> 1:28:58.840
 or they're heroes.

1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:02.680
 You know, everyone I have met in this space

1:29:03.680 --> 1:29:07.440
 is not like the pound your chest patriot

1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:11.560
 that you see on the beach on the 4th of July.

1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:15.200
 A lot of them have complicated feelings

1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:17.720
 about their former employers.

1:29:17.720 --> 1:29:20.520
 Well, at least at the NSA reminded me

1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:25.520
 to do what we were accused of doing after Snowden,

1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:28.800
 to spy on Americans.

1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:33.800
 You have no idea the amount of red tape and paperwork

1:29:33.800 --> 1:29:38.320
 and bureaucracy it would have taken to do

1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:41.180
 what everyone thinks that we were supposedly doing.

1:29:42.500 --> 1:29:45.600
 But then, you know, we find out in the course

1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:49.480
 of the Snowden reporting about a program called Lovin',

1:29:49.480 --> 1:29:53.040
 where a couple of the NSA analysts were using their access

1:29:53.040 --> 1:29:55.380
 to spy on their ex girlfriends.

1:29:55.380 --> 1:29:59.300
 So, you know, there's an exception to every case.

1:29:59.300 --> 1:30:04.300
 Generally, I will probably get, you know,

1:30:05.020 --> 1:30:07.580
 accused of my Western bias here again,

1:30:07.580 --> 1:30:12.580
 but I think you can almost barely compare

1:30:15.060 --> 1:30:17.260
 some of these Western intelligence agencies

1:30:17.260 --> 1:30:19.980
 to China, for instance.

1:30:19.980 --> 1:30:24.980
 And the surveillance that they're deploying on the Uyghurs

1:30:26.020 --> 1:30:28.940
 to the level they're deploying it.

1:30:28.940 --> 1:30:32.100
 And the surveillance they're starting to export abroad

1:30:32.100 --> 1:30:33.180
 with some of the programs,

1:30:33.180 --> 1:30:35.500
 like the watering hole attack I mentioned earlier,

1:30:35.500 --> 1:30:38.980
 where it's not just hitting the Uyghurs inside China,

1:30:38.980 --> 1:30:40.340
 it's hitting anyone interested

1:30:40.340 --> 1:30:42.060
 in the Uyghur plight outside China.

1:30:42.060 --> 1:30:44.580
 I mean, it could be an American high school student

1:30:44.580 --> 1:30:46.540
 writing a paper on the Uyghurs.

1:30:46.540 --> 1:30:49.100
 They wanna spy on that person too.

1:30:49.100 --> 1:30:51.740
 You know, there's no rules in China

1:30:51.740 --> 1:30:55.460
 really limiting the extent of that surveillance.

1:30:55.460 --> 1:30:59.340
 And we all better pay attention to what's happening

1:30:59.340 --> 1:31:04.060
 with the Uyghurs because just as Ukraine has been to Russia

1:31:04.060 --> 1:31:08.240
 in terms of a test kitchen for its cyber attacks,

1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:12.900
 the Uyghurs are China's test kitchen for surveillance.

1:31:12.900 --> 1:31:15.300
 And there's no doubt in my mind

1:31:15.300 --> 1:31:17.660
 that they're testing them on the Uyghurs.

1:31:17.660 --> 1:31:19.140
 Uyghurs are their Petri dish,

1:31:19.140 --> 1:31:21.220
 and eventually they will export

1:31:21.220 --> 1:31:23.880
 that level of surveillance overseas.

1:31:23.880 --> 1:31:26.480
 I mean, in 2015,

1:31:27.360 --> 1:31:31.700
 Obama and Xi Jinping reached a deal

1:31:31.700 --> 1:31:34.540
 where basically the White House said,

1:31:34.540 --> 1:31:38.620
 you better cut it out on intellectual property theft.

1:31:38.620 --> 1:31:40.140
 And so they made this agreement

1:31:40.140 --> 1:31:43.620
 that they would not hack each other for commercial benefit.

1:31:43.620 --> 1:31:45.700
 And for a period of about 18 months,

1:31:45.700 --> 1:31:49.060
 we saw this huge drop off in Chinese cyber attacks

1:31:49.060 --> 1:31:50.820
 on American companies.

1:31:50.820 --> 1:31:53.080
 But some of them continued.

1:31:53.080 --> 1:31:54.300
 Where did they continue?

1:31:54.300 --> 1:31:58.420
 They continued on aviation companies,

1:31:58.420 --> 1:32:01.100
 on hospitality companies like Marriott.

1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:02.900
 Why?

1:32:02.900 --> 1:32:05.740
 Because that was still considered fair game to China.

1:32:05.740 --> 1:32:07.420
 It wasn't IP theft they were after.

1:32:07.420 --> 1:32:11.860
 They wanted to know who was staying in this city

1:32:11.860 --> 1:32:15.020
 at this time when Chinese citizens were staying there

1:32:15.020 --> 1:32:17.440
 so they could cross match for counterintelligence

1:32:17.440 --> 1:32:20.220
 who might be a likely Chinese spy.

1:32:20.220 --> 1:32:22.720
 I'm sure we're doing some of that too.

1:32:22.720 --> 1:32:24.780
 Counterintelligence is counterintelligence.

1:32:24.780 --> 1:32:26.300
 It's considered fair game.

1:32:27.460 --> 1:32:30.420
 But where I think it gets evil

1:32:30.420 --> 1:32:34.220
 is when you use it for censorship,

1:32:34.220 --> 1:32:36.100
 to suppress any dissent,

1:32:37.300 --> 1:32:41.780
 to do what I've seen the UAE do to its citizens

1:32:41.780 --> 1:32:44.180
 where people who've gone on Twitter

1:32:44.180 --> 1:32:47.580
 just to advocate for better voting rights,

1:32:47.580 --> 1:32:49.360
 more enfranchisement,

1:32:49.360 --> 1:32:53.500
 suddenly find their passports confiscated.

1:32:53.500 --> 1:32:57.340
 You know, I talked to one critic, Ahmed Mansour,

1:32:57.340 --> 1:32:58.700
 and he told me,

1:32:58.700 --> 1:33:01.060
 you know, you might find yourself a terrorist,

1:33:01.060 --> 1:33:02.420
 labeled a terrorist one day,

1:33:02.420 --> 1:33:04.700
 you don't even know how to operate a gun.

1:33:04.700 --> 1:33:06.520
 I mean, he had been beaten up

1:33:06.520 --> 1:33:07.980
 every time he tried to go somewhere.

1:33:07.980 --> 1:33:09.660
 His passport had been confiscated.

1:33:09.660 --> 1:33:10.600
 By that point, it turned out

1:33:10.600 --> 1:33:12.100
 they'd already hacked into his phone

1:33:12.100 --> 1:33:14.160
 so they were listening to us talking.

1:33:14.160 --> 1:33:16.300
 They'd hacked into his baby monitor

1:33:16.300 --> 1:33:18.900
 so they're spying on his child.

1:33:18.900 --> 1:33:21.340
 And they stole his car.

1:33:22.340 --> 1:33:24.680
 And then they created a new law

1:33:24.680 --> 1:33:27.780
 that you couldn't criticize the ruling family

1:33:27.780 --> 1:33:29.380
 or the ruling party on Twitter.

1:33:29.380 --> 1:33:32.720
 And he's been in solitary confinement every day since

1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:34.180
 on hunger strike.

1:33:34.180 --> 1:33:37.760
 So that's evil, you know, that's evil.

1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:40.200
 And we still, we don't do that here.

1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:42.060
 You know, we have rules here.

1:33:42.060 --> 1:33:44.500
 We don't cross that line.

1:33:44.500 --> 1:33:48.540
 So yeah, in some cases, like I won't go to Dubai.

1:33:48.540 --> 1:33:49.980
 You know, I won't go to Abu Dhabi.

1:33:49.980 --> 1:33:51.580
 If I ever want to go to the Maldives,

1:33:51.580 --> 1:33:54.860
 like too bad, like most of the flights go through Dubai.

1:33:54.860 --> 1:33:57.140
 So there's some lines we're not willing to cross.

1:33:57.140 --> 1:33:58.940
 But then again, just like you said,

1:33:58.940 --> 1:34:02.660
 there's individuals within NSA, within CIA,

1:34:02.660 --> 1:34:05.780
 and they may have power.

1:34:05.780 --> 1:34:07.860
 And to me, there's levels of evil.

1:34:07.860 --> 1:34:11.300
 To me personally, this is the stuff of conspiracy theories,

1:34:11.300 --> 1:34:13.880
 is the things you've mentioned as evil

1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:16.140
 are more direct attacks.

1:34:16.140 --> 1:34:19.140
 But there's also psychological warfare.

1:34:19.140 --> 1:34:20.800
 So blackmail.

1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:25.580
 So what does spying allow you to do?

1:34:25.580 --> 1:34:27.820
 Allow you to collect information

1:34:27.820 --> 1:34:30.140
 if you have something that's embarrassing.

1:34:30.140 --> 1:34:33.580
 Or if you have like Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theories,

1:34:33.580 --> 1:34:38.460
 active, what is it, manufacture of embarrassing things.

1:34:38.460 --> 1:34:41.080
 And then use blackmail to manipulate the population

1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:42.860
 or all the powerful people involved.

1:34:42.860 --> 1:34:45.820
 It troubles me deeply that MIT allowed somebody

1:34:45.820 --> 1:34:48.580
 like Jeffrey Epstein in their midst,

1:34:48.580 --> 1:34:51.620
 especially some of the scientists I admire

1:34:51.620 --> 1:34:54.260
 that they would hang out with that person at all.

1:34:54.260 --> 1:34:57.840
 And so I'll talk about it sometimes.

1:34:59.020 --> 1:35:00.260
 And then a lot of people tell me,

1:35:00.260 --> 1:35:04.340
 well, obviously Jeffrey Epstein is a front for intelligence.

1:35:04.340 --> 1:35:09.340
 And I just, I struggle to see that level of competence

1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:10.720
 and malevolence.

1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:15.720
 But, you know, who the hell am I?

1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:21.200
 And I guess I was trying to get to that point.

1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:23.000
 You said that there's bureaucracy and so on,

1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.740
 which makes some of these things very difficult.

1:35:25.740 --> 1:35:27.440
 I wonder how much malevolence,

1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:31.640
 how much competence there is in these institutions.

1:35:31.640 --> 1:35:34.880
 Like how far, this takes us back to the hacking question.

1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:39.880
 How far are people willing to go if they have the power?

1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:41.720
 This has to do with social engineering.

1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:42.800
 This has to do with hacking.

1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:45.440
 This has to do with manipulating people,

1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:47.360
 attacking people, doing evil onto people,

1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:50.280
 psychological warfare and stuff like that.

1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:51.500
 I don't know.

1:35:51.500 --> 1:35:54.000
 I believe that most people are good.

1:35:54.860 --> 1:35:59.400
 And I don't think that's possible in a free society.

1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:00.460
 There's something that happens

1:36:00.460 --> 1:36:02.560
 when you have a centralized government

1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:05.600
 where power corrupts over time

1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:08.880
 and you start surveillance programs

1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:12.120
 kind of, it's like a slippery slope

1:36:12.120 --> 1:36:16.680
 that over time starts to both use fear

1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:20.060
 and direct manipulation to control the populace.

1:36:20.060 --> 1:36:22.240
 But in a free society, I just,

1:36:23.680 --> 1:36:25.120
 it's difficult for me to imagine

1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:27.720
 that you can have like somebody like a Jeffrey Epstein

1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:29.400
 in the front for intelligence.

1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:31.640
 I don't know what I'm asking you, but I'm just,

1:36:34.780 --> 1:36:36.960
 I have a hope that for the most part,

1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:39.880
 intelligence agencies are trying to do good

1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:41.920
 and are actually doing good for the world

1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:45.720
 when you view it in the full context

1:36:45.720 --> 1:36:47.740
 of the complexities of the world.

1:36:51.640 --> 1:36:55.200
 But then again, if they're not, would we know?

1:36:55.200 --> 1:36:58.400
 That's why Edward Snowden might be a good thing.

1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:00.520
 Let me ask you on a personal question.

1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:02.480
 You have investigated some of the most powerful

1:37:02.480 --> 1:37:04.520
 organizations and people in the world

1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:07.620
 of cyber warfare, cyber security.

1:37:07.620 --> 1:37:09.600
 Are you ever afraid for your own life,

1:37:09.600 --> 1:37:13.240
 your own wellbeing, digital or physical?

1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:15.520
 I mean, I've had my moments.

1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:20.080
 You know, I've had our security team at the times

1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:21.960
 called me at one point and said,

1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:25.800
 someone's on the dark web offering good money

1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:28.860
 to anyone who can hack your phone or your laptop.

1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:33.000
 I describe in my book how when I was at that

1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:35.240
 hacking conference in Argentina and I came back

1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:38.680
 and I brought a burner laptop with me,

1:37:38.680 --> 1:37:40.760
 but I'd kept it in the safe anyway

1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:42.480
 and it didn't have anything on it,

1:37:42.480 --> 1:37:45.320
 but someone had broken in and it was moved.

1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:51.640
 You know, I've had all sorts of sort of scary moments.

1:37:52.760 --> 1:37:55.520
 And then I've had moments where I think I went

1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:58.920
 just way too far into the paranoid side.

1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:03.920
 I mean, I remember writing about the Times hack by China

1:38:04.600 --> 1:38:07.460
 and I just covered a number of Chinese cyber attacks

1:38:07.460 --> 1:38:10.080
 where they'd gotten into the thermostat

1:38:10.080 --> 1:38:11.600
 at someone's corporate apartment

1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:15.820
 and they'd gotten into all sorts of stuff.

1:38:15.820 --> 1:38:17.760
 And I was living by myself.

1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:22.760
 I was single in San Francisco and my cable box

1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:25.560
 on my television started making some weird noises

1:38:25.560 --> 1:38:26.960
 in the middle of the night.

1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:29.680
 And I got up and I ripped it out of the wall

1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:32.080
 and I think I said something like embarrassing,

1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:33.760
 like, fuck you China, you know.

1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:38.760
 And then I went back to bed and I woke up

1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:41.640
 and it's like beautiful morning light.

1:38:41.640 --> 1:38:42.560
 I mean, I'll never forget it.

1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:44.600
 Like this is like glimmering morning light

1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:48.120
 is shining on my cable box, which has now been ripped out

1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:50.640
 and is sitting on my floor and like the morning light.

1:38:50.640 --> 1:38:53.840
 And I was just like, no, no, no,

1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:56.920
 like I'm not going down that road.

1:38:56.920 --> 1:39:01.920
 Like you basically, I came to a fork in the road

1:39:03.400 --> 1:39:06.120
 where I could either go full tinfoil hat,

1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:10.040
 go live off the grid, never have a car with navigation,

1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:12.480
 never use Google maps, never own an iPhone,

1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:17.480
 never order diapers off Amazon, you know, create an alias

1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:22.240
 or I could just do the best I can

1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:26.040
 and live in this new digital world we're living in.

1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:28.080
 And what does that look like for me?

1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:30.760
 I mean, what are my crown jewels?

1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:32.760
 This is what I tell people, what are your crown jewels?

1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:34.200
 Cause just focus on that.

1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:35.620
 You can't protect everything,

1:39:35.620 --> 1:39:37.480
 but you can protect your crown jewels.

1:39:37.480 --> 1:39:39.000
 For me, for the longest time,

1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:42.320
 my crown jewels were my sources.

1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:44.520
 I was nothing without my sources.

1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:49.420
 So I had some sources, I would meet the same dim sum place

1:39:49.420 --> 1:39:53.760
 or maybe it was a different restaurant on the same date,

1:39:53.760 --> 1:39:58.760
 you know, every quarter and we would never drive there.

1:39:59.040 --> 1:40:00.360
 We would never Uber there.

1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:02.040
 We wouldn't bring any devices.

1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:05.000
 I could bring a pencil and a notepad.

1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.160
 And if someone wasn't in town,

1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:09.120
 like there were a couple of times where I'd show up

1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:11.120
 and the source never came,

1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:14.000
 but we never communicated digitally.

1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.440
 And those were the links I was willing to go

1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:19.520
 to protect that source, but you can't do it for everyone.

1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:22.300
 So for everyone else, you know, it was signal,

1:40:22.300 --> 1:40:24.520
 using two factor authentication,

1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:26.960
 you know, keeping my devices up to date,

1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:30.640
 not clicking on phishing emails, using a password manager,

1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:34.480
 all the things that we know we're supposed to do.

1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:37.320
 And that's what I tell everyone, like don't go crazy

1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:39.280
 because then that's like the ultimate hack.

1:40:39.280 --> 1:40:43.620
 Then they've hacked your mind, whoever they is for you.

1:40:43.620 --> 1:40:45.200
 But just do the best you can.

1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:50.200
 Now, my whole risk model changed when I had a kid.

1:40:50.200 --> 1:40:54.720
 You know, now it's, oh God, you know,

1:40:54.720 --> 1:40:59.720
 if anyone threatened my family, God help them.

1:40:59.960 --> 1:41:04.960
 But it changes you.

1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:12.340
 And, you know, unfortunately there are some things,

1:41:12.340 --> 1:41:15.000
 like I was really scared to go deep on,

1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:19.540
 like Russian cyber crime, you know, like Putin himself,

1:41:19.540 --> 1:41:21.240
 you know, and it's interesting.

1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:24.600
 Like I have a mentor who's an incredible person

1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:29.560
 who was the Times Moscow Bureau Chief during the Cold War.

1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:32.040
 And after I wrote a series of stories

1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:35.040
 about Chinese cyber espionage, he took me out to lunch.

1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:37.960
 And he told me that when he was living in Moscow,

1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:40.100
 he would drop his kids off at preschool

1:41:40.100 --> 1:41:42.640
 when they were my son's age now.

1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:44.800
 And the KGB would follow him

1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:48.280
 and they would make a really like loud show of it.

1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:51.360
 You know, they'd tail him, they'd, you know, honk,

1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:55.240
 they'd just be, make a ruckus.

1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:57.640
 And he said, you know what, they never actually did anything

1:41:57.640 --> 1:42:00.760
 but they wanted me to know that they were following me

1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:03.000
 and I operated accordingly.

1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.840
 And he says, that's how you should operate

1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:08.200
 in the digital world.

1:42:08.200 --> 1:42:11.660
 Know that there are probably people following you.

1:42:11.660 --> 1:42:14.400
 Sometimes they'll make a little bit of noise.

1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:17.540
 But one thing you need to know is that

1:42:17.540 --> 1:42:18.620
 while you're at the New York Times,

1:42:18.620 --> 1:42:21.360
 you have a little bit of an invisible shield on you.

1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:23.660
 You know, if something were to happen to you,

1:42:23.660 --> 1:42:25.080
 that would be a really big deal.

1:42:25.080 --> 1:42:27.000
 That would be an international incident.

1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.900
 So I kind of carried that invisible shield with me

1:42:29.900 --> 1:42:31.540
 for years.

1:42:31.540 --> 1:42:34.360
 And then Jamal Khashoggi happened.

1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:38.480
 And that destroyed my vision of my invisible shield.

1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:41.980
 You know, sure, you know, he was a Saudi

1:42:41.980 --> 1:42:44.820
 but he was a Washington Post columnist.

1:42:44.820 --> 1:42:46.160
 You know, for the most part,

1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:47.320
 he was living in the United States.

1:42:47.320 --> 1:42:49.240
 He was a journalist.

1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:52.820
 And for them to do what they did to him,

1:42:52.820 --> 1:42:57.320
 pretty much in the open and get away with it,

1:42:57.320 --> 1:43:01.080
 and for the United States to let them get away with it

1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:04.660
 because we wanted to preserve diplomatic relations

1:43:04.660 --> 1:43:06.040
 with the Saudis,

1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:10.500
 that really threw my worldview upside down.

1:43:10.500 --> 1:43:13.740
 And, you know, I think that sent a message

1:43:13.740 --> 1:43:15.580
 to a lot of countries

1:43:15.580 --> 1:43:19.500
 that it was sort of open season on journalists.

1:43:19.500 --> 1:43:22.960
 And to me, that was one of the most destructive things

1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:27.360
 that happened under the previous administration.

1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:30.240
 And, you know, I don't really know

1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:32.280
 what to think of my invisible shield anymore.

1:43:32.280 --> 1:43:33.700
 Like you said, that really worries me

1:43:33.700 --> 1:43:36.420
 on the journalism side that people would be afraid

1:43:36.420 --> 1:43:39.040
 to dig deep on fascinating topics.

1:43:41.080 --> 1:43:44.340
 And, you know, I have my own,

1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:50.160
 part of the reason, like I would love to have kids,

1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:51.660
 I would love to have a family.

1:43:52.700 --> 1:43:56.680
 Part of the reason I'm a little bit afraid,

1:43:56.680 --> 1:43:57.940
 there's many ways to phrase this,

1:43:57.940 --> 1:44:02.480
 but the loss of freedom in the way of doing

1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:04.980
 all the crazy shit that I naturally do,

1:44:04.980 --> 1:44:07.900
 which I would say the ethic of journalism

1:44:07.900 --> 1:44:09.900
 is kind of not, is doing crazy shit

1:44:09.900 --> 1:44:11.160
 without really thinking about it.

1:44:11.160 --> 1:44:13.400
 This is letting your curiosity

1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:18.460
 really allow you to be free and explore.

1:44:18.460 --> 1:44:22.040
 It's, I mean, whether it's stupidity or fearlessness,

1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:25.240
 whatever it is, that's what great journalism is.

1:44:25.240 --> 1:44:30.180
 And all the concerns about security risks

1:44:30.180 --> 1:44:32.760
 have made me like become a better person.

1:44:32.760 --> 1:44:35.600
 The way I approach it is just make sure

1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:37.280
 you don't have anything to hide.

1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:38.960
 I know this is not a thing.

1:44:38.960 --> 1:44:41.860
 This is not a, this is not an approach to security.

1:44:41.860 --> 1:44:44.920
 I'm just, this is like a motivational speech or something.

1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:47.320
 It's just like, if you can lose,

1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:49.220
 you can be hacked at any moment.

1:44:49.220 --> 1:44:52.120
 Just don't be a douchebag secretly.

1:44:52.120 --> 1:44:54.400
 Just be like a good person.

1:44:54.400 --> 1:44:56.680
 Because then, I see this actually

1:44:56.680 --> 1:44:58.680
 with social media in general.

1:45:00.120 --> 1:45:03.840
 Just present yourself in the most authentic way possible,

1:45:03.840 --> 1:45:06.880
 meaning be the same person online as you are privately.

1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:08.080
 Have nothing to hide.

1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:11.800
 That's one, not the only, but one of the ways

1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:13.600
 to achieve security.

1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:15.820
 Maybe I'm totally wrong on this,

1:45:15.820 --> 1:45:19.520
 but don't be secretly weird.

1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:21.860
 If you're weird, be publicly weird

1:45:21.860 --> 1:45:24.300
 so it's impossible to blackmail you.

1:45:24.300 --> 1:45:25.440
 That's my approach to security.

1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:26.600
 Yeah, well, they call it

1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:29.920
 the New York Times front page phenomenon.

1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:32.720
 Don't put anything in email or I guess social media

1:45:32.720 --> 1:45:35.800
 these days that you wouldn't want to read

1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:37.920
 on the front page of the New York Times.

1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:41.620
 And that works, but sometimes I even get carried,

1:45:41.620 --> 1:45:45.560
 I mean, I have not as many followers as you,

1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:47.080
 but a lot of followers,

1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:49.080
 and sometimes even I get carried away.

1:45:49.080 --> 1:45:51.280
 Just be emotional and stuff and say something.

1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:56.280
 Yeah, I mean, just the cortisol response on Twitter.

1:45:57.320 --> 1:46:01.600
 Twitter is basically designed to elicit those responses.

1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:04.720
 I mean, every day I turn on my computer,

1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:07.760
 I look at my phone, I look at what's trending on Twitter,

1:46:07.760 --> 1:46:10.080
 and it's like, what are the topics

1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:13.740
 that are gonna make people the most angry today?

1:46:13.740 --> 1:46:14.580
 You know?

1:46:14.580 --> 1:46:19.160
 And you know, it's easy to get carried away,

1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:22.320
 but it's also just, that sucks too,

1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:25.280
 that you have to be constantly censoring yourself.

1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:26.620
 And maybe it's for the better.

1:46:26.620 --> 1:46:29.480
 Maybe you can't be a secret asshole,

1:46:29.480 --> 1:46:31.360
 and we can put that in the good bucket.

1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:33.700
 But at the same time, you know,

1:46:33.700 --> 1:46:38.700
 there is a danger to that other voice,

1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:43.060
 to creativity, you know, to being weird.

1:46:43.060 --> 1:46:45.600
 There's a danger to that little whispered voice

1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:48.840
 that's like, well, how would people read that?

1:46:48.840 --> 1:46:51.160
 You know, how could that be manipulated?

1:46:51.160 --> 1:46:53.520
 How could that be used against you?

1:46:53.520 --> 1:46:58.520
 And that stifles creativity and innovation and free thought.

1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:05.280
 And you know, that is on a very micro level.

1:47:06.840 --> 1:47:08.920
 And that's something I think about a lot.

1:47:08.920 --> 1:47:11.600
 And that's actually something that Tim Cook

1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:13.200
 has talked about a lot,

1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:17.640
 and why he has said he goes full force on privacy

1:47:17.640 --> 1:47:20.960
 is it's just that little voice

1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:24.840
 that is at some level censoring you.

1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:28.280
 And what is sort of the long term impact

1:47:28.280 --> 1:47:31.000
 of that little voice over time?

1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:35.200
 I think there's a ways, I think that self censorship

1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:37.680
 is an attack factor that there's solutions to.

1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:40.160
 The way I'm really inspired by Elon Musk,

1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:43.720
 the solution to that is just be privately

1:47:43.720 --> 1:47:46.800
 and publicly the same person and be ridiculous.

1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:49.760
 Embrace the full weirdness and show it more and more.

1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:54.080
 So, you know, that's memes that has like ridiculous humor.

1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:57.860
 And I think, and if there is something

1:47:57.860 --> 1:48:00.940
 you really wanna hide, deeply consider

1:48:00.940 --> 1:48:02.520
 if that you wanna be that.

1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:05.280
 Like, why are you hiding it?

1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:07.400
 What exactly are you afraid of?

1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:10.640
 Because I think my hopeful vision for the internet

1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:13.320
 is the internet loves authenticity.

1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:18.260
 They wanna see you weird, so be that and like live that fully

1:48:18.260 --> 1:48:20.240
 because I think that gray area

1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:22.400
 where you're kind of censoring yourself,

1:48:22.400 --> 1:48:25.120
 that's where the destruction is.

1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:28.760
 You have to go all the way, step over, be weird.

1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:31.040
 And then it feels, it can be painful

1:48:31.040 --> 1:48:33.680
 because people can attack you and so on, but just ride it.

1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:35.960
 I mean, that's just like a skill

1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:38.080
 on the social psychological level

1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:42.080
 that ends up being an approach to security,

1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:45.080
 which is like remove the attack vector

1:48:45.080 --> 1:48:46.960
 of having private information

1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:50.080
 by being your full weird self publicly.

1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:55.840
 What advice would you give to young folks today,

1:48:55.840 --> 1:49:00.680
 you know, operating in this complicated space

1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:02.520
 about how to have a successful life,

1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:03.960
 a life they can be proud of,

1:49:03.960 --> 1:49:05.580
 a career they can be proud of?

1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:09.480
 Maybe somebody in high school and college

1:49:09.480 --> 1:49:11.600
 thinking about what they're going to do.

1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:15.120
 Be a hacker, you know, if you have any interest,

1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:19.960
 become a hacker and apply yourself to defense, you know.

1:49:19.960 --> 1:49:21.800
 Every time, like we do have

1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:24.620
 these amazing scholarship programs, for instance,

1:49:24.620 --> 1:49:26.640
 where, you know, they find you early,

1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:30.040
 they'll pay your college as long as you commit

1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:32.000
 to some kind of federal commitment

1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:35.320
 to sort of help federal agencies with cybersecurity.

1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:37.880
 And where does everyone wanna go every year

1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:39.100
 from the scholarship program?

1:49:39.100 --> 1:49:42.240
 They wanna go work at the NSA or Cyber Command, you know.

1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:44.240
 They wanna go work on offense.

1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:46.240
 They wanna go do the sexy stuff.

1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:49.940
 It's really hard to get people to work on defense.

1:49:49.940 --> 1:49:51.800
 It's just, it's always been more fun

1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:54.560
 to be a pirate than be in the Coast Guard, you know.

1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:59.160
 And so we have a huge deficit

1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:01.320
 when it comes to filling those roles.

1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:06.320
 There's 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions

1:50:06.600 --> 1:50:08.000
 around the world.

1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:09.680
 I mean, talk about job security,

1:50:09.680 --> 1:50:12.760
 like be a hacker and work on cybersecurity.

1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:14.300
 You will always have a job.

1:50:15.300 --> 1:50:18.600
 And we're actually at a huge deficit

1:50:18.600 --> 1:50:21.320
 and disadvantage as a free market economy

1:50:22.200 --> 1:50:26.800
 because we can't match cybersecurity salaries

1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:30.060
 at Palantir or Facebook or Google or Microsoft.

1:50:30.060 --> 1:50:32.480
 And so it's really hard for the United States

1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:33.840
 to fill those roles.

1:50:33.840 --> 1:50:38.400
 And, you know, other countries have had this work around

1:50:38.400 --> 1:50:41.460
 where they basically have forced conscription on some level.

1:50:41.460 --> 1:50:43.720
 You know, China tells people,

1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:46.840
 like you do whatever you're gonna do during the day,

1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:48.520
 work at Alibaba.

1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:51.340
 You know, if you need to do some ransomware, okay.

1:50:51.340 --> 1:50:53.960
 But the minute we tap you on the shoulder

1:50:53.960 --> 1:50:57.160
 and ask you to come do this sensitive operation for us,

1:50:57.160 --> 1:50:59.180
 the answer is yes.

1:50:59.180 --> 1:51:00.820
 You know, same with Russia.

1:51:00.820 --> 1:51:03.640
 You know, a couple of years ago when Yahoo was hacked

1:51:03.640 --> 1:51:05.680
 and they laid it all out in an indictment,

1:51:05.680 --> 1:51:07.680
 it came down to two cyber criminals

1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:09.560
 and two guys from the FSB.

1:51:09.560 --> 1:51:12.160
 Cyber criminals were allowed to have their fun,

1:51:12.160 --> 1:51:14.860
 but the minute they came across the username and password

1:51:14.860 --> 1:51:16.740
 for someone's personal Yahoo account

1:51:16.740 --> 1:51:19.440
 that worked at the White House or the State Department

1:51:19.440 --> 1:51:23.640
 or military, they were expected to pass that over to the FSB.

1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:24.960
 So we don't do that here.

1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:27.400
 And it's even worse on defense.

1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:29.880
 We really can't fill these positions.

1:51:29.880 --> 1:51:33.040
 So, you know, if you are a hacker,

1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:34.800
 if you're interested in code,

1:51:34.800 --> 1:51:38.480
 if you're a tinker, you know, learn how to hack.

1:51:39.920 --> 1:51:42.720
 There are all sorts of amazing hacking competitions

1:51:42.720 --> 1:51:47.520
 you can do through the SANS org, for example, S A N S.

1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:50.880
 And then use those skills for good.

1:51:50.880 --> 1:51:53.500
 You know, neuter the bugs in that code

1:51:53.500 --> 1:51:56.300
 that get used by autocratic regimes

1:51:56.300 --> 1:51:59.300
 to make people's life, you know, a living prison.

1:52:00.140 --> 1:52:01.680
 You know, plug those holes.

1:52:01.680 --> 1:52:03.720
 You know, defend industrial systems,

1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:06.000
 defend our water treatment facilities

1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:07.820
 from hacks where people are trying to come in

1:52:07.820 --> 1:52:09.500
 and poison the water.

1:52:09.500 --> 1:52:12.660
 You know, that I think is just an amazing,

1:52:14.160 --> 1:52:16.280
 it's an amazing job on so many levels.

1:52:16.280 --> 1:52:19.680
 It's intellectually stimulating.

1:52:19.680 --> 1:52:22.920
 You can tell yourself you're serving your country.

1:52:22.920 --> 1:52:24.680
 You can tell yourself you're saving lives

1:52:24.680 --> 1:52:26.160
 and keeping people safe.

1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:28.480
 And you'll always have amazing job security.

1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:31.000
 And if you need to go get that job that pays you,

1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:33.560
 you know, 2 million bucks a year, you can do that too.

1:52:33.560 --> 1:52:34.880
 And you can have a public profile,

1:52:34.880 --> 1:52:38.800
 more so of a public profile, you can be a public rockstar.

1:52:38.800 --> 1:52:42.720
 I mean, it's the same thing as sort of the military.

1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:44.020
 There's a lot of,

1:52:46.520 --> 1:52:49.980
 there's a lot of well known sort of people

1:52:49.980 --> 1:52:51.700
 commenting on the fact that veterans

1:52:51.700 --> 1:52:54.040
 are not treated as well as they should be.

1:52:54.040 --> 1:52:56.120
 But it's still the fact that soldiers

1:52:56.120 --> 1:53:00.380
 are deeply respected for defending the country,

1:53:00.380 --> 1:53:02.840
 the freedoms, the ideals that we stand for.

1:53:02.840 --> 1:53:05.480
 And in the same way, I mean, in some ways,

1:53:05.480 --> 1:53:09.040
 the cybersecurity defense are the soldiers of the future.

1:53:09.040 --> 1:53:10.760
 Yeah, and you know what's interesting,

1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:14.160
 I mean, in cybersecurity, the difference is,

1:53:14.160 --> 1:53:17.200
 oftentimes you see the more interesting threats

1:53:17.200 --> 1:53:20.380
 in the private sector, because that's where the attacks come.

1:53:20.380 --> 1:53:22.520
 You know, when cyber criminals

1:53:22.520 --> 1:53:25.600
 and nation state adversaries come for the United States,

1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:29.080
 they don't go directly for Cyber Command or the NSA.

1:53:29.080 --> 1:53:32.960
 You know, they go for banks, they go for Google,

1:53:32.960 --> 1:53:36.680
 they go for Microsoft, they go for critical infrastructure.

1:53:36.680 --> 1:53:39.600
 And so those companies, those private sector companies

1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:41.840
 get to see some of the most advanced,

1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:45.720
 sophisticated attacks out there.

1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:48.600
 And you know, if you're working at FireEye

1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:51.580
 and you're calling out the SolarWinds attack, for instance,

1:53:51.580 --> 1:53:56.120
 I mean, you just saved God knows how many systems

1:53:56.120 --> 1:53:59.960
 from, you know, that compromise turning into something

1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:02.520
 that more closely resembles sabotage.

1:54:03.680 --> 1:54:08.680
 So, you know, go be a hacker, or go be a journalist.

1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:13.020
 So you wrote the book,

1:54:13.020 --> 1:54:15.840
 This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends,

1:54:15.840 --> 1:54:17.520
 as we've been talking about,

1:54:17.520 --> 1:54:20.240
 of course, referring to cyber war, cybersecurity.

1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:25.320
 What gives you hope about the future of our world

1:54:25.320 --> 1:54:26.640
 if it doesn't end?

1:54:26.640 --> 1:54:28.020
 How will it not end?

1:54:31.520 --> 1:54:32.800
 That's a good question.

1:54:32.800 --> 1:54:34.560
 I mean, I have to have hope, right?

1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:37.360
 Because I have a kid and I have another on the way,

1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:41.000
 and if I didn't have hope, I wouldn't be having kids.

1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:45.440
 But it's a scary time to be having kids.

1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:50.600
 And you know, it's like pandemic, climate change,

1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:55.600
 disinformation, increasingly advanced, perhaps deadly

1:54:55.640 --> 1:54:56.820
 cyber attacks.

1:54:57.740 --> 1:55:01.480
 What gives me hope is that I share your worldview

1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:04.060
 that I think people are fundamentally good.

1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:07.600
 And sometimes, and this is why the metaverse

1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:10.780
 scares me to death, but when I'm reminded of that

1:55:10.780 --> 1:55:12.160
 is not online.

1:55:13.080 --> 1:55:15.160
 Like online, I get the opposite.

1:55:15.160 --> 1:55:17.380
 You know, you start to lose hope and humanity

1:55:17.380 --> 1:55:19.300
 when you're on Twitter half your day.

1:55:19.300 --> 1:55:22.600
 It's like when I go to the grocery store

1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:26.320
 or I go on a hike or like someone smiles at me

1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:30.100
 or you know, or someone just says something nice.

1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:33.280
 You know, people are fundamentally good.

1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:37.080
 We just don't hear from those people enough.

1:55:37.080 --> 1:55:42.080
 And my hope is, I just think our current political climate,

1:55:42.880 --> 1:55:44.880
 like we've hit rock bottom.

1:55:44.880 --> 1:55:46.640
 This is as bad as it gets.

1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:47.840
 We can't do anything.

1:55:47.840 --> 1:55:49.760
 Don't jinx it.

1:55:49.760 --> 1:55:51.960
 But I think it's a generational thing.

1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:56.040
 You know, I think baby boomers, like it's time to move along.

1:55:57.120 --> 1:56:01.100
 I think it's time for a new generation to come in.

1:56:01.100 --> 1:56:06.000
 And I actually have a lot of hope when I look at you.

1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.800
 I'm sort of like this, I guess they call me

1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:12.080
 a geriatric millennial or a young gen X.

1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:14.460
 But like we have this unique responsibility

1:56:14.460 --> 1:56:17.560
 because I grew up without the internet

1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:20.960
 and without social media, but I'm native to it.

1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:25.280
 So I know the good and I know the bad.

1:56:25.280 --> 1:56:28.240
 And that's true on so many different things.

1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:32.060
 You know, I grew up without climate change anxiety

1:56:32.060 --> 1:56:34.860
 and now I'm feeling it and I know it's not a given.

1:56:34.860 --> 1:56:38.920
 We don't have to just resign ourselves to climate change.

1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:41.200
 You know, same with disinformation.

1:56:41.200 --> 1:56:44.080
 And I think a lot of the problems we face today

1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:47.640
 have just exposed the sort of inertia

1:56:47.640 --> 1:56:49.960
 that there has been on so many of these issues.

1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:52.880
 And I really think it's a generational shift

1:56:52.880 --> 1:56:54.500
 that has to happen.

1:56:54.500 --> 1:56:57.620
 And I think this next generation is gonna come in

1:56:57.620 --> 1:56:59.520
 and say like, we're not doing business

1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:00.960
 like you guys did it anymore.

1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:02.480
 You know, we're not just gonna like rape

1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:05.280
 and pillage the earth and try and turn everyone

1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:07.800
 against each other and play dirty tricks

1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:11.440
 and let lobbyists dictate what we do

1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:14.040
 or don't do as a country anymore.

1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:16.480
 And that's really where I see the hope.

1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:19.160
 It feels like there's a lot of low hanging fruit

1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:23.760
 for young minds to step up and create solutions and lead.

1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:28.760
 So whenever like politicians or leaders that are older,

1:57:30.600 --> 1:57:34.120
 like you said, are acting shitty, I see that as a positive.

1:57:34.120 --> 1:57:38.100
 They're inspiring a large number of young people

1:57:38.100 --> 1:57:39.640
 to replace them.

1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:42.560
 And so I think you're right, there's going to be,

1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:45.160
 it's almost like you need people to act shitty

1:57:45.160 --> 1:57:47.860
 to remind them, oh, wow, we need good leaders.

1:57:47.860 --> 1:57:51.360
 We need great creators and builders and entrepreneurs

1:57:51.360 --> 1:57:54.120
 and scientists and engineers and journalists.

1:57:54.120 --> 1:57:56.560
 You know, all the discussions about how the journalism

1:57:56.560 --> 1:57:58.640
 is quote unquote broken and so on,

1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:02.080
 that's just an inspiration for new institutions to rise up

1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:03.760
 that do journalism better,

1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:06.320
 new journalists to step up and do journalism better.

1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:08.640
 So I, and I've been constantly,

1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:11.760
 when I talk to young people, I'm constantly impressed

1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:16.440
 by the ones that dream to build solutions.

1:58:16.440 --> 1:58:21.320
 And so that's ultimately why I put the hope.

1:58:21.320 --> 1:58:23.160
 But the world is a messy place,

1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:26.220
 like we've been talking about, it's a scary place.

1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:29.720
 Yeah, and I think you hit something,

1:58:29.720 --> 1:58:33.120
 hit on something earlier, which is authenticity.

1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:38.120
 Like no one is going to rise above that is plastic anymore.

1:58:40.080 --> 1:58:43.120
 You know, people are craving authenticity.

1:58:43.120 --> 1:58:46.540
 You know, the benefit of the internet is it's really hard

1:58:46.540 --> 1:58:49.980
 to hide who you are on every single platform.

1:58:49.980 --> 1:58:51.840
 You know, on some level it's gonna come out

1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:53.480
 who you really are.

1:58:53.480 --> 1:58:57.420
 And so you hope that, you know,

1:58:57.420 --> 1:58:59.280
 by the time my kids are grown,

1:58:59.280 --> 1:59:04.120
 like no one's gonna care if they made one mistake online,

1:59:04.120 --> 1:59:07.040
 so long as they're authentic, you know?

1:59:07.040 --> 1:59:09.600
 And I used to worry about this.

1:59:09.600 --> 1:59:13.280
 My nephew was born the day I graduated from college.

1:59:13.280 --> 1:59:17.760
 And I just always, you know, he's like born into Facebook.

1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:21.000
 And I just think like, how is a kid like that

1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:24.040
 ever gonna be president of the United States of America?

1:59:24.040 --> 1:59:27.740
 Because if Facebook had been around when I was in college,

1:59:27.740 --> 1:59:31.480
 you know, like Jesus, you know,

1:59:31.480 --> 1:59:34.240
 how are those kids are gonna ever be president?

1:59:34.240 --> 1:59:37.480
 There's gonna be some photo of them at some point

1:59:37.480 --> 1:59:41.760
 making some mistake, and that's gonna be all over for them.

1:59:41.760 --> 1:59:43.100
 And now I take that back.

1:59:43.100 --> 1:59:46.700
 Now it's like, no, everyone's gonna make mistakes.

1:59:46.700 --> 1:59:49.400
 There's gonna be a picture for everyone.

1:59:49.400 --> 1:59:53.020
 And we're all gonna have to come and grow up

1:59:53.020 --> 1:59:56.480
 to the view that as humans, we're gonna make huge mistakes.

1:59:56.480 --> 1:59:58.120
 And hopefully they're not so big

1:59:58.120 --> 2:00:00.680
 that they're gonna ruin the rest of your life.

2:00:00.680 --> 2:00:02.980
 But we're gonna have to come around to this view

2:00:02.980 --> 2:00:04.520
 that we're all human.

2:00:04.520 --> 2:00:07.280
 And we're gonna have to be a little bit more forgiving

2:00:07.280 --> 2:00:10.160
 and a little bit more tolerant when people mess up.

2:00:10.160 --> 2:00:12.080
 And we're gonna have to be a little bit more humble

2:00:12.080 --> 2:00:15.600
 when we do, and like keep moving forward.

2:00:15.600 --> 2:00:18.640
 Otherwise you can't like cancel everyone, you know?

2:00:18.640 --> 2:00:21.680
 Nicole, this is an incredible, hopeful conversation.

2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:26.680
 Also, one that reveals that in the shadows

2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.200
 there's a lot of challenges to be solved.

2:00:30.200 --> 2:00:32.320
 So I really appreciate that you took on

2:00:32.320 --> 2:00:34.280
 this really difficult subject with your book.

2:00:34.280 --> 2:00:35.840
 That's journalism at its best.

2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:38.680
 So I'm really grateful that you took the risk

2:00:38.680 --> 2:00:40.200
 that you took that on,

2:00:40.200 --> 2:00:42.600
 and that you plugged the cable box back in.

2:00:42.600 --> 2:00:43.800
 That means you have hope.

2:00:43.800 --> 2:00:46.560
 And thank you so much for spending

2:00:46.560 --> 2:00:47.920
 your valuable time with me today.

2:00:47.920 --> 2:00:49.880
 Thank you, thanks for having me.

2:00:49.880 --> 2:00:52.240
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:00:52.240 --> 2:00:53.680
 with Nicole Perlroth.

2:00:53.680 --> 2:00:54.920
 To support this podcast,

2:00:54.920 --> 2:00:57.720
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:00:57.720 --> 2:01:00.080
 And now let me leave you with some words

2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:01.800
 from Nicole herself.

2:01:01.800 --> 2:01:05.640
 Here we are, entrusting our entire digital lives,

2:01:05.640 --> 2:01:09.040
 passwords, texts, love letters, banking records,

2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:10.860
 health records, credit cards, sources,

2:01:10.860 --> 2:01:14.040
 and deepest thoughts to this mystery box

2:01:14.040 --> 2:01:17.780
 whose inner circuitry most of us would never vet.

2:01:17.780 --> 2:01:20.740
 Run by code written in a language most of us

2:01:20.740 --> 2:01:22.400
 will never fully understand.

2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:47.400
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
