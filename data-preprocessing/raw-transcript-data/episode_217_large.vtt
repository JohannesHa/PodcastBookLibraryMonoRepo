00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
 The following is a conversation with Rodney Brooks, one of the greatest roboticists in history.

00:06.400 --> 00:10.640
 He led the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT,

00:10.640 --> 00:16.000
 then cofounded iRobot, which is one of the most successful robotics companies ever.

00:16.560 --> 00:22.560
 Then he cofounded Rethink Robotics that created some amazing collaborative robots like Baxter

00:22.560 --> 00:30.640
 and Sawyer. Finally, he cofounded Robust.ai, whose mission is to teach robots common sense,

00:30.640 --> 00:35.120
 which is a lot harder than it sounds. To support this podcast,

00:35.120 --> 00:37.360
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:38.160 --> 00:43.920
 As a side note, let me say that Rodney is someone I've looked up to for many years in my now over

00:43.920 --> 00:52.080
 two decade journey in robotics because, one, he's a legit great engineer of real world systems,

00:52.080 --> 00:57.600
 and two, he's not afraid to state controversial opinions that challenge the way we see the AI

00:57.600 --> 01:04.240
 world. But of course, while I agree with him on some of his critical views of AI, I don't agree

01:04.240 --> 01:10.640
 with some others, and he's fully supportive of such disagreement. Nobody ever built anything great

01:10.640 --> 01:16.960
 by being fully agreeable. There's always respect and love behind our interactions, and when a

01:16.960 --> 01:22.560
 conversation is recorded like it was for this podcast, I think a little bit of disagreement is

01:22.560 --> 01:29.520
 fun. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Rodney Brooks.

01:31.760 --> 01:37.040
 What is the most amazing or beautiful robot that you've ever had the chance to work with?

01:37.600 --> 01:43.760
 I think it was Domo, which was made by one of my grad students, Aaron Edsinger. It now sits in

01:43.760 --> 01:50.720
 Daniela Russo's office, director of CSAIL, and it was just a beautiful robot. Aaron was really

01:50.720 --> 01:56.240
 clever. He didn't give me a budget ahead of time. He didn't tell me what he was going to do.

01:56.240 --> 02:02.960
 He just started spending money. He spent a lot of money. He and Jeff Weber, who is a mechanical

02:02.960 --> 02:08.640
 engineer who Aaron insisted he bring with him when he became a grad student, built this beautiful,

02:08.640 --> 02:17.040
 gorgeous robot, Domo, which is an upper torso humanoid, two arms with fingers, three fingered

02:17.040 --> 02:26.000
 hands, and face eyeballs. Not the eyeballs, but everything else, series elastic actuators.

02:26.880 --> 02:33.760
 You can interact with it. Cable driven. All the motors are inside, and it's just gorgeous.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.680
 The eyeballs are actuated too, or no?

02:35.680 --> 02:40.000
 Oh yeah, the eyeballs are actuated with cameras, so it had a visual attention mechanism,

02:41.280 --> 02:46.240
 looking when people came in and looking in their face and talking with them.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.200
 Wow, was it amazing?

02:48.000 --> 02:48.800
 The beauty of it.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.040
 You said what was the most beautiful?

02:51.040 --> 02:52.160
 What is the most beautiful?

02:52.160 --> 02:55.600
 It's just mechanically gorgeous. As everything Aaron builds,

02:55.600 --> 02:59.520
 there's always been mechanically gorgeous. It's just exquisite in the detail.

03:00.400 --> 03:04.400
 We're talking about mechanically, like literally the amount of actuators.

03:04.400 --> 03:10.080
 The actuators, the cables, he anodizes different parts, different colors,

03:10.080 --> 03:13.200
 and it just looks like a work of art.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.720
 What about the face? Do you find the face beautiful in robots?

03:17.760 --> 03:23.120
 When you make a robot, it's making a promise for how well it will be able to interact,

03:23.120 --> 03:26.800
 so I always encourage my students not to overpromise.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.840
 Even with its essence, like the thing it presents, it should not overpromise.

03:31.840 --> 03:37.200
 Yeah, so the joke I make, which I think you'll get, is if your robot looks like Albert Einstein,

03:37.200 --> 03:39.440
 it should be as smart as Albert Einstein.

03:39.440 --> 03:47.520
 So the only thing in Domo's face is the eyeballs, because that's all it can do.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.200
 It can look at you and pay attention.

03:52.640 --> 03:58.240
 It's not like one of those Japanese robots that looks exactly like a person at all.

03:58.240 --> 04:06.160
 But see, the thing is, us humans and dogs, too, don't just use eyes as attentional mechanisms.

04:06.160 --> 04:09.440
 They also use it to communicate, as part of the communication.

04:09.440 --> 04:12.880
 Like a dog can look at you, look at another thing, and look back at you,

04:12.880 --> 04:15.840
 and that designates that we're going to be looking at that thing together.

04:15.840 --> 04:21.200
 Yeah, or intent, you know, on both Baxter and Sawyer at Rethink Robotics,

04:21.200 --> 04:25.440
 they had a screen with, you know, graphic eyes,

04:25.440 --> 04:31.200
 so it wasn't actually where the cameras were pointing, but the eyes would look in the direction

04:31.200 --> 04:36.160
 it was about to move its arm, so people in the factory nearby were not surprised by its motions,

04:36.160 --> 04:39.040
 because it gave that intent away.

04:39.840 --> 04:45.120
 Before we talk about Baxter, which I think is a beautiful robot, let's go back to the beginning.

04:45.120 --> 04:48.560
 When did you first fall in love with robotics?

04:48.560 --> 04:50.880
 We're talking about beauty and love to open the conversation.

04:50.880 --> 04:51.440
 This is great.

04:51.440 --> 04:56.960
 I was born in the end of 1954, and I grew up in Adelaide, South Australia,

04:57.520 --> 05:05.120
 and I have these two books that are dated 1961, so I'm guessing my mother found them in a store

05:05.120 --> 05:08.560
 in 62 or 63, How and Why Wonder Books.

05:09.600 --> 05:15.680
 How and Why Wonder Book of Electricity, and a How and Why Wonder Book of Giant Brains and Robots.

05:15.680 --> 05:23.200
 And I learned how to build circuits, you know, when I was eight or nine, simple circuits,

05:23.200 --> 05:31.680
 and I read, you know, learned the binary system, and saw all these drawings, mostly, of robots,

05:31.680 --> 05:34.720
 and then I tried to build them for the rest of my childhood.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.400
 Wait, 61, you said?

05:38.400 --> 05:41.200
 This was when the two books, I've still got them at home.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.520
 What does the robot mean in that context?

05:43.520 --> 05:51.600
 Some of the robots that they had were arms, you know, big arms to move nuclear material around,

05:51.600 --> 05:57.600
 but they had pictures of welding robots that looked like humans under the sea, welding stuff

05:57.600 --> 05:58.100
 underwater.

05:59.040 --> 06:04.480
 So they weren't real robots, but they were, you know, what people were thinking about for robots.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.560
 What were you thinking about?

06:06.560 --> 06:07.920
 Were you thinking about humanoids?

06:07.920 --> 06:09.760
 Were you thinking about arms with fingers?

06:09.760 --> 06:12.080
 Were you thinking about faces or colors?

06:12.080 --> 06:14.000
 Were you thinking about faces or cars?

06:14.000 --> 06:19.360
 No, actually, to be honest, I realized my limitation on building mechanical stuff.

06:19.360 --> 06:26.400
 So I just built the brains, mostly, out of different technologies as I got older.

06:28.320 --> 06:35.040
 I built a learning system which was chemical based, and I had this ice cube tray.

06:35.040 --> 06:42.400
 Each well was a cell, and by applying voltage to the two electrodes, it would build up a

06:42.400 --> 06:43.040
 copper bridge.

06:43.040 --> 06:50.000
 So over time, it would learn a simple network so I could teach it stuff.

06:50.000 --> 07:00.160
 And mostly, things were driven by my budget, and nails as electrodes and an ice cube tray

07:00.160 --> 07:02.160
 was about my budget at that stage.

07:02.160 --> 07:07.520
 Later, I managed to buy transistors, and I could build gates and flip flops and stuff.

07:07.520 --> 07:11.040
 So one of your first robots was an ice cube tray?

07:11.040 --> 07:15.120
 Yeah, it was very cerebral because it learned to add.

07:16.720 --> 07:17.220
 Very nice.

07:17.920 --> 07:26.080
 Well, just a decade or so before, in 1950, Alan Turing wrote a paper that formulated

07:26.080 --> 07:32.400
 the Turing Test, and he opened that paper with the question, can machines think?

07:32.400 --> 07:34.160
 So let me ask you this question.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.160
 Can machines think?

07:36.160 --> 07:39.120
 Can your ice cube tray one day think?

07:40.800 --> 07:44.720
 Certainly, machines can think because I believe you're a machine, and I'm a machine, and I

07:44.720 --> 07:45.680
 believe we both think.

07:46.640 --> 07:51.360
 I think any other philosophical position is sort of a little ludicrous.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.760
 What does think mean if it's not something that we do?

07:53.760 --> 07:54.960
 And we are machines.

07:56.160 --> 08:00.880
 So yes, machines can, but do we have a clue how to build such machines?

08:00.880 --> 08:02.480
 That's a very different question.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.680
 Are we capable of building such machines?

08:05.680 --> 08:06.720
 Are we smart enough?

08:06.720 --> 08:10.000
 We think we're smart enough to do anything, but maybe we're not.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.160
 Maybe we're just not smart enough to build stuff like us.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.720
 The kind of computer that Alan Turing was thinking about, do you think there is something

08:18.720 --> 08:25.040
 fundamentally or significantly different between the computer between our ears, the biological

08:25.040 --> 08:31.200
 computer that humans use, and the computer that he was thinking about from a sort of

08:31.200 --> 08:33.280
 high level philosophical?

08:33.280 --> 08:36.480
 Yeah, I believe that it's very wrong.

08:36.480 --> 08:44.160
 In fact, I'm halfway through a, I think it'll be about a 480 page book, the working title

08:44.160 --> 08:45.440
 is Not Even Wrong.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.080
 And if I may, I'll tell you a bit about that book.

08:48.080 --> 08:48.720
 Yes, please.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.360
 So there's two, well, three thrusts to it.

08:52.720 --> 08:56.160
 One is the history of computation, what we call computation.

08:56.160 --> 09:03.760
 It goes all the way back to some manuscripts in Latin from 1614 and 1620 by Napier and

09:03.760 --> 09:06.640
 Kepler through Babbage and Lovelace.

09:06.640 --> 09:16.640
 And then Turing's 1936 paper is what we think of as the invention of modern computation.

09:17.360 --> 09:23.120
 And that paper, by the way, did not set out to invent computation.

09:23.120 --> 09:29.680
 It set out to negatively answer one of Hilbert's three later set of problems.

09:29.680 --> 09:38.560
 He called it an effective way of getting answers.

09:38.560 --> 09:49.360
 And Hilbert really worked with rewriting rules, as did Church, who also, at the same time,

09:49.360 --> 09:54.880
 a month earlier than Turing, disproved Hilbert's one of these three hypotheses.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.360
 The other two had already been disproved by Gödel.

09:57.360 --> 10:01.680
 Turing set out to disprove it, because it's always easier to disprove these things than

10:01.680 --> 10:03.280
 to prove that there is an answer.

10:04.160 --> 10:12.880
 And so he needed, and it really came from his professor while I was an undergrad at

10:12.880 --> 10:16.400
 Cambridge, who turned it into, is there a mechanical process?

10:16.400 --> 10:23.840
 So he wanted to show a mechanical process that could calculate numbers, because that

10:23.840 --> 10:27.760
 was a mechanical process that people used to generate tables.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.800
 They were called computers, the people at the time.

10:30.800 --> 10:35.360
 And they followed a set of rules where they had paper, and they would write numbers down,

10:35.360 --> 10:38.480
 and based on the numbers, they'd keep writing other numbers.

10:39.040 --> 10:46.800
 And they would produce numbers for these tables, engineering tables, that the more iterations

10:46.800 --> 10:48.960
 they did, the more significant digits came out.

10:48.960 --> 10:56.960
 And so Turing, in that paper, set out to define what sort of machine could do that, mechanical

10:56.960 --> 11:04.320
 machine, where it could produce an arbitrary number of digits in the same way a human computer

11:04.320 --> 11:04.880
 did.

11:06.720 --> 11:13.600
 And he came up with a very simple set of constraints where there was an infinite supply

11:13.600 --> 11:14.320
 of paper.

11:14.320 --> 11:22.320
 This is the tape of the Turing machine, and each Turing machine came with a set of instructions

11:22.320 --> 11:27.920
 that, as a person, could do with pencil and paper, write down things on the tape and erase

11:27.920 --> 11:29.200
 them and put new things there.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.560
 And he was able to show that that system was not able to do something that Hilbert had

11:36.560 --> 11:38.800
 hypothesized, so he disproved it.

11:38.800 --> 11:47.120
 But he had to show that this system was good enough to do whatever could be done, but couldn't

11:47.120 --> 11:48.400
 do this other thing.

11:48.400 --> 11:53.840
 And there he said, and he says in the paper, I don't have any real arguments for this,

11:53.840 --> 11:55.200
 but based on intuition.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.080
 So that's how he defined computation.

11:58.080 --> 12:05.440
 And then if you look over the next, from 1936 up until really around 1975, you see people

12:05.440 --> 12:09.200
 struggling with, is this really what computation is?

12:10.000 --> 12:17.200
 And so Marvin Minsky, very well known in AI, but also a fantastic mathematician, in his

12:17.200 --> 12:22.400
 book Finite and Infant Machines from the mid-'60s, which is a beautiful, beautiful mathematical

12:22.400 --> 12:26.720
 book, says at the start of the book, well, what is computation?

12:26.720 --> 12:29.520
 Turing says it's this, and yeah, I sort of think it's that.

12:29.520 --> 12:32.240
 It doesn't really matter whether the stuff's made of wood or plastic.

12:32.240 --> 12:36.320
 It's just that relatively cheap stuff can do this stuff.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.200
 And so yeah, seems like computation.

12:40.160 --> 12:48.880
 And Donald Knuth, in his first volume of his Art of Computer Programming in around 1968,

12:49.440 --> 12:51.600
 says, well, what's computation?

12:52.320 --> 12:57.200
 It's this stuff, like Turing says, that a person could do each step without too much

12:57.200 --> 12:57.600
 trouble.

12:57.600 --> 13:03.600
 And so one of his examples of what would be too much trouble was a step which required

13:03.600 --> 13:08.160
 knowing whether Fermat's Last Theorem was true or not, because it was not known at the

13:08.160 --> 13:08.800
 time.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.120
 And that's too much trouble for a person to do as a step.

13:12.160 --> 13:18.080
 And Hopcroft and Ullman sort of said a similar thing later that year.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.960
 And by 1975, in the A.H.O.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.880
 Hopcroft and Ullman book, they're saying, well, you know, we don't really know what

13:24.880 --> 13:30.400
 computation is, but intuition says this is sort of about right, and this is what it is.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.400
 That's computation.

13:32.400 --> 13:39.280
 It's a sort of agreed upon thing which happens to be really easy to implement in silicon.

13:39.280 --> 13:43.920
 And then we had Moore's Law, which took off, and it's been an incredibly powerful tool.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.080
 I certainly wouldn't argue with that.

13:46.080 --> 13:49.440
 The version we have of computation, incredibly powerful.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.440
 Can we just take a pause?

13:51.440 --> 13:55.440
 So what we're talking about is there's an infinite tape with some simple rules of how

13:55.440 --> 13:59.120
 to write on that tape, and that's what we're kind of thinking about.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.080
 This is computation.

14:00.080 --> 14:03.200
 Yeah, and it's modeled after humans, how humans do stuff.

14:03.200 --> 14:09.040
 And I think it's, Turing says in the 36th paper, one of the critical facts here is that

14:09.040 --> 14:11.120
 a human has a limited amount of memory.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.280
 So that's what we're going to put onto our mechanical computers.

14:15.280 --> 14:19.680
 So, you know, I'm like mass.

14:19.680 --> 14:26.240
 I'm like mass or charge or, you know, it's not given by the universe.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.640
 It was, this is what we're going to call computation.

14:29.200 --> 14:33.600
 And then it has this really, you know, it had this really good implementation, which

14:33.600 --> 14:36.800
 has completely changed our technological world.

14:36.800 --> 14:37.680
 That's computation.

14:40.400 --> 14:48.880
 Second part of the book, or argument in the book, I have this two by two matrix with science.

14:48.880 --> 14:56.080
 In the top row, engineering in the bottom row, left column is intelligence, right column

14:56.080 --> 14:56.640
 is life.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.800
 So in the bottom row, the engineering, there's artificial intelligence and artificial life.

15:03.440 --> 15:07.520
 In the top row, there's neuroscience and abiogenesis.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.920
 How does living matter turn in?

15:09.920 --> 15:12.000
 How does nonliving matter become living matter?

15:12.720 --> 15:14.000
 Four disciplines.

15:14.000 --> 15:22.160
 These four disciplines all came into the current form in the period 1945 to 1965.

15:24.000 --> 15:24.880
 That's interesting.

15:24.880 --> 15:28.480
 There was neuroscience before, but it wasn't effective neuroscience.

15:28.480 --> 15:32.160
 It was, you know, there were these ganglia and there's electrical charges, but no one

15:32.160 --> 15:33.040
 knows what to do with it.

15:33.680 --> 15:37.360
 And furthermore, there are a lot of players who are common across them.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.360
 I've identified common players except for artificial intelligence and abiogenesis.

15:43.360 --> 15:47.200
 I don't have, but for any other pair, I can point to people who work them.

15:47.200 --> 15:51.840
 And a whole bunch of them, by the way, were at the research lab for electronics at MIT

15:53.200 --> 15:56.880
 where Warren McCulloch held forth.

15:58.240 --> 16:06.400
 In fact, McCulloch, Pitts, Letvin, and Maturana wrote the first paper on functional neuroscience

16:06.400 --> 16:10.480
 called What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain, where instead of it just being this

16:10.480 --> 16:17.680
 bunch of nerves, they sort of showed what different anatomical components were doing

16:17.680 --> 16:23.920
 and telling other anatomical components and, you know, generating behavior in the frog.

16:23.920 --> 16:29.840
 Would you put them as basically the fathers or one of the early pioneers of what are now

16:29.840 --> 16:31.440
 called artificial neural networks?

16:33.120 --> 16:35.120
 Yeah, I mean, McCulloch and Pitts.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.880
 Pitts was a much younger than him.

16:38.880 --> 16:48.240
 In 1943, had written a paper inspired by Bertrand Russell on a calculus for the ideas eminent

16:48.240 --> 16:56.080
 in neural systems where they had tried to, without any real proof, they had tried to

16:56.080 --> 17:03.280
 give a formalism for neurons basically in terms of logic and gates or gates and not

17:03.280 --> 17:09.120
 gates with no real evidence that that was what was going on, but they talked about it

17:09.120 --> 17:16.160
 and that was picked up by Minsky for his 1953 dissertation on, which was a neural

17:16.160 --> 17:17.760
 network, we call it today.

17:18.400 --> 17:26.640
 It was picked up by John von Neumann when he was designing the Edbeck computer in 1945.

17:26.640 --> 17:31.680
 He talked about its components being neurons based on, and in references, he's only got

17:31.680 --> 17:34.160
 three references and one of them is the McCulloch Pitts paper.

17:35.600 --> 17:40.000
 So all these people and then the AI people and the artificial life people, which was

17:40.000 --> 17:44.560
 John von Neumann originally, there's like overlap between all, they're all going around

17:44.560 --> 17:45.440
 the same time.

17:45.440 --> 17:50.640
 And three of these four disciplines turned to computation as their primary metaphor.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.480
 So I've got a couple of chapters in the book.

17:54.480 --> 17:58.480
 One is titled, wait, computers are people?

17:58.480 --> 18:00.800
 Because that's where our computers came from.

18:00.800 --> 18:01.920
 Yeah.

18:01.920 --> 18:05.280
 And, you know, from people who were computing stuff.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.960
 And then I've got another chapter, wait, people are computers?

18:08.960 --> 18:10.880
 Which is about computational neuroscience.

18:10.880 --> 18:11.360
 Yeah.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.120
 So there's this whole circle here.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.560
 And that computation is it.

18:16.560 --> 18:21.760
 And, you know, I have talked to people about, well, maybe it's not computation that goes

18:21.760 --> 18:22.960
 on in the head.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.160
 Of course it is.

18:24.160 --> 18:24.480
 Yeah.

18:24.480 --> 18:30.800
 Okay, well, when Elon Musk's rocket goes up, is it computing?

18:31.520 --> 18:32.800
 Is that how it gets into orbit?

18:32.800 --> 18:33.520
 By computing?

18:34.080 --> 18:37.920
 But we've got this idea, if you want to build an AI system, you write a computer program.

18:39.840 --> 18:46.480
 Yeah, so the word computation very quickly starts doing a lot of work that it was not

18:46.480 --> 18:48.640
 initially intended to do.

18:48.640 --> 18:53.280
 It's the second and same if you talk about the universe as essentially performing a

18:53.280 --> 18:53.760
 computation.

18:53.760 --> 18:54.320
 Yeah, right.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.280
 Wolfram does this.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.200
 He turns it into computation.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.360
 You don't turn rockets into computation.

18:59.360 --> 18:59.840
 Yeah.

18:59.840 --> 19:04.640
 By the way, when you say computation in our conversation, do you tend to think of computation

19:04.640 --> 19:07.200
 narrowly in the way Turing thought of computation?

19:08.000 --> 19:14.080
 It's gotten very, you know, squishy.

19:14.080 --> 19:14.400
 Yeah.

19:14.400 --> 19:14.880
 Squishy.

19:17.680 --> 19:22.640
 But computation in the way Turing thinks about it and the way most people think about it

19:22.640 --> 19:28.400
 actually fits very well with thinking like a hunter gatherer.

19:29.440 --> 19:34.000
 There are places and there can be stuff in places and the stuff in places can change

19:34.000 --> 19:36.160
 and it stays there until someone changes it.

19:37.120 --> 19:44.880
 And it's this metaphor of place and container, which, you know, is a combination of our place

19:44.880 --> 19:48.160
 cells in our hippocampus and our cortex.

19:48.160 --> 19:52.240
 But this is how we use metaphors for mostly to think about.

19:52.240 --> 19:57.120
 And when we get outside of our metaphor range, we have to invent tools which we can sort

19:57.120 --> 19:58.960
 of switch on to use.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.360
 So calculus is an example of a tool.

20:01.360 --> 20:06.640
 It can do stuff that our raw reasoning can't do, and we've got conventions of when you

20:06.640 --> 20:07.840
 can use it or not.

20:08.480 --> 20:15.280
 But sometimes, you know, people try to all the time, we always try to get physical metaphors

20:15.280 --> 20:21.040
 for things, which is why quantum mechanics has been such a problem for a hundred years.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.080
 Because it's a particle.

20:22.080 --> 20:22.880
 No, it's a wave.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.640
 It's got to be something we understand.

20:24.640 --> 20:29.040
 And I say, no, it's some weird mathematical logic that's different from those, but we

20:29.040 --> 20:30.080
 want that metaphor.

20:30.720 --> 20:35.680
 Well, you know, I suspect that, you know, a hundred years or 200 years from now, neither

20:35.680 --> 20:39.920
 quantum mechanics nor dark matter will be talked about in the same terms, you know,

20:39.920 --> 20:44.320
 in the same way that Flogerson's theory eventually went away.

20:44.320 --> 20:49.440
 Because it just wasn't an adequate explanatory metaphor, you know.

20:49.440 --> 20:56.000
 That metaphor was the stuff, there is stuff in the burning, the burning is in the matter.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.120
 As it turns out, the burning was outside the matter, it was the oxygen.

20:59.840 --> 21:05.440
 So our desire for metaphor and combined with our limited cognitive capabilities gets us

21:05.440 --> 21:06.400
 into trouble.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.320
 That's my argument in this book.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.080
 Now, and people say, well, what is it then?

21:10.080 --> 21:12.720
 And I say, well, I wish I knew that, right, the book about that.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.640
 But I, you know, I give some ideas.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.440
 But so there's the three things.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.920
 Computation is sort of a particular thing we use.

21:22.880 --> 21:26.320
 Oh, can I tell you one beautiful thing, one beautiful thing I found?

21:26.320 --> 21:30.000
 So, you know, I used an example of a thing that's different from computation.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.520
 You hit a drum and it vibrates, and there are some stationary points on the drum surface,

21:35.520 --> 21:37.840
 you know, because the waves are going up and down the stationary points.

21:37.840 --> 21:45.760
 Now, you could compute them to arbitrary precision, but the drum just knows them.

21:45.760 --> 21:46.960
 The drum doesn't have to compute.

21:47.760 --> 21:51.200
 What was the very first computer program ever written by Ada Lovelace?

21:51.920 --> 21:56.240
 To compute Bernoulli numbers, and the Bernoulli numbers are exactly what you need to find those

21:56.240 --> 21:58.320
 stable points in the drum surface.

21:58.320 --> 21:58.820
 Wow.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.120
 And there was a bug in the program.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.400
 The arguments to divide were, I don't know, I don't know.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.120
 The arguments to divide were reversed in one place.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.040
 And it still worked?

22:11.040 --> 22:12.560
 Well, no, she's never got to run it.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.000
 They never built the analytical engine.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.240
 She wrote the program without it, you know.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.040
 So the computation?

22:21.040 --> 22:26.160
 Computation is sort of, you know, a thing that's become dominant as a metaphor, but

22:27.200 --> 22:28.240
 is it the right metaphor?

22:29.680 --> 22:33.360
 All three of these four fields adopted computation.

22:33.360 --> 22:40.480
 And, you know, a lot of it swirls around Warren McCulloch and all his students, and he funded

22:40.480 --> 22:41.120
 a lot of people.

22:45.600 --> 22:49.360
 And our human metaphors, our limitations to human thinking, all play into this.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.680
 Those are the three themes of the book.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.880
 So I have a little to say about computation.

22:54.880 --> 23:05.040
 So you're saying that there is a gap between the computer or the machine that performs

23:05.040 --> 23:13.360
 computation and this machine that appears to have consciousness and intelligence.

23:13.360 --> 23:16.080
 Yeah, that piece of meat in your head.

23:16.080 --> 23:16.800
 Piece of meat.

23:16.800 --> 23:20.720
 And maybe it's not just the meat in your head, it's the rest of you too.

23:20.720 --> 23:24.960
 I mean, you actually have a neural system in your gut.

23:24.960 --> 23:31.040
 I tend to also believe, not believe, but we're now dancing around things we don't know, but

23:31.680 --> 23:35.280
 I tend to believe other humans are important.

23:36.560 --> 23:42.080
 Like, so we're almost like, I just don't think we would ever have achieved the level

23:42.080 --> 23:44.160
 of intelligence we have with other humans.

23:44.880 --> 23:49.680
 I'm not saying so confidently, but I have an intuition that some of the intelligence

23:49.680 --> 23:51.200
 is in the interaction.

23:51.200 --> 24:00.240
 Yeah, and I think it seems to be very likely, again, this is speculation, but we, our species,

24:00.240 --> 24:06.800
 and probably neanderthals to some extent, because you can find old bones where they

24:06.800 --> 24:14.320
 seem to be counting on them by putting notches that were neanderthals, we are able to put

24:15.360 --> 24:18.400
 some of our stuff outside our body into the world.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.840
 And then other people can share it.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.960
 And then we get these tools that become shared tools.

24:22.960 --> 24:30.240
 And so there's a whole coupling that would not occur in the single deep learning network,

24:30.240 --> 24:32.800
 which was fed all of literature or something.

24:33.840 --> 24:38.320
 Yeah, the neural network can't step outside of itself.

24:38.320 --> 24:46.640
 But is there some, can we explore this dark room a little bit and try to get at something?

24:46.640 --> 24:47.840
 What is the magic?

24:47.840 --> 24:51.840
 Where does the magic come from in the human brain that creates the mind?

24:52.480 --> 24:58.880
 What's your sense as scientists that try to understand it and try to build it?

24:58.880 --> 25:04.240
 What are the directions it followed might be productive?

25:04.240 --> 25:06.560
 Is it creative, interactive robots?

25:07.040 --> 25:13.440
 Is it creating large deep neural networks that do like self supervised learning and

25:13.440 --> 25:18.800
 just like we'll discover that when you make something large enough, some interesting things

25:18.800 --> 25:19.840
 will emerge?

25:19.840 --> 25:23.600
 Is it through physics and chemistry, biology, like artificial life angle?

25:23.600 --> 25:28.240
 Like we'll sneak up in this four quadrant matrix that you mentioned.

25:28.240 --> 25:33.440
 Is there anything you're most, if you had to bet all your money, financial?

25:33.440 --> 25:34.160
 I wouldn't.

25:35.040 --> 25:40.960
 So every intelligence we know, animal intelligence, dog intelligence,

25:40.960 --> 25:48.400
 octopus intelligence, which is a very different sort of architecture from us.

25:49.920 --> 25:59.520
 All the intelligences we know perceive the world in some way and then have action in

25:59.520 --> 26:11.520
 the world, but they're able to perceive objects in a way which is actually pretty damn phenomenal

26:11.520 --> 26:12.320
 and surprising.

26:13.200 --> 26:22.000
 We tend to think that the box over here between us, which is a sound box, I think is a blue

26:22.000 --> 26:30.560
 box, but blueness is something that we construct with color constancy.

26:32.560 --> 26:37.120
 The blueness is not a direct function of the photons we're receiving.

26:37.120 --> 26:47.600
 It's actually context, which is why you can turn, maybe seeing the examples where someone

26:47.600 --> 26:53.520
 turns a stop sign into some other sort of sign by just putting a couple of marks on

26:53.520 --> 26:55.280
 them and the deep learning system gets it wrong.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.600
 And everyone says, but the stop sign's red.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.920
 Why is it thinking it's the other sort of sign?

26:59.920 --> 27:02.800
 Because redness is not intrinsic in just the photons.

27:02.800 --> 27:07.120
 It's actually a construction of an understanding of the whole world and the relationship between

27:07.120 --> 27:09.840
 objects to get color constancy.

27:11.040 --> 27:15.760
 But our tendency, in order that we get an archive paper really quickly, is you just

27:15.760 --> 27:18.880
 show a lot of data and give the labels and hope it figures it out.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.040
 But it's not figuring it out in the same way we do.

27:21.040 --> 27:24.720
 We have a very complex perceptual understanding of the world.

27:24.720 --> 27:28.000
 Dogs have a very different perceptual understanding based on smell.

27:28.000 --> 27:34.880
 They go smell a post, they can tell how many different dogs have visited it in the last

27:34.880 --> 27:36.320
 10 hours and how long ago.

27:36.320 --> 27:39.440
 There's all sorts of stuff that we just don't perceive about the world.

27:39.440 --> 27:42.400
 And just taking a single snapshot is not perceiving about the world.

27:42.400 --> 27:48.400
 It's not seeing the registration between us and the object.

27:48.400 --> 27:52.160
 And registration is a philosophical concept.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.560
 Brian Cantwell Smith talks about it a lot.

27:54.560 --> 27:58.640
 Very difficult, squirmy thing to understand.

27:59.200 --> 28:02.080
 But I think none of our systems do that.

28:02.080 --> 28:06.000
 We've always talked in AI about the symbol grounding problem, how our symbols that we

28:06.000 --> 28:07.440
 talk about are grounded in the world.

28:08.080 --> 28:12.320
 And when deep learning came along and started labeling images, people said, ah, the grounding

28:12.320 --> 28:13.440
 problem has been solved.

28:13.440 --> 28:18.800
 No, the labeling problem was solved with some percentage accuracy, which is different from

28:18.800 --> 28:19.760
 the grounding problem.

28:20.560 --> 28:28.880
 So you agree with Hans Marvick and what's called the Marvick's paradox that highlights

28:28.880 --> 28:38.720
 this counterintuitive notion that reasoning is easy, but perception and mobility are hard.

28:39.440 --> 28:39.840
 Yeah.

28:39.840 --> 28:45.360
 We shared an office when I was working on computer vision and he was working on his

28:45.360 --> 28:46.640
 first mobile robot.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.400
 What were those conversations like?

28:48.400 --> 28:49.040
 They were great.

28:50.160 --> 28:55.440
 So do you still kind of, maybe you can elaborate, do you still believe this kind of notion that

28:56.160 --> 28:59.600
 perception is really hard?

28:59.600 --> 29:04.080
 Like, can you make sense of why we humans have this poor intuition about what's hard

29:04.080 --> 29:04.480
 and not?

29:04.480 --> 29:10.640
 Well, let me give us sort of another story.

29:10.640 --> 29:10.880
 Sure.

29:11.520 --> 29:21.680
 If you go back to the original teams working on AI from the late 50s into the 60s, and

29:21.680 --> 29:27.760
 you go to the AI lab at MIT, who was it that was doing that?

29:27.760 --> 29:32.480
 It was a bunch of really smart kids who got into MIT and they were intelligent.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.160
 So what's intelligence about?

29:34.160 --> 29:39.760
 Well, the stuff they were good at, playing chess, doing integrals, that was hard stuff.

29:40.480 --> 29:45.680
 But, you know, a baby could see stuff, that wasn't intelligent, anyone could do that,

29:45.680 --> 29:46.800
 that's not intelligence.

29:47.280 --> 29:52.480
 And so, you know, there was this intuition that the hard stuff is the things they were

29:52.480 --> 29:56.800
 good at and the easy stuff was the stuff that everyone could do.

29:57.440 --> 29:57.760
 Yeah.

29:57.760 --> 30:00.880
 And maybe I'm overplaying it a little bit, but I think there's an element of that.

30:00.880 --> 30:08.480
 Yeah, I mean, I don't know how much truth there is to, like chess, for example, was

30:08.480 --> 30:14.080
 for the longest time seen as the highest level of intellect, right?

30:14.720 --> 30:17.200
 Until we got computers that were better at it than people.

30:17.200 --> 30:21.120
 And then we realized, you know, if you go back to the 90s, you'll see, you know, the

30:21.120 --> 30:26.320
 stories in the press around when Kasparov was beaten by Deep Blue.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.320
 Oh, this is the end of all sorts of things.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.640
 Computers are going to be able to do anything from now on.

30:30.640 --> 30:35.120
 And we saw exactly the same stories with Alpha Zero, the Go Playing program.

30:36.160 --> 30:36.660
 Yeah.

30:37.280 --> 30:40.640
 But still, to me, reasoning is a special thing.

30:41.200 --> 30:41.920
 And perhaps...

30:41.920 --> 30:44.640
 No, actually, we're really bad at reasoning.

30:44.640 --> 30:48.400
 We just use these analogies based on our hunter gatherer intuitions.

30:48.400 --> 30:53.520
 But why is that not, don't you think the ability to construct metaphor is a really powerful

30:53.520 --> 30:53.920
 thing?

30:53.920 --> 30:54.400
 Oh, yeah, it is.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.200
 Tell stories.

30:55.200 --> 30:55.520
 It is.

30:55.520 --> 31:00.960
 It's the constructing the metaphor and registering that something constant in our brains.

31:00.960 --> 31:04.000
 Like, isn't that what we're doing with vision too?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.080
 And we're telling our stories.

31:06.080 --> 31:07.840
 We're constructing good models of the world.

31:08.560 --> 31:09.760
 Yeah, yeah.

31:09.760 --> 31:16.400
 But I think we jumped between what we're capable of and how we're doing it right there.

31:16.400 --> 31:21.680
 It was a little confusion that went on as we were telling each other stories.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.400
 Yes, exactly.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.800
 Trying to delude each other.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.280
 No, I just think I'm not exactly so.

31:27.280 --> 31:29.200
 I'm trying to pull apart this Moravec's paradox.

31:30.160 --> 31:31.520
 I don't view it as a paradox.

31:33.280 --> 31:36.000
 What did evolution spend its time on?

31:36.000 --> 31:36.320
 Yes.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.360
 It spent its time on getting us to perceive and move in the world.

31:39.360 --> 31:43.600
 That was 600 million years as multi cell creatures doing that.

31:43.600 --> 31:53.120
 And then it was relatively recent that we were able to hunt or gather or even animals hunting.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.960
 That's much more recent.

31:54.960 --> 32:02.960
 And then anything that we, speech, language, those things are a couple of hundred thousand

32:02.960 --> 32:05.760
 years probably, if that long.

32:05.760 --> 32:08.240
 And then agriculture, 10,000 years.

32:09.520 --> 32:13.760
 All that stuff was built on top of those earlier things, which took a long time to develop.

32:14.320 --> 32:20.160
 So if you then look at the engineering of these things, so building it into robots,

32:20.160 --> 32:22.000
 what's the hardest part of robotics?

32:22.000 --> 32:29.920
 Do you think as the decades that you worked on robots in the context of what we're talking

32:29.920 --> 32:37.520
 about, vision, perception, the actual sort of the biomechanics of movement, I'm kind

32:37.520 --> 32:40.160
 of drawing parallels here between humans and machines always.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.360
 Like what do you think is the hardest part of robotics?

32:44.320 --> 32:45.920
 I just want to think all of them.

32:45.920 --> 32:49.360
 I just want to think all of them.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.280
 There are no easy parts to do well.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.600
 We sort of go reductionist and we reduce it.

32:55.600 --> 33:00.320
 If only we had all the location of all the points in 3D, things would be great.

33:02.400 --> 33:07.440
 If only we had labels on the images, things would be great.

33:07.440 --> 33:10.640
 But as we see, that's not good enough.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.040
 Some deeper understanding.

33:13.040 --> 33:20.960
 But if I came to you and I could solve one category of problems in robotics instantly,

33:21.680 --> 33:24.000
 what would give you the greatest pleasure?

33:28.160 --> 33:36.400
 I mean, you look at robots that manipulate objects, what's hard about that?

33:36.400 --> 33:43.040
 You know, is it the perception, is it the reasoning about the world, that common sense

33:43.040 --> 33:48.720
 reasoning, is it the actual building a robot that's able to interact with the world?

33:49.680 --> 33:54.960
 Is it like human aspects of a robot that's interacting with humans in that game theory

33:54.960 --> 33:56.080
 of how they work well together?

33:56.080 --> 34:00.000
 Well, let's talk about manipulation for a second because I had this really blinding

34:00.000 --> 34:05.360
 moment, you know, I'm a grandfather, so grandfathers have blinding moments.

34:05.360 --> 34:15.680
 Just three or four miles from here, last year, my 16 month old grandson was in his new house

34:16.240 --> 34:17.600
 for the first time, right?

34:18.240 --> 34:19.200
 First time in this house.

34:19.760 --> 34:25.040
 And he'd never been able to get to a window before, but this had some low windows.

34:25.040 --> 34:29.360
 And he goes up to this window with a handle on it that he's never seen before.

34:29.360 --> 34:34.800
 And he's got one hand pushing the window and the other hand turning the handle to open

34:34.800 --> 34:35.300
 the window.

34:36.640 --> 34:42.960
 He knew two different hands, two different things he knew how to put together.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.520
 And he's 16 months old.

34:45.520 --> 34:47.040
 And there you are watching in awe.

34:51.840 --> 34:55.200
 In an environment he'd never seen before, a mechanism he'd never seen.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.320
 How did he do that?

34:56.320 --> 34:57.600
 Yes, that's a good question.

34:57.600 --> 34:58.880
 How did he do that?

34:58.880 --> 34:59.380
 That's why.

34:59.380 --> 35:05.700
 It's like, okay, like you could see the leap of genius from using one hand to perform a

35:05.700 --> 35:11.460
 task to combining, doing, I mean, first of all, in manipulation, that's really difficult.

35:11.460 --> 35:15.300
 It's like two hands, both necessary to complete the action.

35:15.940 --> 35:16.820
 And completely different.

35:16.820 --> 35:25.140
 And he'd never seen a window open before, but he inferred somehow handle open something.

35:25.140 --> 35:31.140
 Yeah, there may have been a lot of slightly different failure cases that you didn't see.

35:32.180 --> 35:36.020
 Not with a window, but with other objects of turning and twisting and handles.

35:37.540 --> 35:42.900
 There's a great counter to reinforcement learning.

35:42.900 --> 35:48.740
 We'll just give the robot plenty of time to try everything.

35:50.260 --> 35:52.260
 Can I tell a little side story here?

35:52.260 --> 36:01.940
 Yeah, so I'm in DeepMind in London, this is three, four years ago, where there's a big

36:01.940 --> 36:06.020
 Google building, and then you go inside and you go through this more security, and then

36:06.020 --> 36:09.060
 you get to DeepMind where the other Google employees can't go.

36:09.060 --> 36:15.540
 And I'm in a conference room, a conference room with some of the people, and they tell

36:15.540 --> 36:23.940
 me about their reinforcement learning experiment with robots, which are just trying stuff out.

36:23.940 --> 36:25.380
 And they're my robots.

36:25.380 --> 36:26.900
 They're Sawyer's.

36:26.900 --> 36:27.540
 We sold them.

36:29.060 --> 36:33.300
 And they really like them because Sawyer's are compliant and can sense forces, so they

36:33.300 --> 36:35.620
 don't break when they're bashing into walls.

36:36.180 --> 36:37.700
 They stop and they do all this stuff.

36:38.980 --> 36:42.580
 So you just let the robot do stuff, and eventually it figures stuff out.

36:42.580 --> 36:47.380
 By the way, Sawyer, we're talking about robot manipulation, so robot arms and so on.

36:47.380 --> 36:48.580
 Yeah, Sawyer's a robot.

36:50.180 --> 36:51.220
 What's Sawyer?

36:51.220 --> 36:55.140
 Sawyer's a robot arm that my company Rethink Robotics built.

36:55.140 --> 36:56.580
 Thank you for the context.

36:56.580 --> 36:57.060
 Sorry.

36:57.060 --> 36:57.540
 Okay, cool.

36:57.540 --> 36:58.420
 So we're in DeepMind.

36:59.380 --> 37:04.100
 And it's in the next room, these robots are just bashing around to try and use reinforcement

37:04.100 --> 37:05.300
 learning to learn how to act.

37:05.940 --> 37:06.740
 Can I go see them?

37:06.740 --> 37:07.780
 Oh no, they're secret.

37:08.340 --> 37:09.300
 They were my robots.

37:09.300 --> 37:10.020
 They were secret.

37:10.820 --> 37:11.700
 That's hilarious.

37:11.700 --> 37:12.100
 Okay.

37:12.100 --> 37:17.860
 Anyway, the point is, you know, this idea that you just let reinforcement learning figure

37:17.860 --> 37:21.060
 everything out is so counter to how a kid does stuff.

37:21.780 --> 37:24.740
 So again, story about my grandson.

37:24.740 --> 37:29.220
 I gave him this box that had lots of different lock mechanisms.

37:29.780 --> 37:34.260
 He didn't randomly, you know, and he was 18 months old, he didn't randomly try to touch

37:34.260 --> 37:35.940
 every surface or push everything.

37:35.940 --> 37:42.020
 He found he could see where the mechanism was, and he started exploring the mechanism

37:42.020 --> 37:43.940
 for each of these different lock mechanisms.

37:44.580 --> 37:48.100
 And there was reinforcement, no doubt, of some sort going on there.

37:48.660 --> 37:54.100
 But he applied a pre filter, which cut down the search space dramatically.

37:55.540 --> 37:59.140
 I wonder to what level we're able to introspect what's going on.

37:59.700 --> 38:03.780
 Because what's also possible is you have something like reinforcement learning going

38:03.780 --> 38:05.860
 on in the mind in the space of imagination.

38:05.860 --> 38:10.900
 So like you have a good model of the world you're predicting and you may be running those

38:10.900 --> 38:16.820
 tens of thousands of like loops, but you're like, as a human, you're just looking at yourself

38:16.820 --> 38:18.740
 trying to tell a story of what happened.

38:18.740 --> 38:24.500
 And it might seem simple, but maybe there's a lot of computation going on.

38:24.500 --> 38:28.020
 Whatever it is, but there's also a mechanism that's being built up.

38:28.020 --> 38:30.420
 It's not just random search.

38:30.420 --> 38:33.780
 Yeah, that mechanism prunes it dramatically.

38:33.780 --> 38:40.980
 Yeah, that pruning, that pruning stuff, but it doesn't, it's possible that that's, so

38:40.980 --> 38:45.620
 you don't think that's akin to a neural network inside a reinforcement learning algorithm.

38:46.740 --> 38:47.700
 Is it possible?

38:49.140 --> 38:52.340
 It's, yeah, until it's possible.

38:52.340 --> 39:01.380
 It's possible, but I'll be incredibly surprised if that happens.

39:01.380 --> 39:06.020
 I'll also be incredibly surprised that after all the decades that I've been doing this,

39:06.020 --> 39:09.540
 where every few years someone thinks, now we've got it.

39:10.100 --> 39:10.820
 Now we've got it.

39:12.580 --> 39:15.620
 Four or five years ago, I was saying, I don't think we've got it yet.

39:15.620 --> 39:18.820
 And everyone was saying, you don't understand how powerful AI is.

39:18.820 --> 39:22.420
 I had people tell me, you don't understand how powerful it is.

39:22.420 --> 39:30.420
 I sort of had a track record of what the world had done to think, well, this is no different

39:30.420 --> 39:31.460
 from before.

39:31.460 --> 39:33.060
 Or we have bigger computers.

39:33.060 --> 39:35.940
 We had bigger computers in the 90s and we could do more stuff.

39:37.940 --> 39:43.380
 But okay, so let me push back because I'm generally sort of optimistic and try to find

39:43.380 --> 39:44.260
 the beauty in things.

39:44.260 --> 39:51.860
 I think there's a lot of surprising and beautiful things that neural networks, this new generation

39:51.860 --> 39:57.460
 of deep learning revolution has revealed to me, has continually been very surprising

39:57.460 --> 39:59.300
 the kind of things it's able to do.

39:59.300 --> 40:03.140
 Now, generalizing that over saying like this, we've solved intelligence.

40:03.140 --> 40:05.220
 That's another big leap.

40:05.220 --> 40:10.500
 But is there something surprising and beautiful to you about neural networks that were actually

40:10.500 --> 40:14.500
 you said back and said, I did not expect this?

40:16.100 --> 40:22.260
 Oh, I think their performance on ImageNet was shocking.

40:22.260 --> 40:26.340
 The computer vision in those early days was just very like, wow, okay.

40:26.340 --> 40:32.500
 That doesn't mean that they're solving everything in computer vision we need to solve or in

40:32.500 --> 40:33.700
 vision for robots.

40:33.700 --> 40:37.220
 What about AlphaZero and self play mechanisms and reinforcement learning?

40:37.220 --> 40:39.300
 Yeah, that was all in the 90s.

40:39.300 --> 40:42.740
 Yeah, that was all in Donald Mickey's 1961 paper.

40:44.020 --> 40:47.540
 Everything that was there, which introduced reinforcement learning.

40:48.340 --> 40:49.300
 No, but come on.

40:49.300 --> 40:52.020
 So no, you're talking about the actual techniques.

40:52.020 --> 40:57.140
 But isn't it surprising to you the level it's able to achieve with no human supervision

40:58.740 --> 40:59.700
 of chess play?

40:59.700 --> 41:05.860
 Like, to me, there's a big, big difference between Deep Blue and...

41:05.860 --> 41:11.860
 Maybe what that's saying is how overblown our view of ourselves is.

41:13.140 --> 41:14.740
 You know, the chess is easy.

41:16.740 --> 41:28.340
 Yeah, I mean, I came across this 1946 report that, and I'd seen this as a kid in one of

41:28.340 --> 41:30.340
 those books that my mother had given me actually.

41:30.340 --> 41:39.060
 The 1946 report, which pitted someone with an abacus against an electronic calculator,

41:39.620 --> 41:42.500
 and he beat the electronic calculator.

41:42.500 --> 41:48.980
 You know, so there at that point was, well, humans are still better than machines at calculating.

41:48.980 --> 41:54.420
 Are you surprised today that a machine can, you know, do a billion floating point operations

41:54.420 --> 41:58.500
 a second and, you know, you're puzzling for minutes through one?

41:58.500 --> 42:07.460
 I mean, I don't know, but I am certainly surprised there's something, to me, different about

42:07.460 --> 42:10.420
 learning, so a system that's able to learn.

42:10.420 --> 42:10.980
 Learning.

42:10.980 --> 42:13.700
 See, now you're getting into one of the deadly sins.

42:15.300 --> 42:19.220
 Because of using terms overly broadly.

42:19.220 --> 42:21.700
 Yeah, I mean, there's so many different forms of learning.

42:21.700 --> 42:22.260
 Yeah.

42:22.260 --> 42:23.300
 So many different forms.

42:23.300 --> 42:24.980
 You know, I learned my way around the city.

42:24.980 --> 42:26.500
 I learned to play chess.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.580
 I learned Latin.

42:28.580 --> 42:30.100
 I learned to ride a bicycle.

42:30.100 --> 42:33.700
 All of those are, you know, very different capabilities.

42:33.700 --> 42:34.180
 Yeah.

42:34.180 --> 42:41.860
 And if someone, you know, has a, you know, in the old days, people would write a paper

42:41.860 --> 42:43.220
 about learning something.

42:43.220 --> 42:52.580
 Now the corporate press office puts out a press release about how Company X is leading

42:52.580 --> 42:56.820
 the world because they have a system that can...

42:56.820 --> 42:58.180
 Yeah, but here's the thing.

42:58.180 --> 42:58.500
 Okay.

42:58.500 --> 42:59.460
 So what is learning?

43:00.100 --> 43:00.820
 When I refer to...

43:00.820 --> 43:02.420
 Learning is many things.

43:02.420 --> 43:02.580
 But...

43:02.580 --> 43:04.660
 It's a suitcase word.

43:04.660 --> 43:12.980
 It's a suitcase word, but loosely, there's a dumb system, and over time, it becomes smart.

43:13.700 --> 43:16.340
 Well, it becomes less dumb at the thing that it's doing.

43:16.340 --> 43:19.140
 Smart is a loaded word.

43:19.140 --> 43:21.220
 Yes, less dumb at the thing it's doing.

43:21.220 --> 43:27.060
 It gets better performance under some measure, under some set of conditions at that thing.

43:27.060 --> 43:35.780
 And most of these learning algorithms, learning systems, fail when you change the conditions

43:35.780 --> 43:37.940
 just a little bit in a way that humans don't.

43:37.940 --> 43:45.940
 So I was at DeepMind, the AlphaGo had just come out, and I said, what would have happened

43:45.940 --> 43:49.940
 if you'd given it a 21 by 21 board instead of a 19 by 19 board?

43:49.940 --> 43:51.620
 They said, fail totally.

43:51.620 --> 43:55.540
 But a human player would actually be able to play.

43:55.540 --> 44:02.980
 And actually, funny enough, if you look at DeepMind's work since then, they're presenting

44:02.980 --> 44:07.620
 a lot of algorithms that would do well at the bigger board.

44:07.620 --> 44:10.340
 So they're slowly expanding this generalization.

44:10.340 --> 44:12.580
 I mean, to me, there's a core element there.

44:12.580 --> 44:20.100
 I think it is very surprising to me that even in a constrained game of chess or Go, that

44:20.100 --> 44:27.620
 through self play, by a system playing itself, that it can achieve superhuman level performance

44:28.580 --> 44:29.940
 through learning alone.

44:29.940 --> 44:38.980
 Okay, so you didn't like it when I referred to Donald Mickey's 1961 paper.

44:38.980 --> 44:46.020
 There, in the second part of it, which came a year later, they had self play on an electronic

44:46.020 --> 44:52.180
 computer at tic tac toe, okay, but it learned to play tic tac toe through self play.

44:52.180 --> 44:54.580
 And it learned to play optimally.

44:54.580 --> 45:02.740
 What I'm saying is, okay, I have a little bit of a bias, but I find ideas beautiful,

45:02.740 --> 45:06.660
 but only when they actually realize the promise.

45:06.660 --> 45:08.420
 That's another level of beauty.

45:08.420 --> 45:13.540
 For example, what Bezos and Elon Musk are doing with rockets.

45:13.540 --> 45:18.900
 We had rockets for a long time, but doing reusable cheap rockets, it's very impressive.

45:18.900 --> 45:22.980
 In the same way, I would have not predicted.

45:22.980 --> 45:30.820
 First of all, when I started and fell in love with AI, the game of Go was seen to be impossible

45:30.820 --> 45:31.300
 to solve.

45:31.300 --> 45:38.500
 Okay, so I thought maybe, you know, maybe it'd be possible to maybe have big leaps in

45:38.500 --> 45:42.020
 a Moore's law style of way, in computation, I'll be able to solve it.

45:42.020 --> 45:50.500
 But I would never have guessed that you can learn your way, however, I mean, in the narrow

45:50.500 --> 45:55.620
 sense of learning, learn your way to beat the best people in the world at the game of

45:55.620 --> 45:59.300
 Go without human supervision, not studying the game of experts.

45:59.300 --> 46:08.900
 Okay, so using a different learning technique, Arthur Samuel in the early 60s, and he was

46:08.900 --> 46:14.900
 the first person to use machine learning, had a program that could beat the world champion

46:14.900 --> 46:15.540
 at checkers.

46:16.100 --> 46:19.860
 And that at the time was considered amazing.

46:19.860 --> 46:22.820
 By the way, Arthur Samuel had some fantastic advantages.

46:23.460 --> 46:25.700
 Do you want to hear Arthur Samuel's advantages?

46:25.700 --> 46:26.660
 Two things.

46:26.660 --> 46:30.500
 One, he was at the 1956 AI conference.

46:30.500 --> 46:32.420
 I knew Arthur later in life.

46:32.420 --> 46:34.500
 He was at Stanford when I was a graduate student there.

46:34.500 --> 46:37.060
 He wore a tie and a jacket every day, the rest of us didn't.

46:38.900 --> 46:40.500
 Delightful man, delightful man.

46:42.980 --> 46:51.620
 It turns out Claude Shannon, in a 1950 Scientific American article, on chess playing, outlined

46:51.620 --> 46:57.140
 the learning mechanism that Arthur Samuel used, and they had met in 1956.

46:57.140 --> 47:00.020
 I assume there was some communication, but I don't know that for sure.

47:00.580 --> 47:07.060
 But Arthur Samuel had been a vacuum tube engineer, getting reliability of vacuum tubes, and then

47:07.060 --> 47:11.860
 had overseen the first transistorized computers at IBM.

47:11.860 --> 47:18.180
 And in those days, before you shipped a computer, you ran it for a week to get early failures.

47:18.180 --> 47:28.580
 So he had this whole farm of computers running random code for hours and hours for each computer.

47:28.580 --> 47:29.940
 He had a whole bunch of them.

47:29.940 --> 47:38.820
 So he ran his chess learning program with self play on IBM's production line.

47:38.820 --> 47:43.700
 He had more computation available to him than anyone else in the world, and then he was

47:43.700 --> 47:48.260
 able to produce a chess playing program, I mean a checkers playing program, that could

47:48.260 --> 47:49.220
 beat the world champion.

47:49.940 --> 47:51.540
 So that's amazing.

47:51.540 --> 47:57.060
 The question is, what I mean surprised, I don't just mean it's nice to have that accomplishment,

47:58.020 --> 48:06.180
 is there is a stepping towards something that feels more intelligent than before.

48:06.180 --> 48:08.740
 Yeah, but that's in your view of the world.

48:08.740 --> 48:11.380
 Okay, well let me then, it doesn't mean I'm wrong.

48:11.380 --> 48:13.540
 No, no it doesn't.

48:13.540 --> 48:18.740
 So the question is, if we keep taking steps like that, how far that takes us?

48:18.740 --> 48:21.780
 Are we going to build a better recommender systems?

48:21.780 --> 48:23.860
 Are we going to build a better robot?

48:23.860 --> 48:25.940
 Or will we solve intelligence?

48:25.940 --> 48:33.300
 So, you know, I'm putting my bet on, but still missing a whole lot.

48:33.300 --> 48:33.800
 A lot.

48:34.500 --> 48:36.020
 And why would I say that?

48:36.020 --> 48:43.060
 Well, in these games, they're all, you know, 100% information games, but again, but each

48:43.060 --> 48:50.420
 of these systems is a very short description of the current state, which is different from

48:50.420 --> 48:55.620
 registering and perception in the world, which gets back to Marovec's paradox.

48:55.620 --> 49:05.780
 I'm definitely not saying that chess is somehow harder than perception or any kind of, even

49:05.780 --> 49:10.180
 any kind of robotics in the physical world, I definitely think is way harder than the

49:10.180 --> 49:10.820
 game of chess.

49:10.820 --> 49:15.300
 So I was always much more impressed by the workings of the human mind.

49:15.300 --> 49:15.940
 It's incredible.

49:15.940 --> 49:16.900
 The human mind is incredible.

49:17.700 --> 49:20.340
 I believe that from the very beginning, I wanted to be a psychiatrist for the longest

49:20.340 --> 49:20.740
 time.

49:20.740 --> 49:23.140
 I always thought that's way more incredible in the game of chess.

49:23.140 --> 49:26.740
 I think the game of chess is, I love the Olympics.

49:26.740 --> 49:31.860
 It's just another example of us humans picking a task and then agreeing that a million humans

49:31.860 --> 49:33.860
 will dedicate their whole life to that task.

49:33.860 --> 49:39.860
 And that's the cool thing that the human mind is able to focus on one task and then compete

49:39.860 --> 49:44.500
 against each other and achieve like weirdly incredible levels of performance.

49:44.500 --> 49:46.740
 That's the aspect of chess that's super cool.

49:46.740 --> 49:49.700
 Not that chess in itself is really difficult.

49:49.700 --> 49:53.460
 It's like the Fermat's last theorem is not in itself to me that interesting.

49:53.460 --> 49:57.780
 The fact that thousands of people have been struggling to solve that particular problem

49:57.780 --> 49:58.500
 is fascinating.

49:58.500 --> 50:00.500
 So can I tell you my disease in this way?

50:00.500 --> 50:00.740
 Sure.

50:01.460 --> 50:03.380
 Which actually is closer to what you're saying.

50:03.380 --> 50:07.620
 So as a child, I was building various, I called them computers.

50:07.620 --> 50:09.380
 They weren't general purpose computers.

50:09.380 --> 50:10.180
 Ice cube tray.

50:10.180 --> 50:11.380
 The ice cube tray was one.

50:11.380 --> 50:12.660
 But I built other machines.

50:12.660 --> 50:18.100
 And what I liked to build was machines that could beat adults at a game and the adults

50:18.100 --> 50:19.700
 couldn't beat my machine.

50:19.700 --> 50:19.940
 Yeah.

50:19.940 --> 50:22.660
 So you were like, that's powerful.

50:22.660 --> 50:24.820
 That's a way to rebel.

50:24.820 --> 50:33.220
 Oh, by the way, when was the first time you built something that outperformed you?

50:33.220 --> 50:33.860
 Do you remember?

50:34.660 --> 50:36.340
 Well, I knew how it worked.

50:36.340 --> 50:42.020
 I was probably nine years old and I built a thing that was a game where you take turns

50:42.020 --> 50:47.460
 in taking matches from a pile and either the one who takes the last one or the one who

50:47.460 --> 50:48.660
 doesn't take the last one wins.

50:48.660 --> 50:49.460
 I forget.

50:49.460 --> 50:54.500
 And so it was pretty easy to build that out of wires and nails and little coils that were

50:54.500 --> 50:58.020
 like plugging in the number and a few light bulbs.

50:59.060 --> 51:07.220
 The one I was proud of, I was 12 when I built a thing out of old telephone switchboard switches

51:07.220 --> 51:11.380
 that could always win at tic tac toe.

51:11.380 --> 51:14.500
 And that was a much harder circuit to design.

51:14.500 --> 51:17.620
 But again, it was no active components.

51:17.620 --> 51:23.300
 It was just three position switches, empty, X, zero, O.

51:23.300 --> 51:29.460
 And nine of them and a light bulb on which move it wanted next.

51:29.460 --> 51:31.540
 And then the human would go and move that.

51:31.540 --> 51:33.060
 See, there's magic in that creation.

51:33.060 --> 51:33.860
 There was.

51:33.860 --> 51:34.580
 Yeah, yeah.

51:34.580 --> 51:43.700
 I tend to see magic in robots that like I also think that intelligence is a little bit

51:43.700 --> 51:44.740
 overrated.

51:44.740 --> 51:48.100
 I think we can have deep connections with robots very soon.

51:49.140 --> 51:52.500
 And well, we'll come back to connections for sure.

51:52.500 --> 52:00.100
 But I do want to say, I think too many people make the mistake of seeing that magic and

52:00.100 --> 52:02.020
 thinking, well, we'll just continue.

52:02.820 --> 52:07.300
 But each one of those is a hard fought battle for the next step, the next step.

52:07.300 --> 52:07.540
 Yes.

52:08.180 --> 52:11.940
 The open question here is, and this is why I'm playing devil's advocate, but I often

52:11.940 --> 52:18.420
 do when I read your blog post in my mind because I have like this eternal optimism, is it's

52:18.420 --> 52:19.380
 not clear to me.

52:19.380 --> 52:23.940
 So I don't do what obviously the journalists do or they give into the hype, but it's not

52:23.940 --> 52:34.740
 obvious to me how many steps away we are from a truly transformational understanding of

52:34.740 --> 52:39.780
 what it means to build intelligent systems or how to build intelligent systems.

52:40.580 --> 52:45.140
 I'm also aware of the whole history of artificial intelligence, which is where your deep grounding

52:45.140 --> 52:51.860
 of this is, is there has been an optimism for decades and that optimism, just like reading

52:51.860 --> 52:57.300
 old optimism is absurd because people were like, this is, they were saying things are

52:57.300 --> 53:00.740
 trivial for decades since the sixties, they're saying everything is true.

53:00.740 --> 53:07.700
 Computer vision is trivial, but I think my mind is working crisply enough to where, I

53:07.700 --> 53:09.700
 mean, we can dig into if you want.

53:09.700 --> 53:12.900
 I'm really surprised by the things DeepMind has done.

53:12.900 --> 53:19.300
 I don't think they're so, they're yet close to solving intelligence, but I'm not sure

53:19.300 --> 53:21.220
 it's not 10 to 10 years away.

53:22.500 --> 53:30.100
 What I'm referring to is interesting to see when the engineering, it takes that idea to

53:30.100 --> 53:32.660
 scale and the idea works.

53:32.660 --> 53:34.100
 And no, it fools people.

53:34.900 --> 53:35.300
 Okay.

53:35.300 --> 53:40.420
 Honestly, Rodney, if it was you, me and Demis inside a room, forget the press, forget all

53:40.420 --> 53:47.060
 those things, just as a scientist, as a roboticist, that wasn't surprising to you that at scale.

53:47.060 --> 53:50.180
 So we're talking about very large now, okay, let's pick one.

53:50.180 --> 53:52.340
 That's the most surprising to you.

53:52.340 --> 53:52.820
 Okay.

53:52.820 --> 53:53.940
 Please don't yell at me.

53:53.940 --> 53:56.180
 GPT three, okay.

53:56.180 --> 54:03.300
 Hold on, hold on, I was going to say, okay, alpha zero, alpha go, alpha go, zero, alpha

54:03.300 --> 54:06.340
 zero, and then alpha fold one and two.

54:06.340 --> 54:13.460
 So do any of these kind of have this core of, forget usefulness or application and so

54:13.460 --> 54:19.220
 on, which you could argue for alpha fold, like, as a scientist, was those surprising

54:19.220 --> 54:22.260
 to you that it worked as well as it did?

54:23.140 --> 54:30.820
 Okay, so if we're going to make the distinction between surprise and usefulness, and I have

54:30.820 --> 54:40.580
 to explain this, I would say alpha fold, and one of the problems at the moment with alpha

54:40.580 --> 54:44.820
 fold is, you know, it gets a lot of them right, which is a surprise to me, because they're

54:44.820 --> 54:51.940
 a really complex thing, but you don't know which ones it gets right, which then is a

54:51.940 --> 54:52.500
 bit of a problem.

54:52.500 --> 54:53.620
 Now they've come out with a recent...

54:53.620 --> 54:56.180
 You mean the structure of the proteins, it gets a lot of those right.

54:56.180 --> 55:00.180
 Yeah, it's a surprising number of them right, it's been a really hard problem.

55:00.180 --> 55:02.100
 So that was a surprise how many it gets right.

55:03.220 --> 55:07.460
 So far, the usefulness is limited, because you don't know which ones are right or not,

55:07.460 --> 55:12.900
 and now they've come out with a thing in the last few weeks, which is trying to get a useful

55:12.900 --> 55:14.980
 tool out of it, and they may well do it.

55:15.620 --> 55:20.820
 In that sense, at least alpha fold is different, because your alpha fold tool is different,

55:21.940 --> 55:27.460
 because now it's producing data sets that are actually, you know, potentially revolutionizing

55:27.460 --> 55:31.620
 competition biology, like they will actually help a lot of people, but...

55:31.620 --> 55:36.020
 You would say potentially revolutionizing, we don't know yet, but yeah.

55:36.020 --> 55:36.820
 That's true, yeah.

55:36.820 --> 55:39.220
 But they're, you know, but I got you.

55:39.220 --> 55:40.020
 I mean, this is...

55:40.020 --> 55:45.860
 Okay, so you know what, this is gonna be so fun, so let's go right into it.

55:45.860 --> 55:52.020
 Speaking of robots that operate in the real world, let's talk about self driving cars.

55:52.740 --> 55:54.740
 Oh, okay.

55:54.740 --> 56:00.500
 Okay, because you have built robotics companies, you're one of the greatest roboticists in

56:00.500 --> 56:06.500
 history, and that's not just in the space of ideas, we'll also probably talk about that,

56:06.500 --> 56:13.220
 but in the actual building and execution of businesses that make robots that are useful

56:13.220 --> 56:16.020
 for people and that actually work in the real world and make money.

56:18.660 --> 56:24.420
 You also sometimes are critical of Mr. Elon Musk, or let's more specifically focus on

56:24.420 --> 56:27.620
 this particular technology, which is autopilot inside Teslas.

56:29.380 --> 56:33.780
 What are your thoughts about Tesla autopilot, or more generally vision based machine learning

56:33.780 --> 56:36.740
 approach to semi autonomous driving?

56:38.580 --> 56:43.140
 These are robots, they're being used in the real world by hundreds of thousands of people,

56:43.700 --> 56:49.940
 and if you want to go there, I can go there, but that's not too much, which they're...

56:49.940 --> 56:57.220
 Let's say they're on par safety wise as humans currently, meaning human alone versus human

56:57.220 --> 56:58.500
 plus robot.

56:58.500 --> 57:03.860
 Okay, so first let me say I really like the car I came in here today.

57:03.860 --> 57:04.340
 Which is?

57:06.260 --> 57:11.860
 2021 model, Mercedes E450.

57:12.740 --> 57:19.620
 I am impressed by the machine vision, sonar, other things.

57:19.620 --> 57:21.700
 I'm impressed by what it can do.

57:21.700 --> 57:27.140
 I'm really impressed with many aspects of it.

57:29.540 --> 57:31.380
 It's able to stay in lane, is it?

57:31.380 --> 57:33.140
 Oh yeah, it does the lane stuff.

57:35.940 --> 57:40.260
 It's looking on either side of me, it's telling me about nearby cars.

57:40.260 --> 57:41.540
 For blind spots and so on.

57:41.540 --> 57:48.100
 Yeah, when I'm going in close to something in the park, I get this beautiful, gorgeous,

57:48.100 --> 57:49.780
 top down view of the world.

57:49.780 --> 57:56.900
 I am impressed up the wazoo of how registered and metrical that is.

57:56.900 --> 58:00.900
 So it's like multiple cameras and it's all ready to go to produce the 360 view kind of

58:00.900 --> 58:00.900
 thing?

58:00.900 --> 58:05.780
 360 view, it's synthesized so it's above the car, and it is unbelievable.

58:06.580 --> 58:10.740
 I got this car in January, it's the longest I've ever owned a car without digging it.

58:11.460 --> 58:12.420
 So it's better than me.

58:13.540 --> 58:15.940
 Me and it together are better.

58:15.940 --> 58:24.980
 So I'm not saying technology's bad or not useful, but here's my point.

58:24.980 --> 58:30.260
 Yes, it's a replay of the same movie.

58:31.380 --> 58:34.900
 Okay, so maybe you've seen me ask this question before.

58:34.900 --> 58:54.100
 But when did the first car go over 55 miles an hour for over 10 miles on a public freeway

58:54.100 --> 58:56.660
 with other traffic around driving completely autonomously?

58:56.660 --> 58:57.460
 When did that happen?

58:59.060 --> 59:01.380
 Was it CMU in the 80s or something?

59:01.380 --> 59:02.340
 It was a long time ago.

59:02.340 --> 59:07.540
 It was actually in 1987 in Munich at the Bundeswehr.

59:09.380 --> 59:11.540
 So they had it running in 1987.

59:12.500 --> 59:16.660
 When do you think, and Elon has said he's going to do this, when do you think we'll

59:16.660 --> 59:23.780
 have the first car drive coast to coast in the US, hands off the wheel, feet off the

59:23.780 --> 59:25.220
 pedals, coast to coast?

59:25.940 --> 59:28.340
 As far as I know, a few people have claimed to do it.

59:28.340 --> 59:30.660
 1995, that was Carnegie Mellon.

59:30.660 --> 59:35.700
 I didn't know, but oh, that was the, they didn't claim, did they claim 100%?

59:35.700 --> 59:37.540
 Not 100%, not 100%.

59:37.540 --> 59:41.940
 And then there's a few marketing people who have claimed 100% since then.

59:41.940 --> 59:50.740
 My point is that, you know, what I see happening again is someone sees a demo and they overgeneralize

59:50.740 --> 59:52.340
 and say, we must be almost there.

59:52.340 --> 59:54.900
 But we've been working on it for 35 years.

59:54.900 --> 59:56.180
 So that's demos.

59:56.180 --> 59:59.540
 But this is going to take us back to the same conversation with AlphaZero.

59:59.540 --> 1:00:06.100
 Are you not, okay, I'll just say what I am because I thought, okay, when I first started

1:00:06.100 --> 1:00:12.740
 interacting with the Mobileye implementation of Tesla Autopilot, I've driven a lot of car,

1:00:12.740 --> 1:00:15.940
 you know, I've been in Google self driving car since the beginning.

1:00:18.020 --> 1:00:23.300
 I thought there was no way before I sat and used Mobileye, I thought they're just knowing

1:00:23.300 --> 1:00:24.100
 computer vision.

1:00:24.100 --> 1:00:26.980
 I thought there's no way it could work as well as it was working.

1:00:26.980 --> 1:00:35.300
 So my model of the limits of computer vision was way more limited than the actual implementation

1:00:35.300 --> 1:00:35.940
 of Mobileye.

1:00:35.940 --> 1:00:37.860
 I was so that's one example.

1:00:37.860 --> 1:00:39.380
 I was really surprised.

1:00:39.380 --> 1:00:41.700
 It's like, wow, that was that was incredible.

1:00:41.700 --> 1:00:48.820
 The second surprise came when Tesla threw away Mobileye and started from scratch.

1:00:50.580 --> 1:00:52.740
 I thought there's no way they can catch up to Mobileye.

1:00:52.740 --> 1:00:56.260
 I thought what Mobileye was doing was kind of incredible, like the amount of work and

1:00:56.260 --> 1:00:56.980
 the annotation.

1:00:56.980 --> 1:01:01.620
 Yeah, well, Mobileye was started by Amnon Shashua and used a lot of traditional, you

1:01:01.620 --> 1:01:04.420
 know, hard fought computer vision techniques.

1:01:04.420 --> 1:01:11.620
 But they also did a lot of good sort of like non research stuff, like actual like just

1:01:11.620 --> 1:01:14.420
 good, like what you do to make a successful product, right?

1:01:14.420 --> 1:01:16.020
 Scale, all that kind of stuff.

1:01:16.020 --> 1:01:20.020
 And so I was very surprised when they from scratch were able to catch up to that.

1:01:20.660 --> 1:01:21.620
 That's very impressive.

1:01:21.620 --> 1:01:23.780
 And I've talked to a lot of engineers that was involved.

1:01:23.780 --> 1:01:25.620
 This is that was impressive.

1:01:25.620 --> 1:01:26.260
 That was impressive.

1:01:27.300 --> 1:01:34.900
 And the recent progress, especially under the involvement of Andrej Karpathy, what they

1:01:34.900 --> 1:01:40.340
 were what they're doing with the data engine, which is converting into the driving task

1:01:40.340 --> 1:01:45.140
 into these multiple tasks and then doing this edge case discovery when they're pulling back

1:01:45.140 --> 1:01:49.940
 like the level of engineering made me rethink what's possible.

1:01:49.940 --> 1:01:55.380
 I don't I still, you know, I don't know to that intensity, but I always thought it was

1:01:55.380 --> 1:02:00.260
 very difficult to solve autonomous driving with all the sensors, with all the computation.

1:02:00.260 --> 1:02:01.860
 I just thought it's a very difficult problem.

1:02:02.420 --> 1:02:07.860
 But I've been continuously surprised how much you can engineer.

1:02:07.860 --> 1:02:12.100
 First of all, the data acquisition problem, because I thought, you know, just because

1:02:12.100 --> 1:02:20.180
 I worked with a lot of car companies and they're they're so a little a little bit old school

1:02:20.180 --> 1:02:25.940
 to where I didn't think they could do this at scale like AWS style data collection.

1:02:25.940 --> 1:02:32.180
 So when Tesla was able to do that, I started to think, OK, so what are the limits of this?

1:02:33.140 --> 1:02:40.980
 I still believe that driver like sensing and the interaction with the driver and like studying

1:02:40.980 --> 1:02:43.700
 the human factor psychology problem is essential.

1:02:43.700 --> 1:02:45.460
 It's it's always going to be there.

1:02:45.460 --> 1:02:48.740
 It's always going to be there, even with fully autonomous driving.

1:02:48.740 --> 1:02:55.220
 But I've been surprised what is the limit, especially a vision based alone, how far that

1:02:55.220 --> 1:02:56.020
 can take us.

1:02:57.060 --> 1:02:59.860
 So that's my levels of surprise now.

1:03:00.900 --> 1:03:07.380
 OK, can you explain in the same way you said, like Alpha Zero, that's a homework problem

1:03:07.380 --> 1:03:10.260
 that's scaled large in its chest, like who cares?

1:03:10.260 --> 1:03:15.380
 Go with here's actual people using an actual car and driving.

1:03:15.380 --> 1:03:19.380
 Many of them drive more than half their miles using the system.

1:03:19.380 --> 1:03:19.880
 Right.

1:03:20.420 --> 1:03:24.980
 So, yeah, they're doing well with with pure vision for your vision.

1:03:24.980 --> 1:03:25.480
 Yeah.

1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:30.820
 And, you know, and now no radar, which is I suspect that can't go all the way.

1:03:30.820 --> 1:03:36.340
 And one reason is without without new cameras that have a dynamic range closer to the human

1:03:36.340 --> 1:03:39.300
 eye, because human eye has incredible dynamic range.

1:03:39.300 --> 1:03:46.500
 And we make use of that dynamic range in its 11 orders of magnitude or some crazy number

1:03:46.500 --> 1:03:47.000
 like that.

1:03:47.700 --> 1:03:53.140
 The cameras don't have that, which is why you see the the the bad cases where the sun

1:03:53.140 --> 1:03:57.060
 on a white thing and it blinds it in a way it wouldn't blind the person.

1:03:59.860 --> 1:04:06.020
 I think there's a bunch of things to think about before you say this is so good, it's

1:04:06.020 --> 1:04:06.660
 just going to work.

1:04:06.660 --> 1:04:12.180
 OK, and I'll come at it from multiple angles.

1:04:12.180 --> 1:04:13.700
 And I know you've got a lot of time.

1:04:13.700 --> 1:04:14.200
 Yeah.

1:04:14.420 --> 1:04:17.220
 OK, let's let's I have thought about these things.

1:04:17.220 --> 1:04:18.740
 Yeah, I know.

1:04:18.740 --> 1:04:24.980
 You've been writing a lot of great blog posts about it for a while before Tesla had autopilot.

1:04:24.980 --> 1:04:25.480
 Right.

1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:28.660
 So you've been thinking about autonomous driving for a while from every angle.

1:04:29.220 --> 1:04:36.020
 So so a few things, you know, in the US, I think that the death rate for autonomous driving

1:04:36.020 --> 1:04:42.500
 death rate from motor vehicle accidents is about thirty five thousand a year,

1:04:44.900 --> 1:04:49.140
 which is an outrageous number, not outrageous compared to covid deaths.

1:04:49.140 --> 1:04:50.980
 But, you know, there is no rationality.

1:04:52.100 --> 1:04:54.340
 And that's part of the thing people have said.

1:04:54.340 --> 1:04:58.900
 Engineers say to me, well, if we cut down the number of deaths by 10 percent by having

1:04:58.900 --> 1:05:01.300
 autonomous driving, that's going to be great.

1:05:01.300 --> 1:05:02.100
 Everyone will love it.

1:05:02.100 --> 1:05:09.620
 And my prediction is that if autonomous vehicles kill more than 10 people a year, they'll be

1:05:09.620 --> 1:05:14.260
 screaming and hollering, even though thirty five thousand people a year have been killed

1:05:14.260 --> 1:05:15.300
 by human drivers.

1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:17.300
 It's not rational.

1:05:17.860 --> 1:05:19.620
 It's a different set of expectations.

1:05:20.100 --> 1:05:21.700
 And that will probably continue.

1:05:23.860 --> 1:05:25.300
 So there's that aspect of it.

1:05:25.300 --> 1:05:34.420
 The other aspect of it is that when we introduce new technology, we often change the rules

1:05:34.420 --> 1:05:34.980
 of the game.

1:05:36.020 --> 1:05:45.060
 So when we introduced cars first into our daily lives, we completely rebuilt our cities

1:05:45.060 --> 1:05:46.900
 and we changed all the laws.

1:05:46.900 --> 1:05:52.820
 Yeah, jaywalking was not an offense that was pushed by the car companies so that people

1:05:52.820 --> 1:05:56.820
 would stay off the road so there wouldn't be deaths from pedestrians getting hit.

1:05:57.460 --> 1:06:02.580
 We completely changed the structure of our cities and had these foul smelling things

1:06:02.580 --> 1:06:04.580
 everywhere around us.

1:06:04.580 --> 1:06:11.060
 And now you see pushback in cities like Barcelona is really trying to exclude cars, et cetera.

1:06:11.060 --> 1:06:21.460
 So I think that to get to self driving, we will, large adoption, it's not going to be

1:06:21.460 --> 1:06:27.300
 just take the current situation, take out the driver and put the same car doing the

1:06:27.300 --> 1:06:30.100
 same stuff because the end case is too many.

1:06:31.860 --> 1:06:33.300
 Here's an interesting question.

1:06:33.300 --> 1:06:39.860
 How many fully autonomous train systems do we have in the U.S.?

1:06:41.860 --> 1:06:43.860
 I mean, do you count them as fully autonomous?

1:06:43.860 --> 1:06:47.860
 I don't know because they're usually as a driver, but they're kind of autonomous, right?

1:06:47.860 --> 1:06:49.860
 No, let's get rid of the driver.

1:06:51.380 --> 1:06:51.860
 Okay.

1:06:51.860 --> 1:06:52.820
 I don't know.

1:06:52.820 --> 1:06:54.660
 It's either 15 or 16.

1:06:54.660 --> 1:06:56.180
 Most of them are in airports.

1:06:56.900 --> 1:06:59.860
 There's a few that are fully autonomous.

1:06:59.860 --> 1:07:06.260
 Seven are in airports, there's a few that go about five, two that go about five kilometers

1:07:06.260 --> 1:07:07.060
 out of airports.

1:07:11.460 --> 1:07:17.460
 When is the first fully autonomous train system for mass transit expected to operate fully

1:07:17.460 --> 1:07:22.420
 autonomously with no driver in a U.S.

1:07:22.420 --> 1:07:22.920
 City?

1:07:23.540 --> 1:07:27.940
 It's expected to operate in 2017 in Honolulu.

1:07:27.940 --> 1:07:29.300
 Oh, wow.

1:07:29.300 --> 1:07:32.020
 It's delayed, but they will get there.

1:07:32.020 --> 1:07:35.780
 BART, by the way, was originally going to be autonomous here in the Bay Area.

1:07:35.780 --> 1:07:38.820
 I mean, they're all very close to fully autonomous, right?

1:07:38.820 --> 1:07:41.540
 Yeah, but getting that close is the thing.

1:07:41.540 --> 1:07:48.660
 And I've often gone on a fully autonomous train in Japan, one that goes out to that

1:07:48.660 --> 1:07:50.660
 fake island in the middle of Tokyo Bay.

1:07:50.660 --> 1:07:51.700
 I forget the name of that.

1:07:53.460 --> 1:07:55.540
 And what do you see when you look at that?

1:07:55.540 --> 1:08:02.020
 What do you see when you go to a fully autonomous train in an airport?

1:08:03.380 --> 1:08:05.300
 It's not like regular trains.

1:08:07.060 --> 1:08:12.100
 At every station, there's a double set of doors so that there's a door of the train

1:08:12.100 --> 1:08:16.340
 and there's a door off the platform.

1:08:18.020 --> 1:08:23.540
 And this is really visible in this Japanese one because it goes out in amongst buildings.

1:08:23.540 --> 1:08:27.060
 The whole track is built so that people can't climb onto it.

1:08:27.060 --> 1:08:27.560
 Yeah.

1:08:27.860 --> 1:08:32.260
 So there's an engineering that then makes the system safe and makes them acceptable.

1:08:32.260 --> 1:08:37.620
 I think we'll see similar sorts of things happen in the U.S.

1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:46.180
 What surprised me, I thought, wrongly, that we would have special purpose lanes on 101

1:08:46.180 --> 1:08:55.140
 in the Bay Area, the leftmost lane, so that it would be normal for Teslas or other cars

1:08:55.140 --> 1:09:00.900
 to move into that lane and then say, okay, now it's autonomous and have that dedicated lane.

1:09:00.900 --> 1:09:03.380
 I was expecting movement to that.

1:09:03.380 --> 1:09:06.500
 Five years ago, I was expecting we'd have a lot more movement towards that.

1:09:06.500 --> 1:09:07.460
 We haven't.

1:09:07.460 --> 1:09:12.820
 And it may be because Tesla's been overpromising by saying this, calling their system fully

1:09:12.820 --> 1:09:21.780
 self driving, I think they may have been gotten there quicker by collaborating to change the

1:09:21.780 --> 1:09:22.580
 infrastructure.

1:09:23.460 --> 1:09:30.180
 This is one of the problems with long haul trucking being autonomous.

1:09:30.180 --> 1:09:38.020
 I think it makes sense on freeways at night for the trucks to go autonomously, but then

1:09:38.020 --> 1:09:40.260
 is that how do you get onto and off of the freeway?

1:09:40.260 --> 1:09:42.980
 What sort of infrastructure do you need for that?

1:09:43.780 --> 1:09:48.500
 Do you need to have the human in there to do that or can you get rid of the human?

1:09:48.500 --> 1:09:55.060
 So I think there's ways to get there, but it's an infrastructure argument because the

1:09:55.060 --> 1:10:02.020
 long tail of cases is very long and the acceptance of it will not be at the same level as human

1:10:02.020 --> 1:10:02.580
 drivers.

1:10:02.580 --> 1:10:09.780
 So I'm with you still, and I was with you for a long time, but I am surprised how well

1:10:09.780 --> 1:10:14.820
 how many edge cases of machine learning and vision based methods can cover.

1:10:15.540 --> 1:10:22.260
 This is what I'm trying to get at is I think there's something fundamentally different

1:10:22.260 --> 1:10:27.460
 with vision based methods and Tesla Autopilot and any company that's trying to do the same.

1:10:27.460 --> 1:10:34.260
 Okay, well, I'm not going to argue with you because, you know, we're speculating.

1:10:34.260 --> 1:10:43.620
 Yes, but, you know, my gut feeling tells me it's going to be things will speed up when

1:10:43.620 --> 1:10:48.260
 there is engineering of the environment because that's what happened with every other technology.

1:10:48.260 --> 1:10:53.940
 I'm a bit, I don't know about you, but I'm a bit cynical that infrastructure is going

1:10:53.940 --> 1:10:59.460
 to rely on government to help out in these cases.

1:11:00.340 --> 1:11:05.540
 If you just look at infrastructure in all domains, it's just a government always drags

1:11:05.540 --> 1:11:06.900
 behind on infrastructure.

1:11:07.540 --> 1:11:11.780
 There's like there's so many just well in this country in the future.

1:11:11.780 --> 1:11:12.260
 Sorry.

1:11:12.260 --> 1:11:13.700
 Yes, in this country.

1:11:13.700 --> 1:11:17.780
 And of course, there's many, many countries that are actually much worse on infrastructure.

1:11:17.780 --> 1:11:21.220
 Oh, yes, many of the much worse and there's some that are much worse.

1:11:21.220 --> 1:11:25.940
 You know, like high speed rail, the other countries are much better.

1:11:25.940 --> 1:11:31.220
 I guess my question is, like, which is at the core of what I was trying to think through

1:11:31.220 --> 1:11:37.540
 here and ask is like, how hard is the driving problem as it currently stands?

1:11:37.540 --> 1:11:41.220
 So you mentioned, like, we don't want to just take the human out and duplicate whatever

1:11:41.220 --> 1:11:42.260
 the human was doing.

1:11:42.260 --> 1:11:48.340
 But if we were to try to do that, what, how hard is that problem?

1:11:48.340 --> 1:11:52.420
 Because I used to think is way harder.

1:11:52.420 --> 1:11:59.220
 Like, I used to think it's with vision alone, it would be three decades, four decades.

1:11:59.220 --> 1:12:06.740
 Okay, so I don't know the answer to this thing I'm about to pose, but I do notice that on

1:12:06.740 --> 1:12:13.380
 Highway 280 here in the Bay Area, which largely has concrete surface rather than blacktop

1:12:13.380 --> 1:12:20.900
 surface, the white lines that are painted there now have black boundaries around them.

1:12:20.900 --> 1:12:27.460
 And my lane drift system in my car would not work without those black boundaries.

1:12:27.460 --> 1:12:28.260
 Interesting.

1:12:28.260 --> 1:12:32.420
 So I don't know whether they started doing it to help the lane drift, whether it is an

1:12:32.420 --> 1:12:41.220
 instance of infrastructure following the technology, but my car would not perform as well as the

1:12:41.220 --> 1:12:45.460
 lane, my car would not perform as well without that change in the way they paint the line.

1:12:45.460 --> 1:12:50.340
 Unfortunately, really good lane keeping is not as valuable.

1:12:50.340 --> 1:12:54.900
 Like, it's orders of magnitude more valuable to have a fully autonomous system.

1:12:54.900 --> 1:13:00.900
 Like, yeah, but for me, lane keeping is really helpful because I'm more healthy at it.

1:13:00.900 --> 1:13:03.700
 But you wouldn't pay 10 times.

1:13:03.700 --> 1:13:11.540
 Like, the problem is there's not financial, like, it doesn't make sense to revamp the

1:13:11.540 --> 1:13:14.260
 infrastructure to make lane keeping easier.

1:13:14.820 --> 1:13:17.300
 It does make sense to revamp the infrastructure.

1:13:17.300 --> 1:13:22.260
 If you have a large fleet of autonomous vehicles, now you change what it means to own cars,

1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:23.860
 you change the nature of transportation.

1:13:24.980 --> 1:13:29.620
 But for that, you need autonomous vehicles.

1:13:29.620 --> 1:13:31.540
 Let me ask you about Waymo then.

1:13:31.540 --> 1:13:37.380
 I've gotten a bunch of chances to ride in a Waymo self driving car.

1:13:37.380 --> 1:13:40.980
 And they're, I don't know if you'd call them self driving, but.

1:13:40.980 --> 1:13:45.780
 Well, I mean, I rode in one before they were called Waymo when I was still at X.

1:13:45.780 --> 1:13:50.740
 So there's currently, there's a big leap, another surprising leap I didn't think would

1:13:50.740 --> 1:13:53.780
 happen, which is they have no driver currently.

1:13:53.780 --> 1:13:55.060
 Yeah, in Chandler.

1:13:55.060 --> 1:13:56.100
 In Chandler, Arizona.

1:13:56.100 --> 1:13:58.980
 And I think they're thinking of doing that in Austin as well.

1:13:58.980 --> 1:14:01.540
 But they're expanding.

1:14:01.540 --> 1:14:06.100
 Although, you know, and I do an annual checkup on this.

1:14:06.100 --> 1:14:13.300
 So as of late last year, they were aiming for hundreds of rides a week, not thousands.

1:14:14.020 --> 1:14:22.660
 And there is no one in the car, but there's certainly safety people in the loop.

1:14:22.660 --> 1:14:26.820
 And it's not clear how many, you know, what the ratio of cars to safety people is.

1:14:26.820 --> 1:14:31.620
 It wasn't, obviously, they're not 100% transparent about this.

1:14:31.620 --> 1:14:33.220
 None of them are 100% transparent.

1:14:33.220 --> 1:14:34.420
 They're very untransparent.

1:14:34.420 --> 1:14:39.540
 But at least the way they're, I don't want to make definitively, but they're saying

1:14:39.540 --> 1:14:40.740
 there's no teleoperation.

1:14:42.580 --> 1:14:45.620
 So like, they're, I mean, okay.

1:14:45.620 --> 1:14:51.780
 And that sort of fits with YouTube videos I've seen of people being trapped in the car

1:14:52.820 --> 1:14:55.460
 by a red cone on the street.

1:14:55.460 --> 1:15:01.620
 And they do have rescue vehicles that come, and then a person gets in and drives it.

1:15:01.620 --> 1:15:02.120
 Yeah.

1:15:02.580 --> 1:15:09.700
 But isn't it incredible to you, it was to me, to get in a car with no driver and watch

1:15:09.700 --> 1:15:15.060
 the steering wheel turn, like for somebody who has been studying, at least certainly

1:15:15.060 --> 1:15:18.980
 the human side of autonomous vehicles for many years, and you've been doing it for way

1:15:18.980 --> 1:15:22.420
 longer, like it was incredible to me that this was actually could happen.

1:15:22.420 --> 1:15:24.100
 I don't care if that scale is 100 cars.

1:15:24.100 --> 1:15:25.860
 This is not a demo.

1:15:25.860 --> 1:15:28.820
 This is not, this is me as a regular human.

1:15:28.820 --> 1:15:33.060
 The argument I have is that people make interpolations from that.

1:15:33.060 --> 1:15:33.940
 Interpolations.

1:15:33.940 --> 1:15:35.780
 That, you know, it's here, it's done.

1:15:37.060 --> 1:15:39.380
 You know, it's just, you know, we've solved it.

1:15:39.380 --> 1:15:40.340
 No, we haven't yet.

1:15:40.980 --> 1:15:42.500
 And that's my argument.

1:15:42.500 --> 1:15:42.900
 Okay.

1:15:42.900 --> 1:15:48.420
 So I'd like to go to, you keep a list of predictions on your amazing blog post.

1:15:48.420 --> 1:15:49.700
 It'd be fun to go through them.

1:15:49.700 --> 1:15:51.620
 But before then, let me ask you about this.

1:15:51.620 --> 1:16:03.140
 You have a harshness to you sometimes in your criticisms of what is perceived as hype.

1:16:05.940 --> 1:16:10.980
 And so like, because people extrapolate, like you said, and they kind of buy into the hype

1:16:10.980 --> 1:16:18.900
 and then they kind of start to think that the technology is way better than it is.

1:16:18.900 --> 1:16:21.700
 But let me ask you maybe a difficult question.

1:16:22.260 --> 1:16:22.760
 Sure.

1:16:23.780 --> 1:16:30.740
 Do you think if you look at history of progress, don't you think to achieve the quote impossible,

1:16:30.740 --> 1:16:32.740
 you have to believe that it's possible?

1:16:32.740 --> 1:16:34.260
 Oh, absolutely.

1:16:34.260 --> 1:16:34.820
 Yeah.

1:16:34.820 --> 1:16:46.980
 Look, his two great runs, great, unbelievable, 1903, first human power, human, you know,

1:16:46.980 --> 1:16:49.300
 human, you know, heavier than their flight.

1:16:49.300 --> 1:16:49.800
 Yeah.

1:16:50.580 --> 1:16:52.740
 1969, we land on the moon.

1:16:52.740 --> 1:16:53.940
 That's 66 years.

1:16:53.940 --> 1:17:00.260
 I'm 66 years old in my lifetime, that span of my lifetime, barely, you know, flying,

1:17:00.260 --> 1:17:05.380
 I don't know what it was, 50 feet, the length of the first flight or something to landing

1:17:05.380 --> 1:17:05.780
 on the moon.

1:17:06.340 --> 1:17:07.380
 Unbelievable.

1:17:08.100 --> 1:17:08.980
 Fantastic.

1:17:08.980 --> 1:17:13.060
 But that requires, by the way, one of the Wright brothers, both of them, but one of

1:17:13.060 --> 1:17:16.180
 them didn't believe it's even possible like a year before.

1:17:16.180 --> 1:17:16.680
 Right.

1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:20.420
 So, like, not just possible soon, but like ever.

1:17:20.420 --> 1:17:21.940
 So, you know.

1:17:21.940 --> 1:17:24.820
 How important is it to believe and be optimistic is what I guess.

1:17:24.820 --> 1:17:26.100
 Oh, yeah, it is important.

1:17:26.100 --> 1:17:32.100
 It's when it goes crazy, when I, you know, you said that, what was the word you used

1:17:32.100 --> 1:17:33.060
 for my bad?

1:17:33.060 --> 1:17:33.780
 Harshness.

1:17:33.780 --> 1:17:34.580
 Harshness.

1:17:34.580 --> 1:17:35.080
 Yes.

1:17:40.180 --> 1:17:41.940
 I just get so frustrated.

1:17:41.940 --> 1:17:42.440
 Yes.

1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:51.260
 When people make these leaps and tell me that I'm, that I don't understand, you know, yeah.

1:17:53.020 --> 1:17:57.420
 There's just from iRobot, which I was co founder of.

1:17:57.420 --> 1:17:57.740
 Yeah.

1:17:57.740 --> 1:18:00.860
 I don't know the exact numbers now because I haven't, it's 10 years since I stepped

1:18:00.860 --> 1:18:06.220
 off the board, but I believe it's well over 30 million robots cleaning houses from that

1:18:06.220 --> 1:18:06.780
 one company.

1:18:06.780 --> 1:18:08.140
 And now there's lots of other companies.

1:18:08.140 --> 1:18:08.140
 Yes.

1:18:08.140 --> 1:18:14.940
 Was that a crazy idea that we had to believe in 2002 when we released it?

1:18:14.940 --> 1:18:20.540
 Yeah, that was, we had, we had to, you know, believe that it could be done.

1:18:20.540 --> 1:18:21.740
 Let me ask you about this.

1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:28.380
 So iRobot, one of the greatest robotics companies ever in terms of creating a robot that actually

1:18:28.380 --> 1:18:31.900
 works in the real world, probably the greatest robotics company ever.

1:18:31.900 --> 1:18:33.660
 You were the co founder of it.

1:18:33.660 --> 1:18:40.860
 If, if the Rodney Brooks of today talked to the Rodney of back then, what would you tell

1:18:40.860 --> 1:18:41.340
 him?

1:18:41.340 --> 1:18:47.100
 Cause I have a sense that would you pat him on the back and say, well, you're doing is

1:18:47.100 --> 1:18:50.780
 going to fail, but go at it anyway.

1:18:50.780 --> 1:18:54.060
 That's what I'm referring to with the harshness.

1:18:54.060 --> 1:18:56.700
 You've accomplished an incredible thing there.

1:18:56.700 --> 1:19:01.500
 One of the several things we'll talk about was, you know, you know, you know, you've

1:19:01.500 --> 1:19:03.820
 done several things we'll talk about.

1:19:03.820 --> 1:19:06.940
 Well, like that's what I'm trying to get at that line.

1:19:06.940 --> 1:19:14.140
 No, it's, it's when my harshness is reserved for people who are not doing it, who claim

1:19:14.140 --> 1:19:16.860
 it's just, well, this shows that it's just going to happen.

1:19:16.860 --> 1:19:18.300
 But here, here's the thing.

1:19:18.300 --> 1:19:19.020
 This shows.

1:19:19.020 --> 1:19:22.700
 But you have that harshness for Elon too.

1:19:24.060 --> 1:19:26.380
 And no, no, it's a different harshness.

1:19:26.380 --> 1:19:30.540
 No, it's, it's a different argument with Elon.

1:19:30.540 --> 1:19:34.780
 I think SpaceX is an amazing company.

1:19:34.780 --> 1:19:40.060
 On the other hand, you know, I, in one of my blog posts, I said, what's easy and what's

1:19:40.060 --> 1:19:40.460
 hard.

1:19:40.460 --> 1:19:44.300
 I said, yeah, space X vertical landing rockets.

1:19:44.300 --> 1:19:45.340
 It had been done before.

1:19:46.380 --> 1:19:48.700
 Grid fins had been done since the sixties.

1:19:48.700 --> 1:19:49.740
 Every Soyuz has them.

1:19:52.780 --> 1:19:58.220
 Reusable space DCX reuse those rockets that landed vertically.

1:19:58.220 --> 1:20:02.780
 There's a whole insurance industry in place for rocket launches.

1:20:02.780 --> 1:20:07.980
 There are all sorts of infrastructure that was doable.

1:20:07.980 --> 1:20:11.980
 It took a great entrepreneur, a great personal expense.

1:20:11.980 --> 1:20:18.220
 He almost drove himself, you know, bankrupt doing it, a great belief to do it.

1:20:18.860 --> 1:20:25.740
 Whereas Hyperloop, there's a whole bunch more stuff that's never been thought about and

1:20:25.740 --> 1:20:28.380
 never been demonstrated.

1:20:28.380 --> 1:20:33.660
 So my estimation is Hyperloop is a long, long, long, a lot further off.

1:20:33.660 --> 1:20:38.940
 But, and if I've got a criticism of, of, of Elon, it's that he doesn't make distinctions

1:20:39.740 --> 1:20:44.780
 between when the technology's coming along and ready.

1:20:44.780 --> 1:20:50.140
 And then he'll go off and mouth off about other things, which then people go and compete

1:20:50.140 --> 1:20:51.100
 about and try and do.

1:20:51.100 --> 1:20:57.580
 And so this is where I, I, I, I understand what you're saying.

1:20:57.580 --> 1:20:59.340
 I tend to draw a different distinction.

1:21:00.060 --> 1:21:06.220
 I, I have a similar kind of harshness towards people who are not telling the truth, who

1:21:06.220 --> 1:21:11.420
 are basically fabricating stuff to make money or to, well, he believes what he says.

1:21:11.420 --> 1:21:18.300
 I just think that's a very important difference because I think in order to fly, in order

1:21:18.300 --> 1:21:24.060
 to get to the moon, you have to believe even when most people tell you you're wrong and

1:21:24.060 --> 1:21:26.940
 most likely you're wrong, but sometimes you're right.

1:21:26.940 --> 1:21:29.900
 I mean, that's the same thing I have with Tesla autopilot.

1:21:29.900 --> 1:21:31.900
 I think that's an interesting one.

1:21:31.900 --> 1:21:38.780
 I was, especially when I was at MIT and just the entire human factors in the robotics community

1:21:38.780 --> 1:21:40.300
 were very negative towards Elon.

1:21:40.300 --> 1:21:43.020
 It was very interesting for me to observe colleagues at MIT.

1:21:45.020 --> 1:21:46.620
 I wasn't sure what to make of that.

1:21:46.620 --> 1:21:51.100
 That was very upsetting to me because I understood where that, where that's coming from.

1:21:51.900 --> 1:21:56.300
 And I agreed with them and I kind of almost felt the same thing in the beginning until

1:21:56.300 --> 1:22:01.660
 I kind of opened my eyes and realized there's a lot of interesting ideas here that might

1:22:01.660 --> 1:22:02.540
 be over hype.

1:22:02.540 --> 1:22:09.740
 You know, if you focus yourself on the idea that you shouldn't call a system full self

1:22:09.740 --> 1:22:16.220
 driving when it's obviously not autonomous, fully autonomous, you're going to miss the

1:22:16.220 --> 1:22:16.860
 magic.

1:22:16.860 --> 1:22:18.940
 Oh, yeah, you are going to miss the magic.

1:22:18.940 --> 1:22:25.340
 But at the same time, there are people who buy it, literally pay money for it and take

1:22:25.340 --> 1:22:27.180
 those words as given.

1:22:27.180 --> 1:22:30.300
 So it's, but I haven't.

1:22:30.300 --> 1:22:33.420
 So that I take words as given is one thing.

1:22:33.420 --> 1:22:38.940
 I haven't actually seen people that use autopilot that believe that the behavior is really important,

1:22:39.500 --> 1:22:40.700
 like the actual action.

1:22:40.700 --> 1:22:45.740
 So like, this is to push back on the very thing that you're frustrated about, which

1:22:45.740 --> 1:22:52.460
 is like journalists and general people buying all the hype and going out in the same way.

1:22:52.460 --> 1:22:57.980
 I think there's a lot of hype about the negatives of this, too, that people are buying without

1:22:57.980 --> 1:23:01.020
 using people use the way this is what this was.

1:23:01.020 --> 1:23:02.060
 This opened my eyes.

1:23:02.060 --> 1:23:07.580
 Actually, the way people use a product is very different than the way they talk about

1:23:07.580 --> 1:23:07.820
 it.

1:23:07.820 --> 1:23:09.500
 This is true with robotics, with everything.

1:23:09.500 --> 1:23:13.660
 Everybody has dreams of how a particular product might be used or so on.

1:23:13.660 --> 1:23:17.980
 And then when it meets reality, there's a lot of fear of robotics, for example, that

1:23:17.980 --> 1:23:20.380
 robots are somehow dangerous and all those kinds of things.

1:23:20.380 --> 1:23:23.980
 But when you actually have robots in your life, whether it's in the factory or in the

1:23:23.980 --> 1:23:28.300
 home, making your life better, that's going to be that's way different.

1:23:28.300 --> 1:23:30.460
 Your perceptions of it are going to be way different.

1:23:30.460 --> 1:23:34.780
 And so my just tension was like, here's an innovator.

1:23:34.780 --> 1:23:41.500
 Supercruise from Cadillac was super interesting, too.

1:23:41.500 --> 1:23:43.020
 That's a really interesting system.

1:23:43.020 --> 1:23:45.580
 We should be excited by those innovations.

1:23:45.580 --> 1:23:49.020
 OK, so can I tell you something that's really annoyed me recently?

1:23:49.020 --> 1:23:56.380
 It's really annoyed me that the press and friends of mine on Facebook are going, these

1:23:56.380 --> 1:23:59.740
 billionaires and their space games, why are they doing that?

1:23:59.740 --> 1:24:02.300
 And that really, really pisses me off.

1:24:02.300 --> 1:24:05.100
 I must say, I applaud that.

1:24:05.100 --> 1:24:06.780
 I applaud it.

1:24:06.780 --> 1:24:13.180
 It's the taking and not necessarily the people who are doing the things, but, you know, that

1:24:13.180 --> 1:24:19.740
 I keep having to push back against unrealistic expectations when these things can become

1:24:19.740 --> 1:24:20.300
 real.

1:24:20.300 --> 1:24:26.220
 Yeah, I this was interesting on because there's been a particular focus for me is autonomous

1:24:26.220 --> 1:24:30.140
 driving, Elon's prediction of when certain milestones will be hit.

1:24:30.140 --> 1:24:37.660
 There's several things to be said there that I always I thought about, because whenever

1:24:37.660 --> 1:24:44.860
 you said them, it was obvious that's not going to me as a person that kind of not inside

1:24:44.860 --> 1:24:46.940
 the system is obvious.

1:24:46.940 --> 1:24:48.700
 It's unlikely to hit those.

1:24:48.700 --> 1:24:50.700
 There's two comments I want to make.

1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:54.220
 One, he legitimately believes it.

1:24:54.220 --> 1:25:04.140
 And two, much more importantly, I think that having ambitious deadlines drives people to

1:25:04.140 --> 1:25:09.420
 do the best work of their life, even when the odds of those deadlines are very low.

1:25:09.420 --> 1:25:12.780
 To a point, and I'm not talking about anyone here, I'm just saying.

1:25:12.780 --> 1:25:14.220
 So there's a line there, right?

1:25:14.220 --> 1:25:20.140
 You have to have a line because you overextend and it's demoralizing.

1:25:20.140 --> 1:25:27.820
 It's demoralizing, but I will say that there's an additional thing here that those words

1:25:28.860 --> 1:25:32.460
 also drive the stock market.

1:25:34.140 --> 1:25:42.060
 And we have because of the way that rich people in the past have manipulated the rubes through

1:25:42.060 --> 1:25:49.260
 investment, we have developed laws about what you're allowed to say.

1:25:49.260 --> 1:25:58.380
 And you know, there's an area here which is I tend to be maybe I'm naive, but I tend to

1:25:58.380 --> 1:26:06.620
 believe that like engineers, innovators, people like that, they're not they're my they don't

1:26:06.620 --> 1:26:09.500
 think like that, like manipulating the price of the stock price.

1:26:09.500 --> 1:26:13.980
 But it's possible that I'm I'm certain it's possible that I'm wrong.

1:26:13.980 --> 1:26:21.820
 It's a very cynical view of the world because I think most people that run companies, especially

1:26:21.820 --> 1:26:27.260
 original founders, they yeah, I'm not saying that's the intent.

1:26:27.260 --> 1:26:33.340
 I'm saying it's eventually it's kind of you you you you fall into that kind of behavior

1:26:33.340 --> 1:26:33.340
 pattern.

1:26:33.340 --> 1:26:33.900
 I don't know.

1:26:33.900 --> 1:26:37.980
 I tend to I wasn't saying I wasn't saying it's falling into that intent.

1:26:37.980 --> 1:26:43.740
 It's just you also have to protect investors in this environment.

1:26:43.740 --> 1:26:44.620
 In this market.

1:26:44.620 --> 1:26:44.860
 Yeah.

1:26:45.580 --> 1:26:50.060
 OK, so you have first of all, you have an amazing blog that people should check out.

1:26:50.060 --> 1:26:54.060
 But you also have this in that blog, a set of predictions.

1:26:54.780 --> 1:26:55.740
 Such a cool idea.

1:26:55.740 --> 1:26:58.220
 I don't know how long ago you started, like three, four years ago.

1:26:58.220 --> 1:27:01.820
 It was January 1st, 2018.

1:27:01.820 --> 1:27:02.220
 18.

1:27:02.940 --> 1:27:07.740
 And I made these predictions and I said that every January 1st, I was going to check back

1:27:07.740 --> 1:27:09.020
 on how my predictions.

1:27:09.020 --> 1:27:10.220
 That's such a great thought experiment.

1:27:10.220 --> 1:27:11.260
 For 32 years.

1:27:11.900 --> 1:27:13.340
 Oh, you said 32 years.

1:27:13.340 --> 1:27:16.380
 I said 32 years because it's still that'll be January 1st, 2050.

1:27:16.940 --> 1:27:19.980
 I'll be I will just turn ninety.

1:27:21.660 --> 1:27:31.180
 Five, you know, and so people know that your predictions, at least for now, are in the

1:27:31.180 --> 1:27:33.180
 space of artificial intelligence.

1:27:33.180 --> 1:27:34.860
 Yeah, I didn't say I was going to make new predictions.

1:27:34.860 --> 1:27:38.380
 I was just going to measure this set of predictions that I made because I was sort of I was sort

1:27:38.380 --> 1:27:40.620
 of annoyed that everyone could make predictions.

1:27:40.620 --> 1:27:42.460
 They didn't come true and everyone forgot.

1:27:42.460 --> 1:27:44.860
 So I should hold myself to a high standard.

1:27:44.860 --> 1:27:48.700
 Yeah, but also just putting years and like date ranges on things.

1:27:48.700 --> 1:27:50.140
 It's a good thought exercise.

1:27:50.140 --> 1:27:52.940
 Yeah, like and like reasoning your thoughts out.

1:27:52.940 --> 1:27:58.300
 And so the topics are artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and space.

1:27:58.300 --> 1:27:58.800
 Yeah.

1:28:00.940 --> 1:28:04.700
 I was wondering if we could just go through some that stand out maybe from memory.

1:28:04.700 --> 1:28:06.140
 I can just mention to you some.

1:28:06.140 --> 1:28:10.780
 Let's talk about self driving cars, like some predictions that you're particularly proud

1:28:10.780 --> 1:28:20.220
 of or are particularly interesting from flying cars to the other element here is like how

1:28:20.220 --> 1:28:24.700
 widespread the location where the deployment of the autonomous vehicles is.

1:28:25.900 --> 1:28:27.580
 And there's also just a few fun ones.

1:28:27.580 --> 1:28:30.300
 Is there something that jumps to mind that you remember from the predictions?

1:28:31.980 --> 1:28:37.500
 Well, I think I did put in there that there would be a dedicated self driving lane on

1:28:37.500 --> 1:28:41.740
 101 by some year, and I think I was over optimistic on that one.

1:28:42.380 --> 1:28:42.860
 Yeah, actually.

1:28:42.860 --> 1:28:44.140
 Yeah, I actually do remember that.

1:28:44.140 --> 1:28:48.620
 But you I think you were mentioning like difficulties at different cities.

1:28:48.620 --> 1:28:49.120
 Yeah.

1:28:50.460 --> 1:28:52.460
 Cambridge, Massachusetts, I think was an example.

1:28:52.460 --> 1:28:56.860
 Yeah, like in Cambridge Port, you know, I lived in Cambridge Port for a number of years

1:28:56.860 --> 1:29:02.780
 and you know, the roads are narrow and getting getting anywhere as a human driver is incredibly

1:29:02.780 --> 1:29:07.660
 frustrating when you start to put and people drive the wrong way on one way streets there.

1:29:07.660 --> 1:29:14.860
 It's just your prediction was driverless taxi services operating on all streets in

1:29:14.860 --> 1:29:20.300
 Cambridge Port, Massachusetts in 2035.

1:29:21.100 --> 1:29:21.740
 Yeah.

1:29:21.740 --> 1:29:25.020
 And that may have been too optimistic.

1:29:25.020 --> 1:29:26.060
 You think so?

1:29:26.060 --> 1:29:31.020
 You know, I've gotten a little more pessimistic since I made these internally on some of these

1:29:31.020 --> 1:29:31.500
 things.

1:29:31.500 --> 1:29:42.780
 So what can you put a year to a major milestone of deployment of a taxi service in in a few

1:29:42.780 --> 1:29:47.500
 major cities like something where you feel like autonomous vehicles are here.

1:29:47.500 --> 1:29:55.900
 So let's let's take the grid streets of San Francisco north of market.

1:29:55.900 --> 1:29:56.540
 Okay.

1:29:56.540 --> 1:29:57.040
 Okay.

1:29:57.040 --> 1:30:07.040
 Relatively benign environment, the streets are wide, the major problem is delivery trucks

1:30:07.040 --> 1:30:10.880
 stopping everywhere, which made things more complicated.

1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:21.280
 Taxi system there with somewhat designated pickup and drop offs, unlike with Uber and

1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:28.160
 Lyft, where you can sort of get to any place and the drivers will figure out how to get

1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:28.720
 in there.

1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:32.080
 We're still a few years away.

1:30:32.080 --> 1:30:35.200
 I, you know, I live in that area.

1:30:35.200 --> 1:30:42.240
 So I see, you know, the self driving car companies cars, multiple multiple ones every day.

1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:52.480
 Now if they're cruise, Zooks less often, Waymo all the time, different and different ones

1:30:52.480 --> 1:30:53.440
 come and go.

1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:54.960
 And there's always a driver.

1:30:55.520 --> 1:31:02.240
 There's always a driver at the moment, although I have noticed that sometimes the driver does

1:31:02.240 --> 1:31:08.000
 not have the authority to take over without talking to the home office, because they will

1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:14.640
 sit there waiting for a long time, and clearly something's going on where the home office

1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:15.680
 is making a decision.

1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:21.600
 So they're, you know, and, and so you can see whether they've got their hands on the

1:31:21.600 --> 1:31:22.400
 wheel or not.

1:31:22.400 --> 1:31:27.680
 And, and it's the incident resolution time that tells you, gives you some clues.

1:31:28.240 --> 1:31:30.720
 So what year do you think, what's your intuition?

1:31:30.720 --> 1:31:34.880
 What date range are you currently thinking San Francisco would be?

1:31:34.880 --> 1:31:42.960
 Are you currently thinking San Francisco would be autonomous taxi service from any point

1:31:42.960 --> 1:31:45.840
 A to any point B without a driver?

1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:53.040
 Are you still, are you thinking 10 years from now, 20 years from now, 30 years from now?

1:31:53.040 --> 1:31:54.400
 Certainly not 10 years from now.

1:31:55.440 --> 1:31:56.320
 It's going to be longer.

1:31:56.880 --> 1:31:59.520
 If you're allowed to go south of market way longer.

1:31:59.520 --> 1:32:03.440
 And unless it's reengineering of roads.

1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:05.120
 By the way, what's the biggest challenge?

1:32:05.120 --> 1:32:06.080
 You mentioned a few.

1:32:06.080 --> 1:32:09.360
 Is it, is it the delivery trucks?

1:32:09.360 --> 1:32:15.040
 Is it the edge cases, the computer perception, well, here's a case that I saw outside my

1:32:15.040 --> 1:32:20.560
 house a few weeks ago, about 8pm on a Friday night, it was getting dark, it was before

1:32:20.560 --> 1:32:21.120
 the solstice.

1:32:23.520 --> 1:32:32.080
 It was a cruise vehicle come down the hill, turned right and stopped dead, covering the

1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:33.600
 crosswalk.

1:32:33.600 --> 1:32:35.120
 Why did it stop dead?

1:32:35.120 --> 1:32:38.480
 Because there was a human just two feet from it.

1:32:38.480 --> 1:32:41.680
 Now, I just glanced, I knew what was happening.

1:32:41.680 --> 1:32:47.840
 The human was a woman was at the door of her car trying to unlock it with one of those

1:32:47.840 --> 1:32:49.360
 things that, you know, when you don't have a key.

1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:54.720
 That car thought, oh, she could jump out in front of me any second.

1:32:55.520 --> 1:32:57.760
 As a human, I could tell, no, she's not going to jump out.

1:32:57.760 --> 1:32:59.360
 She's busy trying to unlock her.

1:32:59.360 --> 1:33:00.240
 She's lost her keys.

1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:01.200
 She's trying to get in the car.

1:33:01.200 --> 1:33:05.440
 And it stayed there for, until I got bored.

1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:11.600
 And so the human driver in there did not take over.

1:33:11.600 --> 1:33:14.080
 But here's the kicker to me.

1:33:14.080 --> 1:33:22.720
 A guy comes down the hill with a stroller, I assume there's a baby in there, and now

1:33:22.720 --> 1:33:25.760
 the crosswalk's blocked by this cruise vehicle.

1:33:25.760 --> 1:33:27.440
 What's he going to do?

1:33:27.440 --> 1:33:30.800
 Cleverly, I think, he decided not to go in front of the car.

1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:34.960
 But he had to go behind it.

1:33:34.960 --> 1:33:39.360
 He had to get off the crosswalk, out into the intersection, to push his baby around

1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:41.200
 this car, which was stopped there.

1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:44.080
 And no human driver would have stopped there for that length of time.

1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:46.160
 They would have got out and out of the way.

1:33:46.880 --> 1:33:56.000
 And that's another one of my pet peeves, that safety is being compromised for individuals

1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:59.760
 who didn't sign up for having this happen in their neighborhood.

1:33:59.760 --> 1:34:03.200
 Now you can say that's an edge case, but...

1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:13.040
 Yeah, well, I'm in general not a fan of anecdotal evidence for stuff like this is one of my

1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:17.920
 biggest problems with the discussion of autonomous vehicles in general, people that criticize

1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:24.640
 them or support them are using edge cases, are using anecdotal evidence, but I got you.

1:34:24.640 --> 1:34:26.800
 Your question is, when is it going to happen in San Francisco?

1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:29.040
 I say not soon, but it's going to be one of them.

1:34:29.040 --> 1:34:38.640
 But where it is going to happen is in limited domains, campuses of various sorts, gated

1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:45.120
 communities where the other drivers are not arbitrary people.

1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:52.800
 They're people who know about these things, they've been warned about them, and at velocities

1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:55.520
 where it's always safe to stop dead.

1:34:57.120 --> 1:34:58.720
 You can't do that on the freeway.

1:34:58.720 --> 1:35:06.160
 That I think we're going to start to see, and they may not be shaped like current cars,

1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:12.560
 they may be things like May Mobility has those things and various companies have these.

1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:14.400
 Yeah, I wonder if that's a compelling experience.

1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:20.320
 To me, it's not just about automation, it's about creating a product that makes your...

1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:23.680
 It's not just cheaper, but it's fun to ride.

1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:29.600
 One of the least fun things is for a car that stops and waits.

1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:34.400
 There's something deeply frustrating for us humans for the rest of the world to take advantage

1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:35.520
 of us as we wait.

1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:47.520
 But think about not you as the customer, but someone who's in their 80s in a retirement

1:35:47.520 --> 1:35:53.200
 village whose kids have said, you're not driving anymore, and this gives you the freedom to

1:35:53.200 --> 1:35:54.240
 go to the market.

1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:59.840
 That's a hugely beneficial thing, but it's a very few orders of magnitude less impact

1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:00.800
 on the world.

1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:05.760
 It's just a few people in a small community using cars as opposed to the entirety of the

1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:06.080
 world.

1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:13.600
 I like that the first time that a car equipped with some version of a solution to the trolley

1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:14.800
 problem is...

1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:16.400
 What's NIML stand for?

1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:17.040
 Not in my life.

1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:17.680
 Not in my life.

1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:20.080
 I define my lifetime as up to 2050.

1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:28.640
 You know, I ask you, when have you had to decide which person shall I kill?

1:36:29.360 --> 1:36:31.760
 No, you put the brakes on and you break as hard as you can.

1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:35.360
 You're not making that decision.

1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:41.280
 I do think autonomous vehicles or semi autonomous vehicles do need to solve the whole pedestrian

1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:45.520
 problem that has elements of the trolley problem within it, but it's not...

1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:51.760
 Yeah, well, and I talk about it in one of the articles or blog posts that I wrote, and

1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:55.120
 people have told me, one of my coworkers has told me he does this.

1:36:56.480 --> 1:37:01.600
 He tortures autonomously driven vehicles and pedestrians will torture them.

1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:07.360
 Now, once they realize that putting one foot off the curb makes the car think that they

1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:10.800
 might walk into the road, teenagers will be doing that all the time.

1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:15.440
 I, by the way, one of my, and this is a whole nother discussion, because my main interest

1:37:15.440 --> 1:37:18.400
 with robotics is HRI, human robot interaction.

1:37:19.200 --> 1:37:24.080
 I believe that robots that interact with humans will have to push back.

1:37:25.520 --> 1:37:30.480
 Like they can't just be bullied because that creates a very uncompelling experience for

1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:31.280
 the humans.

1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:35.600
 Yeah, well, you know, Waymo, before it was called Waymo, discovered that, you know, they

1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:38.080
 had to do that at four way intersections.

1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:42.800
 They had to nudge forward to give the cue that they were going to go, because otherwise

1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:45.680
 the other drivers would just beat them all the time.

1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:52.320
 So you cofounded iRobot, as we mentioned, one of the most successful robotics companies

1:37:52.320 --> 1:37:52.800
 ever.

1:37:53.520 --> 1:38:00.480
 What are you most proud of with that company and the approach you took to robotics?

1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:07.840
 Well, there's something I'm quite proud of there, which may be a surprise, but, you know,

1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:17.280
 I was still on the board when this happened, it was March 2011, and we sent robots to Japan

1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:27.520
 and they were used to help shut down the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which was, everything

1:38:27.520 --> 1:38:32.240
 was, I've been there since, I was there in 2014, and the robots, some of the robots were

1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:33.120
 still there.

1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:35.600
 I was proud that we were able to do that.

1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:37.280
 Why were we able to do that?

1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:42.000
 And, you know, people have said, well, you know, Japan is so good at robotics.

1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:51.600
 It was because we had had about 6,500 robots deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, teleopt,

1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:55.920
 but with intelligence, dealing with roadside bombs.

1:38:56.480 --> 1:39:03.360
 So we had, it was at that time, nine years of in field experience with the robots in

1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:09.200
 harsh conditions, whereas the Japanese robots, which were, you know, getting, this goes back

1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:14.560
 to what annoys me so much, getting all the hype, look at that, look at that Honda robot,

1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:20.800
 it can walk, wow, the future's here, couldn't do a thing because they weren't deployed,

1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:26.960
 but we had deployed in really harsh conditions for a long time, and so we're able to do

1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:30.400
 something very positive in a very bad situation.

1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:36.640
 What about just the simple, and for people who don't know, one of the things that iRobot

1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:40.400
 has created is the Roomba vacuum cleaner.

1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:47.760
 What about the simple robot that, that is the Roomba, quote unquote, simple, that's

1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:51.760
 deployed in tens of millions of, in tens of millions of homes?

1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:54.240
 What do you think about that?

1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:59.440
 Well, I make the joke that I started out life as a pure mathematician and turned into a

1:39:59.440 --> 1:40:05.440
 vacuum cleaner salesman, so if you're going to be an entrepreneur, be ready for, be ready

1:40:05.440 --> 1:40:15.040
 to do anything, but I was, you know, there was a, there was a wacky lawsuit that I got

1:40:15.040 --> 1:40:20.800
 opposed for not too many years ago, and I was the only one who had emailed from the

1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:27.520
 1990s, and no one in the company had it, so I went and went through my email, and it

1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:34.880
 reminded me of, you know, the joy of what we were doing, and what was I doing?

1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:41.040
 What was I doing at the time we were building, building the Roomba?

1:40:41.920 --> 1:40:46.160
 One of the things was we had this, you know, incredibly tight budget because we wanted

1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:50.960
 to put it on the shelves at $200.

1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:59.120
 There was another home cleaning robot at the time, it was the Electrolux Trilobite, which

1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:05.360
 sold for 2,000 euros, and to us that was not going to be a consumer product, so we had

1:41:05.360 --> 1:41:10.480
 reason to believe that $200 was a, was a thing that people would buy at.

1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:19.120
 That was our aim, but that meant we had, you know, that's on the shelf making profit.

1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:26.560
 That means the cost of goods has to be minimal, so I find all these emails of me going, you

1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:32.000
 know, I'd be in Taipei for a MIT meeting, and I'd stay a few extra days and go down

1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:38.800
 to Hsinchu and talk to these little tiny companies, lots of little tiny companies outside of TSMC,

1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:45.440
 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, which let all these little companies be fabulous.

1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:51.760
 They didn't have to have their own fab so they could innovate, and they were building,

1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:57.840
 their innovations were to build, strip down 6802s, 6802 was what was in an Apple I, get

1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:03.600
 rid of half the silicon and still have it be viable, and I'd previously got some of

1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:11.520
 those for some earlier failed products of iRobot, and that was in Hong Kong going to

1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:16.800
 all these companies that built, you know, they weren't gaming in the current sense,

1:42:16.800 --> 1:42:23.360
 there were these handheld games that you would play, or birthday cards, because we had about

1:42:23.360 --> 1:42:30.640
 a 50 cent budget for computation, so I'm trekking from place to place looking at their chips,

1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:38.320
 looking at what they'd removed, ah, their interrupt handling is too weak for a general

1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:43.440
 purpose, so I was going deep technical detail, and then I found this one from a company called

1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:50.000
 Winbond, which had, and I'd forgotten it had this much RAM, it had 512 bytes of RAM,

1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:54.640
 and it was in our budget, and it had all the capabilities we needed.

1:42:54.640 --> 1:42:57.200
 Yeah, and you were excited.

1:42:57.200 --> 1:43:02.400
 Yeah, and I was reading all these emails, Colin, I found this, so.

1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:05.840
 Did you think, did you ever think that you guys could be so successful?

1:43:07.200 --> 1:43:10.960
 Like, eventually this company would be so successful, could you possibly have imagined?

1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:13.760
 No, we never did think that.

1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:19.200
 We'd had 14 failed business models up to 2002, and then we had two winners the same year.

1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:27.600
 No, and then, you know, we, I remember the board, because by this time we had some venture

1:43:27.600 --> 1:43:36.240
 capital in, the board went along with us building some robots for, you know, aiming at the Christmas

1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:44.640
 2002 market, and we went three times over what they authorized and built 70,000 of them,

1:43:44.640 --> 1:43:51.200
 and sold them all in that first, because we released on September 18th, and they were

1:43:51.200 --> 1:43:52.560
 all sold by Christmas.

1:43:52.560 --> 1:43:57.040
 So it was, so we were gutsy, but.

1:43:57.040 --> 1:44:00.640
 But yeah, you didn't think this will take over the world.

1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:09.040
 Well, this is, so a lot of amazing robotics companies have gone under over the past few

1:44:09.040 --> 1:44:10.560
 decades.

1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:17.680
 Why do you think it's so damn hard to run a successful robotics company?

1:44:17.680 --> 1:44:18.960
 There's a few things.

1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:28.960
 One is expectations of capabilities by the founders that are off base.

1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:31.600
 The founders, not the consumer, the founders.

1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:34.000
 Yeah, expectations of what can be delivered.

1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:34.500
 Sure.

1:44:34.500 --> 1:44:42.180
 Mispricing, and what a customer thinks is a valid price, is not rational, necessarily.

1:44:42.180 --> 1:44:42.680
 Yeah.

1:44:43.620 --> 1:44:56.100
 And expectations of customers, and just the sheer hardness of getting people to adopt a

1:44:56.100 --> 1:44:57.060
 new technology.

1:44:57.060 --> 1:44:59.700
 And I've suffered from all three of these, you know.

1:44:59.700 --> 1:45:04.820
 I've had more failures than successes, in terms of companies.

1:45:04.820 --> 1:45:06.180
 I've suffered from all three.

1:45:07.860 --> 1:45:18.580
 So, do you think one day there will be a robotics company, and by robotics company, I mean, where

1:45:18.580 --> 1:45:24.740
 your primary source of income is from robots, that will be a trillion plus dollar company?

1:45:24.740 --> 1:45:31.460
 And if so, what would that company do?

1:45:31.460 --> 1:45:35.300
 I can't, you know, because I'm still starting robot companies.

1:45:35.300 --> 1:45:35.800
 Yeah.

1:45:38.180 --> 1:45:41.380
 I'm not making any such predictions in my own mind.

1:45:41.380 --> 1:45:43.140
 I'm not thinking about a trillion dollar company.

1:45:43.140 --> 1:45:47.220
 And by the way, I don't think, you know, in the 90s, anyone was thinking that Apple would

1:45:47.220 --> 1:45:48.580
 ever be a trillion dollar company.

1:45:48.580 --> 1:45:52.580
 So, these are, these are, you know, these are, you know, these are, you know, these

1:45:52.580 --> 1:45:57.220
 would be a trillion dollar company, so these are, these are very hard to predict.

1:45:57.220 --> 1:46:03.460
 But, sorry to interrupt, but don't you, because I kind of have a vision in a small way, and

1:46:03.460 --> 1:46:08.580
 it's a big vision in a small way, that I see that there would be robots in the home,

1:46:10.180 --> 1:46:12.420
 at scale, like Roomba, but more.

1:46:13.540 --> 1:46:14.980
 And that's trillion dollar.

1:46:15.620 --> 1:46:16.120
 Right.

1:46:16.120 --> 1:46:22.100
 And I think there's a real market pull for them because of the demographic inversion,

1:46:22.100 --> 1:46:25.220
 you know, who's going to do all the stuff for the older people?

1:46:26.180 --> 1:46:29.620
 There's too many, you know, I'm leading here.

1:46:31.700 --> 1:46:32.980
 There's going to be too many of us.

1:46:36.420 --> 1:46:41.540
 But we don't have capable enough robots to make that economic argument at this point.

1:46:42.340 --> 1:46:44.180
 Do I expect that that will happen?

1:46:44.180 --> 1:46:45.380
 Yes, I expect it will happen.

1:46:45.380 --> 1:46:50.580
 But I got to tell you, we introduced the Roomba in 2002, and I stayed another

1:46:50.580 --> 1:46:51.780
 nine years.

1:46:51.780 --> 1:46:57.700
 We were always trying to find what the next home robot would be, and still today, the

1:46:57.700 --> 1:47:02.660
 primary product of 20 years late, almost 20 years later, 19 years later, the primary product

1:47:02.660 --> 1:47:03.620
 is still the Roomba.

1:47:03.620 --> 1:47:07.060
 So iRobot hasn't found the next one.

1:47:07.060 --> 1:47:12.580
 Do you think it's possible for one person in the garage to build it versus, like, Google

1:47:12.580 --> 1:47:16.340
 launching Google self driving car that turns into Waymo?

1:47:16.340 --> 1:47:20.980
 Do you think this is almost like what it takes to build a successful robotics company?

1:47:20.980 --> 1:47:24.420
 Do you think it's possible to go from the ground up, or is it just too much capital

1:47:24.420 --> 1:47:24.980
 investment?

1:47:25.540 --> 1:47:31.700
 Yeah, so it's very hard to get there without a lot of capital.

1:47:31.700 --> 1:47:38.100
 And we're starting to see, you know, fair chunks of capital for some robotics companies.

1:47:38.100 --> 1:47:45.540
 You know, Series B's, I saw one yesterday for $80 million, I think it was, for Covariant.

1:47:45.540 --> 1:47:54.740
 But it can take real money to get into these things, and you may fail along the way.

1:47:54.740 --> 1:48:00.900
 I've certainly failed at Rethink Robotics, and we lost $150 million in capital there.

1:48:00.900 --> 1:48:05.700
 So, okay, so Rethink Robotics is another amazing robotics company you cofounded.

1:48:06.580 --> 1:48:08.100
 So what was the vision there?

1:48:09.060 --> 1:48:11.140
 What was the dream?

1:48:11.140 --> 1:48:15.620
 And what are you most proud of with Rethink Robotics?

1:48:15.620 --> 1:48:23.140
 I'm most proud of the fact that we got robots out of the cage in factories that were safe,

1:48:23.140 --> 1:48:26.180
 absolutely safe, for people and robots to be next to each other.

1:48:26.180 --> 1:48:27.700
 So these are robotic arms.

1:48:27.700 --> 1:48:28.500
 Robotic arms.

1:48:28.500 --> 1:48:31.140
 Able to pick up stuff and interact with humans.

1:48:31.140 --> 1:48:35.140
 Yeah, and that humans could retask them without writing code.

1:48:35.140 --> 1:48:40.020
 And now that's sort of become an expectation for a lot of other little companies and big

1:48:40.020 --> 1:48:42.260
 companies, our advertising they're doing.

1:48:42.260 --> 1:48:45.540
 That's both an interface problem and also a safety problem.

1:48:45.540 --> 1:48:46.580
 Yeah, yeah.

1:48:47.620 --> 1:48:49.460
 So I'm most proud of that.

1:48:51.300 --> 1:48:58.580
 I completely, I let myself be talked out of what I wanted to do.

1:48:59.380 --> 1:49:02.260
 And, you know, you always got, you know, I can't replay the tape.

1:49:02.260 --> 1:49:05.460
 I can't replay it.

1:49:05.460 --> 1:49:12.180
 Maybe, you know, if I'd been stronger on, and I remember the day, I remember the exact

1:49:12.180 --> 1:49:12.580
 meeting.

1:49:13.860 --> 1:49:15.380
 Can you take me through that meeting?

1:49:16.260 --> 1:49:16.580
 Yeah.

1:49:18.340 --> 1:49:23.940
 So I'd said that I'd set as a target for the company that we were going to build $3,000

1:49:23.940 --> 1:49:29.060
 robots with force feedback that was safe for people to be around.

1:49:29.700 --> 1:49:30.420
 Wow.

1:49:30.420 --> 1:49:31.380
 That was my goal.

1:49:31.380 --> 1:49:38.980
 And we built, so we started in 2008, and we had prototypes built of plastic, plastic

1:49:38.980 --> 1:49:48.180
 gearboxes, and at a $3,000, you know, lifetime, or $3,000, I was saying, we're going to go

1:49:48.180 --> 1:49:52.500
 after not the people who already have robot arms in factories, the people who would never

1:49:52.500 --> 1:49:53.940
 have a robot arm.

1:49:53.940 --> 1:49:55.940
 We're going to go after a different market.

1:49:55.940 --> 1:49:57.940
 So we don't have to meet their expectations.

1:49:57.940 --> 1:49:59.860
 And so we're going to build it out of plastic.

1:49:59.860 --> 1:50:02.740
 It doesn't have to have a $35,000 lifetime.

1:50:02.740 --> 1:50:05.460
 It's going to be so cheap that it's OpEx, not CapEx.

1:50:09.140 --> 1:50:16.980
 And so we had a prototype that worked reasonably well, but the control engineers were complaining

1:50:16.980 --> 1:50:24.820
 about these plastic gearboxes with a beautiful little planetary gearbox that we could use

1:50:24.820 --> 1:50:29.780
 something called series elastic actuators.

1:50:29.780 --> 1:50:30.980
 We embedded them in there.

1:50:30.980 --> 1:50:32.180
 We could measure forces.

1:50:32.180 --> 1:50:34.500
 We knew when we hit something, et cetera.

1:50:35.060 --> 1:50:40.100
 The control engineers were saying, yeah, but there's this torque ripple because these plastic

1:50:40.100 --> 1:50:44.900
 gears, they're not great gears, and there's this ripple, and trying to do force control

1:50:44.900 --> 1:50:47.220
 around this ripple is so hard.

1:50:47.220 --> 1:50:55.140
 And I'm not going to name names, but I remember one of the mechanical engineers saying, we'll

1:50:55.140 --> 1:50:59.620
 just build a metal gearbox with spur gears, and it'll take six weeks.

1:50:59.620 --> 1:51:00.340
 We'll be done.

1:51:01.140 --> 1:51:02.020
 Problem solved.

1:51:03.700 --> 1:51:06.660
 Two years later, we got the spur gearbox working.

1:51:08.020 --> 1:51:15.540
 We cost reduced it every possible way we could, but now the price went up too.

1:51:15.540 --> 1:51:19.300
 And then the CEO at the time said, well, we have to have two arms, not one arm.

1:51:19.860 --> 1:51:27.460
 So our first robot product, Baxter, now cost $25,000, and the only people who were going

1:51:27.460 --> 1:51:31.460
 to look at that were people who had arms in factories because that was somewhat cheaper

1:51:31.460 --> 1:51:33.460
 for two arms than arms in factories.

1:51:34.180 --> 1:51:43.700
 But they were used to 0.1 millimeter reproducibility of motion and certain velocities, and I kept

1:51:43.700 --> 1:51:45.620
 thinking, but that's not what we're giving you.

1:51:45.620 --> 1:51:47.380
 You don't need position repeatability.

1:51:47.380 --> 1:51:49.700
 Use force control like a human does.

1:51:49.700 --> 1:51:53.060
 No, no, but we want that repeatability.

1:51:53.060 --> 1:51:54.500
 We want that repeatability.

1:51:54.500 --> 1:51:56.340
 All the other robots have that repeatability.

1:51:56.340 --> 1:51:58.500
 Why don't you have that repeatability?

1:51:58.500 --> 1:51:59.780
 So can you clarify?

1:51:59.780 --> 1:52:02.900
 Force control is you can grab the arm and you can move it.

1:52:02.900 --> 1:52:04.660
 You can move it around, but suppose you...

1:52:06.100 --> 1:52:06.900
 Can you see that?

1:52:06.900 --> 1:52:07.540
 Yes.

1:52:07.540 --> 1:52:08.820
 Suppose you want to...

1:52:09.940 --> 1:52:10.440
 Yes.

1:52:10.440 --> 1:52:15.160
 Suppose this thing is a precise thing that's got to fit here in this right angle.

1:52:16.520 --> 1:52:20.520
 Under position control, you have fixtured where this is.

1:52:20.520 --> 1:52:25.320
 You know where this is precisely, and you just move it, and it goes there.

1:52:25.320 --> 1:52:30.120
 In force control, you would do something like slide over here till we feel that and slide

1:52:30.120 --> 1:52:34.040
 it in there, and that's how a human gets precision.

1:52:34.040 --> 1:52:40.600
 They use force feedback and get the things to mate rather than just go straight to it.

1:52:42.440 --> 1:52:48.120
 Couldn't convince our customers who were in factories and were used to thinking about

1:52:48.120 --> 1:52:51.880
 things a certain way, and they wanted it, wanted it, wanted it.

1:52:51.880 --> 1:52:55.560
 So then we said, okay, we're going to build an arm that gives you that.

1:52:56.120 --> 1:52:59.880
 So now we ended up building a $35,000 robot with one arm with...

1:52:59.880 --> 1:53:01.800
 Oh, what are they called?

1:53:04.840 --> 1:53:08.520
 A certain sort of gearbox made by a company whose name I can't remember right now, but

1:53:08.520 --> 1:53:09.480
 it's the name of the gearbox.

1:53:11.880 --> 1:53:14.760
 But it's got torque ripple in it.

1:53:15.560 --> 1:53:19.720
 So now there was an extra two years of solving the problem of doing the force with the torque

1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:20.200
 ripple.

1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:28.440
 So we had to do the thing we had avoided for the plastic gearboxes, which is a little bit

1:53:28.440 --> 1:53:31.240
 for the plastic gearboxes we ended up having to do.

1:53:31.240 --> 1:53:35.240
 The robot was now overpriced and they...

1:53:35.240 --> 1:53:38.680
 And that was your intuition from the very beginning kind of that this is not...

1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:44.760
 You're opening a door to solve a lot of problems that you're eventually going to have to solve

1:53:44.760 --> 1:53:45.800
 this problem anyway.

1:53:45.800 --> 1:53:46.120
 Yeah.

1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:49.240
 And also I was aiming at a low price to go into a different market.

1:53:49.240 --> 1:53:49.720
 Low price.

1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:51.160
 That didn't have robots.

1:53:51.160 --> 1:53:52.600
 $3,000 would be amazing.

1:53:52.600 --> 1:53:52.760
 Yeah.

1:53:52.760 --> 1:53:54.120
 I think we could have done it for five.

1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:58.840
 But, you know, you talked about setting the goal a little too far for the engineers.

1:53:58.840 --> 1:53:59.640
 Yeah, exactly.

1:54:02.280 --> 1:54:07.400
 So why would you say that company not failed, but went under?

1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:15.400
 We had buyers and there's this thing called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the

1:54:15.400 --> 1:54:16.600
 U.S., CFIUS.

1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:21.640
 And that had previously been invoked twice.

1:54:21.640 --> 1:54:27.960
 Around where the government could stop foreign money coming into a U.S. company based on

1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:31.000
 defense requirements.

1:54:32.680 --> 1:54:34.600
 We went through due diligence multiple times.

1:54:34.600 --> 1:54:42.280
 We were going to get acquired, but every consortium had Chinese money in it, and all the bankers

1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:47.080
 would say at the last minute, you know, this isn't going to get past CFIUS, and the investors

1:54:47.080 --> 1:54:47.880
 would go away.

1:54:47.880 --> 1:54:54.280
 And then we had two buyers, once we were about to run out of money, two buyers, and one used

1:54:54.280 --> 1:55:01.960
 heavy handed legal stuff with the other one, said they were going to take it and pay more,

1:55:02.760 --> 1:55:08.040
 dropped out when we were out of cash, and then bought the assets at 1 30th of the price

1:55:08.040 --> 1:55:09.320
 they had offered a week before.

1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:12.280
 It was a tough week.

1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:21.640
 Do you, does it hurt to think about like an amazing company that didn't, you know, like

1:55:21.640 --> 1:55:23.640
 iRobot didn't find a way?

1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:25.400
 Yeah, it was tough.

1:55:25.400 --> 1:55:27.480
 I said I was never going to start another company.

1:55:27.480 --> 1:55:36.360
 I was pleased that everyone liked what we did so much that the team was hired by three

1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:40.040
 companies, and I was very happy that we were able to do that.

1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:42.920
 Three companies within a week.

1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:44.760
 Everyone had a job in one of these three companies.

1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:49.800
 Some stayed in their same desks because another company came in and rented the space.

1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:54.840
 So I felt good about people not being out on the street.

1:55:55.720 --> 1:55:57.880
 So Baxter has a screen with a face.

1:55:59.560 --> 1:56:05.880
 What, that's a revolutionary idea for a robot manipulation, like for a robotic arm.

1:56:07.320 --> 1:56:08.840
 How much opposition did you get?

1:56:08.840 --> 1:56:12.920
 Well, first the screen was also used during codeless programming.

1:56:12.920 --> 1:56:14.440
 We taught by demonstration.

1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:17.000
 It showed you what its understanding of the task was.

1:56:17.640 --> 1:56:18.680
 So it had two roles.

1:56:21.240 --> 1:56:26.520
 Some customers hated it, and so we made it so that when the robot was running it could

1:56:26.520 --> 1:56:30.200
 be showing graphs of what was happening and not show the eyes.

1:56:30.200 --> 1:56:36.600
 Other people, and some of them surprised me who they were, saying well this one doesn't

1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:37.960
 look as human as the old one.

1:56:37.960 --> 1:56:39.640
 We liked the human looking.

1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:40.120
 Yeah.

1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:41.880
 So there was a mixed bag.

1:56:43.240 --> 1:56:48.760
 But do you think that's, I don't know, I'm kind of disappointed whenever I talk to

1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:55.160
 roboticists, like the best robotics people in the world, they seem to not want to do

1:56:55.160 --> 1:56:56.760
 the eyes type of thing.

1:56:56.760 --> 1:57:02.040
 Like they seem to see it as a machine as opposed to a machine that can also have a human connection.

1:57:02.760 --> 1:57:03.960
 I'm not sure what to do with that.

1:57:03.960 --> 1:57:05.480
 It seems like a lost opportunity.

1:57:05.480 --> 1:57:10.440
 I think the trillion dollar company will have to do the human connection very well no matter

1:57:10.440 --> 1:57:11.160
 what it does.

1:57:11.160 --> 1:57:11.960
 Yeah, I agree.

1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:15.560
 Can I ask you a ridiculous question?

1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:15.880
 Sure.

1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:18.280
 I might give a ridiculous answer.

1:57:19.880 --> 1:57:25.640
 Do you think, well maybe by way of asking the question, let me first mention that you're

1:57:25.640 --> 1:57:29.080
 kind of critical of the idea of the Turing test as a test of intelligence.

1:57:32.280 --> 1:57:33.640
 Let me first ask this question.

1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:40.360
 Do you think we'll be able to build an AI system that humans fall in love with and it

1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:43.960
 falls in love with the human, like romantic love?

1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:51.560
 Well, we've had that with humans falling in love with cars even back in the 50s.

1:57:51.560 --> 1:57:52.680
 It's a different love, right?

1:57:52.680 --> 1:57:53.640
 Well, yeah.

1:57:53.640 --> 1:57:58.680
 I think there's a lifelong partnership where you can communicate and grow like...

1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:01.160
 I think we're a long way from that.

1:58:01.160 --> 1:58:03.000
 I think we're a long, long way.

1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:08.440
 I think Blade Runner had the time scale totally wrong.

1:58:10.440 --> 1:58:16.840
 Yeah, but so to me, honestly, the most difficult part is the thing that you said with the Marvex

1:58:16.840 --> 1:58:21.400
 Paradox is to create a human form that interacts and perceives the world.

1:58:21.400 --> 1:58:28.040
 But if we just look at a voice, like the movie Her or just like an Alexa type voice, I tend

1:58:28.040 --> 1:58:29.560
 to think we're not that far away.

1:58:29.560 --> 1:58:43.400
 Well, for some people, maybe not, but as humans, as we think about the future, we always try

1:58:43.400 --> 1:58:44.200
 to...

1:58:44.200 --> 1:58:46.920
 And this is the premise of most science fiction movies.

1:58:46.920 --> 1:58:49.800
 You've got the world just as it is today and you change one thing.

1:58:50.920 --> 1:58:51.960
 But that's not how...

1:58:51.960 --> 1:58:53.960
 And it's the same with a self driving car.

1:58:53.960 --> 1:58:55.000
 You change one thing.

1:58:55.000 --> 1:58:56.840
 No, everything changes.

1:58:56.840 --> 1:58:59.720
 Everything grows together.

1:58:59.720 --> 1:59:04.520
 So surprisingly, it might be surprising to you or might not, I think the best movie about

1:59:04.520 --> 1:59:07.640
 this stuff was Bicentennial Man.

1:59:09.160 --> 1:59:10.440
 And what was happening there?

1:59:11.080 --> 1:59:14.200
 It was schmaltzy and, you know, but what was happening there?

1:59:15.720 --> 1:59:21.160
 As the robot was trying to become more human, the humans were adopting the technology of

1:59:21.160 --> 1:59:23.080
 the robot and changing their bodies.

1:59:23.080 --> 1:59:27.160
 So there was a convergence happening in a sense.

1:59:27.160 --> 1:59:28.760
 So we will not be the same.

1:59:28.760 --> 1:59:32.440
 You know, we're already talking about genetically modifying our babies.

1:59:32.440 --> 1:59:36.680
 You know, there's more and more stuff happening around that.

1:59:36.680 --> 1:59:41.800
 We will want to modify ourselves even more for all sorts of things.

1:59:43.240 --> 1:59:48.440
 We put all sorts of technology in our bodies to improve it.

1:59:48.440 --> 1:59:53.560
 You know, I've got things in my ears so that I can sort of hear you.

1:59:53.560 --> 1:59:54.060
 Yeah.

1:59:56.120 --> 1:59:57.480
 So we're always modifying our bodies.

1:59:57.480 --> 2:00:02.440
 So, you know, I think it's hard to imagine exactly what it will be like in the future.

2:00:03.640 --> 2:00:09.720
 But on the Turing test side, do you think, so forget about love for a second, let's talk

2:00:09.720 --> 2:00:12.280
 about just like the Alexa Prize.

2:00:12.280 --> 2:00:16.200
 Actually, I was invited to be a part of the Alexa Prize.

2:00:16.200 --> 2:00:22.040
 Actually, I was invited to be a, what is the interviewer for the Alexa Prize or whatever

2:00:23.080 --> 2:00:24.120
 that's in two days.

2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:32.440
 Their idea is success looks like a person wanting to talk to an AI system for a prolonged

2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:33.800
 period of time, like 20 minutes.

2:00:35.080 --> 2:00:41.400
 How far away are we and why is it difficult to build an AI system with which you'd want

2:00:41.400 --> 2:00:45.720
 to have a beer and talk for an hour or two hours?

2:00:45.720 --> 2:00:53.160
 Like not for to check the weather or to check music, but just like to talk as friends.

2:00:53.160 --> 2:01:00.840
 Yeah, well, you know, we saw Weizenbaum back in the 60s with his programmer, Elisa, being

2:01:00.840 --> 2:01:03.080
 shocked at how much people would talk to Elisa.

2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:08.360
 And I remember, you know, in the 70s typing, you know, stuff to Elisa to see what it would

2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:09.000
 come back with.

2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:17.960
 You know, I think right now, and this is a thing that Amazon's been trying to improve

2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:22.760
 with Alexa, there is no continuity of topic.

2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:26.680
 There's not, you can't refer to what we talked about yesterday.

2:01:27.880 --> 2:01:32.360
 It's not the same as talking to a person where there seems to be an ongoing existence, which

2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:32.920
 changes.

2:01:33.800 --> 2:01:37.080
 We share moments together and they last in our memory together.

2:01:37.080 --> 2:01:39.000
 Yeah, there's none of that.

2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:46.840
 And there's no sort of intention of these systems that they have any goal in life, even

2:01:46.840 --> 2:01:51.880
 if it's to be happy, you know, they don't even have a semblance of that.

2:01:51.880 --> 2:01:53.720
 Now, I'm not saying this can't be done.

2:01:53.720 --> 2:01:57.960
 I'm just saying, I think this is why we don't feel that way about them.

2:01:57.960 --> 2:02:01.560
 That's a sort of a minimal requirement.

2:02:01.560 --> 2:02:06.840
 If you want the sort of interaction you're talking about, it's a minimal requirement.

2:02:06.840 --> 2:02:10.360
 Whether it's going to be sufficient, I don't know.

2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:11.560
 We haven't seen it yet.

2:02:11.560 --> 2:02:14.120
 We don't know what it feels like.

2:02:14.120 --> 2:02:23.160
 I tend to think it's not as difficult as solving intelligence, for example, and I think it's

2:02:23.160 --> 2:02:24.680
 achievable in the near term.

2:02:26.680 --> 2:02:32.200
 But on the Turing test, why don't you think the Turing test is a good test of intelligence?

2:02:32.200 --> 2:02:39.080
 Oh, because, you know, again, the Turing, if you read the paper, Turing wasn't saying

2:02:39.080 --> 2:02:40.440
 this is a good test.

2:02:40.440 --> 2:02:46.520
 He was using it as a rhetorical device to argue that if you can't tell the difference

2:02:46.520 --> 2:02:52.920
 between a computer and a person, you must say that the computer's thinking because you

2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:56.040
 can't tell the difference, you know, when it's thinking.

2:02:56.600 --> 2:02:58.280
 You can't say something different.

2:02:58.280 --> 2:03:08.920
 What it has become as this sort of weird game of fooling people, so back at the AI Lab in

2:03:08.920 --> 2:03:14.280
 the late 80s, we had this thing that still goes on called the AI Olympics, and one of

2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:21.320
 the events we had one year was the original imitation game, as Turing talked about, because

2:03:21.320 --> 2:03:25.160
 he starts by saying, can you tell whether it's a man or a woman?

2:03:25.160 --> 2:03:28.680
 So we did that at the Lab.

2:03:28.680 --> 2:03:33.720
 You'd go and type, and the thing would come back, and you had to tell whether it was a

2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:50.920
 man or a woman, and one man came up with a question that he could ask, which was always

2:03:50.920 --> 2:03:55.000
 a dead giveaway of whether the other person was really a man or a woman.

2:03:56.520 --> 2:04:01.400
 He would ask them, did you have green plastic toy soldiers as a kid?

2:04:01.400 --> 2:04:01.880
 Yeah.

2:04:01.880 --> 2:04:03.240
 What did you do with them?

2:04:03.240 --> 2:04:07.160
 And a woman trying to be a man would say, oh, I lined them up.

2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:07.800
 We had wars.

2:04:07.800 --> 2:04:08.760
 We had battles.

2:04:08.760 --> 2:04:11.240
 And the man, just being a man, would say, I stomped on them.

2:04:11.240 --> 2:04:11.960
 I burned them.

2:04:11.960 --> 2:04:21.480
 So that's what the Turing test with computers has become.

2:04:21.480 --> 2:04:22.760
 What's the trick question?

2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:28.040
 That's why I say it's sort of devolved into this weirdness.

2:04:29.480 --> 2:04:35.800
 Nevertheless, conversation not formulated as a test is a fascinatingly challenging dance.

2:04:36.680 --> 2:04:38.200
 That's a really hard problem.

2:04:38.200 --> 2:04:45.720
 To me, conversation, when non poses a test, is a more intuitive illustration how far away

2:04:45.720 --> 2:04:48.760
 we are from solving intelligence than computer vision.

2:04:48.760 --> 2:04:49.240
 It's hard.

2:04:49.960 --> 2:04:53.000
 Computer vision is harder for me to pull apart.

2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:55.400
 But with language, with conversation, you could see.

2:04:55.400 --> 2:04:56.840
 Because language is so human.

2:04:56.840 --> 2:04:57.560
 It's so human.

2:04:58.680 --> 2:05:02.440
 We can so clearly see it.

2:05:04.280 --> 2:05:06.920
 Shit, you mentioned something I was going to go off on.

2:05:06.920 --> 2:05:08.920
 OK.

2:05:08.920 --> 2:05:16.120
 I mean, I have to ask you, because you were the head of CSAIL, AI Lab, for a long time.

2:05:17.560 --> 2:05:18.040
 I don't know.

2:05:18.840 --> 2:05:22.840
 To me, when I came to MIT, you were one of the greats at MIT.

2:05:22.840 --> 2:05:24.120
 So what was that time like?

2:05:25.960 --> 2:05:34.760
 And plus, you're friends with, but you knew Minsky and all the folks there, all the legendary

2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:37.400
 AI people of which you're one.

2:05:37.960 --> 2:05:39.560
 So what was that time like?

2:05:39.560 --> 2:05:46.760
 What are memories that stand out to you from that time, from your time at MIT, from the

2:05:46.760 --> 2:05:53.000
 AI Lab, from the dreams that the AI Lab represented, to the actual revolutionary work?

2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:55.640
 Well, let me tell you first the disappointment in myself.

2:05:56.760 --> 2:06:03.960
 As I've been researching this book, and so many of the players were active in the 50s

2:06:03.960 --> 2:06:08.600
 and 60s, I knew many of them when they were older, and I didn't ask them all the questions

2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:10.440
 now I wish I had asked.

2:06:11.320 --> 2:06:16.760
 I'd sit with them at our Thursday lunches, which we had a faculty lunch, and I didn't

2:06:16.760 --> 2:06:19.720
 ask them so many questions that now I wish I had.

2:06:19.720 --> 2:06:20.840
 Can I ask you that question?

2:06:20.840 --> 2:06:21.880
 Because you wrote that.

2:06:22.440 --> 2:06:25.800
 You wrote that you were fortunate to know and rub shoulders with many of the greats,

2:06:26.600 --> 2:06:30.680
 those who founded AI, robotics, and computer science, and the World Wide Web.

2:06:30.680 --> 2:06:34.760
 And you wrote that your big regret nowadays is that often I have questions for those who

2:06:34.760 --> 2:06:41.560
 have passed on, and I didn't think to ask them any of these questions, even as I saw

2:06:41.560 --> 2:06:44.120
 them and said hello to them on a daily basis.

2:06:44.120 --> 2:06:51.160
 So maybe also another question I want to ask, if you could talk to them today, what question

2:06:51.160 --> 2:06:51.960
 would you ask?

2:06:51.960 --> 2:06:53.240
 What questions would you ask?

2:06:53.240 --> 2:06:56.440
 Well, Licklider, I would ask him.

2:06:56.440 --> 2:07:02.600
 You know, he had the vision for humans and computers working together, and he really

2:07:02.600 --> 2:07:10.680
 founded that at DARPA, and he gave the money to MIT, which started Project MAC in 1963.

2:07:12.360 --> 2:07:16.200
 And I would have talked to him about what the successes were, what the failures were,

2:07:16.200 --> 2:07:18.680
 what he saw as progress, etc.

2:07:18.680 --> 2:07:24.680
 I would have asked him more questions about that, because now I could use it in my book,

2:07:24.680 --> 2:07:25.880
 you know, but I think it's lost.

2:07:25.880 --> 2:07:26.920
 It's lost forever.

2:07:26.920 --> 2:07:28.680
 A lot of the motivations are lost.

2:07:33.240 --> 2:07:40.840
 I should have asked Marvin why he and Seymour Pappert came down so hard on neural networks

2:07:40.840 --> 2:07:48.440
 in 1968 in their book Perceptrons, because Marvin's PhD thesis was all about neural networks.

2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:50.280
 And how do you make sense of that?

2:07:50.280 --> 2:07:52.040
 That book destroyed the field.

2:07:52.040 --> 2:07:56.280
 He probably, do you think he knew the effect that book would have?

2:07:59.480 --> 2:08:01.240
 All the theorems are negative theorems.

2:08:02.280 --> 2:08:02.780
 Yeah.

2:08:03.880 --> 2:08:04.380
 Yeah.

2:08:04.920 --> 2:08:05.960
 So, yeah.

2:08:05.960 --> 2:08:09.800
 That's just the way of, that's the way of life.

2:08:10.920 --> 2:08:15.800
 But still, it's kind of tragic that he was both the proponent and the destroyer of neural

2:08:15.800 --> 2:08:16.360
 networks.

2:08:16.360 --> 2:08:19.160
 Yeah.

2:08:19.160 --> 2:08:25.160
 Is there other memories stand out from the robotics and the AI work at MIT?

2:08:28.120 --> 2:08:30.600
 Well, yeah, but you gotta be more specific.

2:08:31.320 --> 2:08:33.160
 Well, I mean, like, it's such a magical place.

2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:40.520
 I mean, to me, it's a little bit also heartbreaking that, you know, with Google and Facebook,

2:08:40.520 --> 2:08:46.280
 like DeepMind and so on, so much of the talent, you know, it doesn't stay necessarily

2:08:46.280 --> 2:08:50.440
 for prolonged periods of time in these universities.

2:08:50.440 --> 2:08:50.940
 Oh, yeah.

2:08:50.940 --> 2:08:57.800
 I mean, some of the companies are more guilty than others of paying fabulous salaries to

2:08:57.800 --> 2:09:00.120
 some of the highest, you know, producers.

2:09:00.120 --> 2:09:02.840
 And then just, you never hear from them again.

2:09:02.840 --> 2:09:04.600
 They're not allowed to give public talks.

2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:05.640
 They're sort of locked away.

2:09:06.600 --> 2:09:12.280
 And it's sort of like collecting, you know, Hollywood stars or something.

2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:13.960
 And they're not allowed to make movies anymore.

2:09:13.960 --> 2:09:14.460
 I own them.

2:09:14.460 --> 2:09:15.660
 Yeah.

2:09:15.660 --> 2:09:20.700
 That's tragic because, I mean, there's an openness to the university setting where you

2:09:20.700 --> 2:09:25.580
 do research to both in the space of ideas and like publication, all those kinds of things.

2:09:25.580 --> 2:09:28.940
 Yeah, you know, and, you know, there's the publication and all that.

2:09:28.940 --> 2:09:31.980
 And often, you know, although these places say they publish.

2:09:32.940 --> 2:09:33.660
 There's pressure.

2:09:33.660 --> 2:09:41.260
 But I think, for instance, you know, on net net, I think Google buying those eight or

2:09:41.260 --> 2:09:45.580
 nine robotics company was bad for the field because it locked those people away.

2:09:46.620 --> 2:09:51.820
 They didn't have to make the company succeed anymore, locked them away for years, and then

2:09:53.660 --> 2:09:55.660
 sort of all frid it away.

2:09:55.660 --> 2:09:56.160
 Yeah.

2:09:56.160 --> 2:10:02.960
 So do you have hope for MIT, for MIT?

2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:03.460
 Yeah.

2:10:03.460 --> 2:10:04.000
 Why shouldn't I?

2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:11.200
 Well, I could be harsh and say that I'm not sure I would say MIT is leading the world

2:10:11.200 --> 2:10:15.440
 in AI or even Stanford or Berkeley.

2:10:15.440 --> 2:10:23.680
 I would say, I would say DeepMind, Google AI, Facebook AI, all of those things.

2:10:23.680 --> 2:10:29.920
 I would take a slightly different approach, a different answer.

2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:32.880
 I'll come back to Facebook in a minute.

2:10:32.880 --> 2:10:41.360
 But I think those other places are following a dream of one of the founders.

2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:46.560
 And I'm not sure that it's well founded, the dream.

2:10:46.560 --> 2:10:52.960
 And I'm not sure that it's going to have the impact that he believes it is.

2:10:54.720 --> 2:10:56.560
 You're talking about Facebook and Google and so on.

2:10:56.560 --> 2:10:57.600
 I'm talking about Google.

2:10:57.600 --> 2:10:58.320
 Google.

2:10:58.320 --> 2:11:03.360
 But the thing is, those research labs aren't, there's the big dream.

2:11:03.920 --> 2:11:08.480
 And I'm usually a fan of no matter what the dream is, a big dream is a unifier.

2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:15.200
 Because what happens is you have a lot of bright minds working together on a dream.

2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:20.000
 What results is a lot of adjacent ideas and how so much progress is made.

2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:20.500
 Yeah.

2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:22.560
 So I'm not saying they're actually leading.

2:11:22.560 --> 2:11:25.280
 I'm not saying that the universities are leading.

2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:25.780
 Yeah.

2:11:25.780 --> 2:11:28.960
 But I don't think those companies are leading in general because they're,

2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:36.160
 we saw this incredible spike in attendees at NeurIPS.

2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:44.800
 And as I said in my January 1st review this year for 2020, 2020 will not be

2:11:44.800 --> 2:11:48.560
 remembered as a watershed year for machine learning or AI.

2:11:48.560 --> 2:11:52.720
 There was nothing surprising happened anyway.

2:11:52.720 --> 2:11:56.720
 Unlike when deep learning hit ImageNet.

2:11:57.440 --> 2:12:00.160
 That was a shake.

2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:06.640
 And there's a lot more people writing papers, but the papers are fundamentally

2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:08.800
 boring and uninteresting.

2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:09.760
 Incremental work.

2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:10.260
 Yeah.

2:12:10.260 --> 2:12:13.140
 Is there a particular memories you have with Minsky or somebody else at

2:12:13.140 --> 2:12:15.620
 MIT that stand out, funny stories?

2:12:16.340 --> 2:12:19.140
 I mean, unfortunately, he's another one that's passed away.

2:12:21.940 --> 2:12:24.020
 You've known some of the biggest minds in AI.

2:12:24.580 --> 2:12:25.080
 Yeah.

2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:29.460
 And you know, they, they did amazing things and sometimes they were grumpy.

2:12:31.460 --> 2:12:35.380
 Well, he was, uh, he was interesting cause he was very grumpy, but that,

2:12:35.380 --> 2:12:41.060
 that was his, uh, I remember him saying in an interview that the key to success

2:12:41.780 --> 2:12:45.940
 or being to keep being productive is to hate everything you've ever done in the past.

2:12:45.940 --> 2:12:48.980
 Maybe that, maybe that explains the Perceptron book.

2:12:49.940 --> 2:12:50.440
 There it was.

2:12:50.440 --> 2:12:51.940
 He told you exactly.

2:12:53.540 --> 2:12:58.100
 But he, meaning like, just like, I mean, maybe that's the way to not

2:12:58.100 --> 2:12:59.380
 treat yourself too seriously.

2:12:59.380 --> 2:13:03.940
 Just, uh, you know, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not,

2:13:03.940 --> 2:13:05.620
 you're not treating yourself too seriously.

2:13:05.620 --> 2:13:08.260
 Just, uh, always be moving forward.

2:13:09.220 --> 2:13:10.100
 Uh, that was the idea.

2:13:10.100 --> 2:13:14.980
 I mean, that, that crankiness, I mean, there's a, uh, that's the scary.

2:13:14.980 --> 2:13:21.060
 So let me, let me, let me tell you, uh, you know, what really, um, you know,

2:13:21.060 --> 2:13:27.460
 the joy memories are about having access to technology before anyone else has seen

2:13:27.460 --> 2:13:27.960
 it.

2:13:27.960 --> 2:13:34.860
 You know, I got to Stanford in 1977 and we had, um, you know, we had terminals

2:13:34.860 --> 2:13:37.260
 that could show live video on them.

2:13:37.260 --> 2:13:40.620
 Um, digital, digital sound system.

2:13:40.620 --> 2:13:45.020
 We had a Xerox graphics printer.

2:13:45.020 --> 2:13:50.140
 We could print, um, uh, it wasn't, you know, it wasn't like a typewriter

2:13:50.140 --> 2:13:51.980
 ball hitting in characters.

2:13:51.980 --> 2:13:53.580
 It could print arbitrary things.

2:13:53.580 --> 2:13:58.300
 I mean, you know, one bit, you know, black or white, but you get arbitrary pictures.

2:13:58.300 --> 2:14:00.380
 This was science fiction sort of stuff.

2:14:00.380 --> 2:14:07.260
 Um, um, at, at MIT, the, uh, the list machines, which, you know, they were the

2:14:07.260 --> 2:14:12.060
 first personal computers and, you know, cost a hundred thousand dollars each.

2:14:12.060 --> 2:14:14.620
 And I could, you know, I got there early enough in the day.

2:14:14.620 --> 2:14:15.980
 I got one for the day.

2:14:15.980 --> 2:14:17.420
 Couldn't, couldn't stand up.

2:14:17.420 --> 2:14:18.380
 I had to keep working.

2:14:18.380 --> 2:14:25.340
 Um, um, so they're having that like direct glimpse into the future.

2:14:25.340 --> 2:14:25.580
 Yeah.

2:14:25.580 --> 2:14:29.100
 And, and, you know, I've had email every day since 1977.

2:14:29.100 --> 2:14:36.060
 Um, and, uh, you know, the, the host field was only eight bits, you know, that many

2:14:36.060 --> 2:14:39.980
 places, but I could send the email to other people at a few places.

2:14:39.980 --> 2:14:45.340
 So that was, that was pretty exciting to be in that world so different from what

2:14:45.340 --> 2:14:46.780
 the rest of the world knew.

2:14:46.780 --> 2:14:53.420
 Um, uh, uh, let me ask you probably edit this out, but just in case you have a

2:14:53.420 --> 2:15:00.060
 story, uh, I'm hanging out with Don Knuth, uh, for a while tomorrow.

2:15:00.060 --> 2:15:02.700
 Did you ever get a chance to such a different world than yours?

2:15:03.340 --> 2:15:08.300
 He's a very kind of theoretical computer science, the puzzle of, uh, of, uh, computer

2:15:08.300 --> 2:15:09.500
 science and mathematics.

2:15:09.500 --> 2:15:13.740
 And you're so much about the magic of robotics, like the practice of it.

2:15:13.740 --> 2:15:17.820
 You mentioned him earlier for like, not, you know, about computation.

2:15:17.820 --> 2:15:19.580
 Did your worlds cross?

2:15:19.580 --> 2:15:20.540
 They did enough.

2:15:20.540 --> 2:15:25.100
 You know, I, I know him now we talk, you know, but let me tell you my, my Donald

2:15:25.100 --> 2:15:25.820
 Knuth story.

2:15:26.700 --> 2:15:31.500
 So, um, you know, besides, you know, analysis of algorithms, he's well known for

2:15:32.140 --> 2:15:36.940
 writing tech, which is in LaTeX, which is the academic publishing system.

2:15:37.580 --> 2:15:41.740
 So he did that at the AI lab and he would do it.

2:15:41.740 --> 2:15:44.060
 He would work overnight at the AI lab.

2:15:45.020 --> 2:15:55.660
 And one, one day, one night, the, uh, the mainframe computer went down and, um, uh,

2:15:55.660 --> 2:15:57.340
 a guy named Robert Pore was there.

2:15:57.340 --> 2:16:03.180
 He did his PhD at the Media Lab at MIT and he was, um, you know, an engineer.

2:16:04.300 --> 2:16:08.780
 And so I, he and I, you know, tracked down what were the problem was.

2:16:08.780 --> 2:16:13.100
 It was one of this big refrigerator size or washing machine size disk drives had

2:16:13.100 --> 2:16:13.500
 failed.

2:16:13.500 --> 2:16:15.500
 And that's what brought the whole system down.

2:16:15.500 --> 2:16:20.300
 So we've got panels pulled off and we're pulling, you know, circuit cards out.

2:16:20.300 --> 2:16:25.340
 And Donald Knuth, who's a really tall guy walks in and he's looking down and says,

2:16:25.340 --> 2:16:26.540
 when will it be fixed?

2:16:26.540 --> 2:16:28.940
 You know, cause he wanted to get back to writing his tech system.

2:16:31.340 --> 2:16:37.420
 And so we, we figured out, you know, it was a particular chip, 7,400 series chip,

2:16:37.420 --> 2:16:38.700
 which was socketed.

2:16:38.700 --> 2:16:40.780
 We popped it out.

2:16:40.780 --> 2:16:43.340
 We put a replacement in, put it back in.

2:16:43.340 --> 2:16:45.740
 Smoke comes out cause we put it in backwards.

2:16:45.740 --> 2:16:48.780
 Cause we were so nervous that Donald Knuth was standing over us.

2:16:49.500 --> 2:16:52.940
 Anyway, we eventually got it fixed and got the mainframe running again.

2:16:53.660 --> 2:16:56.220
 So that was your little, when was that again?

2:16:56.220 --> 2:16:58.860
 Well, that must have been before October 79.

2:16:58.860 --> 2:17:00.300
 Cause we moved out of that building then.

2:17:00.300 --> 2:17:03.740
 So sometime probably 78 sometime early 79.

2:17:03.740 --> 2:17:06.140
 Yeah, those, all those figures is just fascinating.

2:17:06.140 --> 2:17:09.420
 All the people with pass, pass through MIT is really fascinating.

2:17:10.220 --> 2:17:17.420
 Is there, let me ask you to put on your big wise man hat.

2:17:18.140 --> 2:17:20.860
 Is there advice that you can give to young people today,

2:17:20.860 --> 2:17:23.980
 whether in high school or college who are thinking about their career

2:17:24.700 --> 2:17:32.060
 or thinking about life, how to live a life they're proud of, a successful life?

2:17:32.060 --> 2:17:36.140
 Yeah. So, so many people ask me for advice and have asked for,

2:17:36.140 --> 2:17:41.020
 and I give, I talk to a lot of people all the time and there is no one way.

2:17:44.060 --> 2:17:48.700
 You know, there's a lot of pressure to produce papers

2:17:51.900 --> 2:17:53.980
 that will be acceptable and be published.

2:17:56.460 --> 2:17:58.620
 Maybe I was, maybe I can't do it.

2:17:58.620 --> 2:18:03.340
 Maybe I was, maybe I come from an age where I would,

2:18:03.340 --> 2:18:07.100
 I could be a rebel against that and still succeed.

2:18:07.100 --> 2:18:13.260
 Maybe it's harder today, but I think it's important not to get too caught up

2:18:14.860 --> 2:18:17.260
 with what everyone else is doing.

2:18:18.380 --> 2:18:22.940
 And if you, if, well, it depends on what you want of life.

2:18:22.940 --> 2:18:31.100
 If you want to have real impact, you have to be ready to fail a lot of times.

2:18:31.100 --> 2:18:33.420
 So you have to make a lot of unsafe decisions.

2:18:34.220 --> 2:18:38.700
 And the only way to make that work is to make, keep doing it for a long time.

2:18:38.700 --> 2:18:40.220
 And then one of them will be work out.

2:18:40.220 --> 2:18:43.740
 And so that, that, that will make something successful.

2:18:43.740 --> 2:18:44.220
 Or not.

2:18:45.500 --> 2:18:48.780
 Or yeah, or you may, or you just may, you know, end up, you know,

2:18:48.780 --> 2:18:50.780
 not having a, you know, having a lousy career.

2:18:50.780 --> 2:18:52.140
 I mean, it's certainly possible.

2:18:52.140 --> 2:18:53.420
 Taking the risk is the thing.

2:18:53.420 --> 2:18:53.580
 Yeah.

2:18:56.220 --> 2:19:04.620
 But there's no way to, to make all safe decisions and actually really contribute.

2:19:06.620 --> 2:19:11.020
 Do you think about your death, about your mortality?

2:19:12.300 --> 2:19:15.660
 I got to say when COVID hit, I did.

2:19:15.660 --> 2:19:18.860
 Because we did, you know, in the early days, we didn't know how bad it was going to be.

2:19:18.860 --> 2:19:22.780
 And I, that, that made me work on my book harder for a while,

2:19:22.780 --> 2:19:25.900
 but then I'd started this company and now I'm doing full time,

2:19:25.900 --> 2:19:27.100
 more than full time of the company.

2:19:27.100 --> 2:19:29.660
 So the book's on hold, but I do want to finish this book.

2:19:30.300 --> 2:19:32.060
 When you think about it, are you afraid of it?

2:19:35.820 --> 2:19:42.220
 I'm afraid of dribbling, you know, of losing it.

2:19:42.220 --> 2:19:43.980
 The details of, okay.

2:19:43.980 --> 2:19:44.220
 Yeah.

2:19:45.180 --> 2:19:45.580
 Yeah.

2:19:45.580 --> 2:19:50.380
 But the fact that the ride ends, I've known that for a long time.

2:19:51.260 --> 2:19:54.780
 So it's, yeah, but there's knowing and knowing.

2:19:55.420 --> 2:19:57.580
 It's such a, yeah.

2:19:57.580 --> 2:19:58.780
 And it really sucks.

2:19:58.780 --> 2:20:00.380
 It feels, it feels a lot closer.

2:20:01.820 --> 2:20:07.900
 So my, in, in my, my blog with my predictions, my sort of push back against that was that I said,

2:20:08.940 --> 2:20:14.860
 I'm going to review these every year for 32 years and that puts me into my mid nineties.

2:20:14.860 --> 2:20:18.780
 So, you know, it's my whole every, every time you write the blog posts,

2:20:18.780 --> 2:20:23.660
 you're getting closer and closer to your own prediction of your death.

2:20:23.660 --> 2:20:23.820
 Yeah.

2:20:24.940 --> 2:20:26.300
 What do you hope your legacy is?

2:20:28.140 --> 2:20:31.900
 You're one of the greatest roboticist AI researchers of all time.

2:20:34.700 --> 2:20:38.140
 What I hope is that I actually finished writing this book

2:20:38.140 --> 2:20:48.220
 and that there's one person who reads it and see something about changing the way they're thinking.

2:20:48.940 --> 2:20:53.340
 And that leads to the next big.

2:20:54.860 --> 2:20:59.340
 And then there'll be on a podcast a hundred years from now saying I once read that book

2:21:01.580 --> 2:21:02.860
 and that changed everything.

2:21:04.460 --> 2:21:06.140
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

2:21:06.140 --> 2:21:10.140
 This whole thing, the existence, the, the, the, all the hurried things we do

2:21:10.140 --> 2:21:13.260
 on this planet, what do you think is the meaning of it all?

2:21:13.260 --> 2:21:15.660
 Yeah. Well, you know, I think we're all really bad at it.

2:21:17.180 --> 2:21:19.020
 Life or finding meaning or both.

2:21:19.020 --> 2:21:24.380
 Yeah. We get caught up in, in, in the, it's easy to get easier to do the stuff that's immediate

2:21:24.940 --> 2:21:26.780
 and not through the stuff. It's not immediate.

2:21:27.820 --> 2:21:29.980
 So the big picture we're bad at.

2:21:29.980 --> 2:21:31.020
 Yeah. Yeah.

2:21:31.020 --> 2:21:33.900
 Do you have a sense of what that big picture is?

2:21:33.900 --> 2:21:37.980
 Like why you ever look up to the stars and ask, why the hell are we here?

2:21:41.580 --> 2:21:50.380
 You know, my, my, my, my atheism tells me it's just random, but you know, I want to understand the,

2:21:50.380 --> 2:21:55.660
 the way random in the, in the, that's what I talk about in this book, how order comes from disorder.

2:21:55.660 --> 2:21:56.220
 Yeah.

2:21:58.220 --> 2:22:02.460
 But it kind of sprung up like most of the whole thing is random, but this, this, this,

2:22:02.460 --> 2:22:06.940
 the whole thing is random, but this little pocket of complexity they will call earth

2:22:07.660 --> 2:22:10.300
 that like, why the hell does that happen?

2:22:10.300 --> 2:22:17.420
 And, and what we don't know is how common that those pockets of complexity are or how often,

2:22:18.060 --> 2:22:21.260
 um, cause they may not last forever.

2:22:22.780 --> 2:22:30.460
 Which is, uh, more exciting slash sad to you if we're alone or if there's infinite number of.

2:22:30.460 --> 2:22:35.420
 Oh, I think, I think it's impossible for me to believe that we're alone.

2:22:36.300 --> 2:22:39.980
 Um, that would just be too horrible, too cruel.

2:22:41.500 --> 2:22:43.180
 It could be like the sad thing.

2:22:43.180 --> 2:22:46.300
 It could be like a graveyard of intelligent civilizations.

2:22:46.300 --> 2:22:46.940
 Oh, everywhere.

2:22:46.940 --> 2:22:47.100
 Yeah.

2:22:47.980 --> 2:22:49.900
 That might be the most likely outcome.

2:22:50.620 --> 2:22:51.660
 And for us too.

2:22:51.660 --> 2:22:52.540
 Yeah, exactly.

2:22:52.540 --> 2:22:52.860
 Yeah.

2:22:52.860 --> 2:22:54.700
 And all of this will be forgotten.

2:22:54.700 --> 2:22:54.940
 Yeah.

2:22:54.940 --> 2:22:59.900
 Yeah, including all the robots you build, everything forgotten.

2:23:01.500 --> 2:23:05.740
 Well, on average, everyone has been forgotten in history.

2:23:05.740 --> 2:23:06.220
 Yeah.

2:23:06.220 --> 2:23:06.940
 Right.

2:23:06.940 --> 2:23:07.500
 Yeah.

2:23:07.500 --> 2:23:10.540
 Most people are not remembered beyond the generation or two.

2:23:11.100 --> 2:23:12.780
 Um, I mean, yeah.

2:23:12.780 --> 2:23:17.900
 Well, not just on average, basically very close to a hundred percent of people who've ever lived

2:23:17.900 --> 2:23:18.780
 are forgotten.

2:23:18.780 --> 2:23:19.020
 Yeah.

2:23:19.020 --> 2:23:24.140
 I mean, you know, long arc of, I don't know anyone alive who remembers my great grandparents

2:23:24.140 --> 2:23:25.260
 because we didn't meet them.

2:23:26.300 --> 2:23:32.460
 So still this fun, this, uh, this, uh, life is pretty fun somehow.

2:23:32.460 --> 2:23:32.620
 Yeah.

2:23:33.660 --> 2:23:39.180
 Even the immense absurdity and, and, uh, at times, meaninglessness of it all.

2:23:39.180 --> 2:23:40.220
 It's pretty fun.

2:23:40.220 --> 2:23:43.740
 And one of the, for me, one of the most fun things is robots.

2:23:43.740 --> 2:23:45.180
 And I've looked up to your work.

2:23:45.180 --> 2:23:46.780
 I've looked up to you for a long time.

2:23:46.780 --> 2:23:47.180
 That's right.

2:23:47.180 --> 2:23:47.740
 God.

2:23:47.740 --> 2:23:53.580
 Rod, it's, it's an honor that, uh, you would spend your valuable time with me today talking.

2:23:53.580 --> 2:23:54.780
 It was an amazing conversation.

2:23:54.780 --> 2:23:55.980
 Thank you so much for being here.

2:23:55.980 --> 2:23:57.820
 Well, thanks for, thanks for talking with me.

2:23:57.820 --> 2:23:58.620
 I've enjoyed it.

2:24:00.060 --> 2:24:02.700
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Rodney Brooks.

2:24:02.700 --> 2:24:06.300
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:24:06.860 --> 2:24:11.580
 And now let me leave you with the three laws of robotics from Isaac Asimov.

2:24:12.620 --> 2:24:19.020
 One, a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction, allow human being to come to

2:24:19.020 --> 2:24:25.580
 harm. Two, a robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except when such orders

2:24:25.580 --> 2:24:32.860
 would conflict with the first law. And three, a robot must protect its own existence as long

2:24:32.860 --> 2:24:37.500
 as such protection does not conflict with the first or the second laws.

2:24:38.620 --> 2:24:39.740
 Thank you for listening.

2:24:39.740 --> 2:24:49.740
 I hope to see you next time.
