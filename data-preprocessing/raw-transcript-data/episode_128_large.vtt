00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
 The following is a conversation with Michael Malice,

00:02.720 --> 00:05.800
 an anarchist, political thinker, author,

00:05.800 --> 00:10.160
 and a proud, part time, Andy Kaufman like troll,

00:10.160 --> 00:11.940
 in the best sense of that word,

00:11.940 --> 00:14.960
 on both Twitter and in real life.

00:14.960 --> 00:18.640
 He's a host of a great podcast called You're Welcome,

00:18.640 --> 00:20.920
 spelled Y O U R.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.520
 I think that gives a sense of his sense of humor.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.960
 He is the author of Dear Reader,

00:25.960 --> 00:29.600
 the unauthorized autobiography of King Jong Il,

00:29.600 --> 00:31.040
 and The New Right,

00:31.040 --> 00:33.880
 A Journey to the Fringe of American Politics.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.040
 This latter book, when I read it,

00:36.040 --> 00:38.520
 or rather listened to it last year,

00:38.520 --> 00:40.620
 helped me start learning about the various

00:40.620 --> 00:43.600
 disparate movements that I was undereducated about,

00:43.600 --> 00:46.920
 from the internet trolls, to Alex Jones,

00:46.920 --> 00:51.440
 to white nationalists, and to techno anarchists.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.680
 The book is funny and brilliant, and so is Michael.

00:54.680 --> 00:58.120
 Unfortunately, because of a self imposed deadline,

00:58.120 --> 01:01.280
 I actually pulled an all nighter before this conversation.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.880
 So I was not exactly all there mentally,

01:03.880 --> 01:06.360
 even more so than usual, which is tough,

01:06.360 --> 01:09.880
 because Michael is really quick witted and brilliant.

01:09.880 --> 01:12.440
 But he was kind, patient, and understanding

01:12.440 --> 01:16.080
 in this conversation, and I hope you will be as well.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.080
 Today, I'm trying something a little new,

01:18.080 --> 01:21.960
 looking to establish a regular structure for these intros.

01:21.960 --> 01:25.000
 A first, doing the guest intro, like I just did.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.960
 Second, quick one or two sentence mention of each sponsor.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.280
 Third, my side comments related to the episode.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.000
 And finally, fourth, full ad reads

01:35.000 --> 01:36.760
 on the audio side of things,

01:36.760 --> 01:39.560
 and on YouTube, going straight to the conversation.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.520
 So not doing the full ad reads.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.560
 And as always, no ads in the middle,

01:43.560 --> 01:46.600
 because to me, they get in the way of the conversation.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.520
 So, quick mention of the sponsors.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.400
 First, SEMrush, the most advanced

01:51.400 --> 01:54.320
 SEO optimization tool I've ever come across.

01:54.320 --> 01:56.080
 I don't like looking at numbers,

01:56.080 --> 01:57.520
 but someone probably should.

01:57.520 --> 02:00.000
 It helps you make good decisions.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
 Second sponsor is DoorDash, food delivery service

02:03.000 --> 02:04.640
 that I've used for many years

02:04.640 --> 02:07.640
 to fuel long, uninterrupted sessions of deep work

02:07.640 --> 02:11.840
 at Google, MIT, and I still use it a lot today.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.880
 Third sponsor is Masterclass, online courses

02:14.880 --> 02:16.720
 from the best people in the world

02:16.720 --> 02:18.560
 on each of the topics covered,

02:18.560 --> 02:21.040
 from rockets, to game design, to poker,

02:21.040 --> 02:25.360
 to writing, and to guitar with Carlos Santana.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.280
 Please check out these sponsors in the description

02:27.280 --> 02:30.800
 to get a discount and to support this podcast.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.040
 As a side note, let me say that I hope to have

02:33.040 --> 02:35.680
 some conversations with political thinkers,

02:35.680 --> 02:38.160
 including liberals and conservatives,

02:38.160 --> 02:41.080
 anarchists, libertarians, objectivists,

02:41.080 --> 02:42.920
 and everything in between.

02:42.920 --> 02:46.480
 I'm as allergic to Trump bashing and Trump worship

02:46.480 --> 02:48.160
 as you probably are.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.800
 I have none of that in me.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.040
 I really work hard to be open minded

02:52.040 --> 02:54.600
 and let my curiosity drive the conversation.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.760
 I do plead with you to be patient on two counts.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.560
 First, I have an intense, busy life

03:00.560 --> 03:02.360
 outside of these podcasts.

03:02.360 --> 03:05.520
 Like it's 4 a.m. right now as I'm recording this.

03:05.520 --> 03:08.360
 So sometimes life affects these conversations,

03:08.360 --> 03:11.240
 like in this case, I pull an all nighter beforehand.

03:11.240 --> 03:13.240
 So please be patient with me if I say something

03:13.240 --> 03:17.640
 inelegant, confusing, dumb, or just plain wrong.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.680
 I'll try to correct myself on social media

03:19.680 --> 03:22.400
 or in future conversations as much as I can.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.040
 I really am always learning and working hard to improve.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.920
 Second, if I or the guest says something about,

03:29.920 --> 03:33.080
 for example, our current president, Donald Trump,

03:33.080 --> 03:36.920
 that's over the top negative or over the top positive,

03:36.920 --> 03:39.760
 please don't let your brain go into the partisan mode.

03:39.760 --> 03:43.240
 Try to hear our words in an open minded nuanced way.

03:43.240 --> 03:45.840
 And if we say stuff from a place of emotion,

03:45.840 --> 03:47.440
 please give us a pass.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.720
 Nuanced conversation can only happen

03:49.720 --> 03:51.360
 if we're patient with each other.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.200
 If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,

03:54.200 --> 03:56.560

03:56.560 --> 03:58.920

03:58.920 --> 04:02.460
 or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.

04:02.460 --> 04:06.280
 And now, here's my conversation with Michael Malice.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.360
 There was a Simpsons episode where he starts mixing

04:09.360 --> 04:12.400
 like sleeping pills with like pet pills

04:12.400 --> 04:13.920
 and he's driving his truck and I'm like,

04:13.920 --> 04:15.480
 I wanna see what happens if he mixed Red Bull

04:15.480 --> 04:17.600
 and Nitra cold brew.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.700
 There's a lineup of drugs.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.640
 This is gonna be so fun.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.720
 Yeah, let's start with love.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.680
 Yeah, so one thing we'll eventually somehow talk about,

04:31.680 --> 04:34.240
 it'll be a theme throughout, is that you're also Russian.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.080
 Yes.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.920
 A little bit less than me, but.

04:36.920 --> 04:37.840
 How, why?

04:37.840 --> 04:39.600
 Cause I'm from Ukraine.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.560
 Oh, you're from Ukraine?

04:40.560 --> 04:41.400
 From above.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.320
 Okay, wow.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.960
 No, because you came here a little bit

04:43.960 --> 04:44.840
 when you were younger.

04:44.840 --> 04:45.680
 Yeah.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.720
 I came here when I was 13,

04:47.720 --> 04:49.960
 so I saturated a little bit of the Russian soul.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.520
 I marinated in the Russian soul a little deeper.

04:52.520 --> 04:53.600
 I haven't told anyone this,

04:53.600 --> 04:55.700
 but I'll be glad to tell you, Davidish.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.160
 I haven't been back since I was two.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.400
 And next summer, it looks like me and my buddy,

05:01.400 --> 05:03.240
 Chris Williamson, who's also a podcaster,

05:03.240 --> 05:06.280
 he's British, Modern Wisdom, he looks like Apollo.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.480
 Looks like we got a videographer.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.320
 Which Apollo?

05:08.320 --> 05:09.160
 Apollo Creed?

05:09.160 --> 05:10.200
 The god, he looks like the god Apollo.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.040
 Yeah, he's like a model.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.760
 I thought you were talking about Rocky.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.640
 So, we're gonna go for the first time

05:16.640 --> 05:18.500
 to see where I came from.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.920
 Which is in Ukraine.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.360
 We're gonna go to Lvov and either St. Petersburg or Moscow,

05:22.360 --> 05:24.860
 probably St. Petersburg, or both.

05:24.860 --> 05:25.760
 It's gonna be intense.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.480
 It's gonna be a lot of panic attacks, I feel.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.600
 And your Russian is okay?

05:30.600 --> 05:31.440
 Yeah.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.160
 How do you think?

05:33.160 --> 05:34.000
 Good?

05:34.000 --> 05:34.820
 Do you understand?

05:34.820 --> 05:35.920
 No, you can't talk Russian in Ukraine,

05:35.920 --> 05:37.440
 or it's like they get offended.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.920
 Yeah, but then you also wanna go to Russia.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.360
 Yeah.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.940
 I don't know.

05:42.940 --> 05:44.800
 For me, there's several people in Russia

05:44.800 --> 05:47.000
 I wanna interview on a podcast.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.640
 So, one of them is Gagarin Perlman,

05:49.640 --> 05:53.720
 which is a mathematician, and the other person is Putin.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.680
 You know what my favorite Putin story is?

05:55.680 --> 05:56.500
 Do you know this?

05:56.500 --> 05:57.340
 No.

05:57.340 --> 05:58.520
 When he had Merkel with him, do you know this story?

05:58.520 --> 05:59.360
 No.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.160
 Merkel's scared of dogs, like petrified of dogs.

06:02.160 --> 06:06.160
 So, he brings in his like black lab.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.240
 It's a Labrador, it's like the sweetest animal,

06:08.240 --> 06:09.760
 and it's all over her, and there's pictures,

06:09.760 --> 06:12.040
 and she's sitting like this, and she's terrified,

06:12.040 --> 06:13.720
 and he's like, what's wrong, Angela?

06:13.720 --> 06:15.460
 He's just completely trolling her.

06:16.560 --> 06:20.800
 Yeah, he's aware of the sort of the narrative around him.

06:20.800 --> 06:21.640
 Yeah.

06:21.640 --> 06:22.480
 And then he plays with it.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.300
 Yes.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.140
 He enjoys it.

06:24.140 --> 06:24.980
 It's a very Russian thing.

06:24.980 --> 06:26.280
 My friend wanted to do a film about me.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.600
 He goes, I realized you guys aren't like us at all.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.080
 You're just like, look at us,

06:30.080 --> 06:31.440
 and then I started telling him stories

06:31.440 --> 06:33.520
 about the upbringing, and he's like, oh my God,

06:33.520 --> 06:34.560
 and as I'm telling them, I'm like,

06:34.560 --> 06:38.440
 wow, this stuff is really crazy, like how we are wired.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.260
 Who's the we?

06:39.260 --> 06:40.100
 Your friend is?

06:40.100 --> 06:40.920
 The Russian, the friend's American.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.920
 I'm saying the way Russians are brought up,

06:42.920 --> 06:45.160
 and the way, maybe, I don't think it was just my family.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.600
 I bet you had similar things.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.680
 Here's an example.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.400
 I was, I had a buddy staying with me.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.360
 He had a problem with his roommate,

06:51.360 --> 06:53.120
 so he crashed at my place, fine.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.540
 I went to the gym, and I come back,

06:56.540 --> 06:58.320
 and he goes, oh, there was,

06:58.320 --> 07:00.440
 and my apartment building is four four apartments,

07:00.440 --> 07:02.000
 so it's not like a huge thing.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.440
 He goes, oh, there was someone knocking at your door,

07:04.440 --> 07:08.900
 so I told him blah blah, and for me,

07:08.900 --> 07:10.960
 and I wonder if you're the same way,

07:10.960 --> 07:12.920
 if I'm at someone's house that's not my own,

07:12.920 --> 07:14.660
 and someone knocks on the door,

07:14.660 --> 07:16.600
 I wouldn't even think to answer it.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.920
 Like if I had an apple here, maybe I'd eat it,

07:18.920 --> 07:20.360
 I'd cut it, whatever.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.860
 I'm not gonna, it just doesn't enter my head

07:21.860 --> 07:23.160
 to smash into my face.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.420
 The thought of answering the door, if it's not my house,

07:26.420 --> 07:27.440
 it would never enter my head.

07:27.440 --> 07:28.640
 Would it enter your head?

07:28.640 --> 07:30.080
 No, but why?

07:30.080 --> 07:31.760
 But he's an American, so someone's at the door.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.680
 He goes and opens it, even though it's not his house.

07:33.680 --> 07:34.740
 I would never do that.

07:34.740 --> 07:36.860
 I would never think to do that.

07:36.860 --> 07:39.880
 That is so strange that you pick some very obscure thing

07:39.880 --> 07:42.040
 to delineate Americans and Russians.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.040
 I don't think that's obscure,

07:43.040 --> 07:46.560
 because I think it speaks to how we perceive strangers.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.280
 With Americans, everyone's friendly,

07:48.280 --> 07:52.000
 and with us, it's like, no, no, you have that moat,

07:52.000 --> 07:55.200
 and I think that percolates into many different aspects

07:55.200 --> 07:58.020
 of how we relate to people, and I have to undo a lot of that.

07:58.020 --> 07:58.860
 That's true.

07:58.860 --> 08:00.880
 You're right, there's the relationship I formed there

08:00.880 --> 08:04.120
 where in Russia, we're very deep and close,

08:04.120 --> 08:06.320
 and then there's the strangers, the other,

08:06.320 --> 08:08.920
 that you don't trust by default.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.280
 It takes a long time to go over the moat of trust.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.880
 For a long time, until recently,

08:13.880 --> 08:15.440
 whenever I said anything to anyone,

08:15.440 --> 08:20.440
 my brain ran a scan that said, if this person turns on you,

08:20.760 --> 08:22.640
 would this, can they use this against you?

08:22.640 --> 08:24.800
 And I would do this with everything I said with strangers,

08:24.800 --> 08:26.320
 and after a while, it's like, you know what?

08:26.320 --> 08:28.200
 Maybe they will, but I'm strong enough to take it,

08:28.200 --> 08:30.560
 but this is not how Americans think.

08:30.560 --> 08:31.400
 Or here's another one.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.220
 Let me ask you this.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.060
 Sorry, I'm taking over the interview.

08:33.060 --> 08:35.680
 People ask about advice for work, right?

08:35.680 --> 08:37.920
 Like I had this, there was this party I went to,

08:37.920 --> 08:39.560
 and basically everyone had their own problems,

08:39.560 --> 08:41.280
 and everyone else gave their advice, right?

08:41.280 --> 08:43.380
 And someone's having a problem with a coworker,

08:43.380 --> 08:46.820
 and the advice these Tupoy Americans gave them is,

08:46.820 --> 08:48.800
 oh, sit down and have a talk with them.

08:48.800 --> 08:52.920
 And to me, this is like the last case, last resort.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.520
 Like first, you have to see what you can

08:54.520 --> 08:56.960
 without showing your hand, showing your vulnerability,

08:56.960 --> 08:58.700
 only when everything hasn't worked out,

08:58.700 --> 09:00.200
 or you're like, all right, let me sit down with you

09:00.200 --> 09:02.120
 and try to have it out with you, probably.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.680
 But for them, the first thing is like, sit down and be like,

09:04.680 --> 09:06.940
 oh, you're causing me problems, blah, blah, blah.

09:06.940 --> 09:09.340
 So I perceive that right away as a threat,

09:09.340 --> 09:11.440
 that this person sees an antagonism between us,

09:11.440 --> 09:13.680
 and also as a weakness that I'm getting to them.

09:13.680 --> 09:17.240
 So my reaction isn't how do I make it better?

09:17.240 --> 09:20.200
 My reaction is to reinforce my position

09:20.200 --> 09:23.640
 and see what I can to marginalize them, usually.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.680
 I haven't worked in a corporate setting in a long time.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.780
 But it's not, I don't approach it the way an American would.

09:27.780 --> 09:29.040
 Like, I'm glad you came and talked to me.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.520
 Now I probably would, because it's gonna be a friend.

09:31.520 --> 09:34.580
 So you attribute that to the Russian upbringing,

09:34.580 --> 09:37.980
 as opposed to you have deep psychological issues.

09:37.980 --> 09:39.820
 I think those are synonymous, don't you?

09:39.820 --> 09:44.400
 Wait, would you think differently, maybe a few years ago?

09:46.580 --> 09:50.400
 I don't know, I think you lost me at the,

09:50.400 --> 09:52.260
 because you kind of said that,

09:52.260 --> 09:54.020
 you're kind of implying you have a deep distrust

09:54.020 --> 09:57.260
 of the world, like the world is.

09:57.260 --> 09:59.860
 I think the default setting would be distrust, yeah.

09:59.860 --> 10:04.860
 But I would put it differently,

10:05.540 --> 10:09.380
 is I almost ignore the rest of the world,

10:09.380 --> 10:14.020
 I don't even acknowledge it, I just savor,

10:14.020 --> 10:18.660
 I save my love and trust for the small circle of people.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.220
 I agree, but when that person is being confrontational,

10:21.220 --> 10:24.020
 or as they perceive it, as being open,

10:24.020 --> 10:27.300
 now there's a situation, how would you handle that?

10:27.300 --> 10:31.260
 Like a cold wind blows, you just kind of like.

10:31.260 --> 10:33.340
 Yeah, but it's not like this is an opportunity

10:33.340 --> 10:36.340
 for us to work out our differences, it's a cold wind.

10:36.340 --> 10:38.500
 It's not a hug, that's my point.

10:38.500 --> 10:41.700
 Americans think it's a hug, a cold wind.

10:41.700 --> 10:45.180
 You're so suspicious, what it really is, is a cold wind.

10:46.860 --> 10:50.380
 I'm so humane, it's not something to be scared of,

10:50.380 --> 10:52.580
 it's a cold wind, it's a good person.

10:52.580 --> 10:56.060
 But it's not, this is great, but it's not a source of,

10:56.060 --> 11:00.620
 like I'm not suspicious of, like I'm not anxious,

11:00.620 --> 11:02.940
 I would say, or like living in fear

11:02.940 --> 11:04.540
 of the rest of the world, I'm more.

11:04.540 --> 11:07.420
 Oh, I agree, but you're not receptive to that person.

11:07.420 --> 11:09.460
 That's all I'm saying, and they are.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.740
 Got it, so speaking of which, let's talk about love.

11:14.380 --> 11:18.820
 Which requires to be receptive of the world, of strangers.

11:19.780 --> 11:23.060
 How do we put more love out there in the world,

11:23.060 --> 11:25.340
 especially on the internet?

11:25.340 --> 11:30.340
 One mechanism I have found to increase love,

11:30.380 --> 11:31.900
 and that's a word that has many meanings

11:31.900 --> 11:33.940
 and is used in a very intense sense

11:33.940 --> 11:35.380
 and is used in a very loose sense.

11:35.380 --> 11:36.860
 Can you try to define love?

11:36.860 --> 11:41.860
 Sure, love is a strong sense of attraction

11:42.100 --> 11:46.940
 toward another person, entity, or place

11:46.940 --> 11:51.340
 that causes one to tend to react

11:51.340 --> 11:53.540
 in a disproportionately positive manner.

11:53.540 --> 11:54.380
 That's off the top of my head.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.460
 Disproportionately.

11:55.460 --> 11:57.660
 Yes, so for example, if you.

11:57.660 --> 11:58.740
 Why not proportionately?

11:58.740 --> 12:02.700
 Because if someone's about to, who you love,

12:02.700 --> 12:05.660
 is about to get harmed, you're moving heaven and earth

12:05.660 --> 12:08.820
 to make sure, or like a book you love.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.460
 I love this book, like you're going through the fire

12:10.460 --> 12:13.140
 to try to save it, whereas if it's a book you really like,

12:13.140 --> 12:15.100
 it's like, oh, I'll get another one.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.580
 And a book's kind of a loose example, but.

12:18.580 --> 12:20.140
 So you're going with the love that's like,

12:20.140 --> 12:22.220
 you're saving for just a few people,

12:22.220 --> 12:25.060
 almost like romantical, like love for a close family.

12:25.060 --> 12:28.780
 But what about just love to even the broader,

12:28.780 --> 12:30.900
 like the kind of love you can put out

12:30.900 --> 12:33.860
 to people on the internet, which is like just kindness.

12:33.860 --> 12:35.300
 Sure, I would say in that case,

12:35.300 --> 12:40.300
 it's important to make them feel seen and validated.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.860
 And I try to do this when people who I have come to know

12:44.860 --> 12:46.600
 on the internet, and there's a lot,

12:46.600 --> 12:48.780
 I try to do that as much as possible

12:48.780 --> 12:51.420
 because I don't think it's valid

12:51.420 --> 12:53.780
 how on social media, and I do this a lot myself,

12:53.780 --> 12:55.140
 but not towards everyone,

12:55.140 --> 12:58.300
 it's just there to be aggressive and antagonistic.

12:58.300 --> 13:00.580
 You should be antagonistic towards bad people,

13:00.580 --> 13:02.780
 and that's fine, but at the same time,

13:02.780 --> 13:04.400
 there's lots of great people.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.100
 And especially with my audience,

13:06.100 --> 13:08.500
 and I would bet disproportionately with yours,

13:08.500 --> 13:10.300
 there's lots of people who are,

13:10.300 --> 13:13.300
 because of their psychology and intelligence,

13:13.300 --> 13:17.220
 are going to be much more isolated socially than they should.

13:17.220 --> 13:19.340
 And if I, and I've heard from many of them,

13:19.340 --> 13:21.180
 and if I'm the person who makes them feel,

13:21.180 --> 13:24.180
 oh, I'm not crazy, it's everyone else around me

13:24.180 --> 13:27.700
 who is just basic, the fact that I can be that person,

13:27.700 --> 13:29.520
 which I didn't have at their age,

13:29.520 --> 13:32.460
 to me is incredibly reaffirming.

13:32.460 --> 13:34.100
 You mean that source of love?

13:34.100 --> 13:36.140
 But I mean love in the sense of like,

13:36.140 --> 13:37.700
 you know, you care about this person

13:37.700 --> 13:38.760
 and you want good things for them,

13:38.760 --> 13:40.140
 not in a kind of romantic way.

13:40.140 --> 13:42.460
 But I mean, you're using it in a broad sense now.

13:42.460 --> 13:44.900
 Yeah, but you're also a person who kind of,

13:44.900 --> 13:49.900
 I mean, attacks the power structures in the world

13:52.060 --> 13:54.740
 by mocking them effectively.

13:54.740 --> 13:59.740
 And love, I would say, requires you to be

14:00.780 --> 14:04.660
 non witty and simple and fragile,

14:04.660 --> 14:08.220
 which I see it as like the opposite of what trolls do.

14:08.220 --> 14:15.220
 Trolls are, if there is someone coming after what I love,

14:15.220 --> 14:18.740
 there's two mechanisms, right, at least two.

14:18.740 --> 14:20.780
 I go up and I'm fighting them,

14:20.780 --> 14:24.660
 and in which case you are getting hurt in a knife fight,

14:24.660 --> 14:26.420
 even if you win the knife fight,

14:26.420 --> 14:30.100
 or if you disarm them and you preclude

14:30.100 --> 14:32.420
 the possibility of a fight and you drive them off

14:32.420 --> 14:34.100
 or render them powerless,

14:34.100 --> 14:37.860
 you keep your person intact as yourself

14:37.860 --> 14:39.660
 and you also protect your values.

14:39.660 --> 14:41.660
 So how do you render them powerless?

14:41.660 --> 14:43.220
 As you just said, by mocking them.

14:43.220 --> 14:46.300
 One of the most effective mechanisms for those in power,

14:46.300 --> 14:48.980
 we're much closer to Brave New World than 1984.

14:48.980 --> 14:51.060
 The people who are dominant and in power

14:51.060 --> 14:54.700
 aren't there because of the threat of the gulag or prison.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.420
 They're there because of social pressures.

14:56.420 --> 14:57.960
 Look at the masks.

14:57.960 --> 15:01.560
 I was on the subway not that long ago in New York City.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.060
 No one cared who I was until I put off the mask.

15:04.060 --> 15:06.100
 I was in the subway that long in New York City.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.140
 And I put this on my Instagram.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.300
 I've told this story before.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.100
 There was an Asian dude in his early 30s.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.380
 He was like in Western clothes.

15:11.380 --> 15:13.420
 It's not like he had a rickshaw or something.

15:13.420 --> 15:16.860
 An older man in his 50s stood up over him on the subway,

15:16.860 --> 15:20.440
 screamed at him, said, go back where you came from.

15:20.440 --> 15:21.280
 You're disgusting.

15:21.280 --> 15:22.220
 I'm gonna get sick.

15:22.220 --> 15:23.920
 If you think this guy is a vector of disease,

15:23.920 --> 15:25.820
 which is your prerogative, why are you coming close to him?

15:25.820 --> 15:27.380
 Why are you getting in his face?

15:27.380 --> 15:28.380
 And what?

15:28.380 --> 15:32.100
 Sorry, so it was because he was Asian?

15:32.100 --> 15:32.940
 It was both.

15:32.940 --> 15:37.580
 It was the not having a mask gave him the permission

15:37.580 --> 15:41.180
 to act like a despicable, aggressive person toward him.

15:41.180 --> 15:44.980
 And the point being, a lot of these mechanisms

15:44.980 --> 15:49.260
 for social control are outsourced to low quality people

15:49.260 --> 15:50.620
 because this is their one chance

15:50.620 --> 15:53.240
 to assert dominance and status over somebody else.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.940
 So the best way to diffuse that

15:54.940 --> 15:56.820
 isn't with weaponry or fighting.

15:56.820 --> 15:58.980
 It's through mockery because all of a sudden,

15:58.980 --> 16:01.760
 their claims to authority are effectively destroyed.

16:01.760 --> 16:02.980
 So let me push back on that.

16:02.980 --> 16:06.940
 What about fighting that with love,

16:06.940 --> 16:10.940
 with patience and kindness towards them?

16:10.940 --> 16:12.860
 I don't think kindness is,

16:12.860 --> 16:16.060
 I think that would be a mismatch and inappropriate.

16:16.060 --> 16:18.180
 There's Superman, there's Batman, okay?

16:18.180 --> 16:20.020
 And Superman's job is to help the good people

16:20.020 --> 16:22.120
 and Batman's job is to hurt the bad people.

16:22.120 --> 16:25.200
 And I will always be on the Batman side

16:25.200 --> 16:26.300
 than the Superman side.

16:27.340 --> 16:29.880
 Both work silly tight costumes.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.660
 One has pointy ears.

16:31.660 --> 16:33.460
 Both are ridiculous, so let's.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.220
 One's a billionaire who gets, he's swimming in trim.

16:36.220 --> 16:37.900
 Which one is a billionaire? Batman.

16:37.900 --> 16:42.900
 Okay, I'm undereducated on the superhero movies,

16:42.900 --> 16:44.420
 I apologize.

16:44.420 --> 16:48.260
 Okay, but you're just saying your predisposition

16:48.260 --> 16:50.540
 is to be on the Batman side,

16:50.540 --> 16:54.660
 is to fighting the bad guys.

16:54.660 --> 16:57.340
 Yeah, and it's what I'm good at.

16:57.340 --> 16:58.540
 That's what you're good at.

16:58.540 --> 17:02.500
 But just to play devil's advocate,

17:02.500 --> 17:04.580
 or actually, in this case, I am the devil

17:04.580 --> 17:06.380
 because it's what I usually do.

17:06.380 --> 17:08.460
 Well, I'm the devil, you're the angel's advocate.

17:08.460 --> 17:12.280
 Exactly, to be the angel advocate, yeah.

17:12.280 --> 17:15.180
 Is like, I feel like mockery

17:17.820 --> 17:20.380
 is a path towards escalation of conflict.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.100
 Yes, in many ways, yes.

17:22.100 --> 17:25.000
 So you're not, I mean,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.520
 it's kind of like guerrilla warfare.

17:28.520 --> 17:31.440
 I mean, you're not going to win.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.760
 I am winning, we're all winning.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.900
 We're winning on a daily.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.680
 This is my next book, we're winning.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.400
 We've won before, I'm not joking.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.040
 The topic of the next book.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.600
 Yes, it's the white pill.

17:40.600 --> 17:41.440
 The white pill.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.660
 Is that we're gonna, we are winning.

17:43.660 --> 17:46.300
 The most horrible people are being rendered

17:46.300 --> 17:49.080
 into laughing stocks on a daily basis on social media.

17:49.080 --> 17:49.920
 This is a glorious thing.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.120
 This is good, I so disagree with you.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.120
 I disagree with you because there's side effects

17:54.120 --> 17:55.940
 that are very destructive.

17:55.940 --> 17:57.520
 It feels like you're winning,

17:57.520 --> 18:00.360
 but we're completely destroying the possibility

18:00.360 --> 18:04.640
 of having like a cohesive society.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.720
 That's called oncology.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.840
 What's that mean?

18:07.840 --> 18:09.060
 Curing cancer.

18:09.060 --> 18:09.900
 No, I, yeah.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.880
 Your concept of a cohesive society is, in fact,

18:12.880 --> 18:15.720
 a society based on oppression

18:15.720 --> 18:20.120
 and not allowing individuals to live their personal freedom.

18:20.120 --> 18:22.520
 Oh, so you're a utopian view of the world.

18:22.520 --> 18:23.420
 You're the utopian.

18:23.420 --> 18:24.760
 You're saying cohesive society.

18:24.760 --> 18:25.820
 I'm saying I don't need that.

18:25.820 --> 18:27.620
 I'm saying there's gonna be conflict.

18:27.620 --> 18:29.120
 Right, there's gonna be conflict.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.320
 You and I are disagreeing right now.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.360
 That's not cohesive.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.600
 Doesn't mean we like each other less.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.520
 Doesn't mean we respect each other less.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.040
 Cohesive doesn't, it's just a euphemism

18:37.040 --> 18:39.960
 for like everyone submitting to what I want.

18:39.960 --> 18:43.720
 No, I mean, cohesive could be that.

18:43.720 --> 18:48.160
 It could be like enforced with violence,

18:48.160 --> 18:49.000
 all that kind of stuff,

18:49.000 --> 18:53.200
 sort of the libertarian view of the world,

18:53.200 --> 18:57.240
 but it could just be being respectful

18:57.240 --> 19:00.400
 and kind of each other and kind towards each other

19:00.400 --> 19:02.660
 and loving towards each other.

19:02.660 --> 19:04.620
 I mean, that's what I mean by cohesive.

19:04.620 --> 19:07.600
 So when people say free, it's funny.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.000
 Like freedom is a funny thing

19:10.000 --> 19:14.240
 because freedom could be painful to a lot of people.

19:15.940 --> 19:18.000
 It's all matters how you define it,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.280
 how you implement it, how it actually looks like.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.120
 Sure.

19:21.120 --> 19:26.120
 I'm just saying it feels like the mockery

19:26.880 --> 19:31.460
 of the powerful leads to further and further divisions.

19:31.460 --> 19:36.360
 It's like it's turning life into a game

19:36.360 --> 19:40.280
 to where it's always you're creating

19:40.280 --> 19:43.040
 these different little tribes and groups

19:43.040 --> 19:48.040
 and you're constantly fighting the groups

19:48.340 --> 19:50.280
 that become a little bit more powerful

19:50.280 --> 19:53.400
 by undercutting them through guerrilla warfare kind of thing.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.920
 And that's what the internet becomes

19:54.920 --> 19:56.760
 is everyone's just mocking each other

19:56.760 --> 19:59.240
 and then certain groups become more and more powerful

19:59.240 --> 20:01.840
 and then they start fighting each other

20:01.840 --> 20:05.600
 and they form groups of ideologies

20:05.600 --> 20:07.560
 and they start fighting each other in the internet

20:07.560 --> 20:11.280
 where the result is it doesn't feel like

20:12.440 --> 20:14.600
 the common humanities highlighted.

20:14.600 --> 20:19.360
 It doesn't feel like that's a path of progress.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.400
 Now, like when I say cohesive,

20:21.400 --> 20:25.840
 I don't mean like everybody has to be enforcing equality,

20:25.840 --> 20:27.240
 all those kinds of ideas.

20:27.240 --> 20:30.600
 I just mean like not being so divisive.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.440
 So it's going back to the original question of like,

20:34.440 --> 20:37.440
 how do we put more love out in the world than the internet?

20:37.440 --> 20:39.780
 I want divisiveness.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.120
 Oh, you see, you think divisiveness is that?

20:41.120 --> 20:41.960
 That's the goal.

20:41.960 --> 20:42.780
 That's very interesting.

20:42.780 --> 20:43.620
 It's the goal.

20:43.620 --> 20:44.920
 So you started this conversation

20:44.920 --> 20:46.100
 where you're talking about you have love

20:46.100 --> 20:47.440
 for that small group.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.240
 I think we both would agree to have a bigger group

20:50.240 --> 20:51.080
 would be better,

20:51.080 --> 20:53.560
 especially if that love comes from a sincere place.

20:53.560 --> 20:56.400
 I think our country,

20:56.400 --> 20:57.680
 I wrote an article about this four years ago

20:57.680 --> 21:00.900
 that it's time to disunite the states and to secede.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.280
 This country has been held together

21:02.280 --> 21:04.160
 with at least two separate cultures

21:04.160 --> 21:06.800
 with dumb text and string for over 20 years.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.800
 There's an enormous amount of contempt

21:08.800 --> 21:10.800
 from one group toward another.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.880
 This contempt comes from a sincere place.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.900
 They do not share each other's values.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.680
 There's absolutely no reason,

21:16.680 --> 21:18.360
 just like any unhealthy relationship

21:18.360 --> 21:19.640
 where you can't say, you know what?

21:19.640 --> 21:20.960
 It's not working out.

21:20.960 --> 21:24.400
 I want to go my own way and live my happiness.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.440
 And I genuinely want you to go your way,

21:26.440 --> 21:27.360
 live your happiness.

21:27.360 --> 21:28.800
 If I'm wrong, prove me wrong.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.860
 I'll learn from you and take lessons and vice versa.

21:31.860 --> 21:33.320
 But the fact that we all have to be

21:33.320 --> 21:35.680
 in the same house together is not coherent.

21:35.680 --> 21:36.500
 And that's not love.

21:36.500 --> 21:40.700
 That is the path towards friction and tension and conflict.

21:40.700 --> 21:43.960
 Do you think there's concrete groups?

21:43.960 --> 21:47.040
 Like is it as simple as the two groups of blue and red?

21:47.040 --> 21:49.920
 No, it's also very fluid

21:49.920 --> 21:53.560
 because you and I are allied as Jewish people,

21:53.560 --> 21:57.040
 as Russians, as males, as podcasters.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.560
 You're an academic, I'm not.

21:58.560 --> 22:02.800
 So we're different, but we each are a Venn diagram,

22:02.800 --> 22:04.440
 even within ourselves.

22:04.440 --> 22:07.000
 And I can talk to you about politics

22:07.000 --> 22:08.640
 and then we can talk about Russia stuff.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.840
 And then you could talk about your work,

22:10.840 --> 22:12.100
 which I don't know anything about.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.400
 So that'd be where you're way up here and a way down here.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.280
 So there's lots, every relationship

22:16.280 --> 22:18.920
 with just between individuals, it's very dynamic.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.640
 So how do we succeed?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.640
 Like how do we form individual states

22:22.640 --> 22:25.900
 where there's a little bit more cohesion?

22:25.900 --> 22:27.720
 Sure, and voluntary cohesion.

22:27.720 --> 22:31.600
 So the first step is to eliminate

22:31.600 --> 22:35.360
 and the concept of political authority as legitimate

22:35.360 --> 22:38.200
 and to denigrate and humiliate those

22:38.200 --> 22:40.800
 who would put themselves in a position

22:40.800 --> 22:44.200
 in which they are there to tell you how to live your life

22:44.200 --> 22:46.600
 from any semblance of validity.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.440
 And that's starting to happen.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.680
 If you look at what they had with the lockdowns,

22:50.680 --> 22:52.320
 Cuomo and de Blasio, New York,

22:53.320 --> 22:56.000
 I was tired a couple of weeks ago.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.440
 And I said to my friend, oh, just click, maybe I have COVID.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.640
 And he goes, it's not possible, like what do you mean?

23:00.640 --> 23:04.780
 And he goes, we haven't had any deaths in like two months.

23:04.780 --> 23:08.080
 And there's only like 100 cases a day for like two months.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.300
 And I go, you're exaggerating

23:09.300 --> 23:11.040
 because everything was still closed.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.900
 And I looked at the numbers and he wasn't exaggerating.

23:13.900 --> 23:16.880
 And there's no greater American dream to me

23:16.880 --> 23:19.920
 than an immigrant family comes to the states,

23:19.920 --> 23:21.820
 forms their own little business.

23:21.820 --> 23:23.420
 Maybe mom's a good cook, it's a restaurant,

23:23.420 --> 23:25.260
 dry cleaner, fruit stand.

23:25.260 --> 23:27.980
 And those people aren't gonna have a lot of money.

23:27.980 --> 23:30.320
 Those are the first ones who lost their companies

23:30.320 --> 23:32.360
 because of these lockdowns.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.160
 Cuomo, who's the governor of New York,

23:35.160 --> 23:38.080
 opened up the gyms, he said, you're clear to open up.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.340
 De Blasio said, and we don't have enough inspectors,

23:40.340 --> 23:43.080
 you're gonna have to wait another couple of weeks.

23:43.080 --> 23:45.880
 To regard that as anything other than literally criminal

23:45.880 --> 23:49.460
 is something that I am having a hard and harder time

23:49.460 --> 23:51.120
 wrapping my head around.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.600
 You said, I mean, that's something

23:52.600 --> 23:54.280
 I'm deeply worried about as well,

23:54.280 --> 23:58.380
 which is like thousands, it's actually millions

23:58.380 --> 24:01.280
 of dreams being crushed, that American dream

24:01.280 --> 24:03.720
 of starting a business, of running a business.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.240
 What about all the young people who you and I

24:06.240 --> 24:10.080
 have in our audiences who are socially isolated at best,

24:10.080 --> 24:11.960
 and now they can't leave their homes?

24:12.840 --> 24:15.100
 Isolation and ostracism are things

24:15.100 --> 24:17.240
 that are very well studied in psychology.

24:17.240 --> 24:19.320
 These have extreme consequences.

24:19.320 --> 24:22.640
 I read a book called Ostracism, and this wasn't scientific,

24:22.640 --> 24:24.400
 but basically the author was a psychiatrist,

24:24.400 --> 24:26.880
 psychologist, whatever, and he had one of his colleagues,

24:26.880 --> 24:29.080
 they did an experiment, let's for a week,

24:29.080 --> 24:30.600
 you ostracize me completely.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.040
 We know it's an, and he goes, even knowing

24:33.040 --> 24:34.680
 it's the experiment, the fact that he wouldn't

24:34.680 --> 24:37.040
 make eye contact with me and the fact that he ignored me

24:37.040 --> 24:40.880
 had an extreme emotional impact on me,

24:40.880 --> 24:44.020
 knowing full well this is purely for experimental purposes.

24:44.020 --> 24:46.360
 Now you multiply that by all these, the suicide,

24:46.360 --> 24:48.000
 the number of kids who were thinking about suicide

24:48.000 --> 24:50.160
 was through the roof during all this.

24:50.160 --> 24:53.300
 And my point is, until these people,

24:53.300 --> 24:55.800
 it's gonna, I would predict like 2024,

24:55.800 --> 24:57.840
 that's where we're gonna have to start having conversations

24:57.840 --> 25:00.140
 about what personal consequences have to be done

25:00.140 --> 25:01.720
 for these people, because until then,

25:01.720 --> 25:03.400
 they're gonna do the same thing.

25:03.400 --> 25:06.120
 So you think there's going to be society wide consequences

25:06.120 --> 25:08.800
 of this that we're gonna see, like ripple effects,

25:08.800 --> 25:10.440
 because of the social isolation?

25:10.440 --> 25:13.280
 I know, I mean, we also need to talk about consequences

25:13.280 --> 25:16.440
 for Cuomo and de Blasio, because if politicians

25:16.440 --> 25:18.820
 respond to incentives, and the incentives are there

25:18.820 --> 25:20.800
 for them to be extremely conservative,

25:20.800 --> 25:22.560
 because if you have to choose, as Cuomo said

25:22.560 --> 25:25.160
 in a press conference, between a thousand people dying

25:25.160 --> 25:26.480
 and a thousand people losing their business,

25:26.480 --> 25:28.360
 it's not a hard choice, and he's right.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.860
 But at a certain point, it's like, all right,

25:30.860 --> 25:35.120
 you're losing both, you're making these decisions

25:35.120 --> 25:36.900
 and not having consequences for it,

25:36.900 --> 25:38.740
 and you're gonna do it again the next time,

25:38.740 --> 25:41.200
 so we need to make sure you're a little scared.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.880
 And I don't know what that would mean.

25:42.880 --> 25:47.880
 But you're laying this problem, this incompetence.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.080
 I don't think it's incompetence,

25:50.080 --> 25:51.720
 I think it's very competent.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.600
 I think their job is to be able, yes.

25:54.600 --> 25:59.000
 But you're laying it not at the hands of the individuals,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.400
 but the structure of government.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.360
 It's both, yes.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.760
 How would we deal with it better

26:05.760 --> 26:07.980
 without centralized control?

26:07.980 --> 26:09.440
 Well, we didn't really have centralized control,

26:09.440 --> 26:11.160
 because every country and every state

26:11.160 --> 26:12.840
 handled it in a different mechanism.

26:12.840 --> 26:16.240
 But a city has centralized control, right?

26:16.240 --> 26:17.080
 No, that's not true.

26:17.080 --> 26:19.400
 So Cuomo and de Blasio, they had a lot of disagreements

26:19.400 --> 26:21.200
 over this over the months, and this was actually

26:21.200 --> 26:23.520
 a source of great interest and tension.

26:23.520 --> 26:26.160
 De Blasio wanted, at one point, was talking about

26:26.160 --> 26:27.840
 quarantining people in their homes.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.920
 Cuomo was like, you're crazy.

26:29.920 --> 26:33.040
 Same thing with the schools, same thing with the gyms,

26:33.040 --> 26:35.840
 and there were other such examples.

26:35.840 --> 26:38.240
 But the point being, this was an emergency.

26:38.240 --> 26:41.920
 World War I, I talked about this on Tim Poole's show,

26:41.920 --> 26:45.680
 was very dangerous, because it gave a lot of evil people

26:45.680 --> 26:48.160
 some very useful information about what the country

26:48.160 --> 26:51.160
 put up with and what they can get away with under wartime.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.680
 And this set the model for things like the New Deal

26:53.680 --> 26:55.880
 and the other things of that nature.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.480
 It is undeniable, you're a scientist,

26:57.480 --> 27:00.240
 so you understand this perfectly well,

27:00.240 --> 27:04.080
 that this lockdown gave some very nefarious people

27:04.080 --> 27:07.440
 some very valid data about how much people

27:07.440 --> 27:11.600
 were put up with under pressures from the state.

27:13.320 --> 27:16.120
 So fundamentally, what is the problem with the state?

27:16.120 --> 27:17.240
 Its existence.

27:17.240 --> 27:22.240
 Okay, well, but to play angel's advocate again,

27:22.240 --> 27:25.120
 angel's advocate again, you know,

27:25.120 --> 27:28.200
 government is the people.

27:28.200 --> 27:31.880
 Come on, do you really think this?

27:31.880 --> 27:35.560
 As best I think as possible to have representation.

27:35.560 --> 27:37.200
 Can you imagine if you have an attorney?

27:37.200 --> 27:38.760
 You're like, oh, you can't have the attorney you want.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.240
 You're gonna have this guy who you absolutely hate

27:40.240 --> 27:42.320
 who you share no values with, why?

27:42.320 --> 27:45.280
 Because he drives, I mean, leaders, political leaders,

27:45.280 --> 27:48.240
 and political representation drive the discourse.

27:48.240 --> 27:53.000
 Like the majority of people voted for him or whatever,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.040
 however you define that.

27:55.040 --> 27:58.560
 And now we get to have a discussion,

27:58.560 --> 28:01.120
 well, was this the right choice?

28:01.120 --> 28:02.720
 And then we get to make that choice again

28:02.720 --> 28:04.080
 in four years and so on.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.640
 First of all, the fact that I have to be under the thumb

28:06.640 --> 28:09.160
 of somebody for four years makes no sense.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.680
 There's no other relationship that's like this,

28:10.680 --> 28:12.200
 including a marriage.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.440
 You can leave any other relationship at any time,

28:14.440 --> 28:15.320
 number one.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.160
 Number two is.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.480
 You could always impeach.

28:17.480 --> 28:18.320
 Well, they did that.

28:18.320 --> 28:22.520
 Part of it I'm just saying that the mechanisms

28:22.520 --> 28:24.400
 are flawed in many ways, yeah.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.960
 Yeah, right, and so that's number one.

28:26.960 --> 28:29.720
 Number two is it doesn't make sense

28:29.720 --> 28:32.880
 that if I don't want someone to represent me

28:32.880 --> 28:35.240
 that because that person is popular

28:35.240 --> 28:36.600
 that they are now in a position to.

28:36.600 --> 28:40.600
 So having representation and having citizenship

28:40.600 --> 28:44.320
 based on geography is a prelandline technology

28:44.320 --> 28:45.840
 in a post cell phone world.

28:45.840 --> 28:48.080
 There's no reason why I have to,

28:48.080 --> 28:50.760
 just because we're physically in between two oceans,

28:50.760 --> 28:52.960
 we all have to be represented by the same people,

28:52.960 --> 28:55.500
 whereas I can very easily have my security

28:55.500 --> 28:57.480
 be under someone and switch it as easily

28:57.480 --> 28:58.720
 as cell phone providers.

28:58.720 --> 29:01.080
 So, okay, but it doesn't have to be geographical.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.600
 It can be ideas.

29:02.600 --> 29:03.440
 Sure.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.280
 I mean, this country represents a certain set of ideas.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.120
 Yes, it does.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.680
 It started out geographically.

29:07.680 --> 29:08.520
 It still is geographic.

29:08.520 --> 29:09.360
 It was both.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.200
 It started off as ideas as well.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.520
 But like, it was intricately.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.640
 I mean, that's the way humans are.

29:14.640 --> 29:17.120
 I mean, there was no internet.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.760
 So it was, you were geographically in the same location

29:19.760 --> 29:21.160
 and you signed a bunch of documents

29:21.160 --> 29:22.520
 and then you kind of debated

29:22.520 --> 29:24.500
 and you wrote a bunch of stuff

29:24.500 --> 29:26.480
 and then you agreed on it.

29:26.480 --> 29:27.320
 Okay.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.480
 You understand that no one signed these documents

29:29.480 --> 29:30.680
 and no one agreed to it.

29:30.680 --> 29:33.760
 As Lysander Spooner pointed out over 150 years ago,

29:33.760 --> 29:36.760
 the constitution or the social contract, if anything,

29:36.760 --> 29:38.940
 is only binding to the signatories.

29:38.940 --> 29:41.440
 And even then they're all long dead.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.700
 So it's this fallacy that somehow,

29:43.700 --> 29:45.880
 because I'm in a physical place,

29:45.880 --> 29:48.500
 I've agreed, even though I'm screaming through your face

29:48.500 --> 29:49.560
 that I don't agree,

29:49.560 --> 29:54.440
 to be subordinate to some imaginary, invisible monster

29:54.440 --> 29:56.280
 that was created 250 years ago.

29:56.280 --> 29:57.960
 And this idea of like, if you don't like it,

29:57.960 --> 29:58.800
 you have to move.

29:58.800 --> 29:59.920
 That's not what freedom means.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.080
 Freedom means I do what I want, not what you want.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.520
 So if you don't like it, you move.

30:04.520 --> 30:08.280
 Okay, just to put some, I don't like words and terms.

30:08.280 --> 30:09.680
 One, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, one.

30:09.680 --> 30:10.520
 Yeah, exactly.

30:10.520 --> 30:11.600
 Is that what your language is?

30:11.600 --> 30:14.520
 It is, I'm translating it all in real time.

30:14.520 --> 30:18.120
 But would you call the kind of ideas

30:18.120 --> 30:19.960
 that you're advocating for

30:19.960 --> 30:21.560
 and we're talking about anarchy?

30:21.560 --> 30:23.300
 Yes, anarchism, yes.

30:23.300 --> 30:24.560
 Okay, so let's get into it.

30:24.560 --> 30:29.560
 Can you try to paint the utopia

30:29.640 --> 30:33.600
 that an anarchist worldview dreams about?

30:33.600 --> 30:36.240
 The only people who describe anarchism as utopia

30:36.240 --> 30:37.520
 are its critics.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.620
 If I told you right now,

30:39.620 --> 30:41.240
 and I wish I could say this factually,

30:41.240 --> 30:42.880
 that I have a cure for cancer,

30:42.880 --> 30:45.200
 that would not make us a utopia.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.280
 That would still probably be expensive.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.000
 We would still have many other diseases.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.880
 However, we would be fundamentally healthier,

30:51.880 --> 30:55.000
 happier and better off, all of us.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.080
 Than democracy.

30:56.080 --> 30:58.680
 So, sorry, I jumped back from the cancer.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.640
 No, than democracy or government.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.640
 So it's only curing one major,

31:03.640 --> 31:05.560
 major life threatening problem,

31:05.560 --> 31:08.120
 but in no sense is it a utopia.

31:08.120 --> 31:12.120
 So what, can we try to answer this question,

31:12.120 --> 31:13.640
 same question many times,

31:13.640 --> 31:17.640
 which is what exactly is the problem with democracy?

31:17.640 --> 31:19.960
 The problem with democracy is that those who need leaders

31:19.960 --> 31:21.560
 are not qualified to choose them.

31:22.640 --> 31:27.640
 Those who need leaders are not qualified to choose them.

31:28.160 --> 31:29.080
 So.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.560
 That's the central problem with democracy.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.400
 Not all of us need leaders.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.240
 Right.

31:33.240 --> 31:38.240
 So, what does it mean to need a leader?

31:38.600 --> 31:41.360
 Are you saying like people who are actually

31:41.360 --> 31:44.240
 like free thinkers don't need leaders kind of thing?

31:44.240 --> 31:45.480
 Sure.

31:45.480 --> 31:46.520
 That's a good way of working.

31:46.520 --> 31:47.880
 But like, you don't, okay.

31:47.880 --> 31:51.920
 So do you acknowledge that there's some value

31:51.920 --> 31:56.000
 in authority in different subjects?

31:56.000 --> 31:57.880
 So what that means is,

31:57.880 --> 32:00.080
 I don't mean authority, somebody who's in control of you,

32:00.080 --> 32:00.920
 but.

32:00.920 --> 32:04.120
 But you're doing the definition switch.

32:04.120 --> 32:04.960
 Because.

32:04.960 --> 32:05.800
 I am, I am.

32:05.800 --> 32:06.640
 You're right, you're right.

32:06.640 --> 32:07.480
 It's unfair.

32:07.480 --> 32:08.320
 Okay, that was bad.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.160
 But that's what they do.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.040
 That's their trick.

32:10.040 --> 32:10.880
 Yeah.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.240
 And this is one of the useful things,

32:12.240 --> 32:14.080
 by the way, that's this total sidebar.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.480
 If people ask me for advice,

32:15.480 --> 32:17.000
 I always tell them if you're gonna raise your kids,

32:17.000 --> 32:18.680
 raise them bilingual.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.800
 Because I was trilingual by the time I was six

32:20.800 --> 32:23.080
 and that teaches you to think in concepts.

32:23.080 --> 32:24.680
 Whereas if you only know one language,

32:24.680 --> 32:26.120
 you fall for things like this,

32:26.120 --> 32:28.560
 because using authority in the sense of a policeman

32:28.560 --> 32:30.480
 and someone has authority in physics,

32:30.480 --> 32:31.560
 it's the same word.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.520
 Conceptually, they're extremely different.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.480
 But if you're only thinking in one language,

32:35.480 --> 32:37.680
 your brain is going to equate the two.

32:37.680 --> 32:38.960
 And that's a trap that people

32:38.960 --> 32:40.240
 who only speak one language have.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.080
 For sure.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.800
 But even if you know multiple languages,

32:42.800 --> 32:44.520
 you can still use the trick of using

32:44.520 --> 32:45.680
 the worst of your convenience.

32:45.680 --> 32:46.520
 Yeah, absolutely.

32:46.520 --> 32:48.080
 To manipulate the conversation.

32:48.080 --> 32:49.320
 But you weren't trying to do that,

32:49.320 --> 32:50.240
 but you fell into that.

32:50.240 --> 32:51.240
 I accidentally did it.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.080
 Yeah, you're right.

32:52.080 --> 32:53.960
 We all tend to do that if you only speak one language

32:53.960 --> 32:55.000
 and think in one language.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.600
 But if, I guess let me rephrase it.

32:57.600 --> 33:02.360
 Are you against, do you acknowledge the value

33:02.360 --> 33:07.040
 of offloading your own effort

33:07.040 --> 33:09.280
 about a particular thing to somebody else?

33:09.280 --> 33:10.120
 Absolutely.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.880
 Like an accountant, a lawyer, a doctor,

33:12.880 --> 33:15.080
 absolute, a chef, infinite.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.560
 Isn't that ultimately what a democracy is?

33:18.560 --> 33:19.400
 No.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.600
 Broadly defined, like you're basically electing

33:21.600 --> 33:22.920
 a bunch of authorities.

33:22.920 --> 33:25.080
 Using the word you in two senses.

33:25.080 --> 33:26.840
 Using the word you meaning me as an individual,

33:26.840 --> 33:28.200
 not using you as a mass.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.520
 Yeah, as a mass, not you as an individual.

33:31.520 --> 33:34.240
 Right, so I would absolutely want someone

33:34.240 --> 33:35.680
 to provide for my security.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.160
 I would absolutely want someone to negotiate with me

33:38.160 --> 33:39.840
 for foreign power or something like that.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.440
 That does not mean it has to be predicated

33:42.440 --> 33:44.680
 and what lots of other people who I do not know

33:44.680 --> 33:47.280
 and if I do know them, probably would not respect,

33:47.280 --> 33:48.160
 think about.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.680
 It's of no moral relevance to me.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.760
 Nor I to them.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.240
 So do you think this kind of,

33:54.240 --> 33:57.840
 there could be a bunch of humans that behave

33:57.840 --> 34:01.440
 kind of like ants in a distributed way.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.880
 There could be an emergent behavior in them

34:04.880 --> 34:06.960
 that results in a stable society.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.040
 Like isn't that the hope with anarchy

34:09.040 --> 34:12.240
 is like without an overarching.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.600
 But ants, I mean ants are the worst example here

34:15.600 --> 34:17.720
 because ants have a very firm authority.

34:17.720 --> 34:18.560
 The queen?

34:18.560 --> 34:20.560
 Yeah, and they're all drones.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.360
 They're all clones of each other.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.880
 Yeah, but so if you forget the queen,

34:24.880 --> 34:26.400
 their behavior, they're all,

34:27.600 --> 34:28.960
 well from your perspective,

34:28.960 --> 34:30.760
 from your human intelligent perspective,

34:30.760 --> 34:31.800
 but from their perspective,

34:31.800 --> 34:33.920
 they probably see each other as a bunch of individuals.

34:33.920 --> 34:34.760
 No they don't.

34:34.760 --> 34:36.800
 Ants are very big on altruism

34:36.800 --> 34:38.400
 in the sense of self sacrifice.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.440
 They do not think the individual matters.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.800
 They routinely kill themselves

34:44.800 --> 34:46.840
 for the sake of the hive in the community.

34:46.840 --> 34:49.280
 But they, see that's from the outside perspective,

34:49.280 --> 34:51.560
 from the individual perspective of the individual,

34:51.560 --> 34:56.560
 they probably, they don't see it as altruism.

34:57.600 --> 35:00.360
 Right, but they view and they're right

35:00.360 --> 35:02.760
 because the ants life is very ephemeral and cheap,

35:02.760 --> 35:06.240
 that it's more important to continue this mass population

35:06.240 --> 35:08.720
 that one individual ant live.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.600
 Like bees are another even better example.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.040
 The honeybee, when they sting,

35:12.040 --> 35:13.720
 they only sting once and they die.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.440
 And they do it gladly because it's like,

35:15.440 --> 35:18.160
 okay, this community is much more important than me

35:18.160 --> 35:19.840
 and they're right.

35:19.840 --> 35:22.280
 Yeah, okay, so fine, let's forget.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.440
 I'm being pedantic, but it's important, I think.

35:24.440 --> 35:25.440
 I'm not just being pedantic

35:25.440 --> 35:26.480
 for the sake of being pedantic.

35:26.480 --> 35:29.360
 But there's something beautiful that I won't argue about

35:29.360 --> 35:31.920
 because I do, there's an interesting point there

35:31.920 --> 35:33.400
 about individualism of ants.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.160
 I do think they're more individual.

35:35.160 --> 35:40.160
 But let's give your view of ants that they're communists.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.680
 Okay, let's go with the communist view of ants.

35:42.680 --> 35:43.520
 Okay, yeah.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.880
 But they're still a beautiful emergent thing,

35:46.880 --> 35:51.320
 which is like they can function as a society

35:51.320 --> 35:56.320
 and without, I would say, centralized control.

35:57.800 --> 35:58.640
 Yeah, I agree with you.

35:58.640 --> 35:59.480
 It's another argument.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.040
 So is that the hope for anarchy?

36:01.040 --> 36:03.200
 It's like you just throw a bunch of people

36:03.200 --> 36:05.520
 that voluntarily wanna be in the same place

36:05.520 --> 36:06.880
 under the same set of ideas

36:06.880 --> 36:10.400
 and they kind of, like the doctors emerge,

36:10.400 --> 36:12.600
 the police officers emerge,

36:12.600 --> 36:15.160
 the different necessary structures

36:15.160 --> 36:17.000
 of a functional society emerge.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.640
 Do you know what the most beautiful example of anarchism is

36:20.640 --> 36:22.520
 that is just beyond beautiful

36:22.520 --> 36:23.360
 when you stop to think about it?

36:23.360 --> 36:24.240
 I'll see Twitter.

36:24.240 --> 36:25.400
 I'm not being tongue in cheek.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.240
 Okay.

36:26.240 --> 36:27.080
 Language.

36:28.040 --> 36:29.720
 There's infinite languages.

36:29.720 --> 36:33.040
 Language, the things that language can be used for

36:33.040 --> 36:36.240
 are bring tears to people's eyes quite literally.

36:36.240 --> 36:38.960
 It's also used for basic things.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.200
 No one is forcing us.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.640
 We speak two languages each at least.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.440
 No one's forcing us to use English.

36:44.440 --> 36:47.800
 No one's forcing us to use this dialect of English.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.920
 It's a way, and despite there being

36:50.920 --> 36:54.760
 so many different languages, lingua franca emerge,

36:54.760 --> 36:56.600
 the language that everyone is, Latin.

36:56.600 --> 36:59.080
 Even in North Korea, they refer to the fish

36:59.080 --> 37:02.600
 and the different animals by the Latin scientific note.

37:02.600 --> 37:03.800
 No one decided this.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.240
 Sure, there's an organization

37:05.240 --> 37:07.280
 that sets a binomial nomenclature,

37:07.280 --> 37:08.920
 but there's no gun to anyone's head

37:08.920 --> 37:13.480
 referring to a sea moth as a Pegasus species.

37:13.480 --> 37:16.880
 And when you think about how amazing language is,

37:16.880 --> 37:18.840
 and in some other context would say like,

37:18.840 --> 37:21.320
 well, you need to have a world government

37:21.320 --> 37:23.240
 and they're deciding which is the verbs

37:23.240 --> 37:25.120
 and you have to have an official definition

37:25.120 --> 37:26.720
 and an official dictionary.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.120
 And none of that's happened.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.520
 And I think anyone, even if they don't agree

37:30.520 --> 37:32.840
 with my politics or my worldview,

37:32.840 --> 37:35.800
 cannot deny that the creation of language

37:35.800 --> 37:39.080
 is one of humanity's most miraculous,

37:39.080 --> 37:40.760
 beautiful achievements.

37:40.760 --> 37:41.600
 Absolutely.

37:41.600 --> 37:42.440
 So there you go.

37:42.440 --> 37:45.960
 There's one system where a kind of anarchy

37:45.960 --> 37:49.560
 can result in beauty, stability,

37:49.560 --> 37:50.920
 like sufficient stability,

37:50.920 --> 37:55.680
 and yet, flexibility to adjust it and so on.

37:55.680 --> 37:57.680
 And the internet helps it.

37:57.680 --> 38:00.440
 You get something like Urban Dictionary,

38:00.440 --> 38:05.120
 which starts creating absurd, both humor and wit.

38:05.120 --> 38:07.360
 But also language and syntax and jargon,

38:07.360 --> 38:09.240
 immediately you size people up.

38:09.240 --> 38:12.080
 If you say vertebral, I know you're a doctor,

38:12.080 --> 38:15.080
 because that's how they pronounce it, the spinal column.

38:15.080 --> 38:17.200
 I'm sure in your field, there's certain jargon

38:17.200 --> 38:18.840
 and right away you can know if this person's one of us

38:18.840 --> 38:19.680
 or not.

38:19.680 --> 38:20.840
 I mean, it's infinite.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.280
 I mean, I don't need to tell you.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.480
 It's emojis too.

38:23.480 --> 38:25.640
 Yes, there's so much there to study with language.

38:25.640 --> 38:26.480
 It's fascinating.

38:26.480 --> 38:30.320
 But do you think this applies to human life?

38:30.320 --> 38:32.160
 The meat space, the physical space?

38:32.160 --> 38:33.000
 Yes.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.480
 So that kind of beauty can emerge

38:35.480 --> 38:40.040
 without writing stuff on paper, without laws.

38:40.040 --> 38:40.880
 You could have rules.

38:40.880 --> 38:43.280
 You don't need, they don't have to be laws.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.120
 So.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.680
 Enforced by violence.

38:45.680 --> 38:48.160
 Like that's what, what's a law?

38:48.160 --> 38:50.160
 A law is something that is unchosen.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.000
 A rule is something.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.920
 If I go to my pool, you know,

38:52.920 --> 38:55.000
 I sign up to be a member of pool,

38:55.000 --> 38:56.400
 on the wall there's certain things.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.000
 It's like, you know, certain number of people in the pool.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.080
 No peeing in here.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.000
 Good luck enforcing that one.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.080
 And so on and so forth.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.080
 Well, that's the problem.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.920
 Aren't you afraid that people are gonna pee in the pool?

39:06.920 --> 39:10.920
 That's not as my big concern as mass incarceration,

39:10.920 --> 39:13.240
 as the fact that the police can steal more money

39:13.240 --> 39:14.480
 than burglars can.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.560
 The fact that innocent people can be killed

39:16.560 --> 39:18.240
 with no consequences.

39:18.240 --> 39:20.320
 The fact that war can be waged

39:20.320 --> 39:24.640
 and with no consequences for those who waged it.

39:24.640 --> 39:27.000
 The fact that so many men and women are being murdered

39:27.000 --> 39:28.360
 overseas and here,

39:28.360 --> 39:31.120
 and the people who are guiding these are regarded as heroic.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.040
 So you think there might,

39:32.040 --> 39:34.480
 that in an anarchist system,

39:34.480 --> 39:38.600
 there's a possibility of having less wars

39:38.600 --> 39:41.240
 and less, what would you say, corruption

39:42.400 --> 39:44.680
 and less abuse of power?

39:44.680 --> 39:45.640
 Let's talk, yes.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.080
 And let's talk about corruption

39:47.080 --> 39:49.880
 because, and I made this point on Rogan,

39:49.880 --> 39:51.960
 you and I, again, the Russian background,

39:51.960 --> 39:55.160
 we realize that when it comes to corruption,

39:55.160 --> 39:56.880
 American is very naive.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.960
 Corruption they think is, oh, I got my brother a job

39:58.960 --> 40:01.000
 and he's getting money on the table.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.160
 That's not, when we're talking about like state corruption,

40:04.160 --> 40:06.040
 things that are done in totalitarian states

40:06.040 --> 40:07.280
 and even to some extent in America,

40:07.280 --> 40:09.200
 like Jeffrey Epstein, Jillian Maxwell,

40:09.200 --> 40:11.640
 things that Stalin did, things that Hitler did.

40:11.640 --> 40:14.160
 When the CIA was torturing people at Gitmo,

40:14.160 --> 40:16.320
 they had to borrow KGB manuals

40:16.320 --> 40:17.720
 because they didn't know how to torture correctly

40:17.720 --> 40:20.040
 because they never thought of these things.

40:20.040 --> 40:23.320
 It's very hard for us to get into the mindset

40:23.320 --> 40:25.720
 of someone who's like a child predator,

40:25.720 --> 40:27.840
 someone who, let me give you an example

40:27.840 --> 40:28.800
 from my forthcoming book.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.840
 There was a guy who was the head of Ukraine in the 30s,

40:31.840 --> 40:33.200
 I forget his name.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.840
 Now these old Soviets, they were tough.

40:34.840 --> 40:36.840
 I mean, they pride, Stalin means steel.

40:36.840 --> 40:39.160
 They pride themselves and their cruelty

40:39.160 --> 40:40.720
 and how strong they were.

40:40.720 --> 40:42.080
 And this was the purge.

40:42.080 --> 40:44.840
 Stalin is trying to, killing lots of people left and right

40:44.840 --> 40:48.320
 and his henchman, Beria had the quote,

40:48.320 --> 40:50.400
 find me the man and I'll find you the crime.

40:50.400 --> 40:52.840
 They would accuse someone and they would torture him

40:52.840 --> 40:54.640
 until he talked and confessed

40:54.640 --> 40:56.480
 and then he had to turn people in.

40:56.480 --> 40:59.200
 And they took this guy in like beginning of the year,

40:59.200 --> 41:01.480
 I think it's 36, 38, he was head of Ukraine.

41:01.480 --> 41:02.960
 By May, he's arrested.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.680
 And they take him to the Ljubljanka, the basement

41:04.680 --> 41:06.640
 in the red square where they're torturing people.

41:06.640 --> 41:08.440
 And they did the works on him.

41:08.440 --> 41:11.120
 And he was a good Soviet and he stood up.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.400
 Who knows what they did to him?

41:12.400 --> 41:13.560
 He didn't talk.

41:13.560 --> 41:16.280
 So they said, okay, one moment.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.200
 They brought his teenage daughter in,

41:18.200 --> 41:20.680
 raped her in front of him, he talked.

41:20.680 --> 41:23.180
 So when we talk about corruption,

41:24.280 --> 41:26.920
 we would never in a million years think of this.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.440
 That's not how our minds work.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.960
 So when you're talking about states

41:31.960 --> 41:35.760
 and people where you don't have ease of exit,

41:35.760 --> 41:38.600
 where you are forced to be under the auspices

41:38.600 --> 41:41.480
 of an organization creating a monopoly,

41:41.480 --> 41:44.440
 that leads to in extreme cases,

41:44.440 --> 41:49.040
 but in not as extreme cases, really nefarious outcomes.

41:49.040 --> 41:53.000
 Whereas if you have the option to leave

41:53.000 --> 41:54.880
 as a client or customer,

41:54.880 --> 41:58.040
 that would have a strongly limiting effect

41:58.040 --> 42:01.440
 on how a business and what it can get away with.

42:01.440 --> 42:03.200
 But don't you think maybe,

42:03.200 --> 42:04.640
 I don't know who the right example is,

42:04.640 --> 42:05.720
 whether it's Stalin,

42:05.720 --> 42:08.840
 I think Hitler might be the better example of,

42:08.840 --> 42:12.720
 don't you think, or Jeffrey Epstein perhaps,

42:12.720 --> 42:15.280
 don't you think people who are evil

42:15.280 --> 42:20.280
 will find ways to manipulate human nature

42:20.640 --> 42:23.720
 to attain power, no matter the system?

42:23.720 --> 42:24.560
 Yes.

42:24.560 --> 42:27.920
 And like the corollary question is,

42:27.920 --> 42:31.800
 do you think those people can get more power

42:31.800 --> 42:36.800
 in a democracy, when there's a government already in place?

42:37.920 --> 42:39.800
 It's easily they get more power, more dangerous

42:39.800 --> 42:40.760
 to have a government in place.

42:40.760 --> 42:43.040
 First of all, sociopaths don't know for their charm

42:43.040 --> 42:44.720
 and for their warmth.

42:44.720 --> 42:46.180
 Here's the two situations.

42:47.120 --> 42:51.000
 In a free society, I'm a sociopath, I'm an evil person,

42:51.000 --> 42:52.160
 I'm the head of Macy's.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.640
 In a state society, I'm an evil person, I'm a sociopath,

42:55.640 --> 42:57.320
 I'm the head of the US government.

42:57.320 --> 42:59.240
 Which of these are you more concerned with?

42:59.240 --> 43:00.560
 It's like night and day.

43:00.560 --> 43:03.320
 So you would have far more decentralized military,

43:03.320 --> 43:08.320
 you would have far more decentralized security forces,

43:08.460 --> 43:10.120
 and they would be much more subject

43:10.120 --> 43:11.760
 to feedback from the market.

43:11.760 --> 43:14.800
 If you have an issue with Macy's

43:14.800 --> 43:18.320
 or any store with a sweater, look at that transaction.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.880
 If you have an issue with the state,

43:20.880 --> 43:22.880
 hiring a lawyer costs more than a surgeon.

43:22.880 --> 43:25.640
 To even access the mechanism for dispute

43:25.640 --> 43:27.740
 is going to be exorbitant and price poor people

43:27.740 --> 43:30.980
 out of the market for conflict resolution immediately.

43:30.980 --> 43:32.240
 So right away, you have something

43:32.240 --> 43:34.640
 that's extremely regressive.

43:34.640 --> 43:37.520
 And even though this is touted as some great equalizer,

43:37.520 --> 43:38.780
 it's quite the opposite.

43:38.780 --> 43:41.140
 So in current society, there's deep suspicion

43:41.140 --> 43:43.260
 of governments and states.

43:43.260 --> 43:44.800
 Not really.

43:44.800 --> 43:46.640
 Like just your example of Macy's,

43:46.640 --> 43:49.400
 I mean, don't you think a Hitler could rise

43:49.400 --> 43:51.600
 to be at the top of a social network

43:51.600 --> 43:53.180
 like Twitter and Facebook?

43:53.180 --> 43:56.320
 Okay, let's suppose Hitler ran Twitter, okay?

43:56.320 --> 43:58.440
 Let's take this thought experiment seriously.

43:58.440 --> 43:59.760
 Literally what could he do?

43:59.760 --> 44:01.240
 So the only tweets are gonna be

44:01.240 --> 44:02.760
 about how much the Jews suck, right?

44:02.760 --> 44:04.400
 Okay, fine.

44:04.400 --> 44:07.040
 Okay, all the cool people are leaving.

44:07.040 --> 44:09.560
 There could be some compelling,

44:09.560 --> 44:12.920
 like you said, evil people are charming.

44:12.920 --> 44:14.620
 There could be some compelling narratives

44:14.620 --> 44:18.920
 that could be with conspiracy theories, untruths,

44:18.920 --> 44:22.340
 that could be spread like propaganda.

44:22.340 --> 44:25.560
 Every criticism of anarchism is in fact a description.

44:25.560 --> 44:27.460
 Well, the strongest criticism of anarchism

44:27.460 --> 44:29.400
 are in fact descriptions of status quo.

44:29.400 --> 44:34.160
 Your concern is, under anarchism, propaganda would spread

44:34.160 --> 44:36.080
 and people would be taught the wrong ideas,

44:36.080 --> 44:37.680
 unlike the status quo?

44:37.680 --> 44:39.960
 That's not even a criticism of anarchism.

44:39.960 --> 44:41.560
 I'm not actually criticizing.

44:41.560 --> 44:43.640
 It's an open question of,

44:45.720 --> 44:48.360
 it's an open question of in which system

44:48.360 --> 44:53.360
 will human nature be able to thrive more

44:54.280 --> 44:57.480
 and in which system would the evils

44:57.480 --> 44:59.240
 that arise in human nature

44:59.240 --> 45:02.000
 would be more easily suppressible?

45:02.000 --> 45:03.320
 That's the open question.

45:03.320 --> 45:05.000
 It's a scientific experiment

45:05.000 --> 45:07.280
 and I'm asking only from my perspective

45:07.280 --> 45:10.400
 of the fact that we've tried democracy

45:10.400 --> 45:14.280
 quite a bit recently and maybe you can correct me,

45:14.280 --> 45:18.000
 we haven't yet seriously tried anarchy on a large scale.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.680
 Well, we don't need to try to,

45:19.680 --> 45:21.520
 so anarchy isn't like a country, right?

45:21.520 --> 45:25.320
 It's like saying, well, if anarchy works,

45:25.320 --> 45:27.280
 how come we've never had an anarchist government, right?

45:27.280 --> 45:29.620
 So anarchism is a relationship

45:29.620 --> 45:31.140
 and language is an example of this.

45:31.140 --> 45:32.720
 It's a worldwide anarchic system.

45:32.720 --> 45:34.000
 You and I have an anarchist relationship.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.400
 There's almost no circumstances

45:35.400 --> 45:37.720
 that we'd be calling the police on each other.

45:37.720 --> 45:39.880
 I mean, I'm asking the same question

45:39.880 --> 45:41.720
 in a bunch of different directions

45:41.720 --> 45:44.360
 out of, born out of my curiosity,

45:44.360 --> 45:49.280
 is why is anarchy going to be better

45:49.280 --> 45:52.000
 at preventing the darker sides of human nature,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.720
 which presumably your criticism of government.

45:54.720 --> 45:56.820
 Because of decentralization.

45:56.820 --> 46:00.160
 So the darker side of human nature is an extreme concern.

46:00.160 --> 46:01.800
 Anyone who says it's gonna go away

46:01.800 --> 46:04.120
 is absurd and fallacious.

46:04.120 --> 46:05.260
 I think that's a nonstarter

46:05.260 --> 46:07.220
 when people say that everyone's gonna be good.

46:07.220 --> 46:08.660
 Human beings are basically animals.

46:08.660 --> 46:10.840
 We're capable of great beauty and kindness.

46:10.840 --> 46:13.660
 We're capable of just complete cruel

46:13.660 --> 46:15.320
 and what we would call inhumanity,

46:15.320 --> 46:17.920
 but we see it on a daily basis even today.

46:17.920 --> 46:21.340
 And what's interesting is the corporate press

46:21.340 --> 46:23.680
 won't even tell you the darkest aspects

46:23.680 --> 46:25.320
 because that's too upsetting to people.

46:25.320 --> 46:27.700
 So they'll tell you about atrocities and horrors,

46:27.700 --> 46:29.320
 but only to a point.

46:29.320 --> 46:31.020
 And then when you actually do the homework,

46:31.020 --> 46:32.600
 you're like, oh, it's so much worse than,

46:32.600 --> 46:34.120
 like that thing about Stalin, right?

46:34.120 --> 46:38.040
 So we know in a broad sense that Stalin was a dictator.

46:38.040 --> 46:41.080
 We know that he killed a lot of people,

46:41.080 --> 46:44.040
 but it takes work to learn about the Holodomor.

46:44.040 --> 46:45.540
 It takes work to learn about

46:45.540 --> 46:47.640
 what those literal tortures were

46:47.640 --> 46:49.680
 and that this is the person who later,

46:49.680 --> 46:52.320
 FDR and Harry Truman were shaking hands with

46:52.320 --> 46:53.360
 and taking photos with

46:53.360 --> 46:55.600
 and was being sold to us as Uncle Joe.

46:55.600 --> 46:56.960
 He's just like you and me.

46:57.820 --> 47:02.820
 So when you have a decentralized information network

47:03.260 --> 47:06.040
 as opposed to having three media networks,

47:06.040 --> 47:08.560
 it is a lot easier for information

47:08.560 --> 47:09.900
 that doesn't fit what would be

47:09.900 --> 47:13.840
 the corporate America narrative to reach the populations.

47:13.840 --> 47:16.380
 And it would be more effective for democracy

47:16.380 --> 47:18.400
 because they're in a much better position to be informed.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.220
 Now, you're right.

47:20.220 --> 47:22.260
 It also means, well, if everyone has a mic,

47:22.260 --> 47:25.560
 that means every crazy person and with their wacky views.

47:25.560 --> 47:28.480
 And at a certain point, yeah, it has to become,

47:28.480 --> 47:29.660
 then there's another level,

47:29.660 --> 47:32.120
 which is then the people have to be self enforcing.

47:32.120 --> 47:34.040
 And you see that in social media all the time

47:34.040 --> 47:37.240
 where someone says this, the other person jumps in.

47:37.240 --> 47:40.600
 You think, but isn't social media a good example of this?

47:40.600 --> 47:44.960
 So you think ultimately without centralized control,

47:44.960 --> 47:47.220
 you can have stability?

47:48.720 --> 47:52.280
 What about the mob outrage and the mob rule,

47:52.280 --> 47:54.800
 the power of the mobs that emerge?

47:54.800 --> 47:58.720
 Power of the mob is a very serious concern.

47:58.720 --> 48:01.480
 Gustav Le Bon wrote a book in the 1890s called The Crowd.

48:01.480 --> 48:03.440
 And this was one of the most important books I've written

48:03.440 --> 48:05.960
 because it influenced both Mussolini and Hitler and Stalin

48:05.960 --> 48:07.360
 and they all talked about it.

48:07.360 --> 48:11.040
 And he made the point that under crowd psychology,

48:11.040 --> 48:13.480
 human lynching is another example of this.

48:13.480 --> 48:16.100
 None of those individuals or very few

48:16.100 --> 48:19.520
 would ever dream of doing these acts.

48:19.520 --> 48:21.160
 But when they're all together

48:21.160 --> 48:23.680
 and you lose that sense of self, you become the ant

48:23.680 --> 48:25.740
 and you lose that sense of individually,

48:25.740 --> 48:29.120
 you're capable of doing things that like in another context,

48:29.120 --> 48:32.280
 you'd be like, I should kill myself, I'm a monster.

48:32.280 --> 48:36.160
 So you're worried about that, but doesn't the mob have more

48:36.160 --> 48:37.560
 power under anarchy?

48:37.560 --> 48:39.840
 No, the mob has much less power in anarchy

48:39.840 --> 48:41.880
 because under anarchism, every individual

48:41.880 --> 48:43.360
 is fully empowered.

48:43.360 --> 48:47.960
 You wouldn't have gun restrictions.

48:47.960 --> 48:50.040
 You would have people creating communities

48:50.040 --> 48:51.820
 based on shared values.

48:51.820 --> 48:55.000
 They'd be much more collegial, they'd be much more kind,

48:55.000 --> 48:57.520
 as opposed to when you're forcing people

48:57.520 --> 48:59.400
 to be together in a polity

48:59.400 --> 49:01.360
 when they don't have things in common.

49:01.360 --> 49:03.720
 That is like having a bad roommate.

49:03.720 --> 49:06.120
 If you're forced to look like jails,

49:06.120 --> 49:09.920
 if you're forced to be locked in a room with someone,

49:09.920 --> 49:11.480
 even if you had first liked them,

49:11.480 --> 49:13.480
 after a while, you're going to start to hate them

49:13.480 --> 49:16.800
 and that leads to very nefarious consequences.

49:16.800 --> 49:21.160
 So as an anarchist, what do you do in a society like this?

49:21.160 --> 49:22.720
 Thrive.

49:22.720 --> 49:24.720
 I think I'm doing okay.

49:24.720 --> 49:29.720
 No, I mean, there's an election coming up.

49:29.720 --> 49:34.720
 There's, as you talk, You're Welcome

49:36.080 --> 49:40.080
 is one of the 15 shows that you host.

49:40.080 --> 49:44.120
 It's down to one.

49:44.120 --> 49:46.020
 Okay, it's down to one.

49:46.020 --> 49:47.320
 But I'm a big fan.

49:49.440 --> 49:52.440
 You talk about libertarianism a little bit.

49:52.440 --> 49:57.440
 I mean, is there some practical political direction

49:57.440 --> 50:01.160
 in terms of we as a society should go?

50:01.160 --> 50:03.000
 I don't mean we as a nation.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.640
 I mean, we as a collective of people

50:04.640 --> 50:07.520
 should go to make a better world

50:07.520 --> 50:09.200
 from an anarchist point of view.

50:09.200 --> 50:13.680
 Sure, I think politics is the enemy and anything.

50:13.680 --> 50:14.680
 How do you define politics?

50:14.680 --> 50:16.340
 The state, the government.

50:16.340 --> 50:19.960
 So anything that lessens its sway on people,

50:19.960 --> 50:23.440
 anything that delegitimizes it is good.

50:23.440 --> 50:25.400
 I wrote an article a few years ago

50:25.400 --> 50:27.620
 about how wonderful it is that Trump

50:27.620 --> 50:29.900
 is regarded as such a buffoon

50:29.900 --> 50:32.080
 because it's very, very useful

50:32.080 --> 50:35.160
 to have a commander in chief who's regarded as a clown

50:35.160 --> 50:37.280
 because it's gonna take a lot

50:37.280 --> 50:39.920
 to get him to convince your kids to go overseas

50:39.920 --> 50:42.320
 and start killing people and making widows and orphans,

50:42.320 --> 50:44.440
 as well as those kids coming home in caskets.

50:44.440 --> 50:47.200
 Whereas if someone is regarded with prestige

50:47.200 --> 50:49.680
 and they're like, oh, we need to send your kid overseas.

50:49.680 --> 50:50.920
 Oh, absolutely.

50:50.920 --> 50:52.340
 I mean, this guy's great.

50:52.340 --> 50:54.440
 So that is a very healthy thing

50:54.440 --> 50:57.120
 where people are skeptical of the state.

50:57.120 --> 51:01.080
 But there's a lot of people that regard him

51:01.080 --> 51:04.640
 as one of the greatest leaders we've ever had.

51:04.640 --> 51:07.200
 Yeah, Dinesh D'Souza, he's another Lincoln.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.440
 When you talk shit about Trump

51:10.440 --> 51:12.560
 or talk shit about Biden,

51:14.840 --> 51:16.840
 I'm trying to find a line to walk

51:16.840 --> 51:19.720
 where they don't immediately put you into

51:19.720 --> 51:21.600
 this person has Trump derangement syndrome

51:21.600 --> 51:25.240
 or they have the alternative to that.

51:25.240 --> 51:27.100
 I'm more than happy

51:27.100 --> 51:29.480
 when people are preemptively dismissing me

51:29.480 --> 51:31.600
 because then I don't have to waste time engaging with them

51:31.600 --> 51:33.640
 because those people would be of no use to me.

51:33.640 --> 51:36.540
 When I was on Tim Pool recently, Tim Pool's show,

51:36.540 --> 51:38.740
 Tim Pool's known for his little hat.

51:38.740 --> 51:40.520
 I got a propeller beanie motorized

51:40.520 --> 51:42.560
 and it was just spinning the whole two hours.

51:42.560 --> 51:44.280
 I know, like a 1950s thing.

51:44.280 --> 51:47.480
 The point being I wore it because there's lots of people

51:47.480 --> 51:50.080
 who would say, I can't take seriously someone

51:50.080 --> 51:51.400
 who wears a hat like that.

51:51.400 --> 51:53.640
 And my point being, if you are the kind of person

51:53.640 --> 51:56.680
 who takes your cues based on someone's wardrobe

51:56.680 --> 51:58.560
 as opposed to the content of your ideas,

51:58.560 --> 52:01.200
 you're of no use to me as an ally.

52:01.200 --> 52:04.600
 So I'd be more than happy you preemptively abort

52:04.600 --> 52:07.220
 rather than waste our breath trying to engage.

52:07.220 --> 52:10.200
 This is a very, very deep thing that you and I disagree on,

52:10.200 --> 52:13.440
 which is, this goes to the trolling versus the love,

52:14.500 --> 52:19.040
 is I believe that person instinctually dismisses you

52:19.040 --> 52:21.320
 on the very basic surface level.

52:21.320 --> 52:26.320
 But deep down, there's a wealth of a human being

52:27.600 --> 52:32.320
 that seeks the connection, seeks to understand deeply

52:32.320 --> 52:36.000
 to connect with other humans that we should speak to.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.200
 Yeah, you and I completely disagree.

52:38.200 --> 52:40.040
 See, you're saying.

52:40.040 --> 52:42.400
 I'm saying there's no mind there literally.

52:42.400 --> 52:47.400
 Okay, so I naturally think the majority of people

52:47.400 --> 52:52.400
 have the capacity to be thoughtful, intelligent,

52:55.440 --> 53:00.440
 and learn about ideas, ideas that they instinctually

53:01.960 --> 53:06.960
 based on their own current inner circle disagree with

53:07.200 --> 53:10.160
 and learn to understand, to empathize with the other.

53:10.160 --> 53:13.480
 And in the current climate,

53:13.480 --> 53:15.680
 there's a divisiveness that discourages that.

53:15.680 --> 53:20.680
 And that's where I see the value of love of encouraging

53:20.680 --> 53:25.680
 people to strip away that surface instinctual response

53:27.280 --> 53:29.480
 based on the thing they've been taught,

53:29.480 --> 53:31.120
 based on the things they listen to,

53:31.120 --> 53:32.560
 to actually think deeply.

53:32.560 --> 53:36.880
 Have you ever had gone to CVS or Duane Reade

53:36.880 --> 53:40.240
 and your bill, how much you owe them is $6,

53:40.240 --> 53:42.240
 and you give them a $10 bill in a single

53:42.240 --> 53:44.520
 and watch the look on their face?

53:44.520 --> 53:46.760
 You watch them void their bowels and panic

53:46.760 --> 53:49.600
 because you've given them $11 on a $6 bill.

53:49.600 --> 53:52.560
 This is not a mind capable or interested

53:52.560 --> 53:54.280
 in thoughts and ideas and learning.

53:54.280 --> 53:57.000
 No, you're talking about the first moment

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
 of a first moment where there's an opportunity to think.

54:02.440 --> 54:04.160
 They are desperate to avoid it.

54:05.640 --> 54:07.080
 No, they're just, it's.

54:07.080 --> 54:08.720
 And incapable of it.

54:08.720 --> 54:12.480
 I just, they have the same exact experiences

54:12.480 --> 54:15.120
 I have every single day when I know it's time

54:15.120 --> 54:18.040
 for me to go out on a run of five miles

54:18.040 --> 54:20.320
 or six miles or 10 miles.

54:20.320 --> 54:24.320
 I'm desperate to avoid it, and at the same time,

54:24.320 --> 54:26.520
 I know I have the capacity to do it,

54:26.520 --> 54:28.960
 and I'm deeply fulfilled when I do do it,

54:28.960 --> 54:30.360
 when I do overcome that challenge.

54:30.360 --> 54:33.200
 You are one of the great minds of our generation.

54:33.200 --> 54:35.080
 You are telling me that any of these people

54:35.080 --> 54:38.200
 can do anything close to the work you do?

54:38.200 --> 54:39.800
 Not in artificial intelligence,

54:39.800 --> 54:44.800
 but in the ability to be compassionate

54:45.280 --> 54:48.320
 towards other people's ideas,

54:48.320 --> 54:50.440
 like understand them enough to be able.

54:50.440 --> 54:53.360
 Passion requires a certain baseline of intelligence,

54:53.360 --> 54:54.680
 because you have to perceive other people

54:54.680 --> 54:56.040
 as being different but of value.

54:56.040 --> 54:56.880
 Yeah, exactly.

54:56.880 --> 54:59.520
 That's a sophisticated mindset.

54:59.520 --> 55:03.240
 I think most people are capable of it.

55:03.240 --> 55:04.080
 You don't think so?

55:04.080 --> 55:06.720
 No, and nor are they interested in it.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.920
 But in that kind of,

55:08.920 --> 55:11.760
 if you don't believe they're capable of it,

55:11.760 --> 55:14.040
 how can anarchy be stable?

55:15.040 --> 55:18.200
 If you have a farm, there's one farmer and 50 cows,

55:18.200 --> 55:19.480
 it's very stable.

55:19.480 --> 55:21.480
 You're just not, you're not asking the cows

55:21.480 --> 55:23.560
 where to farm things.

55:25.240 --> 55:29.560
 Yeah, but the cows aren't intelligent enough to do damage.

55:29.560 --> 55:31.520
 Cows certainly, bulls,

55:31.520 --> 55:32.400
 because they could do a lot of damage.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.800
 They could trample things, they could attack you.

55:34.800 --> 55:36.960
 Cows are like, how much do they weigh, like 4,000 pounds?

55:36.960 --> 55:38.480
 Can you connect the analogy then?

55:38.480 --> 55:39.320
 Because like.

55:39.320 --> 55:41.120
 Sure, you can't expect that.

55:41.120 --> 55:41.960
 Yeah.

55:41.960 --> 55:44.640
 Saying a cow is a cow isn't a slur.

55:44.640 --> 55:46.000
 It's not saying you hate cows.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.640
 Cows, or even, let's say,

55:47.640 --> 55:50.520
 the example I always use with good reason is dogs, okay?

55:51.440 --> 55:53.680
 I always say to study how human beings operate,

55:53.680 --> 55:55.120
 watch Cesar Millan,

55:55.120 --> 55:57.080
 because human beings and dogs have co evolved.

55:57.080 --> 55:59.480
 Our minds have both evolved in parallel tracks

55:59.480 --> 56:00.880
 to communicate with each other.

56:00.880 --> 56:03.520
 Dogs are, can be vicious.

56:03.520 --> 56:06.320
 Dogs for the most part are great, wonderful,

56:06.320 --> 56:08.760
 but you can't expect the dog

56:08.760 --> 56:11.280
 to understand certain concepts.

56:11.280 --> 56:13.040
 It's not an, and now most people are offended.

56:13.040 --> 56:14.160
 Are you saying I'm like a dog?

56:14.160 --> 56:15.880
 If you're a dog person like I am,

56:15.880 --> 56:17.080
 this is actually a huge compliment.

56:17.080 --> 56:19.800
 Most dogs are better than most people,

56:19.800 --> 56:22.960
 but to get the idea that this is something

56:22.960 --> 56:26.640
 that is basically your peer is nonsensical.

56:26.640 --> 56:28.400
 Now, of course this sounds arrogant and elitist

56:28.400 --> 56:29.560
 and so on and so forth,

56:29.560 --> 56:31.320
 and I'm perfectly happy with that,

56:31.320 --> 56:34.480
 but it is very hard to persuade me or anyone

56:34.480 --> 56:36.480
 that if you walk, George Carlin has that joke,

56:36.480 --> 56:37.960
 think how smart the average person is,

56:37.960 --> 56:40.400
 then realize 50% of people are dumber than that.

56:40.400 --> 56:42.200
 If you walk around and see who's out there,

56:42.200 --> 56:43.800
 these people are very kind.

56:43.800 --> 56:45.080
 They are of value.

56:45.080 --> 56:47.800
 They deserve to be treated with respect.

56:47.800 --> 56:49.880
 They deserve to be secure in their person.

56:49.880 --> 56:52.840
 They deserve to feel safe and to have love,

56:52.840 --> 56:56.360
 but the expectation that they should have

56:56.360 --> 56:59.240
 any sort of semblance of power over me or my life

56:59.240 --> 57:03.120
 is as nonsensical as asking Lassie to be my accountant.

57:03.120 --> 57:05.960
 So, but that goes to power,

57:05.960 --> 57:09.880
 that not to the ability, the capacity

57:09.880 --> 57:12.880
 to be empathetic, compassionate, intelligent.

57:12.880 --> 57:16.160
 What, if I were to try to prove you wrong?

57:16.160 --> 57:17.880
 That's a good question, okay.

57:17.880 --> 57:22.220
 What would you be impressed by about society?

57:24.080 --> 57:25.720
 How would I show it to you?

57:25.720 --> 57:26.560
 That's a good question.

57:26.560 --> 57:27.400
 How would you show it to me?

57:27.400 --> 57:28.960
 Because I think something has to be falsifiable

57:28.960 --> 57:30.680
 if you're gonna make a claim, right?

57:30.680 --> 57:33.960
 So what would it?

57:33.960 --> 57:35.400
 Because we both made claims

57:35.400 --> 57:39.040
 that aren't a kind of our own like interpretation

57:39.040 --> 57:40.760
 based on our interaction.

57:40.760 --> 57:43.640
 Like when I opened Twitter, everyone seems to say.

57:43.640 --> 57:44.800
 Why do you only follow one person?

57:44.800 --> 57:45.640
 Who do you follow?

57:45.640 --> 57:46.800
 Who's the one person you follow?

57:46.800 --> 57:48.040
 Stoic Emperor.

57:48.040 --> 57:49.640
 I follow a lot of people.

57:49.640 --> 57:50.640
 I have a script.

57:50.640 --> 57:55.640
 I have a script that I have an entire interface.

57:55.880 --> 57:58.760
 So I think Twitter is really.

57:58.760 --> 57:59.760
 This is real love.

57:59.760 --> 58:00.920
 It's not ironic love.

58:00.920 --> 58:04.200
 I love watching it and I'm sure you do too.

58:04.200 --> 58:06.360
 I love watching a quality mind at work

58:06.360 --> 58:08.260
 because when someone has a quality mind,

58:08.260 --> 58:10.360
 they're often not self aware.

58:10.360 --> 58:12.780
 I catch this on myself of how it operates

58:12.780 --> 58:13.920
 and then when other people see it,

58:13.920 --> 58:15.440
 they're like, oh my God, this is so beautiful

58:15.440 --> 58:17.340
 because there's such an innocence to it.

58:17.340 --> 58:21.760
 But like when I opened Twitter, I'm energized.

58:21.760 --> 58:23.160
 There's a lot of love on Twitter.

58:23.160 --> 58:24.080
 People say like.

58:24.080 --> 58:24.920
 I love Twitter.

58:24.920 --> 58:25.740
 I agree.

58:25.740 --> 58:27.060
 You don't think I have a lot of love on Twitter?

58:27.060 --> 58:29.000
 My fans pay my rent.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.400
 I mean, I don't know your experience of Twitter,

58:32.400 --> 58:33.440
 but when I look at your,

58:33.440 --> 58:35.560
 which is a fundamentally different thing.

58:35.560 --> 58:37.560
 I'm saying my experience from the.

58:37.560 --> 58:39.320
 So maybe you can tell me what your experience

58:39.320 --> 58:40.360
 is like as a human.

58:40.360 --> 58:43.040
 So when I observe your Twitter,

58:43.040 --> 58:48.040
 I think, I wouldn't call it love.

58:48.040 --> 58:50.440
 I would call it fun.

58:50.440 --> 58:51.280
 Yes.

58:51.280 --> 58:54.680
 And because of that, that's a different kind of,

58:54.680 --> 58:56.840
 that like love emerges from that

58:56.840 --> 59:00.500
 because people kind of learn that we're having,

59:00.500 --> 59:02.360
 this is like game night, like.

59:02.360 --> 59:03.780
 Yes.

59:03.780 --> 59:06.320
 You know, we can talk shit a little bit.

59:06.320 --> 59:10.400
 We can, and you can even like pull in,

59:10.400 --> 59:11.600
 you can make fun of people.

59:11.600 --> 59:13.760
 You can have the crazy uncle come over

59:13.760 --> 59:16.720
 that is a huge Trump supporter,

59:16.720 --> 59:19.480
 somebody who hates Trump and you can have a little fun.

59:19.480 --> 59:20.320
 I get it.

59:20.320 --> 59:21.140
 It's a different kind of thing.

59:21.140 --> 59:25.340
 I wouldn't be able to be the,

59:25.340 --> 59:26.840
 you're the host of game night.

59:26.840 --> 59:27.680
 Yes, yes.

59:27.680 --> 59:30.240
 So I wouldn't be able to host that kind of game night.

59:30.240 --> 59:32.840
 I imagine you programming your robots

59:32.840 --> 59:34.300
 and you're asking what is fun

59:34.300 --> 59:35.640
 and it just starts sparking.

59:35.640 --> 59:37.300
 Yeah, exactly.

59:37.300 --> 59:38.140
 Yeah.

59:38.140 --> 59:38.960
 What is fun?

59:38.960 --> 59:42.480
 So the robots in my life that survive

59:42.480 --> 59:45.680
 are the ones that don't,

59:45.680 --> 59:49.820
 that like survive that whole programming process.

59:49.820 --> 59:51.140
 So they're kind of like,

59:51.140 --> 59:52.880
 they're kind of like the idiot from Dostoevsky,

59:52.880 --> 59:55.780
 they're very like simple minded robots.

59:56.880 --> 1:00:00.320
 Fun is moving a can from one table to another.

1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:03.440
 That's game night for our kin.

1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:04.720
 You know, one of my quotes is,

1:00:04.720 --> 1:00:06.440
 and I think about this every day

1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:09.180
 and I mean it with every fiber of my being,

1:00:09.180 --> 1:00:11.520
 we're born knowing that life is a magical adventure

1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:14.780
 and it takes them years to train us to think otherwise.

1:00:14.780 --> 1:00:16.560
 And I think that Willy Wonka approach,

1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:17.800
 it's a very Camus approach.

1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:20.660
 It's something I believe with every fiber of my being.

1:00:20.660 --> 1:00:22.780
 I try to spread that as much as possible.

1:00:22.780 --> 1:00:24.600
 I think it is very sad.

1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:25.720
 I'm not being sarcastic.

1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:27.520
 It comes off as condescending.

1:00:27.520 --> 1:00:29.000
 I mean it at face value.

1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.760
 It's very sad how many people are not receptive to that.

1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:32.880
 And I think a lot of those functions,

1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:34.060
 how they were raised.

1:00:34.060 --> 1:00:37.040
 And I could have very easily with my upbringing

1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:40.360
 have not maintained that perspective.

1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:42.720
 And there's a lot of,

1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:45.180
 I have a lot of friends in recovery like AA

1:00:45.180 --> 1:00:47.000
 and they have an expression,

1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.200
 not my circus, not my monkeys, right?

1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:51.920
 That you can't really take on other people's problems

1:00:51.920 --> 1:00:53.120
 on your own at a certain point,

1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:54.560
 they have to do the work themselves

1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:56.840
 because you can only do so much externally.

1:00:56.840 --> 1:01:00.560
 And there are a lot of very damaged people out there.

1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:04.440
 And they're damaged people who revel in being damaged.

1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:07.000
 And they are damaged people who desperately,

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:08.960
 desperately, desperately wanna be well,

1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:10.280
 who desperately wanna be happy,

1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:12.180
 who desperately wanna find joy.

1:01:12.180 --> 1:01:15.840
 So if I can be the one and as arrogant as this sounds,

1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:18.400
 I'll own it, who does give them that fun

1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:21.120
 and to tell them it doesn't have to be like you thought.

1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:24.140
 Like it could be, it's gonna hurt, it's gonna suck,

1:01:24.140 --> 1:01:25.820
 but it's still a magical adventure

1:01:25.820 --> 1:01:26.800
 and you're gonna be okay,

1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:28.080
 cause you've been through worse.

1:01:28.080 --> 1:01:30.040
 Like that, if that could be my message,

1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:32.020
 I would own it all day long.

1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:35.560
 And so what does adventure look like for you?

1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:37.240
 Cause I mean, it actually boils down to,

1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:38.620
 I still disagree with you.

1:01:38.620 --> 1:01:41.880
 I think trolling can be

1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:45.020
 and very often is destructive for society.

1:01:45.020 --> 1:01:46.720
 Yes, I want to destroy society.

1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:47.600
 That is the goal.

1:01:48.940 --> 1:01:50.600
 I want to help many people.

1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:51.800
 Unironically, okay.

1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:52.880
 Unironically, yes.

1:01:54.760 --> 1:01:55.840
 What do I do with that?

1:01:55.840 --> 1:01:56.680
 Okay, so.

1:01:56.680 --> 1:01:57.500
 Whatever you want.

1:01:57.500 --> 1:02:00.200
 Do what thou wilt is the hall of the law.

1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:01.120
 Like I just wanna,

1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:02.440
 so you're hosting game night

1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:04.140
 and I just wanna play Monopoly.

1:02:04.140 --> 1:02:07.560
 I wanna play, what's it, Risk.

1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:08.920
 Okay, I wanna play these games.

1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:10.560
 And you're saying. Those are aggressive games.

1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:12.840
 Yeah, I was trying to think like of a friendlier game,

1:02:12.840 --> 1:02:14.640
 but they're all kind of aggressive.

1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:16.440
 Battleship.

1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:19.680
 Axis and allies, you know, fun stuff.

1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:24.220
 But like, so that's an adventure,

1:02:24.220 --> 1:02:27.760
 but you're saying that we want to destroy everything.

1:02:27.760 --> 1:02:31.600
 Even like the rules of those games are not.

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:33.480
 You voluntarily agree to those rules.

1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:35.200
 The point is if someone comes in

1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:37.420
 who no one invited to game night

1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:40.080
 and are telling you, no, when you play Monopoly,

1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:42.720
 you have to get money when you land in free parking

1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:45.320
 or you don't, it's like, who are you?

1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:47.520
 We're having our own fun and you smell.

1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:52.960
 I don't know, but there's an aggressive.

1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:53.960
 There's an aggression.

1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:56.460
 Let me speak to that, which I think you're picking up on.

1:02:56.460 --> 1:02:58.440
 I had a friend named Martha, Marcia, excuse me.

1:02:58.440 --> 1:02:59.720
 She ran something called cuddle parties,

1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:02.000
 which people laughed at about a lot back in the day.

1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:03.260
 And the premise of the cuddle parties,

1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:04.760
 everyone got together and cuddled, right?

1:03:04.760 --> 1:03:05.680
 And it's like, ah, ha, ha.

1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:06.720
 Then you stop to think about it

1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:09.620
 and you realize physical contact is extremely important.

1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:11.000
 And a lot of people don't have it.

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.720
 And if this is a mechanism of people getting that,

1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:13.560
 it actually is going to have

1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:15.400
 profound positive psychological consequences.

1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:17.320
 So after she explained it, I'm like, okay,

1:03:17.320 --> 1:03:18.600
 we laughed at this because it's weird.

1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:20.560
 And now that I think about it, this is wonderful.

1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:23.560
 And I asked her about like the tough question,

1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:25.800
 I go, what if guys get turned on?

1:03:25.800 --> 1:03:27.640
 And on their website, it even has a rule,

1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:28.840
 like do not fear the erection, right?

1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:30.200
 Because it's going to be a natural consequence

1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:31.400
 of physical proximity.

1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:33.000
 And the point she goes, she said this,

1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:34.520
 I think about this all the time.

1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:38.560
 People will take as much space as you let them.

1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:42.840
 It is incumbent on each of us to set our own boundaries.

1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:44.400
 We all have to learn when to say,

1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:46.240
 no, you're making me uncomfortable.

1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:48.460
 If someone doesn't respect your right

1:03:48.460 --> 1:03:50.180
 to have your boundary to be uncomfortable,

1:03:50.180 --> 1:03:51.800
 this person is not your friend.

1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:54.300
 Now they can say, I don't understand.

1:03:54.300 --> 1:03:55.460
 Like, why is this okay?

1:03:55.460 --> 1:03:56.360
 Why is that not?

1:03:56.360 --> 1:03:59.280
 Let me know you better so I'm respectful of you.

1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:01.020
 But if they roll their eyes and they're like,

1:04:01.020 --> 1:04:02.320
 get over, I'm going to do what I want,

1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:05.320
 this person is not interested in knowing you as a human being.

1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:08.000
 Okay.

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:08.820
 And that is the aggression.

1:04:08.820 --> 1:04:10.180
 You have to draw those lines.

1:04:10.180 --> 1:04:13.440
 I mean, but that's a very positive way

1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:14.880
 of phrasing that aggression.

1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:17.000
 I'm a very positive person.

1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.040
 But the trolling, there's a destructive thing to it.

1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:20.880
 Yes.

1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:22.320
 That hurts others.

1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:23.160
 Yes.

1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:25.320
 But it's not bad people.

1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:28.460
 I only troll as a reaction or towards those in power.

1:04:28.460 --> 1:04:29.300
 Okay.

1:04:29.300 --> 1:04:31.080
 So maybe let's talk about trolling a little bit.

1:04:31.080 --> 1:04:36.000
 Because trolling, when it can, maybe you can correct me,

1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000
 but I've seen it become a game for people

1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:41.520
 that's enjoyable in itself.

1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:44.280
 I disagree with that.

1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:45.520
 That's not a good thing.

1:04:45.520 --> 1:04:48.680
 If you are there just to hurt innocent people,

1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:50.800
 you are a horrible human being.

1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:53.920
 But doesn't trolling too easily become that?

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:55.880
 I don't know about easily.

1:04:55.880 --> 1:04:58.720
 Let me give you an example of where trolling came from.

1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:01.160
 The original troll was Andy Kaufman.

1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:02.720
 He was on the show Taxi.

1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:05.440
 He was a performance artist, not a stand up comedian.

1:05:05.440 --> 1:05:08.080
 And this is a quintessential example of trolling.

1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:10.680
 He had a character where he was basically

1:05:10.680 --> 1:05:11.520
 like a lounge singer.

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:14.920
 He had these glasses on and just a terrible singer

1:05:14.920 --> 1:05:15.740
 and so on and so forth.

1:05:15.740 --> 1:05:16.980
 And he denied it was him.

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:21.320
 And he came out and I'm blanking on the guy's name.

1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:22.160
 I can't believe it.

1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:22.980
 Tony Clifton.

1:05:22.980 --> 1:05:23.820
 Wow.

1:05:23.820 --> 1:05:24.660
 Yeah.

1:05:24.660 --> 1:05:25.680
 He came out in the audience and he goes,

1:05:25.680 --> 1:05:28.160
 you know, my wife died a few years ago.

1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:29.880
 Every time I look at my daughter Sarah's eyes,

1:05:29.880 --> 1:05:30.760
 I can see my wife.

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:31.600
 Sarah, come out here.

1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:32.560
 Let's do a duet.

1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:35.000
 And Sarah was like 11, sits on his lap.

1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:36.400
 They start singing duet.

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:37.560
 Her voice cracks.

1:05:37.560 --> 1:05:38.960
 He smacks her across the face.

1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:39.840
 What the hell are you doing?

1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:42.160
 You're making an ass out of me in front of these people.

1:05:42.160 --> 1:05:43.520
 She starts crying.

1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:45.520
 The audience is booing and he goes,

1:05:45.520 --> 1:05:47.620
 don't boo her, you're just gonna make her cry more.

1:05:47.620 --> 1:05:50.160
 Now it ends.

1:05:50.160 --> 1:05:51.280
 This wasn't his daughter.

1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:52.120
 It wasn't even a child.

1:05:52.120 --> 1:05:52.940
 It was an actress.

1:05:52.940 --> 1:05:53.780
 This was all set up.

1:05:53.780 --> 1:05:57.280
 He's exploiting their love of children

1:05:57.280 --> 1:05:59.320
 in order to force them to be performers.

1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:01.000
 That is trolling.

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:02.760
 No one is actually getting hurt.

1:06:02.760 --> 1:06:05.680
 It's a humorous, though twisted exchange.

1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:10.240
 If you go online looking for weak people

1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:13.000
 and you are there to denigrate them

1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:16.440
 just for them being weak or in some way inferior to you,

1:06:16.440 --> 1:06:18.760
 that is the wrong approach.

1:06:18.760 --> 1:06:21.320
 I am best on the counter punch.

1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:23.440
 A lot of times people come to me

1:06:23.440 --> 1:06:24.880
 and they'll be like, I hope you die.

1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:25.720
 You're ugly.

1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:26.540
 You're disgusting.

1:06:26.540 --> 1:06:28.080
 And there's this great quote from Billy Idol,

1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:30.120
 which I'm gonna mango here, something effective.

1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:31.640
 I love it when people are rude to me,

1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:33.580
 then I can stop pretending to be nice.

1:06:33.580 --> 1:06:35.400
 Then you start fights.

1:06:35.400 --> 1:06:37.200
 Now it's a chance for me to finish it

1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:38.920
 and make an example of this person.

1:06:38.920 --> 1:06:40.880
 But that's very, very different from

1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:42.960
 I'm gonna go around and humiliate people

1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:45.100
 for the sake of doing it, in my view.

1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:48.440
 And I can see how one would lead to the other.

1:06:48.440 --> 1:06:50.920
 Yeah, but that's my fundamental concern with it.

1:06:50.920 --> 1:06:55.580
 So my dream is to put, use technology,

1:06:55.580 --> 1:06:58.940
 create platforms that increase

1:06:58.940 --> 1:07:00.500
 the amount of love in the world.

1:07:00.500 --> 1:07:05.500
 And to me, trolling is doing the opposite.

1:07:05.980 --> 1:07:09.760
 So like Andy Kaufman is brilliant.

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:12.960
 So I love, obviously, it sounds like I'm a robot thing.

1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:14.200
 I love humor, okay?

1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:16.500
 Humor is good.

1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:21.000
 One, one, one, zero, one, one, one, one.

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:25.600
 But like, it's, I just see like 4chan.

1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:29.440
 I see that you can often see that humor quickly turn.

1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:31.920
 Yeah, because what happens is a lot of low status people,

1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:34.920
 this is their one mechanism through sadism

1:07:34.920 --> 1:07:38.400
 to feel empowered, and then they can hide behind,

1:07:38.400 --> 1:07:40.200
 well, I'm just joking.

1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:41.360
 Yeah, like there's this dark thing.

1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:42.520
 Yeah, that's not acceptable.

1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:43.360
 That's something you can't have.

1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:45.760
 There's a dark LOL that people do,

1:07:45.760 --> 1:07:49.000
 which is like they'll say like the shittiest thing.

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.040
 Right, because they feel. And then do LOL after.

1:07:51.040 --> 1:07:55.240
 Like, as if, I don't even know like what is happening

1:07:55.240 --> 1:07:56.920
 in that dark mind of yours.

1:07:56.920 --> 1:08:00.520
 Because they are feeling powerless in their lives,

1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:02.880
 and they see someone who they perceive as higher status

1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:05.080
 or more powerful than them, or even not appear,

1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:07.040
 and they, through their words,

1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:09.500
 cause a reaction in this person.

1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:11.680
 So they feel like they are, in a very literal sense,

1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:12.920
 making a difference on earth,

1:08:12.920 --> 1:08:15.200
 and they matter in a very dark way.

1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:16.400
 It's disturbing.

1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:18.240
 This is not, I mean, it's unfortunate

1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:21.200
 that that term trolling is used for that,

1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:22.960
 as opposed to what Andy Kaufman does,

1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:24.400
 as opposed to what I do.

1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:29.040
 It really is a sinister thing,

1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:31.680
 and it's something I'm not at all a fan of.

1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:33.880
 How do we fight that?

1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:37.260
 So, like a neighboring concept of that

1:08:37.260 --> 1:08:39.760
 is conspiracy theories, which is.

1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:41.560
 I don't think they're neighboring at all.

1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:45.300
 Well, let me give a sort of naive perspective.

1:08:45.300 --> 1:08:46.640
 Maybe you can educate me on this.

1:08:46.640 --> 1:08:49.800
 From my perspective, conspiracy theories

1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:52.920
 are these constructs of ideas

1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:55.440
 that go deeper and deeper and deeper

1:08:55.440 --> 1:08:59.960
 into creating worlds

1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:06.240
 where there's powerful pedophiles controlling things,

1:09:06.860 --> 1:09:11.840
 like these very sophisticated models of the world

1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:14.160
 that in part might be true,

1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:15.960
 but in large part, I would say,

1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:18.560
 are figments of imagination

1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:22.080
 that become really useful constructs.

1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:23.120
 Self reinforcing.

1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:26.600
 Self reinforcing for then feeding,

1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:29.840
 like empowering the trolls

1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:34.840
 to attack the powerful, the conventionally powerful.

1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:37.120
 I don't think that's a function of conspiracy theories.

1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:38.680
 Now, let's talk about conspiracy theories,

1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:39.580
 because one of my quotes is,

1:09:39.580 --> 1:09:41.920
 "'You take one red pill, not the whole bottle.'"

1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:45.560
 This concept that everything in life

1:09:45.560 --> 1:09:50.480
 is at the function of a small cadre of individuals

1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:53.200
 would be, for many people, reassuring,

1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:55.880
 because as bad as it looks, you know they,

1:09:55.880 --> 1:09:57.940
 whoever they are, it's usually the Jews,

1:09:57.940 --> 1:10:00.840
 aren't gonna let it get that bad, that they will pull back.

1:10:00.840 --> 1:10:05.820
 Or the black pill is that they aren't intentionally

1:10:05.820 --> 1:10:07.280
 trying to destroy everything,

1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:08.880
 and there's nothing we can do and we're doomed.

1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:10.500
 And there's an amazing book by Arthur Herman

1:10:10.500 --> 1:10:12.840
 called The Idea of Declined Western History.

1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:14.320
 It's one of my top 10 books

1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:16.360
 where he goes through every 20 years

1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:18.200
 how there's a different population that say,

1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:20.640
 "'It's the end of the world, here's the proof.'"

1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:22.140
 And very often, the proof is something

1:10:22.140 --> 1:10:24.080
 that is kind of self fulfilling,

1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:26.520
 where it's not falsifiable.

1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:27.760
 And we both have to think of ways

1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:29.660
 to falsify our claims from earlier.

1:10:29.660 --> 1:10:32.520
 So it is a big danger.

1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:35.840
 It's a big danger online, because very quickly,

1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:38.580
 if someone who you thought was good,

1:10:38.580 --> 1:10:40.280
 but now is bad on one aspect,

1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:41.800
 well, they're controlled opposition,

1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:44.080
 or they've been taken over,

1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:47.740
 or they've been kind of appropriated by the bad people,

1:10:47.740 --> 1:10:49.920
 whoever those bad people would be.

1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:52.880
 I don't know that I have a good answer for this.

1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:56.040
 I don't think it's as pervasive as people think.

1:10:56.040 --> 1:10:57.840
 The number of people who believe conspiracy theory?

1:10:57.840 --> 1:11:00.200
 Right, I mean, and also conspiracy theory

1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:04.240
 is a term used to dismiss ideas that have some currency.

1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:06.800
 The Constitutional Convention was a conspiracy.

1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:08.440
 The Founding Fathers got together secretly

1:11:08.440 --> 1:11:10.040
 on this war to secrecy in Philadelphia,

1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:11.520
 said, we're throwing out the Articles of Confederation,

1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:12.960
 we're making a new government, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:15.320
 And Luther Martin left, and he told everyone,

1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:16.580
 this is a conspiracy, and they're like,

1:11:16.580 --> 1:11:17.920
 yeah, whatever, Luther Martin.

1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:20.160
 So, and Jeffrey Epstein was a conspiracy,

1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:21.680
 Harvey Weinstein was a conspiracy,

1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:22.720
 Bill Cosby was a conspiracy.

1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:24.880
 They all knew, they didn't care.

1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:26.600
 Communist infiltration in America,

1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:28.760
 there's a great book by Eugene Lyons

1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:30.160
 called The Red Decade.

1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:32.960
 They all knew every atrocity

1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:36.920
 that was done under Stalinism was excused in the West,

1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:37.960
 and if you didn't believe it,

1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:40.280
 oh, you've got this crazy anti Russia conspiracy.

1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:43.700
 So it's a term that is weaponized in a negative sense,

1:11:43.700 --> 1:11:45.640
 but that does not at all imply

1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:49.200
 that it does not have very negative real life consequences

1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:52.280
 because it's kind of a cult of one, right?

1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:54.080
 Like I'm at home with my computer,

1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:56.120
 I bang into this ideology,

1:11:56.120 --> 1:11:58.160
 anyone who doesn't agree with me,

1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:00.120
 they are blind, they're oblivious,

1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:02.880
 mom and dad, my friends, you don't get it.

1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:05.260
 We were warned about people like you,

1:12:05.260 --> 1:12:08.440
 and I think there's a very heavy correlation,

1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:10.040
 and I'm not a psychiatrist, of course,

1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:12.480
 between that and certain types of mild mental illness,

1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:14.600
 like some kind of paranoid schizophrenia

1:12:14.600 --> 1:12:17.160
 and things like that, because after a certain point,

1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:20.200
 if everything is a function of this conspiracy,

1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:22.920
 there's no randomness or beauty in life.

1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:25.240
 Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you can say

1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:28.160
 anything interesting about it in the way of advice

1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:33.160
 of how to take a step into conspiracy theory world

1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:37.540
 without completely going, like diving deep,

1:12:37.540 --> 1:12:39.720
 because it seems like that's what happens.

1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:42.500
 People can't look at Jeffrey Epstein.

1:12:42.500 --> 1:12:44.000
 I can tell you what the advice I'd have

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:48.040
 is, seriously and rigorously, without going,

1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:49.760
 because you can look at Jeffrey Epstein

1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:52.320
 and say there's a deeper thing.

1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:53.880
 You can always go deeper.

1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:55.840
 It's like Jeffrey Epstein was just a tool

1:12:55.840 --> 1:12:59.760
 of the lizard people, and the lizard people are the tool.

1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:02.980
 Well, they say Satanists, in this case.

1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:06.520
 Somehow, recently, very popular,

1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:08.720
 spedophiles somehow always involved.

1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:11.820
 I'm not understanding any of that.

1:13:11.820 --> 1:13:15.160
 Legitimately, I say this both humorously and seriously.

1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:18.960
 I need to look into it, and I guess the bigger question

1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:21.920
 I'm asking, how does a serious human being,

1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:25.920
 somebody with a position at a respectable university,

1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:28.160
 look at a conspiracy theory and look into it?

1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:30.600
 When I look at somebody like Jeffrey Epstein,

1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:35.600
 who had a role at MIT, and I think I'm not happy,

1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:40.600
 personally, I wasn't there when Jeffrey Epstein was there.

1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:45.880
 I'm not happy with the behavior of people now

1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:49.360
 about Jeffrey Epstein, about the bureaucracy

1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:51.600
 and the everybody's trying to keep quiet,

1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:55.840
 hoping it blows over, without really looking into any,

1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:59.560
 looking in a deep philosophical way

1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:03.760
 of how do we let this human being be among us?

1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:08.000
 Can I give you a better example that is conspiratorial?

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.000
 The Speaker of the House,

1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:10.960
 the longest serving Republican Speaker of the House,

1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:12.960
 Dennis Hastert, was a pedophile.

1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:14.480
 He went to jail.

1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:16.040
 The Democrats don't throw this

1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:18.320
 in the Republicans faces every five minutes.

1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:19.640
 Not even Democratic activists.

1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:23.600
 I find that very, very odd, and not what I would predict.

1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:26.200
 Now, I'm not saying there's some kind of conspiracy,

1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:28.980
 but when it comes to things like sexual predation,

1:14:28.980 --> 1:14:31.640
 which is something that I'm very, very concerned about.

1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:32.480
 I have an uncle now.

1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:33.880
 My sister just had her second kid recently.

1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:34.760
 He's adorable.

1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:40.760
 It's something that I don't understand.

1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:44.120
 It feels as if there's a lot of people

1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:45.780
 who want this to all go away.

1:14:45.780 --> 1:14:47.800
 Now, I think it's also because we don't have

1:14:47.800 --> 1:14:50.200
 the vocabulary and framework to discuss it,

1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:52.240
 because when you start talking about things like children

1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:55.600
 and these kind of issues, we want to believe it's all crap,

1:14:55.600 --> 1:14:56.880
 because it's, for those of us

1:14:56.880 --> 1:14:58.440
 who aren't in this kind of mindset,

1:14:58.440 --> 1:15:01.160
 the idea that this happens to kids and happens frequently

1:15:01.160 --> 1:15:03.720
 is something so horrible that it's just like,

1:15:03.720 --> 1:15:04.800
 I don't even want to hear it,

1:15:04.800 --> 1:15:07.320
 and that does these children and adult survivors

1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:08.720
 an enormous disservice.

1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:11.340
 So I don't know that I have any particular insight on this.

1:15:11.340 --> 1:15:14.800
 But see, how do you, the Catholic Church,

1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:17.120
 again, there's all these topics that.

1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:20.000
 Public school teachers are far more proportionately

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.940
 peders of children than the Catholic Church.

1:15:21.940 --> 1:15:24.640
 Man, I don't know what, you're right, you're right.

1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:29.640
 Perhaps I've been reading a lot about Stalin and Hitler,

1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:32.840
 somehow it's more comforting to be able to.

1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:34.320
 Yeah, because it's there, and then.

1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:38.520
 And then, and then the atrocities that are happening now,

1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:39.920
 it's a little bit more difficult because.

1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:41.600
 There was a New York Times article, sorry to interrupt you,

1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:45.320
 where they had people tracking down child pornography.

1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:47.560
 And I think the article said they didn't have enough people

1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:51.400
 just to cover the videotapes of infants being raped.

1:15:51.400 --> 1:15:54.520
 And we can even wrap our heads around reading Lolita,

1:15:54.520 --> 1:15:57.440
 like, okay, she's 14, 12, okay, it's still a female.

1:15:57.440 --> 1:15:59.760
 An infant, it's something that,

1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:01.480
 again, like with the Stalin example,

1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:02.740
 we sat down here for a hundred years,

1:16:02.740 --> 1:16:03.840
 we would never think of something like this,

1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:06.600
 think of it in a sexual context, it makes no sense.

1:16:06.600 --> 1:16:08.820
 So, and the fact that this is international,

1:16:08.820 --> 1:16:11.280
 okay, we eliminated completely in America.

1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:12.760
 Well, then they're gonna go find,

1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:14.240
 there's infants all over the world,

1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:15.840
 there's video cameras all over the world.

1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:18.420
 So then it has to become a conspiracy

1:16:18.420 --> 1:16:20.780
 because someone has to film it, I'm filming it,

1:16:20.780 --> 1:16:23.120
 you're buying it, your kid.

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:25.520
 It is literally a conspiratorial,

1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:27.360
 not in the sense of like a mafia conspiracy

1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:29.360
 or some government illuminati,

1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:33.980
 but there is our networks designed to produce this product.

1:16:33.980 --> 1:16:38.480
 See, but like what I'm trying to do now,

1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:40.360
 and part of the, one of the nice things

1:16:40.360 --> 1:16:43.000
 with like a podcast and other things I'm involved with

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:46.720
 is removing myself from having any kind of boss

1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:48.200
 so I can do whatever that helps.

1:16:48.200 --> 1:16:50.280
 Oh, it's so wonderful, that just happened to me,

1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:52.480
 it's the most wonderful thing ever.

1:16:52.480 --> 1:16:55.520
 So I could do, I can actually, in moderation,

1:16:55.520 --> 1:16:57.760
 consider like look into stuff.

1:16:57.760 --> 1:16:59.880
 Careful though, I was gonna write a book about this

1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:00.920
 that people pointed out,

1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:02.960
 you sure wanna do this research?

1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:04.040
 Because if you start Googling around

1:17:04.040 --> 1:17:06.660
 for this kind of stuff, it's on your computer.

1:17:06.660 --> 1:17:09.800
 Oh, in that sense, I'm more concerned about,

1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:11.080
 you know, it's the Nietzsche thing,

1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:13.760
 looking into the abyss, like you wanna be very,

1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:16.660
 I believe I can do this kind of thing in moderation

1:17:16.660 --> 1:17:19.280
 without slipping into the depths.

1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:23.520
 I think that's intelligence, that's like,

1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:26.760
 I recently quote unquote looked into like

1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:30.640
 the UFO community, the extraterrestrial,

1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:32.040
 whatever community.

1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:34.560
 I think it always frustrated me

1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:37.240
 that the scientific community like rolled their eyes

1:17:37.240 --> 1:17:40.040
 at all the UFO sightings, all that kind of stuff.

1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:42.760
 Even though there could be fascinating, beautiful,

1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:44.720
 physical fun, like, first of all,

1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:46.320
 there could legit. Like ball lightning.

1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:49.960
 The ball lightning, right, that's at the very basic level

1:17:49.960 --> 1:17:51.840
 is a fascinating thing.

1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:56.840
 And also, it could be something like,

1:17:57.040 --> 1:17:59.500
 I mean, I don't know, but it could be something interesting,

1:17:59.500 --> 1:18:02.080
 like worth looking into.

1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:04.240
 My grandfather was an air traffic controller

1:18:04.240 --> 1:18:05.800
 back in the Soviet Union.

1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:08.280
 And he said, we saw this stuff all the time.

1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:09.800
 These are planes that were not moving

1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:11.400
 or whatever things that were not moving

1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:13.400
 according to anything we knew about.

1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:14.640
 So it's absolutely real.

1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:18.040
 He's not some jerk with an iPhone in his backyard.

1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:22.640
 This is a military professional who understood technology,

1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:24.120
 who knew where the secret bases were.

1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:27.700
 So if he's telling me, it doesn't mean it's Martians,

1:18:27.700 --> 1:18:29.160
 but he's telling me there's something there.

1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:31.560
 And there are many examples of these like military people.

1:18:31.560 --> 1:18:33.320
 These aren't some layman who sees a store.

1:18:33.320 --> 1:18:34.160
 Yeah, these are legit people.

1:18:34.160 --> 1:18:37.560
 Yeah, and so you can dismiss,

1:18:37.560 --> 1:18:38.680
 when you're talking about professionals

1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:40.280
 who are around aircraft all the time,

1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:42.440
 who are familiar with aircraft at the highest levels,

1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:45.000
 and they're seeing things that they can't explain,

1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:46.240
 they're clearly not stupid

1:18:46.240 --> 1:18:47.360
 and they're clearly not under form.

1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:49.880
 So there's different ways to dismiss it.

1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:53.240
 For example, you were saying

1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:55.520
 that trolling is a good mechanism.

1:18:55.520 --> 1:18:57.980
 I'm against that, but I'm not dismissing it

1:18:57.980 --> 1:19:00.480
 by like rolling my eyes.

1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:04.240
 I'm considering legitimately that you're way smarter than me

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:05.800
 and you understand the world better than me.

1:19:05.800 --> 1:19:08.200
 Like I'm allowing myself to consider that possibility

1:19:08.200 --> 1:19:09.040
 and thinking about it.

1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:12.960
 Like maybe that's true, like seriously considering it.

1:19:12.960 --> 1:19:17.120
 That's what I feel the way people should approach

1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:20.040
 intelligent people, serious quote unquote people,

1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:22.400
 scientists should approach conspiracy theories.

1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:26.680
 Like look at it carefully.

1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:29.400
 First of all, is it possible that the earth is flat?

1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:32.560
 It's not trivial to show that the earth is not flat.

1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:33.720
 It's a very good exercise.

1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:34.560
 You should go through it.

1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:35.400
 Yes.

1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:36.400
 But once you go through it,

1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:41.120
 you realize that based on a lot of data

1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:42.360
 and a lot of evidence,

1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:43.680
 and there's a lot of different experiments

1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:45.600
 you can do yourself actually

1:19:45.600 --> 1:19:47.200
 to show that the earth is not flat.

1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:48.040
 Okay.

1:19:48.040 --> 1:19:50.840
 The same kind of process can be taken

1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:52.960
 for a lot of different conspiracy theories

1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:54.120
 and it's helpful.

1:19:54.120 --> 1:19:58.640
 And without slipping into the depths of lizard people

1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:00.520
 running everything.

1:20:00.520 --> 1:20:04.120
 That's where I've now listened to two episodes

1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:08.600
 of Alex Jones's show

1:20:08.600 --> 1:20:12.120
 because he goes crazy deep

1:20:12.120 --> 1:20:16.880
 into different kind of worldviews

1:20:16.880 --> 1:20:18.240
 that I was not familiar with.

1:20:18.240 --> 1:20:19.120
 Right.

1:20:19.120 --> 1:20:20.560
 And I don't know what to make of it.

1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:22.000
 I mean, the reason I've been listening to it

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:25.520
 is because there's been a lot of discussions

1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:27.280
 about platforming of different people.

1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:28.120
 Yeah.

1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:30.880
 And I've been thinking about what does censorship mean?

1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:34.320
 I've been thinking about whether,

1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:39.320
 because Joe Rogan said he's gonna have Alex on again.

1:20:39.320 --> 1:20:43.640
 And then I enjoyed it as a fan,

1:20:43.640 --> 1:20:45.240
 just the entertainment of it.

1:20:45.240 --> 1:20:47.520
 But then I actually listened to Alex

1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:49.720
 and I was thinking,

1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:53.120
 is this human being dangerous for the world?

1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:55.520
 Like is the ideas he's saying dangerous for the world?

1:20:55.520 --> 1:20:57.400
 I'm more concerned with the Russian conspiracy

1:20:57.400 --> 1:20:59.120
 that we had for three years.

1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:01.560
 The claim that our election was not legitimate

1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:02.900
 and that everyone in the Trump White House

1:21:02.900 --> 1:21:04.320
 is a stooge of Putin.

1:21:04.320 --> 1:21:07.200
 And the people who said this had no consequences for this.

1:21:07.200 --> 1:21:10.060
 Alex Jones doesn't have the respect that they do.

1:21:10.060 --> 1:21:12.080
 These are both areas of concern for me.

1:21:12.080 --> 1:21:15.320
 But he might if he's given more platform.

1:21:15.320 --> 1:21:18.280
 So like the people who've,

1:21:18.280 --> 1:21:19.760
 and I'd be curious to,

1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:22.280
 I'm also a little bit,

1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:24.080
 I don't know what to think about the idea

1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:27.200
 that Russians hacked the election.

1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:30.480
 That it seems too easily accepted in the mainstream media.

1:21:30.480 --> 1:21:33.940
 Hillary Clinton said that how they did it

1:21:33.940 --> 1:21:37.620
 was they had ads on the dark web.

1:21:37.620 --> 1:21:40.360
 Now you and I both know what the dark web is.

1:21:40.360 --> 1:21:43.040
 So the possibility of ads on the dark web

1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:47.140
 having a proportional influence on the election

1:21:47.140 --> 1:21:48.380
 is literally zero.

1:21:48.380 --> 1:21:50.060
 Perhaps I should look into it more carefully,

1:21:50.060 --> 1:21:53.860
 but I've found very little good data

1:21:53.860 --> 1:21:58.220
 on exactly what did the Russians do to hack elections.

1:21:58.220 --> 1:22:00.080
 Like technically speaking,

1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:01.320
 what are we talking about here?

1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:03.780
 Like as opposed to these kind of weird,

1:22:03.780 --> 1:22:05.640
 like the best thing there's a couple of books

1:22:05.640 --> 1:22:09.360
 and like reporting on like farms.

1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:10.200
 Like it's.

1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:11.020
 Troll farms, yeah.

1:22:11.020 --> 1:22:12.080
 Troll farms.

1:22:12.080 --> 1:22:14.720
 But let's see the data.

1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:16.720
 Like how many exactly?

1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:17.720
 What are we talking about?

1:22:17.720 --> 1:22:19.880
 Like what were they doing?

1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:22.960
 Not just like some anecdotal discussions of,

1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:26.700
 but like relative to the bigger,

1:22:26.700 --> 1:22:28.720
 the size of Facebook.

1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:32.120
 Like if there's a few people, several hundreds,

1:22:32.120 --> 1:22:36.640
 say posting different political things on Facebook

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:39.680
 relative to the full size of Facebook.

1:22:39.680 --> 1:22:41.680
 Let's look at the full size.

1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:42.800
 Right, you're thinking like a scientist.

1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:43.640
 The actual impact.

1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:44.480
 Yeah.

1:22:44.480 --> 1:22:47.480
 Like, cause it's fascinating the social dynamics

1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:50.440
 of viral information of videos.

1:22:50.440 --> 1:22:53.800
 When Donald Trump retweets something,

1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:56.520
 I think that's understudied the effect of that.

1:22:56.520 --> 1:23:01.520
 Like he retweeted a clip with Joe Rogan

1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:05.480
 and Mike Tyson, where Mike Tyson says

1:23:05.480 --> 1:23:08.020
 that he finds fighting orgasmic.

1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:10.880
 I don't understand that, but they'd be fascinating

1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:12.640
 to think like what is the ripple effect

1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:16.740
 on the social dynamic of our society

1:23:16.740 --> 1:23:19.640
 from retweeting a clip about Mike Tyson.

1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:22.320
 What's your favorite Trump tweet?

1:23:22.320 --> 1:23:26.800
 I tuned them out a long time ago, unfortunately.

1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:31.800
 I have, this goes to the,

1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:35.400
 you and I have a different relationship with Donald Trump.

1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:37.360
 You appreciate the art form of trolling.

1:23:37.360 --> 1:23:38.200
 Sexual versus nonsexual.

1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:39.560
 Nonsexual, yeah.

1:23:39.560 --> 1:23:44.320
 So I tend to prefer Bill Clinton.

1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:45.160
 He's more my type.

1:23:45.160 --> 1:23:46.000
 No, I'm just kidding.

1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:47.240
 I don't know.

1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:48.760
 You don't like that consent stuff.

1:23:48.760 --> 1:23:50.060
 No, the consent, no.

1:23:50.060 --> 1:23:53.460
 No, you appreciate the art form of trolling

1:23:53.460 --> 1:23:57.060
 and Donald Trump is a master.

1:23:57.060 --> 1:24:00.140
 He's the da Vinci of trolling.

1:24:00.140 --> 1:24:03.580
 So I tend to think that trolling

1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:05.860
 is ultimately destructive for society

1:24:05.860 --> 1:24:07.940
 and then Donald Trump takes nothing seriously.

1:24:07.940 --> 1:24:09.100
 He's playing a game.

1:24:09.100 --> 1:24:10.500
 He's making a game out of everything.

1:24:10.500 --> 1:24:11.420
 He takes a lot of things seriously.

1:24:11.420 --> 1:24:14.620
 I think he's very committed to international peace.

1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:16.780
 Sorry, I shouldn't speak so strong.

1:24:16.780 --> 1:24:18.900
 I think he takes, actually, yes,

1:24:18.900 --> 1:24:20.500
 a lot of things seriously.

1:24:20.500 --> 1:24:25.260
 I meant on Twitter and the game of politics.

1:24:25.260 --> 1:24:26.100
 Yeah.

1:24:26.100 --> 1:24:29.540
 He is, he only takes.

1:24:29.540 --> 1:24:30.460
 Irreverently.

1:24:30.460 --> 1:24:31.300
 Yeah.

1:24:31.300 --> 1:24:32.140
 Yeah.

1:24:32.140 --> 1:24:35.100
 And I appreciate it.

1:24:35.100 --> 1:24:37.900
 I just would like to focus on

1:24:39.140 --> 1:24:43.380
 genuine, real expressions of humanity,

1:24:43.380 --> 1:24:44.660
 especially positive.

1:24:44.660 --> 1:24:45.580
 Well, this is one.

1:24:45.580 --> 1:24:46.620
 This is my favorite tweet.

1:24:46.620 --> 1:24:48.780
 My fans got it lasered, etched,

1:24:48.780 --> 1:24:50.940
 and put in a block of Lucite for me.

1:24:50.940 --> 1:24:54.940
 And he said, every time I speak of the losers and haters,

1:24:54.940 --> 1:24:56.740
 I do so with great affection.

1:24:56.740 --> 1:24:59.500
 They cannot help the fact that they were born fucked up.

1:24:59.500 --> 1:25:00.740
 That's an actual Trump tweet.

1:25:00.740 --> 1:25:01.940
 It's my favorite one.

1:25:03.580 --> 1:25:04.580
 And that's kind of nice.

1:25:04.580 --> 1:25:05.420
 And that's love.

1:25:05.420 --> 1:25:06.260
 That's love.

1:25:06.260 --> 1:25:07.100
 That's kind of nice.

1:25:07.100 --> 1:25:08.620
 Great affection.

1:25:08.620 --> 1:25:11.300
 That, I mean.

1:25:11.300 --> 1:25:12.420
 Exclamation point.

1:25:12.420 --> 1:25:17.420
 I broke Lex.

1:25:19.220 --> 1:25:20.340
 What is love?

1:25:21.500 --> 1:25:22.900
 Yeah, the sparks are flying.

1:25:22.900 --> 1:25:25.860
 But I have to kind of analyze that

1:25:25.860 --> 1:25:27.500
 from a literary perspective,

1:25:27.500 --> 1:25:29.860
 but it seems like there's love in there.

1:25:29.860 --> 1:25:30.700
 Like a little bit.

1:25:30.700 --> 1:25:31.540
 Yeah.

1:25:31.540 --> 1:25:32.940
 It's a little bit lighthearted.

1:25:32.940 --> 1:25:34.900
 Cause he's saying, even when I'm going after them,

1:25:34.900 --> 1:25:36.260
 don't take it so seriously.

1:25:36.260 --> 1:25:37.100
 Yeah.

1:25:37.100 --> 1:25:37.940
 That's nice.

1:25:37.940 --> 1:25:38.780
 It is nice.

1:25:38.780 --> 1:25:39.980
 That's acknowledging the game of it.

1:25:39.980 --> 1:25:40.820
 Yes.

1:25:40.820 --> 1:25:41.980
 That's nice.

1:25:41.980 --> 1:25:43.460
 He's not always.

1:25:43.460 --> 1:25:45.020
 There's some things he's very, very vicious.

1:25:45.020 --> 1:25:45.860
 Yeah.

1:25:45.860 --> 1:25:46.700
 Very vicious.

1:25:46.700 --> 1:25:48.540
 He's done things that I can tell you about

1:25:48.540 --> 1:25:51.180
 that I'm like, this is a bad person.

1:25:51.180 --> 1:25:53.100
 What do you think about one of the,

1:25:53.100 --> 1:25:55.340
 okay, listen, I'm not,

1:25:55.340 --> 1:25:56.420
 for people listening,

1:25:56.420 --> 1:25:59.700
 I do not have Trump derangement syndrome.

1:25:59.700 --> 1:26:01.660
 I don't, I see,

1:26:01.660 --> 1:26:04.620
 I try to look for the good and the bad in everybody.

1:26:05.580 --> 1:26:07.900
 One thing, perhaps it's irrational,

1:26:07.900 --> 1:26:10.340
 but perhaps because I've been reading history,

1:26:10.340 --> 1:26:14.540
 I, the one triggering thing for me

1:26:14.540 --> 1:26:17.300
 is the delaying of elections.

1:26:18.460 --> 1:26:20.100
 I believe in elections.

1:26:20.100 --> 1:26:24.820
 And this is the part that you probably disagree with,

1:26:24.820 --> 1:26:29.420
 but I, you know, I believe in the value of people voting.

1:26:29.420 --> 1:26:32.340
 And I just seen too many dictators,

1:26:32.340 --> 1:26:34.180
 the place where they finally,

1:26:34.180 --> 1:26:36.340
 the big switch happens

1:26:36.340 --> 1:26:39.780
 when you question the legitimacy of elections.

1:26:39.780 --> 1:26:41.540
 Who's been questioning the legitimacy of elections

1:26:41.540 --> 1:26:43.100
 for the last three years?

1:26:43.100 --> 1:26:45.660
 I've only heard Donald Trump do it last year,

1:26:45.660 --> 1:26:48.540
 but the last three years you're saying somebody else?

1:26:48.540 --> 1:26:51.340
 You don't think, not my president, illegitimate,

1:26:51.340 --> 1:26:52.980
 we're not gonna normalize him as president,

1:26:52.980 --> 1:26:55.540
 Russia hacked this election, impeached,

1:26:55.540 --> 1:26:56.380
 you're not a real president.

1:26:56.380 --> 1:26:59.140
 You don't think that's questioning the legitimacy of 2016?

1:26:59.140 --> 1:27:02.100
 Nah, it's a good, I haven't been paying attention enough,

1:27:02.100 --> 1:27:05.780
 but I would imagine that argument has been,

1:27:05.780 --> 1:27:08.900
 that I haven't actually heard too many people,

1:27:08.900 --> 1:27:12.340
 but I imagine that's been a popular thing to say.

1:27:12.340 --> 1:27:16.620
 Okay, I, but nevertheless, that's a part,

1:27:16.620 --> 1:27:19.420
 that didn't, that's not a statement

1:27:19.420 --> 1:27:21.580
 that gained power enough to say

1:27:22.500 --> 1:27:27.100
 that Barack Obama will keep being president

1:27:27.100 --> 1:27:30.380
 or Hillary Clinton should be president.

1:27:30.380 --> 1:27:31.340
 Newsweek had that article,

1:27:31.340 --> 1:27:34.100
 how Hillary Clinton could still be president, Newsweek.

1:27:34.100 --> 1:27:35.780
 No, but she's not.

1:27:35.780 --> 1:27:36.620
 That's what I'm saying.

1:27:36.620 --> 1:27:41.220
 My worry isn't, my worry isn't saying

1:27:41.220 --> 1:27:43.020
 that the election was illegitimate

1:27:43.020 --> 1:27:45.500
 and people whining at a mass scale

1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:49.340
 and then Fox News or CNN reporting for years

1:27:49.340 --> 1:27:51.060
 or books being written for years.

1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:54.900
 My worry is legitimately martial law.

1:27:54.900 --> 1:27:57.860
 A person stays president.

1:27:57.860 --> 1:27:59.140
 So here's the issue.

1:27:59.140 --> 1:28:02.500
 Like there's a phase shift that happens in a dictatorship.

1:28:02.500 --> 1:28:04.260
 I did a book on North Korea.

1:28:04.260 --> 1:28:06.900
 I'm not someone who thinks dictatorship should be taken

1:28:06.900 --> 1:28:07.740
 lightly.

1:28:07.740 --> 1:28:09.940
 I'm not someone who thinks it can't happen here.

1:28:09.940 --> 1:28:12.220
 I think a lot of times people are desperate

1:28:12.220 --> 1:28:13.100
 for dictatorship.

1:28:13.100 --> 1:28:14.100
 So I am with you.

1:28:14.100 --> 1:28:15.460
 And I think this is something,

1:28:15.460 --> 1:28:17.020
 if you're gonna hand wave it away,

1:28:17.020 --> 1:28:18.380
 everyone else hand waved it away.

1:28:18.380 --> 1:28:19.500
 Hitler's never gonna be chancellor.

1:28:19.500 --> 1:28:20.340
 He's like lunatic.

1:28:20.340 --> 1:28:21.180
 Oh, please.

1:28:21.180 --> 1:28:22.020
 He's a joke.

1:28:22.020 --> 1:28:22.860
 He's a joke.

1:28:22.860 --> 1:28:24.900
 They couldn't find a publisher for Mein Kampf in English

1:28:24.900 --> 1:28:28.140
 because this is some guy from some random minor party

1:28:28.140 --> 1:28:29.500
 in Germany spouting nonsense.

1:28:29.500 --> 1:28:31.220
 Who's gonna read this crap?

1:28:31.220 --> 1:28:33.260
 So I completely agree with you in that regard.

1:28:33.260 --> 1:28:34.300
 I don't think we're there.

1:28:34.300 --> 1:28:37.820
 My point is Donald Trump this year

1:28:37.820 --> 1:28:42.580
 had every pathway open to him to declare martial law.

1:28:42.580 --> 1:28:44.460
 The cities are being burned down.

1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:47.260
 He could have very easily sent in the tanks

1:28:47.260 --> 1:28:49.500
 and people would have been applauding him from his side.

1:28:49.500 --> 1:28:50.540
 You make me feel so good right now.

1:28:50.540 --> 1:28:51.620
 But am I wrong though?

1:28:51.620 --> 1:28:52.460
 No, I...

1:28:52.460 --> 1:28:56.020
 What he did, he tweeted out to Mayor Wheeler of Portland.

1:28:56.020 --> 1:28:58.420
 He said, call me.

1:28:58.420 --> 1:29:03.180
 We will solve this in minutes, but you have to call.

1:29:03.180 --> 1:29:06.500
 And he sat in his hands and they said, oh, it's his fault.

1:29:06.500 --> 1:29:07.500
 The city is burning down.

1:29:07.500 --> 1:29:08.340
 He's not doing anything.

1:29:08.340 --> 1:29:10.100
 And he goes, I'm not doing anything

1:29:10.100 --> 1:29:12.220
 until you ask me to do it.

1:29:12.220 --> 1:29:13.980
 So I think that is,

1:29:13.980 --> 1:29:16.900
 even if you think he's an aspiring dictator,

1:29:16.900 --> 1:29:20.700
 that is at least a sign that there is some restraint

1:29:20.700 --> 1:29:22.220
 on his aspirations.

1:29:23.380 --> 1:29:28.380
 Can I just take that in as a beautiful moment of hope?

1:29:29.380 --> 1:29:30.700
 So I'm gonna remember this moment.

1:29:30.700 --> 1:29:33.660
 I'm gonna miss Ted Cruz, beautiful Ted.

1:29:33.660 --> 1:29:34.500
 I'm gonna remember that.

1:29:34.500 --> 1:29:39.500
 I mean, I should say that perhaps I'm irrationally,

1:29:39.740 --> 1:29:41.580
 this is the one moment where I feel myself

1:29:41.580 --> 1:29:42.980
 being a little unhealthy.

1:29:42.980 --> 1:29:44.140
 I don't think you're being irrational.

1:29:44.140 --> 1:29:46.300
 I think there's an asymmetry

1:29:46.300 --> 1:29:48.500
 because it's kind of like, okay,

1:29:48.500 --> 1:29:51.100
 either if I leave the house, it's like Russian roulette.

1:29:51.100 --> 1:29:52.700
 Yeah, maybe it's like a one in six shot.

1:29:52.700 --> 1:29:54.340
 I'm pulling the trigger, I'm killing myself,

1:29:54.340 --> 1:29:56.140
 but that's one in six.

1:29:56.140 --> 1:29:59.340
 That's not, and the consequences are so dire

1:29:59.340 --> 1:30:01.660
 that a little paranoia would go a long way.

1:30:01.660 --> 1:30:02.500
 There's something that.

1:30:02.500 --> 1:30:04.140
 But you can't go back.

1:30:04.140 --> 1:30:05.220
 Yeah.

1:30:05.220 --> 1:30:06.580
 It's an asymmetry, yeah.

1:30:06.580 --> 1:30:11.580
 The thing is, the thing that makes Donald Trump new to me,

1:30:11.660 --> 1:30:14.620
 and again, I'm a little naive in these things,

1:30:14.620 --> 1:30:18.660
 but he surprised me

1:30:19.620 --> 1:30:23.900
 in how many ways he just didn't play by the rules.

1:30:23.900 --> 1:30:25.220
 Yeah.

1:30:25.220 --> 1:30:30.220
 And he's made me, a little ant in this ant colony,

1:30:30.500 --> 1:30:34.460
 think like, well, do you have to play by the rules at all?

1:30:34.460 --> 1:30:35.300
 Right.

1:30:35.300 --> 1:30:38.180
 Like, why are we having elections?

1:30:38.180 --> 1:30:41.500
 Why did you say, like, it's coronavirus time?

1:30:41.500 --> 1:30:44.780
 Like, it's not healthy to have elections.

1:30:44.780 --> 1:30:47.140
 Like, we shouldn't be, like, I could,

1:30:47.140 --> 1:30:48.820
 if I put my dictator hat on.

1:30:48.820 --> 1:30:52.180
 Nancy Pelosi said that Joe Biden shouldn't debate.

1:30:52.180 --> 1:30:53.940
 Yeah, did she?

1:30:53.940 --> 1:30:54.820
 Yes.

1:30:54.820 --> 1:30:56.980
 She says she shouldn't dignify Trump with a debate.

1:30:56.980 --> 1:30:57.820
 He's the president.

1:30:57.820 --> 1:30:59.180
 He could be the worst president on earth,

1:30:59.180 --> 1:31:01.020
 evil, despicable monster.

1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:02.100
 I'll take that as an argument.

1:31:02.100 --> 1:31:03.660
 So she's playing politics, but she's.

1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:04.780
 I don't think that's playing politics.

1:31:04.780 --> 1:31:08.100
 I think when there's a certain point where things get,

1:31:08.100 --> 1:31:10.220
 when you start attacking institutions

1:31:10.220 --> 1:31:14.020
 for the emergencies of the moment and acting arbitrarily,

1:31:14.020 --> 1:31:15.940
 that is when things are the slippery slope.

1:31:15.940 --> 1:31:18.900
 Yeah, so you're saying debates is one of the institutions.

1:31:18.900 --> 1:31:21.020
 Like, that's one of the traditions to have the debates.

1:31:21.020 --> 1:31:23.300
 I think the debates are extremely important.

1:31:23.300 --> 1:31:25.420
 And now I don't think that someone's a good debater

1:31:25.420 --> 1:31:26.540
 is gonna make a good president.

1:31:26.540 --> 1:31:27.780
 I mean, that's a big problem.

1:31:27.780 --> 1:31:29.140
 But you're just saying this is attacking

1:31:29.140 --> 1:31:32.300
 just yet another tradition, yet another.

1:31:32.300 --> 1:31:33.300
 You know, like, how if you're dating,

1:31:33.300 --> 1:31:34.220
 if you're married to someone

1:31:34.220 --> 1:31:35.660
 and someone throws out the word divorce,

1:31:35.660 --> 1:31:38.020
 you can't unring that bell, you threw it out there.

1:31:38.020 --> 1:31:40.260
 I'm saying you don't throw things out like that

1:31:40.260 --> 1:31:43.620
 unless you really are ready to go down this road.

1:31:43.620 --> 1:31:44.660
 And I think that is,

1:31:44.660 --> 1:31:46.540
 there's nothing in the constitution about debates.

1:31:46.540 --> 1:31:48.220
 We've only had them since 1980,

1:31:48.220 --> 1:31:51.060
 but still, I think they are extremely important.

1:31:51.060 --> 1:31:52.780
 It's also a great chance for Joe Biden

1:31:52.780 --> 1:31:55.140
 to tell him to his face, you're full of crap,

1:31:55.140 --> 1:31:56.260
 here's what you did, here's what you did,

1:31:56.260 --> 1:31:57.100
 here's what you did.

1:31:57.100 --> 1:32:01.300
 So fascinating that you're both, you acknowledge that,

1:32:01.300 --> 1:32:03.820
 and yet you also see the value

1:32:03.820 --> 1:32:06.300
 of tearing down the entire thing.

1:32:06.300 --> 1:32:09.500
 So you're both worried about no debates,

1:32:09.500 --> 1:32:11.260
 or at least in your voice, in your tone.

1:32:11.260 --> 1:32:13.940
 There's a great quote by Chesterton.

1:32:13.940 --> 1:32:15.520
 I'm not a fan of him at all.

1:32:15.520 --> 1:32:17.180
 But he says, before you tear down a fence,

1:32:17.180 --> 1:32:19.260
 make sure you know why they put it up first.

1:32:19.260 --> 1:32:22.580
 So I am for tearing it all down,

1:32:22.580 --> 1:32:24.300
 but there's something called like a controlled demolition,

1:32:24.300 --> 1:32:26.460
 like building sevens, or there's.

1:32:26.460 --> 1:32:27.300
 Allegedly.

1:32:29.500 --> 1:32:30.900
 We knew we were in Tel Aviv.

1:32:32.540 --> 1:32:34.460
 Hashtag building seven.

1:32:34.460 --> 1:32:36.060
 We knew we were in Tel Aviv.

1:32:36.060 --> 1:32:37.700
 Wow, you're faster than me.

1:32:37.700 --> 1:32:40.580
 You're operating in a different level.

1:32:40.580 --> 1:32:43.260
 I need to upgrade my operating system.

1:32:43.260 --> 1:32:45.260
 I told you Windows 95.

1:32:45.260 --> 1:32:46.740
 You're trying, yeah.

1:32:48.580 --> 1:32:49.660
 Building seven.

1:32:49.660 --> 1:32:52.340
 If you're gonna, it's like Indiana Jones, right?

1:32:52.340 --> 1:32:54.220
 If you're gonna pull something away,

1:32:54.220 --> 1:32:55.820
 make sure you have something in place first,

1:32:55.820 --> 1:32:56.980
 as opposed to just breaking it,

1:32:56.980 --> 1:32:59.540
 and then just, especially in politics,

1:32:59.540 --> 1:33:00.940
 because it escalates.

1:33:00.940 --> 1:33:04.220
 And when things escalate without any kind of response,

1:33:04.220 --> 1:33:07.060
 it can go in a very bad, that's when Napoleon comes in.

1:33:07.060 --> 1:33:12.060
 So what's your prediction about the Biden Trump debates?

1:33:14.300 --> 1:33:16.700
 Again, I just have this weird,

1:33:16.700 --> 1:33:19.660
 maybe we'll return to maybe not in this,

1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:22.380
 how do we put more love into the world?

1:33:22.380 --> 1:33:25.420
 And one of the things that worries me about the debates

1:33:26.540 --> 1:33:31.540
 is it'll be the world's greatest troll

1:33:32.860 --> 1:33:36.460
 against the grandpa on the porch.

1:33:36.460 --> 1:33:37.540
 Who crapped his pants.

1:33:37.540 --> 1:33:38.660
 Yeah.

1:33:38.660 --> 1:33:42.380
 And it will not put more love into the world.

1:33:42.380 --> 1:33:46.500
 It will create more mockery, like.

1:33:46.500 --> 1:33:50.660
 Joe Biden did a great job against Paul Ryan in 2012.

1:33:50.660 --> 1:33:51.820
 Paul Ryan was no lightweight.

1:33:51.820 --> 1:33:53.180
 No one thought he was a lightweight.

1:33:53.180 --> 1:33:56.700
 Joe Biden handed Sarah Pail in her ass in 2008,

1:33:56.700 --> 1:33:58.100
 which isn't as easy to do as you think,

1:33:58.100 --> 1:33:59.020
 because she's a female.

1:33:59.020 --> 1:34:00.340
 So you're gonna come off as bullying.

1:34:00.340 --> 1:34:01.740
 That's something you have to worry about.

1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:03.740
 So the guy isn't,

1:34:04.820 --> 1:34:08.060
 I think he is in the stages of cognitive decline.

1:34:09.140 --> 1:34:11.140
 So I think it's going to be interesting.

1:34:11.980 --> 1:34:13.620
 I want it to be,

1:34:13.620 --> 1:34:18.100
 like Mike Tyson beating up a child,

1:34:18.100 --> 1:34:20.860
 cause it'll be a source of amusement to me.

1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:22.220
 But I don't know how it's going to go.

1:34:22.220 --> 1:34:24.820
 Is it possible that Joe Biden will be the Mike Tyson?

1:34:24.820 --> 1:34:27.020
 Yes, because in his last debate with Bernie,

1:34:27.020 --> 1:34:28.500
 he was perfectly fine.

1:34:28.500 --> 1:34:30.380
 And again, the guy was a sender for decades.

1:34:30.380 --> 1:34:31.740
 And I don't think anyone,

1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:35.020
 if you looked at Joe Biden in 2010,

1:34:35.020 --> 1:34:36.620
 would have thought this guy is going to be,

1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:37.940
 have his ass handed him a debate.

1:34:37.940 --> 1:34:39.260
 You wouldn't think that at all.

1:34:39.260 --> 1:34:41.460
 So I don't know who we're going to see.

1:34:41.460 --> 1:34:45.100
 Plus he's got a lot of room to attack Trump.

1:34:45.100 --> 1:34:47.500
 So I'm sure he's going to come strapped and ready

1:34:47.500 --> 1:34:49.460
 and he's going to have his talking points

1:34:49.460 --> 1:34:51.980
 and watch Trump dance, try to tap dance around him.

1:34:51.980 --> 1:34:52.820
 And if he's in a position,

1:34:52.820 --> 1:34:54.260
 I don't know what the rules of the debate are,

1:34:54.260 --> 1:34:56.820
 to actually nail him to the wall,

1:34:56.820 --> 1:34:57.660
 it might actually,

1:34:57.660 --> 1:34:59.420
 I'm sure he's going to have a lot of lines too.

1:34:59.420 --> 1:35:01.860
 The problem is Trump is the master counter puncher.

1:35:01.860 --> 1:35:04.180
 So like when Hillary's had her line,

1:35:04.180 --> 1:35:06.820
 she's like, well, it's a good thing that Donald Trump

1:35:06.820 --> 1:35:08.460
 isn't in charge of our legal system.

1:35:08.460 --> 1:35:10.260
 And he's like, yeah, you'd be in jail.

1:35:10.260 --> 1:35:13.980
 It's like, oh, lady, you set him up.

1:35:13.980 --> 1:35:16.700
 That's painful to watch, those debates.

1:35:16.700 --> 1:35:20.500
 I mean, there's something, I think it's actually analogous.

1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:22.060
 I've come to think of it,

1:35:22.060 --> 1:35:24.660
 your conversation with me right now,

1:35:24.660 --> 1:35:28.900
 some Sleepy Joe, I'm playing the role of Sleepy Joe.

1:35:28.900 --> 1:35:32.940
 I actually connect to Joe because there's,

1:35:32.940 --> 1:35:35.180
 I'm also incontinent.

1:35:35.180 --> 1:35:37.540
 There's like these weird pauses that he does.

1:35:37.540 --> 1:35:38.620
 Yes, he does.

1:35:38.620 --> 1:35:42.300
 I do the same thing and it annoys the shit out of me

1:35:42.300 --> 1:35:44.940
 that like in mid sentence,

1:35:44.940 --> 1:35:49.380
 I'll start saying a different thing and take a tangent.

1:35:49.380 --> 1:35:54.380
 I'm not as slow and drunk as I sound, always.

1:35:54.460 --> 1:35:56.460
 I swear I'm more intelligent underneath it.

1:35:56.460 --> 1:35:57.660
 I'm slower but less drunk.

1:35:57.660 --> 1:36:00.140
 Yes, exactly.

1:36:00.140 --> 1:36:03.700
 But the result, one of those is true, but not both, yeah.

1:36:03.700 --> 1:36:08.700
 And Trump, just like you, are a master counter puncher.

1:36:09.140 --> 1:36:11.860
 So it's gonna be messy.

1:36:11.860 --> 1:36:13.380
 Here's the other thing, in all seriousness,

1:36:13.380 --> 1:36:15.340
 Chris Wallace is the moderator.

1:36:15.340 --> 1:36:17.300
 Chris Wallace has interviewed Trump several times

1:36:17.300 --> 1:36:21.360
 and he was a tough, tough questioner.

1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:23.700
 So I don't think he's gonna come in there

1:36:23.700 --> 1:36:25.160
 with softball questions.

1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:28.220
 I think he's really going to try to nail Trump down,

1:36:28.220 --> 1:36:29.620
 which is tough to do.

1:36:29.620 --> 1:36:30.660
 I like him a lot.

1:36:30.660 --> 1:36:32.880
 Yeah, and he's like, Mr. President, sir,

1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:33.920
 that's not accurate, blah, blah, blah.

1:36:33.920 --> 1:36:34.760
 He's done it.

1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:36.340
 And Trump gets very frustrated

1:36:36.340 --> 1:36:38.060
 because he doesn't just let him say whatever he wants

1:36:38.060 --> 1:36:40.120
 and he hits him with the follow up.

1:36:41.980 --> 1:36:43.700
 I guess he's on Fox News.

1:36:43.700 --> 1:36:47.500
 And I listen to his Sunday program every once in a while.

1:36:49.260 --> 1:36:51.260
 He gives me hope that, I don't know,

1:36:51.260 --> 1:36:54.180
 there's something in the voice that he's not bought.

1:36:55.260 --> 1:36:57.260
 There's no question he's gonna take this seriously,

1:36:57.260 --> 1:37:00.720
 which I think is the best you could hope for in a moderator.

1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:03.100
 It feels like there's people that might actually

1:37:03.100 --> 1:37:05.740
 take the mainstream media into a place

1:37:05.740 --> 1:37:08.260
 that's going to be better in the future.

1:37:08.260 --> 1:37:09.740
 And we need people like him.

1:37:09.740 --> 1:37:11.160
 You mean like Robespierre?

1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:12.000
 What do you mean?

1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.380
 Like taking the mainstream media to a better future.

1:37:14.380 --> 1:37:15.980
 Like bring out the guillotines.

1:37:17.980 --> 1:37:21.060
 See, you put your anarchist hat back on.

1:37:21.060 --> 1:37:22.540
 I don't think Robespierre is much of an anarchist,

1:37:22.540 --> 1:37:24.220
 but yeah, I get what you're saying.

1:37:24.220 --> 1:37:26.940
 You don't think there should be a centralized place for news?

1:37:26.940 --> 1:37:27.800
 There isn't now.

1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:31.720
 Well, that's what mainstream media

1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:33.440
 is supposed to represent, and it's broken.

1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:36.840
 Well, it's not whatever, what do you call that?

1:37:36.840 --> 1:37:39.680
 A place where people traditionally said

1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:44.320
 was the legitimate source of truth.

1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:47.200
 That's what the media was supposed to represent, no?

1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:50.240
 That's their big branding accomplishment.

1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:51.840
 That was never true?

1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:53.520
 Yeah, because here's what happens.

1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:55.720
 We remember the Spanish American War,

1:37:55.720 --> 1:37:58.160
 remember the Maine, we have to take Cuba,

1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:00.840
 yellow journalism, William Randolph Hearst, right?

1:38:00.840 --> 1:38:04.200
 Then record scratch, and then we're all objective.

1:38:04.200 --> 1:38:06.480
 Like when did this transition happen according to people?

1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:08.160
 When you were saying that the Kaiser

1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:10.280
 is the worst human being on earth?

1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:12.280
 When you were downplaying Stalin

1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:14.280
 and downplaying Hitler's atrocities?

1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:16.280
 When you were saying we had to be in Vietnam?

1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:19.080
 At what point, WMDs, when did it change?

1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:19.920
 It never changed.

1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:22.360
 You just are better con artists at a certain point,

1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:23.620
 and now the mask is dropping.

1:38:23.620 --> 1:38:27.280
 Yeah, but don't you think there's, at its best,

1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:32.280
 like investigative journalism can uncover truth

1:38:32.320 --> 1:38:37.320
 in a way that like Reddit, subreddits can't?

1:38:39.080 --> 1:38:41.560
 You know, Reddit, sure, I agree.

1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:43.820
 At its best, absolutely, that's not even a dispute.

1:38:43.820 --> 1:38:48.740
 But like, don't you think like fake it until you make it

1:38:48.740 --> 1:38:49.880
 is the right way to do it?

1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:51.100
 Meaning like the.

1:38:51.100 --> 1:38:52.320
 Fake the news?

1:38:52.320 --> 1:38:55.800
 No, no, no, I meant the news saying like,

1:38:55.800 --> 1:38:59.960
 we dream of doing, of arriving at the truth

1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:01.240
 and reporting the truth.

1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:02.080
 They don't say that.

1:39:02.080 --> 1:39:04.680
 CNN had an advertisement that said this is an apple.

1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:06.040
 We only report facts.

1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:07.120
 That's a lie.

1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:10.920
 No, that's now, and now it's clear things have changed.

1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:11.800
 They haven't changed.

1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:14.980
 You're just more, you're more aware of their chicanery.

1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:17.880
 But, okay, so the.

1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:19.320
 How many people died in Iraq?

1:39:19.320 --> 1:39:22.760
 Because Saddam Hussein was about to launch WMDs.

1:39:22.760 --> 1:39:24.000
 Who had consequences for this?

1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:25.400
 No one.

1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:26.480
 This isn't a minor thing.

1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:28.760
 This is lots of dead people.

1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:30.040
 Yeah.

1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:34.240
 And also, I mean, dead people, it's horrible,

1:39:34.240 --> 1:39:36.520
 but also the money, which has, like we said,

1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:37.680
 economic effects that.

1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:39.560
 Marianne Williamson, I think it was, had the,

1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:41.860
 or Trump, both of them had the great point that goes,

1:39:41.860 --> 1:39:42.720
 that's like a trillion dollars.

1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:43.640
 How many schools would that build?

1:39:43.640 --> 1:39:44.480
 How many roads would that build?

1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:46.880
 Even here, why are we building hospitals in Iraq

1:39:46.880 --> 1:39:49.000
 that we destroyed when we could building hospitals here?

1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:49.840
 It makes no sense.

1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:50.660
 It's horrifying.

1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:53.200
 So who's responsible for that?

1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:54.720
 Like who?

1:39:54.720 --> 1:39:55.920
 Alex Jones.

1:39:55.920 --> 1:40:00.920
 No, I meant for, well, so who's responsible

1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:04.560
 for arriving at the truth of that,

1:40:04.560 --> 1:40:09.360
 of speaking to the money spent on the wars in Iraq?

1:40:09.360 --> 1:40:11.800
 This is one of the great things about social media.

1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:13.160
 Twitter, you have faith in Twitter.

1:40:13.160 --> 1:40:14.720
 Not specifically Twitter, but yeah,

1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:16.320
 social media's the whole, what anyone could.

1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:18.240
 Here's another great example.

1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:22.160
 Before, if you were talking about police brutality

1:40:22.160 --> 1:40:24.880
 or these riots, you would have to perceive it

1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:26.800
 in the way it was framed and presented to you.

1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:29.120
 Nicholas Sandman's another example.

1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:30.280
 Breonna Taylor, all these things.

1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:32.160
 Well, we don't have footage of her.

1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:34.160
 You would have to perceive in the way that it's edited

1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:35.920
 and presented to you by the corporate press.

1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:38.300
 Now everyone is a video, has a video camera.

1:40:38.300 --> 1:40:39.900
 Everyone has their perspective.

1:40:39.900 --> 1:40:42.840
 And it's very useful when these incidents happen

1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:45.360
 where you could see the same incident from several angles

1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:48.000
 and you don't need Don Lemon or Chris Wallace

1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:49.040
 to tell me what this means.

1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:50.880
 I can see with my own eyes.

1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:55.560
 Yeah, I've been very pleasantly surprised about the power.

1:40:55.560 --> 1:40:58.280
 See, the mob, again, gets in the way.

1:40:58.280 --> 1:41:03.280
 They get emotional and they destroy the ability

1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:05.040
 for people to reason.

1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:09.960
 But you're right that truth is unobstructed on social media.

1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:14.520
 Like if you're careful and patient, you can see the truth.

1:41:14.520 --> 1:41:16.640
 Like for example, data on COVID,

1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:19.920
 some of the best sources are doctors.

1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:22.480
 Like if you wanna know the truth about the coronavirus

1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:27.400
 and what's happening is there's follow people on Twitter.

1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:29.200
 There's certain people that are just like sourcing them

1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:32.040
 from me versus the CDC and the WHO.

1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:33.680
 It's, that's fast.

1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:36.160
 I mean, well, it's kind of anarchy, right?

1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:37.000
 Yes, it is.

1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:38.940
 It's not kind of, it is anarchy, yes.

1:41:38.940 --> 1:41:41.720
 I mean, well, there's some censorship

1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:42.560
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:43.920
 You have censorship under anarchy

1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:45.000
 in the sense that you're talking about.

1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:47.480
 Like people get kicked off of Twitter.

1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:48.320
 That's a drawing backwards.

1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:49.600
 How do you kick somebody, okay.

1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:50.920
 So, I mean, it's a.

1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:52.360
 Private company.

1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:53.400
 Private company.

1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:56.720
 Most people wouldn't say Twitter is working,

1:41:56.720 --> 1:41:59.420
 but that's probably because they take for granted

1:41:59.420 --> 1:42:01.320
 how well it's working and they're just complaining

1:42:01.320 --> 1:42:03.920
 about the small part of it that's broken.

1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:04.760
 Yeah.

1:42:07.840 --> 1:42:09.360
 Okay, another question about.

1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:10.240
 You feel better?

1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:15.240
 No, by the way, I mean, I had a personal gripe

1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:19.940
 with the situation about the, not a personal gripe,

1:42:19.940 --> 1:42:24.940
 but I felt overly emotional about the possibility

1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:29.440
 that there will be some of Donald Trump

1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:31.760
 messing with the election process,

1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:33.040
 but you made me feel better.

1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:33.880
 Good.

1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:36.560
 Like saying like, if he had a bunch of opportunities

1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:41.560
 to do what I would have done if I was a dictator,

1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:47.080
 I would, the first time those riots over George Floyd,

1:42:47.080 --> 1:42:49.880
 I would have instituted martial law.

1:42:49.880 --> 1:42:52.080
 Do you know what I remember very vividly?

1:42:52.080 --> 1:42:55.160
 Is after 9 11 and everyone was waiting for George Bush

1:42:55.160 --> 1:42:57.920
 to give his speech and he had 98% approved rating.

1:42:57.920 --> 1:42:59.040
 And I remember very vividly,

1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:03.000
 cause if he had said we're suspending the constitution,

1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:04.140
 everyone would have cheered for him.

1:43:04.140 --> 1:43:06.400
 Like he couldn't get enough support at that time.

1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:07.800
 And he didn't do it.

1:43:07.800 --> 1:43:10.720
 And I can't say anything really good about George W. Bush.

1:43:10.720 --> 1:43:12.480
 I'm not a fan of his to say the least.

1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:15.880
 So I think you and I, and other people who are familiar

1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:19.500
 with totalitarian regimes to some extent from our ancestry

1:43:19.500 --> 1:43:22.880
 or whatever, from research should always be the ones

1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:24.640
 freaking out and warning,

1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:28.980
 but we should also be aware of we got a ways to go

1:43:28.980 --> 1:43:30.560
 before it's Hitler.

1:43:30.560 --> 1:43:34.360
 And thankfully there are a lot of dominoes

1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:36.360
 that have to fall into place before Hitler.

1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:38.400
 It's like the game secret Hitler, it's a board game

1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:40.100
 before Hitler becomes Hitler.

1:43:40.100 --> 1:43:43.080
 Like it's not, especially in America,

1:43:43.080 --> 1:43:45.600
 there's lots of things that have to happen

1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:47.600
 before you really get to that point.

1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:50.460
 I mean, FDR was for all intents and purposes a dictator,

1:43:50.460 --> 1:43:52.400
 but even then the worst you could say,

1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:54.580
 and this is not something that you should take lightly

1:43:54.580 --> 1:43:56.540
 was internment of Japanese citizens,

1:43:56.540 --> 1:43:58.040
 but they weren't murdered.

1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:01.800
 They weren't under lock and key in the sense of like in cells.

1:44:01.800 --> 1:44:04.120
 So things could have gotten a lot worse for him.

1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:06.560
 We have to, I mean, Hitler is such a horrible person

1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:07.400
 to bring up because.

1:44:07.400 --> 1:44:08.480
 He's Mussolini.

1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:12.840
 Yeah, Mussolini is better because Hitler is so close

1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:15.600
 and connected to the atrocities of the Holocaust.

1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:17.400
 There's all this stuff that led up to the war

1:44:17.400 --> 1:44:18.240
 and the war itself.

1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:20.760
 Say that there was no Holocaust,

1:44:20.760 --> 1:44:23.440
 Hitler would probably be viewed differently.

1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:24.680
 Yes, I should think so.

1:44:24.680 --> 1:44:26.920
 Well, I mean, but.

1:44:26.920 --> 1:44:29.020
 You think, that's a very controversial stance.

1:44:29.020 --> 1:44:30.240
 You think Hitler would be viewed differently

1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:31.620
 if it wasn't for the Holocaust?

1:44:31.620 --> 1:44:36.620
 Well, I mean, but it's a funny thing that the,

1:44:38.840 --> 1:44:43.840
 I would say the death of how many, 40, 50 million.

1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:46.920
 I mean, I don't know how you calculate it.

1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:50.920
 It's not seen as bad as the 6 million.

1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:52.780
 Oh yeah, because of Mao and Stalin.

1:44:52.780 --> 1:44:56.260
 Yeah, but it's interesting.

1:44:56.260 --> 1:44:57.320
 I'm working on it.

1:44:57.320 --> 1:44:58.160
 You're working on it.

1:44:58.160 --> 1:44:59.000
 Yeah, the next book I'm talking about.

1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:01.040
 Reminding, well, it's good.

1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:02.480
 I'm glad a good writer is,

1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:03.800
 because the world's not reminded.

1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:05.080
 My last book, The New Right,

1:45:05.080 --> 1:45:06.440
 I had to deal with something like the Nazis.

1:45:06.440 --> 1:45:07.560
 And one of the points they make is,

1:45:07.560 --> 1:45:09.020
 how come everyone knows about the Holocaust,

1:45:09.020 --> 1:45:10.640
 but no one knows about the Holodomor?

1:45:10.640 --> 1:45:11.660
 And they're right.

1:45:11.660 --> 1:45:12.700
 We should know about this,

1:45:12.700 --> 1:45:14.640
 because it is a great example of both

1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:17.360
 how the Western media were depraved,

1:45:17.360 --> 1:45:19.680
 but also what human beings are capable of.

1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:22.320
 And those scars are still,

1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:25.080
 many Americans think Russia and Ukraine are the same thing.

1:45:25.080 --> 1:45:27.100
 Oh, Trump's in bed with the Ukrainians,

1:45:27.100 --> 1:45:27.940
 Trump's about the Russians,

1:45:27.940 --> 1:45:29.440
 they think it's the same thing.

1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:31.720
 For us, it's complete lunacy.

1:45:31.720 --> 1:45:33.760
 But this is the kind of thing where Pol Pot

1:45:33.760 --> 1:45:35.240
 is another example,

1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:38.320
 where people have no clue of what has been done

1:45:38.320 --> 1:45:40.000
 to their fellow man on the face of this earth,

1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:41.420
 and they should know.

1:45:41.420 --> 1:45:43.920
 How much of that do you lay at the hands of communism?

1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:46.480
 How much are you with like a Jordan Pearson

1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:51.200
 who is intricately connecting the atrocities,

1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:53.880
 like you're saying, 1930s Ukraine,

1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:55.200
 where people were starved?

1:45:56.200 --> 1:45:58.400
 I recently, my grandmother recently passed away,

1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:02.120
 and she survived that as a kid.

1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:07.120
 Which is, those people, I mean, they're tough.

1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:09.880
 They're tough.

1:46:09.880 --> 1:46:11.960
 Like that whole region is tough,

1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:13.280
 because they survived that,

1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:18.280
 and then right after, occupation of Nazis, of Germans.

1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:24.440
 How much do you lay that at communism as an ideology,

1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:27.920
 versus Stalin, the man?

1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:31.040
 I think Lenin was building concentration camps

1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:33.220
 while he was around, and slave labor.

1:46:34.120 --> 1:46:36.840
 I don't, I think it's clearly both.

1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:38.600
 There are certain variants of communism

1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:41.760
 that were far, like Khrushchev and Gorbachev,

1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:44.600
 the reason the Soviet Union fell apart,

1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:47.000
 and this is kind of, I'm gonna spoil the end of the book.

1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:48.920
 There's an amazing book called Revolution 1989,

1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:50.620
 it's like the most beautiful book I've ever read,

1:46:50.620 --> 1:46:53.300
 by Viktor Sebastian, he's a Hungarian author.

1:46:53.300 --> 1:46:55.320
 And basically what happens in 1989,

1:46:55.320 --> 1:46:56.520
 Poland has their elections,

1:46:56.520 --> 1:46:58.600
 and then in 1990, they kind of let in

1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:00.360
 the labor people to the government.

1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:04.480
 And people start crossing borders in the Eastern Bloc,

1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:06.260
 and you had Hanukkah from Eastern Germany,

1:47:06.260 --> 1:47:09.360
 and Ceausescu from Romania calling Gorbachev,

1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:11.080
 because those are the two toughest ones,

1:47:11.080 --> 1:47:13.040
 by communist standards, they go,

1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:16.280
 they're just escaping, we're gonna lose everything.

1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:18.040
 You gotta send in the tanks, like you did in Hungary,

1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:20.540
 like you did in Czechoslovakia in 68.

1:47:20.540 --> 1:47:22.280
 And Gorbachev goes, I'm not sending the tanks.

1:47:22.280 --> 1:47:24.960
 And they go, dude, if you don't send in the tanks,

1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:28.360
 it's all done, and he goes, nope, I'm not that kind of guy.

1:47:28.360 --> 1:47:31.920
 And they were right, Ceausescu was personally shot

1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:33.520
 with his wife up against the wall,

1:47:33.520 --> 1:47:35.240
 Hanukkah, I forget what happened to him,

1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:37.460
 but they all self liberated.

1:47:37.460 --> 1:47:39.840
 My friend who was born in Czechoslovakia,

1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:42.220
 his mom was pregnant under communism,

1:47:42.220 --> 1:47:43.840
 and she never even imagined he'd be free,

1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:45.560
 and he was born under free.

1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:46.960
 And they were all looking around,

1:47:46.960 --> 1:47:48.720
 all these countries that self liberated,

1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:50.440
 because they're like, this is a trick, right?

1:47:50.440 --> 1:47:52.520
 They're trying to figure out who's like not good,

1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:54.840
 so that they can arrest us on mass, and they didn't.

1:47:54.840 --> 1:47:58.880
 So even within communism,

1:47:58.880 --> 1:48:02.480
 there are bad guys and better guys.

1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:06.080
 But we talked about anarchy, we talked about democracy.

1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:09.240
 Do you see, like there's democratic socialism

1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:13.400
 conversations going on in the popular culture,

1:48:13.400 --> 1:48:18.400
 socialism is seen as like evil, or for some people, great?

1:48:18.580 --> 1:48:19.840
 Sure.

1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:24.160
 What are your thoughts about it as in a political ideology?

1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:25.360
 Evil.

1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:26.480
 So you're on the evil side?

1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:27.320
 Yes.

1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:28.140
 Fundamentally?

1:48:28.140 --> 1:48:28.980
 Yes.

1:48:28.980 --> 1:48:33.980
 What is it, you know, what makes it evil?

1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:38.040
 What's like structurally, if you were to try to analyze?

1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:39.920
 Sure, I'd say three ways.

1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:41.720
 Morally, no person has the right

1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:43.960
 to tell another person how to live their life.

1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:46.520
 Economically, it's not possible

1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:48.440
 to make calculations under socialism.

1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:51.780
 It's only the prices that are information that tells me,

1:48:51.780 --> 1:48:53.380
 oh, this is, we need to produce more of this,

1:48:53.380 --> 1:48:54.880
 we need to produce less of this.

1:48:54.880 --> 1:48:56.480
 Without prices being able to adjust

1:48:56.480 --> 1:48:59.940
 and give information to producers and consumers,

1:48:59.940 --> 1:49:02.040
 you have no way of being able to produce

1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:03.520
 effectively or efficiently.

1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:08.120
 And also it is, it turns people against each other.

1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:09.920
 When you force people to interact,

1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:11.320
 when you force them into relationships,

1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:13.040
 when you force them into jobs,

1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:14.380
 and you don't give them any choice,

1:49:14.380 --> 1:49:17.120
 when there's a monopoly, the consequence of monopoly,

1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:19.760
 everyone's familiar with ostensibly under capitalism,

1:49:19.760 --> 1:49:21.520
 but somehow when it's a government monopoly,

1:49:21.520 --> 1:49:23.000
 all those economic principles don't work,

1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:24.280
 it doesn't make any sense.

1:49:24.280 --> 1:49:26.180
 But there's force in democracy too,

1:49:26.180 --> 1:49:29.040
 it's just you're saying there's a bit more force

1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:31.280
 in socialism.

1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:33.580
 But that's interesting that you say

1:49:33.580 --> 1:49:34.880
 that there's not enough information.

1:49:34.880 --> 1:49:36.680
 I mean, that's ultimately,

1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:40.360
 you need to have really good data

1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:42.200
 to achieve the goals of the system,

1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:45.680
 even if there's no corruption.

1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:47.240
 You just need to have the information.

1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:48.200
 Which you can't.

1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:49.840
 And capitalism provides you

1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:54.840
 a really strong source of real time information.

1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:02.640
 And if capitalism at its best and cleanest,

1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:05.560
 which is perfect information, is available,

1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:08.360
 there's no manipulation of information.

1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:10.440
 That's one of the problems, okay.

1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:13.760
 Can we talk about some candidates,

1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:17.200
 the ones we got and possible alternatives?

1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:21.920
 So one question I have is, why do we have,

1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:25.440
 within this system, why do we have the candidates we have?

1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:30.960
 It seems, maybe you can correct me,

1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:33.140
 highly unsatisfactory.

1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:39.520
 Is anyone actually excited about our current candidates?

1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:41.040
 I'm kind of excited,

1:50:41.040 --> 1:50:43.200
 because no matter who wins the election,

1:50:43.200 --> 1:50:44.420
 it's gonna be hilarious.

1:50:44.420 --> 1:50:46.240
 So that is something that I'm excited about.

1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:48.520
 From a humor perspective.

1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:50.040
 Is that what the whole system is?

1:50:50.040 --> 1:50:52.120
 So that's one theory of the case,

1:50:52.120 --> 1:50:55.960
 is the entire thing is optimized for viewership.

1:50:55.960 --> 1:50:56.800
 Yeah.

1:50:56.800 --> 1:50:59.240
 And excitement by definitions

1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:01.540
 of like the reality show kind of excitement.

1:51:01.540 --> 1:51:04.320
 I think it is,

1:51:04.320 --> 1:51:06.820
 if you look at what happened with Brett Kavanaugh,

1:51:06.820 --> 1:51:11.680
 this is not a career that would draw people

1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:14.600
 who are, you might say, quality.

1:51:14.600 --> 1:51:15.960
 Because no matter who they are,

1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:18.800
 there would be a huge incentive from the other team

1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:20.960
 to denigrate them and humiliate them

1:51:20.960 --> 1:51:21.980
 in the worst possible ways.

1:51:21.980 --> 1:51:25.200
 Because as the two teams lose their legitimacy

1:51:25.200 --> 1:51:27.880
 among Gen Pop, it's gonna get harder and harder

1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:30.640
 for them to maintain any kind of claims to authority,

1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:32.080
 which is something I like,

1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:33.600
 but which does kind of play out

1:51:33.600 --> 1:51:36.080
 in certain nefarious ways.

1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:37.980
 So people, the best of the best,

1:51:37.980 --> 1:51:40.100
 are not gonna wanna be politicians.

1:51:40.100 --> 1:51:42.520
 Yeah, because I could have a job,

1:51:42.520 --> 1:51:45.720
 or have a job interview and I'm running Yahoo or whatever,

1:51:45.720 --> 1:51:49.200
 or I could, for 18 months, have to eat, you know,

1:51:49.200 --> 1:51:51.280
 corn dogs looking like I'm going down on someone

1:51:51.280 --> 1:51:53.600
 and shake hands and have all this,

1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:56.440
 my family and on social media daily

1:51:56.440 --> 1:51:58.880
 called the worst things, for what?

1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:02.020
 And then I'm still not guaranteed the position.

1:52:02.020 --> 1:52:05.520
 But the flip side of that, like from my perspective,

1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:07.180
 is the competition is weak.

1:52:08.240 --> 1:52:13.240
 Meaning, like, you need a minimum amount of eloquence,

1:52:13.240 --> 1:52:16.120
 eloquence, clearly, that I don't,

1:52:16.120 --> 1:52:17.880
 the bar which I did not pass.

1:52:17.880 --> 1:52:19.560
 I don't think either of them would be considered

1:52:19.560 --> 1:52:21.260
 particularly eloquent, Biden or Trump.

1:52:21.260 --> 1:52:22.800
 No, I know, but that's what I'm saying.

1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:26.500
 The competition, like if you were,

1:52:26.500 --> 1:52:28.200
 wanted to become a politician,

1:52:28.200 --> 1:52:30.300
 if you wanted to run for president,

1:52:30.300 --> 1:52:32.120
 the opportunity is there.

1:52:32.120 --> 1:52:33.800
 Like if you were at all competent.

1:52:33.800 --> 1:52:36.320
 Like if you had, so like Andrew Yang is an example

1:52:36.320 --> 1:52:37.840
 of somebody who has a bunch of ideas,

1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:42.840
 is somewhat eloquent, like young, energetic.

1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:47.160
 It feels like there should be thousands of Andrew Yangs,

1:52:47.160 --> 1:52:49.280
 like that would enter the domain.

1:52:49.280 --> 1:52:50.440
 He went nowhere.

1:52:51.440 --> 1:52:54.200
 Well, I wouldn't say he went nowhere.

1:52:54.200 --> 1:52:55.760
 He generated quite a bit of excitement.

1:52:55.760 --> 1:52:59.820
 He just didn't go very far, that's, okay.

1:52:59.820 --> 1:53:01.040
 You don't have to run for president

1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:02.360
 to generate excitement with your ideas.

1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:04.240
 You could be a podcast host, I'm not even joking.

1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:07.780
 That's right, that's right, that's right.

1:53:07.780 --> 1:53:09.920
 And he's both, Andrew Yang.

1:53:09.920 --> 1:53:10.840
 Oh, he's a podcast?

1:53:10.840 --> 1:53:13.560
 Yeah, he has a podcast called Yang Speaks.

1:53:13.560 --> 1:53:14.600
 Oh, okay, cool.

1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:24.500
 Oh, wow, the music of the way you said, yeah, cool.

1:53:24.500 --> 1:53:25.880
 It's the way my mom talks to me

1:53:25.880 --> 1:53:28.640
 when I tell her something exciting going on in my life.

1:53:31.640 --> 1:53:32.780
 Oh, that's nice, honey.

1:53:32.780 --> 1:53:34.480
 Oh, you made a robot, that's cool.

1:53:35.880 --> 1:53:36.720
 A mixed coffee?

1:53:36.720 --> 1:53:38.800
 Oh, you're still single, though, aren't you?

1:53:38.800 --> 1:53:43.120
 I wonder why, I wonder why.

1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:44.800
 Make yourself a robot wife?

1:53:44.800 --> 1:53:46.500
 Give me some robot grandchildren.

1:53:49.160 --> 1:53:53.640
 Okay, but first of all, okay,

1:53:53.640 --> 1:53:55.120
 let me ask you about Andrew Yang

1:53:55.120 --> 1:53:58.960
 because he represents fresh energy.

1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:02.180
 You don't find him fresh or energetic, you know?

1:54:02.180 --> 1:54:07.180
 Like, is there any candidate you wish was in the mix

1:54:07.220 --> 1:54:09.360
 that was in the mix you wish was

1:54:09.360 --> 1:54:11.260
 one of the last two remaining?

1:54:11.260 --> 1:54:14.840
 Yeah, people like Marianne Williamson, I thought was great.

1:54:14.840 --> 1:54:16.520
 Tulsi, I thought was great.

1:54:16.520 --> 1:54:18.780
 Amy Klobuchar got a bad rap.

1:54:18.780 --> 1:54:21.260
 I think she held her own.

1:54:21.260 --> 1:54:24.080
 Smart, she wasn't particularly funny, that's okay.

1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:26.240
 I think she was nonthreatening to a lot of people.

1:54:26.240 --> 1:54:28.160
 What did you like about them?

1:54:28.160 --> 1:54:29.640
 I guess I just named all women, that's interesting.

1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:31.540
 It wasn't even intentional.

1:54:31.540 --> 1:54:33.480
 Tulsi, I liked that she was aggressive,

1:54:33.480 --> 1:54:38.480
 has a good resume and is not staying the course

1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:39.760
 for the establishment.

1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:42.720
 Marianne Williamson, I like because she comes from a place,

1:54:42.720 --> 1:54:45.040
 from what it seems, of genuine compassion.

1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:47.160
 Maybe she's a sociopath, I don't know.

1:54:47.160 --> 1:54:50.600
 I read her book and it actually affected me profoundly

1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:53.280
 because it's very rare when you read a book

1:54:53.280 --> 1:54:55.500
 and there's even that one idea that blows your mind

1:54:55.500 --> 1:54:56.840
 and that you kind of think about all the time.

1:54:56.840 --> 1:54:59.000
 And there was one such idea in her book

1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.560
 about she was teaching something called A Course

1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:02.560
 in Miracles in Hollywood.

1:55:02.560 --> 1:55:04.120
 I think she still teaches it.

1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:07.540
 And this was during the 80s, the height of the AIDS crisis.

1:55:07.540 --> 1:55:09.840
 And all these young men in the prime of their life

1:55:09.840 --> 1:55:11.760
 were dropping like flies.

1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:13.180
 And she's trying to give them hope.

1:55:13.180 --> 1:55:16.240
 Well, good luck, they're dying, no one cares.

1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:17.760
 And they're like, you can't tell us

1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:21.480
 that they're gonna cure this, that's a lie.

1:55:21.480 --> 1:55:25.420
 And she goes, what if I told you they're not gonna cure it?

1:55:25.420 --> 1:55:28.180
 What if I told you it's gonna be to like diabetes?

1:55:28.180 --> 1:55:30.560
 They cut off your foot and you're gonna go blind.

1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:33.200
 Would that be something that you can hope for?

1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:34.920
 And when you put it like that, it's like, yeah.

1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:36.760
 Like if you're talking to someone like a homeless junkie

1:55:36.760 --> 1:55:38.080
 and you're like, you could be a doctor,

1:55:38.080 --> 1:55:39.840
 you're a lawyer or a lawyer, like cool story.

1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:43.400
 Like you could have a studio apartment

1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:45.880
 with a terrible roommate and a shitty job.

1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:48.400
 But when you're on the street,

1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:51.360
 cooking breakfast in a teaspoon and you hear that,

1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:53.360
 you're like, wait, would that really be so bad?

1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:54.800
 Is that really so much worse than this?

1:55:54.800 --> 1:55:56.240
 No, and it becomes something.

1:55:56.240 --> 1:55:59.040
 So when she put it in those terms, I'm like, wow,

1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:01.700
 this woman that really did a number on me

1:56:01.700 --> 1:56:04.760
 in terms of teaching people how to be hopeful.

1:56:04.760 --> 1:56:05.920
 Small steps, I guess.

1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:09.120
 But it's also, then it becomes less of I need a miracle

1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:11.520
 to be like, oh, this is really manageable.

1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:12.360
 Yeah.

1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:15.000
 And it's absurd to think it's impossible.

1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:17.920
 What about what's your take on Unity 2020

1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:22.920
 that Brett Weinstein pushed forward?

1:56:22.920 --> 1:56:26.360
 It was DOA, he couldn't even stand up to Twitter.

1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:27.200
 Dead on arrival.

1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:28.040
 Dead on arrival.

1:56:28.040 --> 1:56:29.520
 He couldn't even stand up to Twitter, let alone,

1:56:29.520 --> 1:56:31.040
 or to Facebook, they got blocked,

1:56:31.040 --> 1:56:31.880
 let alone to Facebook.

1:56:31.880 --> 1:56:33.660
 It was not hugely problematic, by the way,

1:56:33.660 --> 1:56:35.640
 that Twitter would block that.

1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:36.800
 Not at all.

1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:37.900
 I don't know why they blocked it,

1:56:37.900 --> 1:56:40.440
 but I believe, I don't know what problematic means.

1:56:40.440 --> 1:56:42.560
 That's a word that does a lot of work

1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:45.600
 that people wanted to do conceptually.

1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:49.680
 The idea that Unity is taking the rejects from each party

1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:52.000
 and we're gonna have something that no one likes

1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.480
 and therefore it's gonna be a compromise is absurd.

1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:56.720
 The last time we had this kind of Unity ticket

1:56:56.720 --> 1:56:59.440
 was the Civil War, where you had Andrew Johnson

1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:01.640
 from the Democrats and Lincoln from the Republicans.

1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:03.720
 This was not something that ended well,

1:57:03.720 --> 1:57:05.960
 particularly nicely, for both halves of the country.

1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:08.320
 So that's the way you see it is,

1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:09.720
 like the way I saw it,

1:57:09.720 --> 1:57:11.520
 I guess I haven't looked carefully at it.

1:57:11.520 --> 1:57:12.560
 I haven't either, to be fair.

1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:13.600
 Yeah.

1:57:13.600 --> 1:57:17.120
 The way I saw it is emphasizing centrists, which is.

1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:19.200
 How is Tulsi a centrist?

1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:20.040
 Tulsi was involved?

1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:21.440
 Yes, he's trying to push Tulsi

1:57:21.440 --> 1:57:23.280
 on like Jesse Ventura or something.

1:57:23.280 --> 1:57:24.280
 Oh.

1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:26.360
 So, okay, I don't know.

1:57:26.360 --> 1:57:27.200
 I don't know the specifics.

1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:28.880
 As a scientist, you also know centrism

1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:30.560
 is not a coherent term in politics.

1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:34.320
 But see, now you're like, what is it?

1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:37.600
 Pleading to authority and my ego.

1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:40.240
 No, no, I'm pleading to how you approach data.

1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:42.680
 If someone is saying the mean is accurate,

1:57:42.680 --> 1:57:45.040
 that only mean, I mean, the mean could be anywhere.

1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:46.200
 It's a function of what's around it.

1:57:46.200 --> 1:57:47.080
 That mean is true.

1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:49.680
 I don't even know what centrists is supposed to mean,

1:57:49.680 --> 1:57:54.680
 but what it means to me, there's no idea, a centrist.

1:57:55.160 --> 1:57:58.600
 There's more of a center right or center left.

1:57:58.600 --> 1:58:00.600
 To me, what that means is somebody

1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:04.240
 who is a liberal or a conservative,

1:58:04.240 --> 1:58:09.240
 but is open minded and empathetic to the other side.

1:58:13.200 --> 1:58:15.600
 Joe Biden had the crime bill.

1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:18.360
 Joe Biden voted for Republican Supreme Court justices.

1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:19.920
 Joe Biden voted for a balanced budget.

1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:21.760
 Joe Biden voted for Bush's war.

1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:23.120
 And I'm sure probably I haven't looked this up,

1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:23.960
 the Patriot Act.

1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:26.040
 Joe, if you want a centrist, you have Joe Biden.

1:58:26.040 --> 1:58:26.880
 Yeah, okay.

1:58:26.880 --> 1:58:28.400
 He's worked very well with Republicans.

1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:29.360
 That argument could be made.

1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:33.440
 Of course, everybody will always resist that argument.

1:58:33.440 --> 1:58:34.280
 It's indeniable.

1:58:34.280 --> 1:58:35.920
 In fact, during the campaign,

1:58:35.920 --> 1:58:40.840
 some activists started yelling at him at a town hall.

1:58:40.840 --> 1:58:43.560
 Not yelling, just saying, hey, we need open borders.

1:58:43.560 --> 1:58:45.520
 Joe Biden says, I'm not for open borders.

1:58:45.520 --> 1:58:48.840
 Go vote for Trump and literally turn his back on the man.

1:58:48.840 --> 1:58:50.200
 And this is during the primaries

1:58:50.200 --> 1:58:53.960
 where it would behoove you to try to appeal to the base.

1:58:53.960 --> 1:58:55.840
 And of course, you can probably also make the argument

1:58:55.840 --> 1:58:59.240
 that Donald Trump is center right, if not center left.

1:58:59.240 --> 1:59:04.200
 Well, I mean, he's very unique as a personality.

1:59:04.200 --> 1:59:05.480
 But if you look at his record,

1:59:05.480 --> 1:59:06.680
 and first of all, his rhetoric,

1:59:06.680 --> 1:59:08.480
 you can say is not centrist at all.

1:59:08.480 --> 1:59:10.480
 But in terms of how he governs,

1:59:10.480 --> 1:59:13.480
 the budgeting, I mean, has been very moderate.

1:59:13.480 --> 1:59:16.080
 It certainly hasn't been like draconian budget cuts.

1:59:16.080 --> 1:59:18.320
 The Supreme Court, you could say, okay, he's hard right.

1:59:18.320 --> 1:59:20.280
 Immigration, you could say in certain capacities,

1:59:20.280 --> 1:59:21.160
 he's hard right.

1:59:21.160 --> 1:59:24.520
 But in terms of pro life, what has he done there?

1:59:24.520 --> 1:59:27.440
 In terms of, so in many other aspects,

1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:30.720
 he's been very much this kind of me too Republican.

1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:31.560
 But certainly the rhetoric,

1:59:31.560 --> 1:59:33.720
 it's very hard to make him the case that he's a centrist.

1:59:33.720 --> 1:59:35.160
 So you don't like,

1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:37.840
 is there any other idea you find compelling?

1:59:37.840 --> 1:59:41.720
 What I like about UND 2020 is it's an idea

1:59:41.720 --> 1:59:46.200
 for a different way, for like a different party,

1:59:46.200 --> 1:59:47.640
 a different path forward.

1:59:47.640 --> 1:59:51.680
 So ideas, just like anarchy is an interesting idea

1:59:51.680 --> 1:59:53.520
 that leads to discourse, that leads to.

1:59:53.520 --> 1:59:54.600
 I don't think it's interesting at all.

1:59:54.600 --> 1:59:56.560
 And here's why I don't think it's interesting.

1:59:56.560 --> 1:59:59.920
 Sweden has eight parties in its parliament.

1:59:59.920 --> 2:00:02.000
 Iceland, population is like 150,000.

2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:03.280
 They've got nine, I think it was.

2:00:03.280 --> 2:00:06.080
 Czech Republic has nine, Britain has five.

2:00:06.080 --> 2:00:08.680
 So the claim that two parties

2:00:08.680 --> 2:00:12.160
 is the censorious of speech,

2:00:12.160 --> 2:00:14.200
 but three, oh, now all of a sudden,

2:00:14.200 --> 2:00:16.640
 it makes no sense, doesn't port to the data, number one.

2:00:16.640 --> 2:00:18.800
 Number two is Donald Trump demonstrated

2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:21.080
 that you can be basically a third party candidate,

2:00:21.080 --> 2:00:23.880
 sees the machinery of a existing party

2:00:23.880 --> 2:00:27.080
 and appropriate to your own ends as Bernie Sanders.

2:00:27.080 --> 2:00:29.320
 Bernie Sanders has never been a Democrat.

2:00:29.320 --> 2:00:31.560
 Major credit to him for that's not easy

2:00:31.560 --> 2:00:33.040
 to be elected as Senator as an independent.

2:00:33.040 --> 2:00:34.200
 He's done it repeatedly.

2:00:34.200 --> 2:00:37.440
 So these are two examples of ossified elites

2:00:37.440 --> 2:00:38.280
 right for the picking.

2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:42.880
 But to have a third party makes no real sense.

2:00:42.880 --> 2:00:45.960
 Speaking of which, a party you talk about quite a bit.

2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:52.000
 And let's look, this is a personal challenge to you.

2:00:53.160 --> 2:00:55.520
 Let me bring up the Libertarian Party.

2:00:55.520 --> 2:00:58.840
 And the personal challenge is to go five minutes

2:00:58.840 --> 2:01:03.160
 without mocking them in discussing this idea.

2:01:03.160 --> 2:01:05.160
 So first of all, what?

2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:07.440
 I'm being trolled.

2:01:07.440 --> 2:01:10.600
 Okay, I'm being trolled, okay, I'm being trolled.

2:01:10.600 --> 2:01:13.320
 I'm being trolled, okay, this is good.

2:01:13.320 --> 2:01:14.720
 Do you remember the fun friends?

2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:16.000
 There was an episode where Chandler

2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:17.560
 had to not make fun of people.

2:01:17.560 --> 2:01:19.200
 Like, can you go one day Chandler?

2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:22.800
 And Phoebe starts telling him about like this UFO she saw

2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:26.440
 and he's like, that's very interesting and nice for you.

2:01:27.840 --> 2:01:29.280
 This is exactly that.

2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:31.120
 So a true master would be able to play

2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:32.880
 within the game, within the constraints.

2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:36.320
 So no, I'm pretty sure you'll still mock them.

2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:38.480
 But no, no, I'll stick to the rules.

2:01:38.480 --> 2:01:39.640
 Five minutes, easy.

2:01:39.640 --> 2:01:42.680
 So first of all, speaking broadly about libertarianism,

2:01:42.680 --> 2:01:44.840
 can you speak to that, how you feel about it?

2:01:44.840 --> 2:01:47.000
 And then also to the Libertarian Party,

2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:49.680
 which is the implementation of it in our current system.

2:01:49.680 --> 2:01:53.720
 So I think libertarianism is a great idea.

2:01:53.720 --> 2:01:56.000
 And I think there's many libertarian ideas

2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.120
 that have become much more mainstream,

2:01:58.120 --> 2:01:59.600
 which I'm very, very happy about.

2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:02.280
 I remember there was an article in either New York

2:02:02.280 --> 2:02:05.160
 or New Yorker Magazine in the early 90s,

2:02:05.160 --> 2:02:06.720
 where they talked about the Cato Institute,

2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:08.440
 which is a libertarian think tank.

2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:11.960
 And they refer to the fact that Cato was against war

2:02:11.960 --> 2:02:16.200
 and against like regulation with a wacky consistency,

2:02:16.200 --> 2:02:18.560
 because they didn't know how to reconcile these two things.

2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:19.520
 I don't remember what the two things were,

2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:22.120
 but I remember that expression wacky consistency.

2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:25.160
 And it wasn't even, we were all taught,

2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:27.160
 and this is very much before the internet,

2:02:27.160 --> 2:02:30.720
 that there's two tribes and if you're pro life,

2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:32.480
 you have to hate gays.

2:02:32.480 --> 2:02:34.960
 And if you're for socialized medicine,

2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:39.760
 that also means you have to be for free speech.

2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:42.080
 It was just this very, and like there's a whole menu

2:02:42.080 --> 2:02:43.440
 and you got to sign it to all of them.

2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:45.720
 And that menu is terrible.

2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:47.480
 They hate America, they want to destroy it.

2:02:47.480 --> 2:02:48.920
 Oh my God, those are horrible evil.

2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:50.280
 This is the menu you want.

2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:52.600
 And the Libertarian Party to some extent,

2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:54.280
 and just libertarians as a whole said,

2:02:54.280 --> 2:02:57.080
 you know, you can do the Chinese buffet

2:02:57.080 --> 2:02:59.480
 and take a little from column A, a little from column B

2:02:59.480 --> 2:03:03.840
 and have an ideology that is coherent and consistent,

2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:07.600
 an ideology of peace and nonaggression

2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:08.760
 and things like that.

2:03:08.760 --> 2:03:12.600
 The Libertarian Party takes its model

2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:15.240
 from like the early progressive and populist parties

2:03:15.240 --> 2:03:16.680
 from the early 20th century,

2:03:16.680 --> 2:03:18.400
 which were not very effective

2:03:18.400 --> 2:03:20.840
 in terms of getting people elected,

2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:23.240
 but were extremely effective

2:03:23.240 --> 2:03:25.240
 in terms of getting the two major parties

2:03:25.240 --> 2:03:27.960
 to appropriate and adopt their ideas and implement them.

2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:30.440
 And in Britain as well, the liberal party got destroyed

2:03:30.440 --> 2:03:32.200
 and became taken over by labor

2:03:32.200 --> 2:03:34.840
 as the alternative party to the Tories

2:03:34.840 --> 2:03:38.640
 and have those ideas basically become mainstreamed.

2:03:38.640 --> 2:03:40.480
 So I think that, and the libertarian,

2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:43.520
 my friend who passed away, Eric, I miss him dearly,

2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:46.000
 was their webmaster and his whole point is,

2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:47.680
 if you don't think of that in terms of a party,

2:03:47.680 --> 2:03:49.080
 in terms of getting people elected,

2:03:49.080 --> 2:03:50.320
 but if you think of it as a party

2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:53.880
 in terms of getting people educated about alternatives,

2:03:53.880 --> 2:03:55.800
 then there's enormous use for that.

2:03:55.800 --> 2:03:56.720
 That was his perspective.

2:03:56.720 --> 2:03:58.720
 And I don't think that's an absurd perspective.

2:03:58.720 --> 2:04:00.160
 But here's some libertarian ideas

2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:02.400
 that have become extremely mainstream.

2:04:02.400 --> 2:04:04.720
 War should be a last resort.

2:04:04.720 --> 2:04:07.120
 This is something we were taught as kids and we all say,

2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:09.280
 but for many years, it's been like,

2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:10.440
 they don't think of it as a last resort.

2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:12.960
 It's like something's bad, well, it's like the first instinct.

2:04:12.960 --> 2:04:15.480
 Now it's like, let's really give it a week, just a week.

2:04:15.480 --> 2:04:16.800
 Like what's going on in Syria?

2:04:16.800 --> 2:04:18.840
 Is there really gonna be a genocide, the Kurds?

2:04:18.840 --> 2:04:19.680
 You know, things like that.

2:04:19.680 --> 2:04:20.520
 So that's one.

2:04:20.520 --> 2:04:22.880
 Another thing is drug legalization.

2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:25.000
 This was, you know, when you and I were kids,

2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:25.840
 oh, it's crazy.

2:04:25.840 --> 2:04:27.240
 Only hippies wanna smoke pot.

2:04:27.240 --> 2:04:30.000
 Now it's like, I was on a grand jury.

2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.440
 And I'll point out what people make is,

2:04:32.440 --> 2:04:35.960
 are you sure that the 16 year old who's selling weed,

2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:39.640
 let's say selling, should his life be ruined?

2:04:39.640 --> 2:04:41.920
 Should he be imprisoned with rapists and murderers?

2:04:41.920 --> 2:04:44.800
 Like if you say yes, say yes,

2:04:44.800 --> 2:04:48.880
 but you have to acknowledge that that's what you're meaning.

2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:50.760
 And then a lot of people are like, wait a minute,

2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:52.080
 there's gotta be a third option

2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:54.720
 then he has no consequences or he's imprisoned

2:04:54.720 --> 2:04:55.560
 with a rapist.

2:04:55.560 --> 2:04:57.640
 I'm not comfortable with either of these.

2:04:57.640 --> 2:05:01.160
 And I think the other one is an increasing skepticism.

2:05:01.160 --> 2:05:02.800
 This libertarians were on top of this first

2:05:02.800 --> 2:05:05.280
 and the hard left of the police.

2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:08.360
 As of now, asset forfeiture steals more from people

2:05:08.360 --> 2:05:09.200
 than burglaries.

2:05:09.200 --> 2:05:11.320
 What people don't know about what asset forfeiture is,

2:05:11.320 --> 2:05:13.840
 if the cops come to your house and they suspect you,

2:05:13.840 --> 2:05:17.680
 you haven't been convicted of using your car or your house

2:05:17.680 --> 2:05:19.960
 or whatever in terms of selling drugs,

2:05:19.960 --> 2:05:22.440
 they can take whatever they want.

2:05:22.440 --> 2:05:25.200
 And then you have to sue to prove your innocence

2:05:25.200 --> 2:05:26.320
 and get your property back.

2:05:26.320 --> 2:05:28.240
 It's a complete violation of due process.

2:05:28.240 --> 2:05:29.480
 People don't realize it's going on.

2:05:29.480 --> 2:05:31.880
 It's a great way for the cops to increase their budgets

2:05:31.880 --> 2:05:32.960
 and it's legal.

2:05:32.960 --> 2:05:35.640
 And libertarians were like the first big ones saying,

2:05:35.640 --> 2:05:37.920
 guys, this is not American and this is crazy.

2:05:37.920 --> 2:05:40.760
 And now increasingly people on conservatives and leftists

2:05:40.760 --> 2:05:42.680
 like, wait a minute, this is...

2:05:42.680 --> 2:05:44.640
 Even if you are selling drugs, like they take your house,

2:05:44.640 --> 2:05:45.800
 what are you talking about?

2:05:45.800 --> 2:05:49.240
 So I think those are some mechanisms that libertarianism,

2:05:49.240 --> 2:05:52.560
 though not by name, has become far more popular.

2:05:52.560 --> 2:05:55.960
 Yeah, it's interesting, so the idea, yeah, a coherent set

2:05:55.960 --> 2:06:00.120
 of ideas that eventually get integrated

2:06:00.120 --> 2:06:01.240
 into a two party system.

2:06:01.240 --> 2:06:02.080
 Yeah.

2:06:02.080 --> 2:06:03.200
 The war, that's an interesting one.

2:06:03.200 --> 2:06:04.040
 You're right.

2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:07.400
 I wonder what the thread there is.

2:06:07.400 --> 2:06:11.080
 I wonder how it connects to 9 11 and so on.

2:06:11.080 --> 2:06:13.800
 I think the Patriot Act.

2:06:13.800 --> 2:06:14.640
 Patriot Act, okay.

2:06:14.640 --> 2:06:16.800
 For people who are politically savvy,

2:06:16.800 --> 2:06:20.720
 we're like, oh, okay, this is not a joke.

2:06:20.720 --> 2:06:24.120
 This is really a crazy infringement of our freedoms

2:06:24.120 --> 2:06:27.040
 and both parties are falling over each other

2:06:27.040 --> 2:06:30.320
 to sign into law and the Orwellian name.

2:06:30.320 --> 2:06:31.160
 You don't wanna...

2:06:31.160 --> 2:06:32.400
 How can you be against patriotism?

2:06:32.400 --> 2:06:33.240
 What kind of person?

2:06:33.240 --> 2:06:34.080
 You know what I mean?

2:06:34.080 --> 2:06:34.920
 So I think for a lot of people,

2:06:34.920 --> 2:06:37.240
 especially both civil libertarians on the left

2:06:37.240 --> 2:06:39.400
 and a lot of conservatives who are constitutionalists

2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:41.000
 are like, wait a minute, this isn't...

2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:42.280
 I'm not comfortable with this.

2:06:42.280 --> 2:06:44.120
 And I'm also not comfortable with how comfortable everyone

2:06:44.120 --> 2:06:45.680
 in Washington is with it.

2:06:45.680 --> 2:06:48.760
 You're right, probably libertarians

2:06:48.760 --> 2:06:52.160
 and libertarianism is a place of ideas,

2:06:52.160 --> 2:06:53.960
 which is why I have a connection to it.

2:06:57.560 --> 2:07:00.400
 Every time I listen to those folks, I like them.

2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:01.520
 I feel connected to them.

2:07:01.520 --> 2:07:03.440
 I would even sometimes, depending on the day,

2:07:03.440 --> 2:07:05.200
 call myself a libertarian.

2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:06.600
 Well, we're all the spectrum, so that's why.

2:07:06.600 --> 2:07:08.280
 We're all on the spectrum, yeah.

2:07:08.280 --> 2:07:12.480
 But when I look at the people that actually rise to the top

2:07:12.480 --> 2:07:15.600
 in terms of the people who represent the party,

2:07:15.600 --> 2:07:18.120
 this is where five minutes ran out, right?

2:07:18.120 --> 2:07:19.760
 I could go, I'm allowed.

2:07:19.760 --> 2:07:22.320
 You can go, why are they so weird?

2:07:22.320 --> 2:07:26.800
 Why aren't strong candidates emerging

2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:31.800
 that represent as political representatives

2:07:31.880 --> 2:07:36.880
 or as famous speakers that represent ideology?

2:07:38.120 --> 2:07:40.320
 I think libertarians tend to...

2:07:40.320 --> 2:07:43.040
 I think Jonathan Haidt in his book, in his research,

2:07:43.040 --> 2:07:45.000
 he's a political scientist and he does a lot of things

2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:46.720
 about how people come to their political inclusions

2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:50.840
 and what factors force people to reach conclusions.

2:07:50.840 --> 2:07:53.640
 And he found that libertarians are the least empathetic

2:07:53.640 --> 2:07:56.120
 and most rationalistic of all the groups.

2:07:56.120 --> 2:07:58.120
 And by that, he means like they think in terms of logic

2:07:58.120 --> 2:07:59.640
 as opposed to like people's feelings

2:07:59.640 --> 2:08:02.060
 and that has positives and has negatives.

2:08:04.320 --> 2:08:07.120
 And we have the A, B testing with Ron Paul.

2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:10.600
 Ron Paul ran for president as a libertarian nominee.

2:08:10.600 --> 2:08:11.680
 He was the nominee.

2:08:11.680 --> 2:08:14.040
 He got pretty much nowhere in 1988.

2:08:14.040 --> 2:08:16.080
 Then he ran as a return to the Republican party

2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:18.040
 as a congressman for many years from Texas.

2:08:18.040 --> 2:08:22.480
 He ran for the presidency in 2008 and 2012.

2:08:22.480 --> 2:08:26.560
 And in 2008, he stood on stage with Rudy Giuliani

2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:29.080
 and told him that they were here in 9 11

2:08:29.080 --> 2:08:30.360
 because we're over there,

2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:33.840
 which would have been a shocking, horrifying taboo

2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:35.080
 a few years earlier.

2:08:35.080 --> 2:08:37.320
 Many people were like, holy crap, this is amazing.

2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:39.160
 Giuliani was all offended and Ron Paul's like...

2:08:39.160 --> 2:08:40.640
 I took some guts by the way.

2:08:40.640 --> 2:08:41.940
 Yeah, you did.

2:08:41.940 --> 2:08:44.160
 When I heard that, it was so refreshing.

2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:47.200
 Not what he said, but the fact that he said something

2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:48.280
 that took guts.

2:08:48.280 --> 2:08:53.280
 It made me realize how rare it is for politicians,

2:08:53.440 --> 2:08:56.040
 but even people to say something that takes guts.

2:08:56.040 --> 2:08:58.680
 Well, it's also the idea that like you can't,

2:08:58.680 --> 2:09:01.120
 even if you think America has a right

2:09:01.120 --> 2:09:03.980
 to invade any country on earth as much as it wants

2:09:03.980 --> 2:09:06.540
 and kill people as a consequence of war

2:09:06.540 --> 2:09:09.360
 and blow up their buildings and destroy their country,

2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:11.040
 you can't with a straight face

2:09:11.040 --> 2:09:13.800
 not expect us to have consequences,

2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:15.940
 even if they're consequences from evil people.

2:09:15.940 --> 2:09:17.620
 Even if we're 100% of the good guys

2:09:17.620 --> 2:09:19.060
 and they're 100% of the bad guys,

2:09:19.060 --> 2:09:21.080
 those bad guys, some of them are still gonna try

2:09:21.080 --> 2:09:22.300
 to do something.

2:09:22.300 --> 2:09:23.480
 What happens next?

2:09:23.480 --> 2:09:24.320
 You know what I mean?

2:09:24.320 --> 2:09:27.360
 So that kind of concept that there's any American

2:09:27.360 --> 2:09:30.960
 culpability, we're America, we are the good guys

2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:32.400
 by definition, we're not culpable,

2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:34.120
 to have people start thinking about

2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:35.520
 what if there's another way?

2:09:35.520 --> 2:09:37.120
 You know, what if we're not there

2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:38.080
 and then they're not here

2:09:38.080 --> 2:09:39.600
 and we're kind of doing a backdoor,

2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:41.840
 we're talking so different scenarios.

2:09:41.840 --> 2:09:44.560
 So the fact that he got so much more traction

2:09:44.560 --> 2:09:47.560
 as a Republican, the fact that Donald Trump

2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:50.680
 who came out of nowhere became not only the candidate,

2:09:50.680 --> 2:09:52.980
 but the president tells people,

2:09:52.980 --> 2:09:54.840
 it's like getting a book deal, right?

2:09:54.840 --> 2:09:57.460
 You can either go, there's three choices.

2:09:57.460 --> 2:10:00.540
 You can either self publish, mainstream publisher

2:10:00.540 --> 2:10:03.200
 or independent publisher.

2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:05.920
 The independent publisher is the worst of all choices

2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:07.960
 because you're not getting a big advance,

2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:10.580
 they're not gonna be able to promote you a lot

2:10:10.580 --> 2:10:12.920
 and they don't get the distribution.

2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:15.480
 Mainstream, I've done mainstream and self, right?

2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:18.280
 With self, I don't have the cred,

2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:20.560
 the respectability of a mainstream or the cache.

2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:22.640
 It can be a New York Times bestseller.

2:10:22.640 --> 2:10:24.340
 Right, it takes a lot of work,

2:10:24.340 --> 2:10:26.980
 but I get a lot more of the profit.

2:10:26.980 --> 2:10:28.640
 If it looks good on the shelf on Amazon,

2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:30.420
 it looks identical, so on and so forth.

2:10:30.420 --> 2:10:32.420
 With the mainstream, the benefits and costs

2:10:32.420 --> 2:10:34.320
 are pretty much obvious to most people.

2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:35.780
 So the same thing, it's like you can either

2:10:35.780 --> 2:10:37.840
 be an independent like Ross Perot

2:10:37.840 --> 2:10:41.180
 or you could be, just seize one of the party apparatus,

2:10:41.180 --> 2:10:42.880
 which the benefits are enormous there.

2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:45.160
 But in terms of going third party,

2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:47.080
 I don't know the libertarian party apparatus

2:10:47.080 --> 2:10:48.880
 other than maybe some ballot access

2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:50.720
 is really that efficacious.

2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:52.600
 And then you're gonna have a lot of baggage.

2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:56.080
 Cause if you hear independent, Jesse Ventura, Ross Perot,

2:10:56.080 --> 2:10:57.400
 you think of the person.

2:10:57.400 --> 2:10:59.360
 Now you have to define yourself

2:10:59.360 --> 2:11:01.200
 and you have to defend the party.

2:11:01.200 --> 2:11:03.160
 That's two bridges for most people.

2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:08.160
 So, brilliantly put, okay, let me speak to you.

2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:12.240
 Cause I'm speaking to Yaron Brooks soon.

2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:13.080
 Yeah.

2:11:14.180 --> 2:11:15.020
 I like him.

2:11:15.020 --> 2:11:19.140
 Yeah, so, but that, another example, I was.

2:11:19.140 --> 2:11:21.480
 Ask him to tell you a joke about Ayn Rand,

2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:22.400
 if he can do it.

2:11:23.820 --> 2:11:26.900
 So there, that's one criticism I've heard you say,

2:11:26.900 --> 2:11:30.980
 which is they're unable to speak to any weaknesses

2:11:30.980 --> 2:11:34.320
 in either Ayn Rand's or objectivist worldview.

2:11:34.320 --> 2:11:35.280
 Yes.

2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:38.320
 That's really, well, you put it,

2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:39.620
 I know you're half joking,

2:11:39.620 --> 2:11:43.320
 but that's actually a legitimate discussion to have.

2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:44.440
 I'm not joking at all.

2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:47.520
 Because that's, to me, one of the criticisms

2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:49.280
 and one of the explanations why the world

2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:53.640
 seems to disrespect Ayn Rand, the people that do,

2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:58.640
 is she kind of implies that her ideas are like flawless.

2:11:58.640 --> 2:12:01.380
 No, she says they correspond to reality.

2:12:01.380 --> 2:12:02.260
 Yeah, right.

2:12:02.260 --> 2:12:03.620
 That's the term she uses.

2:12:03.620 --> 2:12:08.260
 That, I mean, objectivist, it's in the name.

2:12:08.260 --> 2:12:10.980
 It's, you know, it's just facts.

2:12:10.980 --> 2:12:14.140
 Like, it's impossible to basically argue against

2:12:14.140 --> 2:12:16.780
 cause it's pretty simple, it's just all facts.

2:12:16.780 --> 2:12:18.340
 Well, that's, it's possible to argue against,

2:12:18.340 --> 2:12:20.820
 but she would say she's never met a good critic

2:12:20.820 --> 2:12:22.900
 who can argue the facts out of misrepresentation.

2:12:22.900 --> 2:12:24.100
 And she's not entirely wrong.

2:12:24.100 --> 2:12:25.140
 She's often caricatured,

2:12:25.140 --> 2:12:26.860
 cause she has a very extreme personality

2:12:26.860 --> 2:12:28.180
 and extreme worldview.

2:12:28.180 --> 2:12:30.060
 But that to me, I mean, some people,

2:12:30.060 --> 2:12:32.700
 there's a guy named in the physics mathematics community

2:12:32.700 --> 2:12:34.660
 called Stephen Wolfram.

2:12:34.660 --> 2:12:35.500
 I don't know if you've heard of him.

2:12:35.500 --> 2:12:36.340
 Wolfram Malfoy?

2:12:36.340 --> 2:12:37.160
 Yeah.

2:12:37.160 --> 2:12:38.000
 Okay.

2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:39.700
 He has a similar style of speaking sometimes,

2:12:39.700 --> 2:12:44.180
 which is like, I've created a science,

2:12:44.180 --> 2:12:46.540
 but that turns a lot of people off,

2:12:46.540 --> 2:12:48.820
 like this kind of weird confidence.

2:12:48.820 --> 2:12:50.420
 But he's one of my favorite people,

2:12:50.420 --> 2:12:52.520
 I think one of the most brilliant people.

2:12:52.520 --> 2:12:56.060
 If you just ignore that little bit of ego

2:12:56.060 --> 2:12:57.900
 or whatever you call that,

2:12:57.900 --> 2:12:59.620
 that there are some beautiful ideas in there.

2:12:59.620 --> 2:13:03.420
 And that, for me, objectivism,

2:13:03.420 --> 2:13:06.380
 I'm undereducated about it.

2:13:06.380 --> 2:13:08.380
 I hope to be more educated,

2:13:08.380 --> 2:13:10.420
 but there's some interesting ideas that,

2:13:10.420 --> 2:13:12.300
 again, just like with UFOs,

2:13:14.300 --> 2:13:15.460
 not that there's a connection between the two.

2:13:15.460 --> 2:13:16.460
 Don't bring that up for your own.

2:13:16.460 --> 2:13:17.300
 He won't like it.

2:13:17.300 --> 2:13:18.140
 He won't.

2:13:18.140 --> 2:13:19.100
 My friends like UFOs.

2:13:19.100 --> 2:13:21.180
 Oh, no, no, no, this interview is over.

2:13:21.180 --> 2:13:24.060
 That's a good yarn.

2:13:24.060 --> 2:13:25.180
 Okay.

2:13:25.180 --> 2:13:27.500
 But you know, you have to be a little bit open minded,

2:13:27.500 --> 2:13:31.500
 but what's your sense of objectivism?

2:13:31.500 --> 2:13:32.780
 Are there interesting ideas

2:13:32.780 --> 2:13:35.580
 that are useful to you to think about?

2:13:35.580 --> 2:13:38.420
 I own her copy of the first printing of The Fountainhead.

2:13:38.420 --> 2:13:39.620
 So that should tell you a little bit

2:13:39.620 --> 2:13:41.540
 about how my affection for Ms. Rand,

2:13:41.540 --> 2:13:42.760
 how heavy that goes.

2:13:44.220 --> 2:13:46.000
 Ayn Rand does not have all the answers,

2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:47.660
 but she has all the questions.

2:13:47.660 --> 2:13:49.060
 So if you study Rand,

2:13:49.060 --> 2:13:50.900
 you are going to be forced to think through

2:13:50.900 --> 2:13:52.140
 some very basic things,

2:13:52.140 --> 2:13:54.920
 and you're gonna have your eyes open very, very heavily.

2:13:54.920 --> 2:13:56.060
 She was not perfect.

2:13:56.060 --> 2:13:57.340
 She never claimed to be perfect.

2:13:57.340 --> 2:13:59.460
 She was asked on Donahue,

2:13:59.460 --> 2:14:01.260
 is it true that according to your philosophy,

2:14:01.260 --> 2:14:02.500
 you are a perfect being?

2:14:02.500 --> 2:14:05.100
 She said, I never think of myself that way.

2:14:05.100 --> 2:14:06.460
 And she said, but if you asked me,

2:14:06.460 --> 2:14:07.580
 do I practice what I preach?

2:14:07.580 --> 2:14:10.220
 The answer is yes, resoundingly.

2:14:10.220 --> 2:14:12.320
 She's a fascinating woman.

2:14:13.340 --> 2:14:15.480
 What is really interesting about her,

2:14:15.480 --> 2:14:17.820
 and this is something you'd appreciate personally,

2:14:17.820 --> 2:14:19.380
 is when you read her essays,

2:14:19.380 --> 2:14:21.740
 she'll have these weird asides.

2:14:21.740 --> 2:14:23.020
 And it looked like she was talking about art,

2:14:23.020 --> 2:14:24.220
 and she'd be like, and this is why the US

2:14:24.220 --> 2:14:25.900
 should be the only country with nuclear weapons.

2:14:25.900 --> 2:14:28.220
 And when you follow a brilliant mind

2:14:28.220 --> 2:14:31.340
 making these seemingly disparate connections,

2:14:31.340 --> 2:14:33.660
 it's something I find to be just absolutely inspiring

2:14:33.660 --> 2:14:35.180
 and awesome and entertaining.

2:14:36.140 --> 2:14:38.500
 I think there's lots of things about her

2:14:38.500 --> 2:14:40.900
 that people like Yaron would make uncomfortable.

2:14:43.420 --> 2:14:45.420
 Well, like she, they,

2:14:45.420 --> 2:14:47.660
 so objectivism, like any other philosophy,

2:14:47.660 --> 2:14:50.860
 has all these techniques to kind of hand wave away things

2:14:50.860 --> 2:14:52.820
 you don't wanna talk about and like pretend it.

2:14:52.820 --> 2:14:54.380
 So they talk about things like having

2:14:54.380 --> 2:14:57.020
 no metaphysical significance, right?

2:14:57.020 --> 2:14:58.620
 So what that means is like, well, what about this?

2:14:58.620 --> 2:14:59.700
 Ah, I don't wanna talk about it.

2:14:59.700 --> 2:15:00.620
 Like it doesn't matter.

2:15:00.620 --> 2:15:02.900
 Like it literally means in fancy philosophical terms,

2:15:02.900 --> 2:15:03.860
 it doesn't matter.

2:15:03.860 --> 2:15:06.120
 Or they will say correctly,

2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:09.580
 that it's very twisted in our culture

2:15:09.580 --> 2:15:12.520
 that when we have heroes, we look for their flaws

2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:13.940
 instead of looking for their virtues.

2:15:13.940 --> 2:15:16.420
 That's a hundred percent valid perspective.

2:15:16.420 --> 2:15:19.540
 However, if I'm sitting here telling you

2:15:19.540 --> 2:15:22.020
 that I think this woman is a badass,

2:15:22.020 --> 2:15:24.660
 and she's amazing and she should be studied,

2:15:24.660 --> 2:15:26.640
 but there's also these idiosyncrasies,

2:15:26.640 --> 2:15:27.900
 they don't wanna hear it.

2:15:27.900 --> 2:15:30.340
 Because they, and I think it's very convenient for them

2:15:30.340 --> 2:15:32.220
 because there's a lot of things she did that were,

2:15:32.220 --> 2:15:33.380
 here's an example.

2:15:33.380 --> 2:15:36.720
 Rand was very, very pro happiness and pleasure.

2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:39.420
 She was very pro sex, which is kind of surprising

2:15:39.420 --> 2:15:41.820
 looking at her and how she talked and how strident she was.

2:15:41.820 --> 2:15:45.000
 As a result of this, she never got her cats fixed

2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:46.960
 to deny them the pleasure of orgasm.

2:15:46.960 --> 2:15:50.000
 So her male cats are spraying up her entire house.

2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:53.420
 Like that is, I mean, that's her putting her philosophy

2:15:53.420 --> 2:15:55.900
 into practice, but it's still gross.

2:15:55.900 --> 2:15:58.180
 So that's the kind of thing where I don't think he'd be,

2:15:58.180 --> 2:16:01.940
 another thing is Rand had an article on a woman president

2:16:01.940 --> 2:16:04.500
 and she said a woman should never be president, right?

2:16:04.500 --> 2:16:06.980
 Now, when Rand says things that are too goofy for them,

2:16:06.980 --> 2:16:09.660
 they say, oh, that's not objectivism,

2:16:09.660 --> 2:16:11.160
 that's her personal preference.

2:16:11.160 --> 2:16:14.360
 It's like, she did not have these lines.

2:16:14.360 --> 2:16:18.200
 Objectivism was always defined as Ayn Rand's writings,

2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:20.180
 plus the additional essays in her books.

2:16:20.180 --> 2:16:22.240
 So if this was in part of those books,

2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:24.060
 this counts as official objectivism,

2:16:24.060 --> 2:16:25.220
 but they pretend otherwise.

2:16:25.220 --> 2:16:26.420
 So that's another example.

2:16:26.420 --> 2:16:30.140
 Plus she was, and I bet you she was on the spectrum

2:16:30.140 --> 2:16:31.300
 to some extent, I'm not joking,

2:16:31.300 --> 2:16:32.700
 I'm not using that derisively.

2:16:32.700 --> 2:16:36.460
 She was of the belief and not inaccurately,

2:16:36.460 --> 2:16:40.900
 because that humor is used to denigrate and humiliate.

2:16:40.900 --> 2:16:42.660
 And she was thinking about the Jon Stewart type

2:16:42.660 --> 2:16:43.860
 before there was a Jon Stewart.

2:16:43.860 --> 2:16:46.540
 And a lot of times, like how I use mocking,

2:16:46.540 --> 2:16:49.340
 but she was resentful, correctly,

2:16:49.340 --> 2:16:51.880
 that a lot of times people who are great and accomplished,

2:16:51.880 --> 2:16:54.940
 little nobodies will make a punchline

2:16:54.940 --> 2:16:56.700
 just to bring them down and despise her.

2:16:56.700 --> 2:16:58.140
 Here's an example I just thought of.

2:16:58.140 --> 2:17:01.140
 I remember when it was, must have been the 90s,

2:17:01.140 --> 2:17:04.740
 they had a segment on MTV of all these musicians

2:17:04.740 --> 2:17:07.460
 who were making their own perfumes, right?

2:17:07.460 --> 2:17:09.340
 And this girl grabbed Prince's perfume,

2:17:09.340 --> 2:17:11.100
 and before she even smelled it, she had the joke ready.

2:17:11.100 --> 2:17:13.220
 She goes, oh, this smells almost as bad

2:17:13.220 --> 2:17:14.380
 as his music lately.

2:17:14.380 --> 2:17:16.300
 It's like, first of all, I'm sure the perfume's fine.

2:17:16.300 --> 2:17:18.140
 And second of all, this is Prince.

2:17:18.140 --> 2:17:19.700
 He's one of the all time greats,

2:17:19.700 --> 2:17:22.820
 and you can't wait to denigrate him.

2:17:22.820 --> 2:17:25.660
 And part, I wanna be like, how dare you?

2:17:25.660 --> 2:17:29.380
 Like as if this perfume in any way,

2:17:29.380 --> 2:17:32.020
 in any way mitigates his amazing accomplishments

2:17:32.020 --> 2:17:34.060
 and achievements, you horrible person.

2:17:34.060 --> 2:17:36.580
 But I do have some great Ayn Rand jokes,

2:17:36.580 --> 2:17:38.500
 and he would not be happy about them.

2:17:38.500 --> 2:17:40.980
 The perfume thing, the problem with it is just not funny.

2:17:40.980 --> 2:17:43.460
 Oh, he sucks, okay, great.

2:17:43.460 --> 2:17:47.380
 Not that they dared to try to be humorous,

2:17:47.380 --> 2:17:48.780
 because I don't know why you mentioned John,

2:17:48.780 --> 2:17:50.460
 because John Stewart can be funny.

2:17:50.460 --> 2:17:53.260
 Right, but he taught a generation,

2:17:53.260 --> 2:17:55.060
 you still see this on Twitter,

2:17:55.060 --> 2:17:58.900
 where things have to be inherently sarcastic and snide.

2:17:58.900 --> 2:18:00.900
 But isn't that, I mean, aren't you practicing that?

2:18:00.900 --> 2:18:02.740
 No, I use irony, not sarcasm.

2:18:02.740 --> 2:18:03.580
 Here's an example.

2:18:03.580 --> 2:18:05.180
 When people, like you say something,

2:18:05.180 --> 2:18:07.000
 and someone replied, it'd be like,

2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:08.740
 last I checked, blah, blah, blah, blah,

2:18:08.740 --> 2:18:09.860
 and I'll say that, I go,

2:18:09.860 --> 2:18:12.060
 what do you think saying last I checked added to your point?

2:18:12.060 --> 2:18:14.500
 You're giving me valuable information and data,

2:18:14.500 --> 2:18:16.440
 but you are trained to believe

2:18:16.440 --> 2:18:19.460
 that it has to be couched in this sneering.

2:18:19.460 --> 2:18:21.140
 It doesn't, just give me the information.

2:18:21.140 --> 2:18:22.460
 This is useful information.

2:18:22.460 --> 2:18:24.060
 Yeah, that's true.

2:18:24.060 --> 2:18:24.940
 It's a knee jerk.

2:18:24.940 --> 2:18:27.060
 But see, John Stewart did it masterfully.

2:18:27.060 --> 2:18:28.060
 Correct, and they don't.

2:18:28.060 --> 2:18:30.860
 And they don't, it's like people who copy comedians,

2:18:30.860 --> 2:18:34.840
 certain comedians, you try to copy them

2:18:34.840 --> 2:18:37.060
 and use everything in the process of copying.

2:18:37.060 --> 2:18:40.120
 Yeah, yep, okay.

2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:44.920
 But in terms of the philosophy of selfishness,

2:18:44.920 --> 2:18:47.880
 this kind of individual focused idea,

2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:50.860
 and I imagine that connects with you.

2:18:50.860 --> 2:18:52.960
 Yes, and I think it would connect with more people

2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:54.300
 if they understood what she meant by it.

2:18:54.300 --> 2:18:55.800
 Nathaniel Brandon, who was her heir

2:18:55.800 --> 2:18:57.160
 until she kind of broke with him,

2:18:57.160 --> 2:19:00.400
 and he was a co dedicatee of Atlas Shrugged,

2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:04.200
 said no one will say Ayn Rand's views with a straight face.

2:19:04.200 --> 2:19:08.200
 They won't say, I believe that my happiness matters

2:19:08.200 --> 2:19:10.480
 and is important and is worth fighting for,

2:19:10.480 --> 2:19:13.040
 and that Ayn Rand says this, then she's dangerous.

2:19:13.040 --> 2:19:14.560
 Now, it's very easy to say

2:19:14.560 --> 2:19:16.340
 this could have dangerous consequences

2:19:16.340 --> 2:19:17.600
 if you're a sociopath,

2:19:17.600 --> 2:19:21.220
 but to put it in those terms, I think is extremely healthy.

2:19:21.220 --> 2:19:23.000
 I think more people should wanna be happy.

2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:26.640
 And I think a lot of us are raised to be apologetic,

2:19:26.640 --> 2:19:29.360
 especially in this cynical media culture,

2:19:29.360 --> 2:19:32.400
 that if you say, I wanna be happy, I wanna love my life,

2:19:32.400 --> 2:19:34.240
 that it's just like, okay, sweetheart.

2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:35.680
 And the eye rolling,

2:19:35.680 --> 2:19:37.960
 and I think that's so pernicious and so horrifying,

2:19:37.960 --> 2:19:39.480
 this is why I'm a Camus person,

2:19:39.480 --> 2:19:41.400
 because Camus thought the archenemy was cynicism

2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:42.840
 and I could not agree more.

2:19:42.840 --> 2:19:44.080
 Like if you're the kind of person,

2:19:44.080 --> 2:19:45.400
 if someone likes a band and you're like,

2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:46.600
 oh, you like them, blah, blah, blah,

2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:49.160
 it's like, this gives them happiness.

2:19:49.160 --> 2:19:50.000
 Now, there's certain exceptions,

2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:52.360
 but if it gives you happiness, it's not for you,

2:19:52.360 --> 2:19:53.240
 that's cool.

2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:55.800
 Okay, this is beautiful.

2:19:55.800 --> 2:19:59.340
 I so agree with you on the eye rolling,

2:19:59.340 --> 2:20:04.100
 but you see the best of trolling as not the eye roll.

2:20:04.100 --> 2:20:05.320
 Correct, of course not.

2:20:05.320 --> 2:20:08.920
 The best of trolling is taking down the eye rollers.

2:20:08.920 --> 2:20:10.120
 I'm gonna have to think about that.

2:20:10.120 --> 2:20:10.960
 Okay.

2:20:10.960 --> 2:20:11.780
 Because I kind of.

2:20:11.780 --> 2:20:12.620
 Have another Red Bull.

2:20:12.620 --> 2:20:15.660
 Yeah, I was, yeah.

2:20:15.660 --> 2:20:16.500
 Because I put them all.

2:20:16.500 --> 2:20:17.660
 My blood type is Red Bull.

2:20:20.880 --> 2:20:22.800
 I kind of put them all in the same bin.

2:20:22.800 --> 2:20:23.640
 Okay.

2:20:23.640 --> 2:20:24.460
 And they're not.

2:20:24.460 --> 2:20:25.300
 They're not.

2:20:25.300 --> 2:20:26.140
 They're not.

2:20:26.140 --> 2:20:26.960
 Okay, all right.

2:20:26.960 --> 2:20:29.160
 Here's another example of trolling.

2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:30.600
 I was making jokes about Ron Paul,

2:20:30.600 --> 2:20:32.720
 he just had a stroke, right?

2:20:32.720 --> 2:20:35.080
 And someone came at me and they're like,

2:20:35.080 --> 2:20:36.000
 blah, blah, blah, blah.

2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:37.440
 You know, you're ugly.

2:20:37.440 --> 2:20:38.520
 I hope you have a stroke.

2:20:38.520 --> 2:20:39.440
 I hope you're in the hospital.

2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:42.280
 And I just go, I just did have a stroke on your mom's face.

2:20:42.280 --> 2:20:46.000
 So they came at me and now they got put in their place.

2:20:47.040 --> 2:20:50.320
 With a subpar, I mean.

2:20:50.320 --> 2:20:51.280
 I wasn't clever.

2:20:51.280 --> 2:20:52.400
 You weren't clever.

2:20:52.400 --> 2:20:53.640
 Not particularly, no.

2:20:53.640 --> 2:20:57.000
 Well, one of your things you do, which is interesting,

2:20:57.000 --> 2:20:59.280
 I mean, I give you props in a sense,

2:20:59.280 --> 2:21:03.840
 is you're willing to go farther than people expect you to.

2:21:03.840 --> 2:21:05.180
 Yes, that's fun.

2:21:05.180 --> 2:21:06.020
 Yeah.

2:21:06.020 --> 2:21:09.480
 In fact, I'll probably edit out like half of this podcast

2:21:09.480 --> 2:21:12.560
 because the thing you did, which she kept in,

2:21:12.560 --> 2:21:15.920
 should mention, is Michaela Peterson now has a podcast,

2:21:15.920 --> 2:21:16.840
 which is nice.

2:21:16.840 --> 2:21:18.400
 I guess, was it on her podcast?

2:21:18.400 --> 2:21:19.220
 She was on mine.

2:21:19.220 --> 2:21:20.060
 She was on yours.

2:21:20.060 --> 2:21:21.400
 We did both, but this is when you're referring

2:21:21.400 --> 2:21:22.400
 to when she was on mine.

2:21:22.400 --> 2:21:23.560
 She was on, yeah, right.

2:21:23.560 --> 2:21:27.880
 And you went right for the, for the.

2:21:27.880 --> 2:21:29.040
 So I'll tell you what it was.

2:21:29.040 --> 2:21:29.880
 You don't have to paraphrase.

2:21:29.880 --> 2:21:32.560
 I opened up, I say, you know, she's Jordan Peterson's dad.

2:21:32.560 --> 2:21:36.200
 And as many people know, sorry, he's her dad, yeah.

2:21:36.200 --> 2:21:39.880
 He's had a long issue with substance addiction.

2:21:39.880 --> 2:21:42.800
 And I said to her, you're most famous

2:21:42.800 --> 2:21:45.360
 for being Jordan Peterson's daughter.

2:21:45.360 --> 2:21:48.160
 Many people, he's changed so many lives around the world.

2:21:48.160 --> 2:21:51.720
 And he's been such an enormous influence to me personally

2:21:51.720 --> 2:21:54.760
 that I've started taking benzodiazepines recreationally.

2:21:54.760 --> 2:21:58.520
 And she's like, oh my God, Michael, it's so horrible.

2:21:58.520 --> 2:22:01.140
 Yeah, because you pulled me in with this,

2:22:01.140 --> 2:22:02.920
 cause you're talking, I mean, you know,

2:22:02.920 --> 2:22:04.360
 cause he's going through a rough time.

2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:07.400
 Now she's going through just everything was just,

2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:08.920
 you pulled me in emotionally.

2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:11.560
 I was like, this is going to be the sweet,

2:22:11.560 --> 2:22:14.640
 Mike is going to be just this wonderful.

2:22:14.640 --> 2:22:16.080
 And then just bam.

2:22:16.080 --> 2:22:21.000
 So that's, that's, that's, that was props to you on that.

2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:24.720
 It wasn't, whatever that is, that is an art form

2:22:24.720 --> 2:22:27.800
 when done well, it can be taken too far.

2:22:27.800 --> 2:22:32.800
 My criticism is it, that feels too good for some people.

2:22:33.160 --> 2:22:34.000
 What do you mean?

2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:35.960
 Oh, they're too happy being a reverend

2:22:35.960 --> 2:22:37.320
 cause to show that they don't care about anything.

2:22:37.320 --> 2:22:38.960
 That's another form of cynicism though.

2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:42.440
 Right, so I, cause you think it's possible to be a troll

2:22:42.440 --> 2:22:46.960
 and still be the live life to its highest ideal

2:22:46.960 --> 2:22:48.080
 in the Camus sense.

2:22:48.080 --> 2:22:51.080
 I try, that's kind of my ideal.

2:22:51.080 --> 2:22:55.840
 I believe it's not, it becomes a drug.

2:22:55.840 --> 2:22:57.080
 I feel like that takes you,

2:22:57.080 --> 2:23:01.860
 like I think love ultimately is the way to experience

2:23:01.860 --> 2:23:04.240
 like every moment of every day.

2:23:04.240 --> 2:23:06.800
 You don't think that was an expression of,

2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:09.680
 I honestly think, let's split hairs here

2:23:09.680 --> 2:23:12.080
 cause I think this is something of use here.

2:23:12.080 --> 2:23:14.400
 I do think that me,

2:23:15.960 --> 2:23:18.560
 me being able to make her laugh

2:23:18.560 --> 2:23:21.240
 about this year of hell she was in

2:23:21.240 --> 2:23:23.380
 does create an element of love

2:23:23.380 --> 2:23:25.080
 and connection between me and her.

2:23:25.080 --> 2:23:28.080
 Yeah, but I know she would say that.

2:23:28.080 --> 2:23:30.800
 Yes, it wasn't that.

2:23:30.800 --> 2:23:33.600
 It was what you said in combination

2:23:33.600 --> 2:23:37.460
 with the sweetness everywhere else, the kindness.

2:23:37.460 --> 2:23:38.960
 It's a very subtle thing,

2:23:38.960 --> 2:23:41.960
 but like, it's like some of the deepest connection

2:23:41.960 --> 2:23:46.040
 we have with others is when we like mock them lovingly.

2:23:46.040 --> 2:23:46.940
 Yes, correct.

2:23:46.940 --> 2:23:51.800
 But like there is stuff, there's kindness around that.

2:23:51.800 --> 2:23:53.000
 Sometimes it's not in words,

2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:55.180
 but in like subtle things.

2:23:55.180 --> 2:23:58.760
 Cause it creates an air of being familial.

2:23:58.760 --> 2:23:59.760
 Like we're through this together.

2:23:59.760 --> 2:24:02.480
 Yeah, that's missing,

2:24:02.480 --> 2:24:04.380
 that's very difficult to do on the internet.

2:24:04.380 --> 2:24:05.740
 I agree with you.

2:24:05.740 --> 2:24:06.580
 I agree with you.

2:24:06.580 --> 2:24:10.700
 That's why my general approach on the internet

2:24:10.700 --> 2:24:15.240
 is to be more like simple, less witty

2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:19.320
 and more like dumbly loving.

2:24:19.320 --> 2:24:23.080
 But that's not your core competency being witty.

2:24:23.080 --> 2:24:25.280
 Uh, me?

2:24:25.280 --> 2:24:26.280
 Yeah.

2:24:26.280 --> 2:24:27.800
 But I can be witty.

2:24:27.800 --> 2:24:29.760
 You can be, but I'm saying that's not your core competency.

2:24:29.760 --> 2:24:30.860
 I'm not saying you're bad at it,

2:24:30.860 --> 2:24:33.720
 but I'm saying that's not where you go like organically,

2:24:34.600 --> 2:24:36.800
 especially with strangers.

2:24:36.800 --> 2:24:40.200
 I just feel like nobody's core competence on the internet

2:24:40.200 --> 2:24:43.320
 is I guess if you want to bring love to the world,

2:24:43.320 --> 2:24:47.840
 nobody's core competence is given the current platforms,

2:24:47.840 --> 2:24:50.360
 nobody's core competence is wit.

2:24:50.360 --> 2:24:52.560
 It's very difficult to be witty on the internet

2:24:52.560 --> 2:24:55.460
 without while still communicating kindness.

2:24:55.460 --> 2:24:59.520
 Like in the same way that you can in physical space.

2:24:59.520 --> 2:25:00.400
 I'll give you another example.

2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:03.920
 Someone came at me and they were like,

2:25:03.920 --> 2:25:04.880
 they gave me a donation.

2:25:04.880 --> 2:25:06.200
 People do this all the time.

2:25:06.200 --> 2:25:09.800
 And they go, oh, like I started reading your books

2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:11.480
 cause of my wife and you know,

2:25:11.480 --> 2:25:14.980
 now watch your shows together, keep up the good work.

2:25:14.980 --> 2:25:17.440
 And I go, what does her boyfriend think?

2:25:17.440 --> 2:25:20.440
 So that is an example of wit and love

2:25:20.440 --> 2:25:23.000
 because that person feels seen.

2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:24.320
 I'm acknowledging them.

2:25:24.320 --> 2:25:25.880
 I'm also making a joke at their expense.

2:25:25.880 --> 2:25:27.280
 We know it's a joke.

2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:31.960
 So I think language is often used in nonliteral ways

2:25:31.960 --> 2:25:34.100
 to cue emotional and connectivity.

2:25:34.100 --> 2:25:37.060
 It's difficult, but what you've done

2:25:37.060 --> 2:25:39.600
 is difficult to accomplish, but you've done it well.

2:25:39.600 --> 2:25:43.320
 I mean, you've been doing these live streams,

2:25:43.320 --> 2:25:45.200
 which are nice that people give you a bunch of money

2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:46.440
 and donations and stuff.

2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:49.040
 And then you, you'll often like make fun

2:25:49.040 --> 2:25:51.040
 of certain aspects of their questions and so on,

2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:52.200
 but it's always lovely.

2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:53.040
 That's not from love.

2:25:53.040 --> 2:25:53.880
 That is genuine annoyance

2:25:53.880 --> 2:25:54.700
 cause they ask me some really dumb questions.

2:25:54.700 --> 2:25:57.840
 But they're still underlying, it's not even,

2:25:57.840 --> 2:26:00.400
 like there's a kind person under that

2:26:00.400 --> 2:26:02.280
 that's being communicated.

2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:03.120
 That's interesting.

2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:05.640
 But I don't know if I get that from your Twitter.

2:26:05.640 --> 2:26:07.520
 I know I get that from the video,

2:26:07.520 --> 2:26:09.560
 something about the face, something about like,

2:26:09.560 --> 2:26:10.400
 Yeah, of course.

2:26:10.400 --> 2:26:11.220
 The physical presentation.

2:26:11.220 --> 2:26:13.440
 The more data, the more easy it is

2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:15.160
 to convey emotion and subtlety.

2:26:15.160 --> 2:26:17.200
 Absolutely, if you only have literally black and white

2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:19.000
 letters, it's going to be, or whatever,

2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:20.640
 white and black, if you have night mode,

2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:21.720
 it's going to be a very different,

2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:23.640
 it's much more limited information.

2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:26.640
 Yeah, but this is the fundamental thing is like,

2:26:27.720 --> 2:26:28.560
 Here's another example.

2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:30.180
 Like if they had access to my face,

2:26:30.180 --> 2:26:32.240
 like a lot of times some people don't know who I am

2:26:32.240 --> 2:26:34.840
 and they come at me, call me a Nazi antisemite, right?

2:26:34.840 --> 2:26:36.240
 And I start talking about the Jews

2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:37.840
 and just how terrible the Jews are.

2:26:37.840 --> 2:26:39.360
 Now all my audience knows I'm Jewish

2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:40.200
 that I went to yeshiva.

2:26:40.200 --> 2:26:41.480
 So they're sitting there laughing

2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:43.440
 cause this person is making ass of themselves.

2:26:43.440 --> 2:26:44.880
 That person has no idea.

2:26:44.880 --> 2:26:47.440
 But if there was video, then they would be like,

2:26:47.440 --> 2:26:48.760
 okay, wait a minute, something's up.

2:26:48.760 --> 2:26:49.900
 Yeah, something's up.

2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:51.840
 I don't know.

2:26:52.800 --> 2:26:53.760
 I think it's entertaining.

2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:57.400
 I think it's fun, but I just, I don't think it's scalable.

2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:00.240
 And ultimately, I'm trying to figure out

2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:01.960
 this whole trolling thing.

2:27:01.960 --> 2:27:03.880
 Cause I think it's really destructive.

2:27:04.780 --> 2:27:08.920
 I've been the outrage mob, the outrage mobs,

2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:12.640
 just the dynamics of Twitter has been really bothering me.

2:27:12.640 --> 2:27:13.480
 Okay.

2:27:13.480 --> 2:27:17.000
 I've been trying to figure out if we can try to build

2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:19.800
 an alternative to Twitter perhaps

2:27:19.800 --> 2:27:22.140
 or try to encourage Twitter to be better,

2:27:22.140 --> 2:27:25.720
 how to have nuanced, healthy conversations.

2:27:25.720 --> 2:27:28.840
 Like the reason I talk about love isn't just for love's sake.

2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:31.840
 It's just a good base from which to have

2:27:31.840 --> 2:27:33.020
 difficult conversations.

2:27:33.020 --> 2:27:34.520
 Like that's a good starting point.

2:27:34.520 --> 2:27:38.720
 Because if you start, like I would argue that

2:27:38.720 --> 2:27:42.600
 the kind of conversation you have on Twitter is fun,

2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:44.640
 but it might not be a good starting point

2:27:44.640 --> 2:27:46.640
 for a difficult, nuanced conversation.

2:27:46.640 --> 2:27:48.200
 Well, I'm not interested in having

2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:49.800
 those conversations with most people.

2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:50.880
 No, I know, but.

2:27:50.880 --> 2:27:52.200
 So I agree with you.

2:27:52.200 --> 2:27:53.080
 Your point is valid.

2:27:53.080 --> 2:27:56.680
 Yes, but like I'm saying, so if we were trying to have

2:27:56.680 --> 2:27:58.960
 a difficult, nuanced conversation

2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:02.320
 about say race in America or policing,

2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:06.320
 is there institutional racism of policing?

2:28:06.320 --> 2:28:07.160
 Okay.

2:28:07.160 --> 2:28:10.800
 There's the only conversations that have been nuanced

2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:13.680
 about it that I've heard is in the podcasting medium.

2:28:13.680 --> 2:28:14.520
 I agree with you.

2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:17.000
 Which is the magic of podcasting, which is great.

2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:21.160
 But that's the downside of podcasting

2:28:21.160 --> 2:28:24.200
 is it's a very small number of people.

2:28:24.200 --> 2:28:27.680
 Even if it's in the thousands, it's still small.

2:28:27.680 --> 2:28:30.360
 And then there's millions of people on social media

2:28:30.360 --> 2:28:32.920
 and they're not having nuanced conversation at all.

2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:34.040
 They're not capable of it.

2:28:34.040 --> 2:28:35.120
 That's the difference in your thoughts.

2:28:35.120 --> 2:28:35.960
 They have no minds.

2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:36.800
 I believe they are.

2:28:36.800 --> 2:28:37.620
 So that's the.

2:28:37.620 --> 2:28:38.460
 There's no data that shows this.

2:28:38.460 --> 2:28:41.560
 Both of us aren't being not scientific.

2:28:41.560 --> 2:28:43.400
 You don't have data to support your world either.

2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:44.640
 You're making the claim.

2:28:45.640 --> 2:28:46.680
 Well, you are too.

2:28:46.680 --> 2:28:47.500
 No, I'm not.

2:28:47.500 --> 2:28:51.000
 If I'm looking at an object, the claim that it has in mind.

2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:51.840
 Well.

2:28:53.080 --> 2:28:54.660
 No, what?

2:28:54.660 --> 2:28:58.120
 No, your claim is that people are fundamentally stupid.

2:28:58.120 --> 2:28:59.680
 Are you a martial artist?

2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:01.200
 Yes.

2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:02.140
 How's it feel?

2:29:03.280 --> 2:29:05.000
 I just judo on you.

2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:05.840
 Yeah.

2:29:05.840 --> 2:29:10.120
 But you really don't think people are deep down

2:29:10.120 --> 2:29:13.480
 like capable of being intelligent.

2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:14.880
 No, not at all.

2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:16.000
 Not deep down, not surface.

2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:16.840
 I'm not joking.

2:29:16.840 --> 2:29:18.000
 I'm not being tongue in cheek.

2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:18.860
 I'm not being cynical.

2:29:18.860 --> 2:29:22.320
 I do not at all think they have this capacity.

2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:23.160
 I'm gonna think.

2:29:23.160 --> 2:29:24.580
 Cause you're being so clear about it.

2:29:24.580 --> 2:29:25.420
 You're not even.

2:29:26.280 --> 2:29:27.120
 I'm gonna have to think about that.

2:29:27.120 --> 2:29:27.960
 You know why?

2:29:27.960 --> 2:29:31.400
 Here's evidence for my position, not proof.

2:29:31.400 --> 2:29:33.740
 And this is of course data that is of little use,

2:29:33.740 --> 2:29:34.960
 but it's of interest.

2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:37.220
 A lot of times when you have an audience as big as mine

2:29:37.220 --> 2:29:38.760
 and people come at you,

2:29:38.760 --> 2:29:42.080
 not only will people say the same thing, the same concept,

2:29:42.080 --> 2:29:44.360
 they'll say the same concept in the same way.

2:29:44.360 --> 2:29:45.580
 That is not a mind.

2:29:46.740 --> 2:29:47.580
 Yeah.

2:29:47.580 --> 2:29:49.280
 That's surface evidence.

2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:52.680
 You're saying this iceberg looks like this from the surface.

2:29:52.680 --> 2:29:54.300
 I'm saying there's an iceberg there

2:29:54.300 --> 2:29:58.300
 that if challenged can rise to the occasion

2:30:01.400 --> 2:30:04.200
 of deep thinking and you're saying.

2:30:04.200 --> 2:30:05.040
 Nope.

2:30:05.040 --> 2:30:05.960
 Nope.

2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:07.120
 It's just frozen water.

2:30:08.680 --> 2:30:10.580
 Isn't that the Russian expression?

2:30:11.600 --> 2:30:12.840
 That's ice cream.

2:30:12.840 --> 2:30:13.680
 No, not.

2:30:14.600 --> 2:30:17.360
 Doesn't it mean like no one's there?

2:30:17.360 --> 2:30:18.180
 Actually, I don't know.

2:30:18.180 --> 2:30:19.800
 Yeah, it means like, yeah.

2:30:19.800 --> 2:30:20.880
 Yeah, it's like thought.

2:30:20.880 --> 2:30:21.720
 It means.

2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:26.320
 Okay.

2:30:26.320 --> 2:30:28.360
 Well, so you're challenging me

2:30:28.360 --> 2:30:29.960
 to be a little bit more rigorous.

2:30:29.960 --> 2:30:30.800
 I think I'll try.

2:30:30.800 --> 2:30:31.920
 I'm not challenging you anything.

2:30:31.920 --> 2:30:32.760
 I'm just saying.

2:30:32.760 --> 2:30:33.580
 No, not challenging me,

2:30:33.580 --> 2:30:35.720
 but like I'm challenging myself based on what you're saying

2:30:35.720 --> 2:30:37.900
 because I'd like to prove you wrong

2:30:37.900 --> 2:30:42.400
 and find actual data to show you're wrong.

2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:46.400
 And I think I can, but I would need to get that data.

2:30:46.400 --> 2:30:47.720
 That's funny you said, I think I can.

2:30:47.720 --> 2:30:50.700
 When they were working on my biography, Ego and Hubris,

2:30:50.700 --> 2:30:52.200
 the title I had suggested was

2:30:52.200 --> 2:30:54.160
 The Little Engine That Could But Shouldn't.

2:30:54.160 --> 2:30:57.320
 And they didn't like it.

2:30:57.320 --> 2:30:58.600
 I think that's a great title.

2:30:58.600 --> 2:31:00.160
 That's pretty good, yeah.

2:31:00.160 --> 2:31:01.720
 Speaking of biographies, I mean,

2:31:01.720 --> 2:31:04.080
 I read your book or listened to your book.

2:31:04.080 --> 2:31:04.920
 Listened to.

2:31:04.920 --> 2:31:05.920
 There's an audio book from you, right?

2:31:05.920 --> 2:31:06.960
 Yeah, I did the audio, yeah.

2:31:06.960 --> 2:31:08.000
 Yeah.

2:31:08.000 --> 2:31:08.920
 You read it?

2:31:08.920 --> 2:31:10.160
 My Golis, yes.

2:31:10.160 --> 2:31:11.000
 Okay.

2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:12.360
 So this was a.

2:31:12.360 --> 2:31:14.120
 I didn't do Yaron Brooks voice in the book.

2:31:14.120 --> 2:31:15.160
 I did all the different voices

2:31:15.160 --> 2:31:16.000
 because he has a lisp

2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:18.120
 and I didn't want to sound like I was making fun of him.

2:31:19.120 --> 2:31:21.540
 Yeah, I don't remember you reading it,

2:31:21.540 --> 2:31:23.520
 but I was really enjoyed it.

2:31:23.520 --> 2:31:24.360
 No, okay.

2:31:24.360 --> 2:31:25.180
 It was good.

2:31:25.180 --> 2:31:26.240
 It was like a year, a year and a half ago.

2:31:26.240 --> 2:31:27.380
 This I can prove.

2:31:27.380 --> 2:31:28.220
 It's just.

2:31:30.780 --> 2:31:32.260
 Well, let me at a high level,

2:31:32.260 --> 2:31:33.660
 see if you can pull this off.

2:31:33.660 --> 2:31:38.660
 If I ask you, what's the book you write about?

2:31:38.920 --> 2:31:42.740
 It's about a group of people

2:31:42.740 --> 2:31:46.740
 who are united solely by their opposition to progressivism,

2:31:46.740 --> 2:31:49.080
 who have little else in common,

2:31:49.080 --> 2:31:53.380
 but who are all frequently caricatured and dismissed

2:31:53.380 --> 2:31:56.400
 by the larger establishment media.

2:31:56.400 --> 2:32:00.220
 But you give this kind of story of how it came to be.

2:32:00.220 --> 2:32:01.060
 Sure.

2:32:01.060 --> 2:32:03.540
 And to me, like we're talking about trolls,

2:32:03.540 --> 2:32:06.860
 but the internet side of things is quite interesting.

2:32:06.860 --> 2:32:10.020
 So first of all, how does alt right connect?

2:32:10.020 --> 2:32:13.960
 So the alt right is the subset of the new right,

2:32:13.960 --> 2:32:16.780
 which feels that race, not racism,

2:32:16.780 --> 2:32:19.620
 is the most or one of the most important

2:32:19.620 --> 2:32:21.200
 socio political issues.

2:32:21.200 --> 2:32:26.200
 Are any of those folks like part of the mainstream

2:32:27.240 --> 2:32:29.240
 or worth paying attention to?

2:32:29.240 --> 2:32:30.420
 None of them are part of the mainstream.

2:32:30.420 --> 2:32:32.220
 The alt right, by definition,

2:32:32.220 --> 2:32:33.800
 they would be part of the mainstream.

2:32:33.800 --> 2:32:34.920
 They would not be part of them.

2:32:34.920 --> 2:32:36.160
 No, they would not.

2:32:36.160 --> 2:32:38.640
 I don't know that any of them.

2:32:38.640 --> 2:32:40.000
 Well, worth is not a position.

2:32:40.000 --> 2:32:41.840
 I'm not in a position to say worth.

2:32:41.840 --> 2:32:45.360
 I would say that it is of use

2:32:45.360 --> 2:32:48.200
 to be familiar with their arguments

2:32:48.200 --> 2:32:51.320
 because to dismiss any school of thought,

2:32:51.320 --> 2:32:54.680
 especially one that has historically gained leverage,

2:32:54.680 --> 2:32:57.020
 especially one that has historically gained leverage

2:32:57.020 --> 2:32:59.520
 in very dark ways, especially in America,

2:32:59.520 --> 2:33:01.200
 in Europe and other places,

2:33:01.200 --> 2:33:03.080
 just to say, oh, they're racist.

2:33:03.080 --> 2:33:04.340
 I don't need to think about them.

2:33:04.340 --> 2:33:07.220
 It doesn't behoove you.

2:33:07.220 --> 2:33:12.220
 So what lessons do we draw from the 4chan side of things,

2:33:13.400 --> 2:33:16.200
 like the internet side of the movement?

2:33:16.200 --> 2:33:19.000
 Tits or get the fuck out.

2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:21.120
 Can you define every single word in there?

2:33:21.120 --> 2:33:24.080
 Tits or breasts or get the fuck out.

2:33:24.080 --> 2:33:25.520
 That's from 4chan.

2:33:25.520 --> 2:33:28.160
 Okay, what's it mean?

2:33:28.160 --> 2:33:29.960
 Oh, sometimes like a woman will appear in 4chan

2:33:29.960 --> 2:33:32.200
 and they'll just reply, tits or get the fuck out.

2:33:34.480 --> 2:33:35.640
 I'm trying to understand what that,

2:33:35.640 --> 2:33:37.240
 oh, oh, that's a way.

2:33:41.400 --> 2:33:44.360
 I just, very slow.

2:33:44.360 --> 2:33:47.680
 Oh, so that's, okay, so that's very disrespectful

2:33:47.680 --> 2:33:52.520
 towards female members of the community.

2:33:52.520 --> 2:33:53.600
 I don't understand.

2:33:53.600 --> 2:33:55.080
 There's rules to this community

2:33:55.080 --> 2:33:58.760
 and one of them is we're not very good with women.

2:33:58.760 --> 2:33:59.600
 Is that, that's one of the rules?

2:33:59.600 --> 2:34:02.280
 It's more of a principle than a rule.

2:34:02.280 --> 2:34:04.080
 It's a principle?

2:34:04.080 --> 2:34:06.240
 We're not going to ever get laid.

2:34:06.240 --> 2:34:07.900
 That's fundamentally the principle.

2:34:07.900 --> 2:34:08.740
 Is there other principles?

2:34:08.740 --> 2:34:10.240
 But we are gonna get pics.

2:34:10.240 --> 2:34:11.080
 Pics.

2:34:11.080 --> 2:34:11.900
 Sometimes.

2:34:11.900 --> 2:34:12.740
 Sometimes on the internet.

2:34:12.740 --> 2:34:15.120
 Sometimes they GTFO.

2:34:15.120 --> 2:34:19.120
 Okay, so is there other actual principles of,

2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:24.360
 so like it's, from my maybe naive perspective

2:34:24.360 --> 2:34:26.660
 is they have like the darkest aspects of trolling,

2:34:26.660 --> 2:34:28.780
 which is like take nothing serious,

2:34:28.780 --> 2:34:30.440
 make a game out of everything.

2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:31.840
 That's not 4chan per se.

2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:34.200
 One of the things that you will learn in 4chan,

2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:35.880
 which I think is very healthy,

2:34:35.880 --> 2:34:39.500
 is if you have an idiosocratic or unique worldview

2:34:39.500 --> 2:34:42.020
 or focus on an aspect of history or culture,

2:34:42.020 --> 2:34:43.760
 you'll be able to find like minded people

2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:45.400
 who you will engage with you and discuss it

2:34:45.400 --> 2:34:48.120
 without being preemptively dismissive.

2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:51.000
 That's an ideal that they.

2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:51.840
 Well, it's not ideal.

2:34:51.840 --> 2:34:52.840
 It's something that happens a lot.

2:34:52.840 --> 2:34:53.880
 Now 4chan's not really,

2:34:53.880 --> 2:34:56.480
 like Paul is their board with politics,

2:34:56.480 --> 2:34:59.000
 but they will get into some,

2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:01.880
 like the people there are much more erudite than you'd think.

2:35:01.880 --> 2:35:03.080
 So they do take,

2:35:03.080 --> 2:35:05.260
 my perception was they take nothing seriously.

2:35:05.260 --> 2:35:07.360
 So there's things that they take seriously,

2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:08.640
 like discussing ideas.

2:35:08.640 --> 2:35:09.620
 I'll give you one example.

2:35:09.620 --> 2:35:11.280
 There was a video someone posted

2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:13.200
 of a girl who put kittens in a bag

2:35:13.200 --> 2:35:14.420
 and threw it in a river.

2:35:14.420 --> 2:35:16.080
 And they found out where she was within a day

2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:17.500
 and got her like arrested.

2:35:17.500 --> 2:35:19.920
 So yeah, they do take some things very seriously.

2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:21.800
 Okay.

2:35:21.800 --> 2:35:24.200
 But that's like an extreme that,

2:35:24.200 --> 2:35:25.080
 I mean, that's good.

2:35:25.080 --> 2:35:26.200
 First of all, that's heartwarming

2:35:26.200 --> 2:35:29.440
 that they wouldn't somehow turn that into a thing.

2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:31.780
 That feels like more of a, what is it?

2:35:31.780 --> 2:35:32.620
 What's the other one?

2:35:32.620 --> 2:35:33.440
 8chan?

2:35:33.440 --> 2:35:36.020
 8chan's twice as good as 4chan, yeah.

2:35:36.020 --> 2:35:36.960
 That's their slogan.

2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:40.500
 But it feels like they're the kind of community

2:35:40.500 --> 2:35:43.520
 that would take that kitten situation

2:35:43.520 --> 2:35:45.080
 and make a mockery of it.

2:35:45.080 --> 2:35:47.440
 Yeah, they're darker than 4chan.

2:35:47.440 --> 2:35:50.180
 I don't even, I'm not allowed to talk about 16chan.

2:35:51.320 --> 2:35:55.600
 I'm already overwhelmed clearly by 4chan lingo.

2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:58.900
 I literally wrote down in my notes,

2:36:00.960 --> 2:36:04.400
 like in doing research for this conversation,

2:36:04.400 --> 2:36:05.900
 I learned the word pleb.

2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:09.440
 And I wanted to ask you what this pleb means.

2:36:09.440 --> 2:36:10.480
 Do you know what pleb means?

2:36:10.480 --> 2:36:11.320
 No.

2:36:13.480 --> 2:36:16.280
 I saw, I mean, actually, no, I don't.

2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:17.720
 You know what a pleb is?

2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:20.080
 I just, I don't know what a pleb is.

2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:22.300
 Like a plebiscite or plebeian.

2:36:22.300 --> 2:36:23.140
 Okay.

2:36:23.140 --> 2:36:25.900
 But does it mean something more sophisticated?

2:36:27.080 --> 2:36:29.060
 No, it's a very unsophisticated mechanism

2:36:29.060 --> 2:36:30.700
 of being dismissive.

2:36:30.700 --> 2:36:32.760
 Of like the regular people.

2:36:32.760 --> 2:36:35.300
 Yeah, or someone who comes at me on Twitter.

2:36:35.300 --> 2:36:36.140
 Okay.

2:36:36.140 --> 2:36:39.360
 All right, so back to the 4chan alt right.

2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:40.400
 Wasn't the...

2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:41.720
 Those are very different concepts.

2:36:41.720 --> 2:36:43.560
 Don't conflate them.

2:36:43.560 --> 2:36:48.560
 But which internet culture was the alt right born out of?

2:36:48.720 --> 2:36:51.180
 Well, alt right was more born of blogs.

2:36:51.180 --> 2:36:53.440
 And people had different blogs that were posting

2:36:53.440 --> 2:36:55.080
 what they call like racial realism,

2:36:55.080 --> 2:36:57.520
 which is scientific racism, so called.

2:36:57.520 --> 2:37:00.440
 And breaking down issues from a racialist perspective.

2:37:00.440 --> 2:37:03.760
 So that wasn't, 4chan is much more dynamic.

2:37:03.760 --> 2:37:04.760
 It's a message board.

2:37:04.760 --> 2:37:06.600
 It's very fluid.

2:37:06.600 --> 2:37:08.040
 So it doesn't lend itself

2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:11.560
 to these kind of in depth analysis of ideas or history.

2:37:11.560 --> 2:37:12.800
 But it spreads them.

2:37:12.800 --> 2:37:13.640
 Like it...

2:37:13.640 --> 2:37:15.200
 It spreads them as memes, yeah.

2:37:15.200 --> 2:37:16.360
 And you know, but...

2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:18.520
 But it's not an essential mechanism

2:37:18.520 --> 2:37:20.800
 of the alt right, historically?

2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:22.320
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

2:37:22.320 --> 2:37:24.160
 So it was mostly about blogs.

2:37:24.160 --> 2:37:28.040
 Okay, so what do you make of the psychology

2:37:28.040 --> 2:37:29.600
 of this kind of worldview?

2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:30.440
 When you have...

2:37:30.440 --> 2:37:33.840
 This goes to your conspiracy theory subject earlier.

2:37:33.840 --> 2:37:36.460
 When you have a little bit of knowledge about something,

2:37:36.460 --> 2:37:39.000
 about history that no one's talking about,

2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:42.160
 and there's only one group that is talking about it,

2:37:42.160 --> 2:37:45.340
 and you have no alternative answers,

2:37:45.340 --> 2:37:47.300
 you're going to be drawn to that group.

2:37:47.300 --> 2:37:51.600
 So because issues about race, anti semitism, homophobia

2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:53.880
 are so taboo in our culture,

2:37:53.880 --> 2:37:55.320
 understandably there's good reasons.

2:37:55.320 --> 2:37:56.560
 If you start putting things like,

2:37:56.560 --> 2:37:58.680
 how old should you be to have sex with kids

2:37:58.680 --> 2:38:00.120
 and just have regular conversations,

2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:01.280
 eventually some people are gonna start

2:38:01.280 --> 2:38:02.520
 taking some positions you don't like.

2:38:02.520 --> 2:38:04.600
 So some things have to be sanctified to some extent.

2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:06.440
 They're the only ones talking about it.

2:38:06.440 --> 2:38:09.260
 You're gonna be drawn to that subculture.

2:38:10.640 --> 2:38:13.080
 And where does the alt right stand now?

2:38:13.080 --> 2:38:15.360
 I mean, I hear that term used...

2:38:15.360 --> 2:38:18.320
 So the term has been weaponized by the corporate press

2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:22.440
 for people that they want to read out of society.

2:38:22.440 --> 2:38:24.320
 So it's used both on individual levels,

2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:27.360
 like people like Gavin McIngus, Milo Yiannopoulos,

2:38:27.360 --> 2:38:28.760
 some others.

2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:31.780
 I mean, I think they've referred to Trump as alt right.

2:38:31.780 --> 2:38:36.600
 And it's become a slur, just like incel or bot,

2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:39.720
 that has become largely removed from its original meaning.

2:38:39.720 --> 2:38:41.840
 Do you have a sense that there's still a movement

2:38:41.840 --> 2:38:43.000
 that's alt right or like...

2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:44.440
 Yeah, they call themselves now...

2:38:44.440 --> 2:38:47.440
 Okay, so there's something called the dissonant right.

2:38:47.440 --> 2:38:49.720
 And they say, we're completely not like the alt right

2:38:49.720 --> 2:38:53.180
 because the alt right's A, B, and C, and we're B, C, D.

2:38:53.180 --> 2:38:54.420
 There's a huge overlap.

2:38:54.420 --> 2:38:56.080
 It's very much the same people.

2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:59.200
 Is there intellectuals that still represent

2:38:59.200 --> 2:39:01.360
 some aspect of the movement?

2:39:01.360 --> 2:39:02.400
 I mean, sure.

2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:03.240
 Are you tracking this?

2:39:03.240 --> 2:39:05.200
 Not that much anymore.

2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:06.920
 I think they're...

2:39:06.920 --> 2:39:09.160
 I don't find it particularly as...

2:39:10.360 --> 2:39:12.240
 Now that the book's done,

2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:15.840
 I'm looking more into history for my next book.

2:39:15.840 --> 2:39:16.920
 You mentioned communism?

2:39:16.920 --> 2:39:19.620
 I'm gonna talk a lot about the Cold War.

2:39:19.620 --> 2:39:22.040
 So this kind of stuff has largely fallen away

2:39:22.040 --> 2:39:24.000
 from my radar to some extent.

2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:27.080
 And it's been a very effective movement

2:39:27.080 --> 2:39:29.720
 to get them marginalized and silenced.

2:39:29.720 --> 2:39:32.920
 So they're not as deep of a concern

2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:34.520
 in terms of concern or not,

2:39:34.520 --> 2:39:36.480
 just their impact on society.

2:39:36.480 --> 2:39:38.440
 Yes, it's much lessened, yeah.

2:39:38.440 --> 2:39:42.220
 So as a troll on Twitter, in the best sense of the word,

2:39:42.220 --> 2:39:45.120
 what do you make of cancel culture?

2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:47.400
 I think it's Maoism.

2:39:47.400 --> 2:39:50.160
 I mean, corporate America has done a far better job

2:39:50.160 --> 2:39:52.640
 of implementing Maoism than the communist party ever could.

2:39:52.640 --> 2:39:54.320
 You had this meeting not that long ago

2:39:54.320 --> 2:39:56.520
 from I think it was Northwestern University Law School

2:39:56.520 --> 2:39:57.920
 where everyone on the call got up

2:39:57.920 --> 2:39:59.420
 and said that they were racist.

2:39:59.420 --> 2:40:01.160
 I mean, this is something that legally

2:40:01.160 --> 2:40:02.920
 you should be very averse to saying,

2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:04.240
 even if it were true.

2:40:04.240 --> 2:40:06.500
 And it's this kind of concept of getting up

2:40:06.500 --> 2:40:08.780
 and confessing your sins before the collective

2:40:08.780 --> 2:40:10.360
 is something completely.

2:40:12.200 --> 2:40:14.160
 Oh, sorry, they admitted this of themselves?

2:40:14.160 --> 2:40:15.080
 Yeah, they were like,

2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:16.200
 because they're saying because they're white,

2:40:16.200 --> 2:40:17.040
 they're inherently racist.

2:40:17.040 --> 2:40:18.560
 So my name's John, I'm a racist.

2:40:18.560 --> 2:40:20.360
 My name's this, I'm a racist.

2:40:20.360 --> 2:40:22.720
 You hear it and you're like, okay, this is Looney Tunes.

2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:25.240
 So you're saying that, wow, that's so much,

2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:26.440
 you took a step further.

2:40:26.440 --> 2:40:30.040
 So you're saying there's like a deep underlying force

2:40:30.040 --> 2:40:31.720
 that cancels culture.

2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:33.560
 It's not just some kind of mob.

2:40:33.560 --> 2:40:35.060
 Well, it's not a mob at all.

2:40:35.060 --> 2:40:40.060
 It's a systemic organized movement being used

2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:42.320
 for very nefarious purposes

2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:44.300
 and to dominate an entire nation.

2:40:45.160 --> 2:40:46.120
 How do we fight it?

2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:48.520
 Because I sense it inside.

2:40:48.520 --> 2:40:51.520
 You know, I used to defend academia more

2:40:51.520 --> 2:40:56.520
 because I still do to some extent.

2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:02.000
 It's a nuanced discussion because, you know,

2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:03.840
 like folks like Jordan Peterson

2:41:03.840 --> 2:41:06.800
 and a lot of people that kind of attack academia,

2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:10.220
 they refer, they really are talking about gender studies

2:41:10.220 --> 2:41:11.280
 at certain departments.

2:41:11.280 --> 2:41:13.960
 And me from MIT, you know,

2:41:13.960 --> 2:41:15.820
 it's the University of Science and Engineering

2:41:15.820 --> 2:41:20.820
 and the faculty there really don't think

2:41:20.820 --> 2:41:24.060
 about these issues or haven't traditionally thought of,

2:41:24.060 --> 2:41:26.260
 but it's beginning to even infiltrate there.

2:41:26.260 --> 2:41:30.700
 It's the, you know, it's starting to infiltrate engineering

2:41:30.700 --> 2:41:32.500
 and sciences outside of biology.

2:41:32.500 --> 2:41:35.360
 Like let's put biology with the gender studies.

2:41:35.360 --> 2:41:36.980
 Like I'm talking about sciences

2:41:36.980 --> 2:41:40.140
 that really don't have anything to do with gender.

2:41:40.140 --> 2:41:44.720
 It's starting to infiltrate and it worries me.

2:41:45.580 --> 2:41:46.700
 I don't know exactly why,

2:41:46.700 --> 2:41:49.560
 like I don't know exactly what the negative effect

2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:54.560
 there would be, except it feels like it's anti intellectual.

2:41:55.780 --> 2:41:57.340
 Oh yes, of course.

2:41:57.340 --> 2:41:59.020
 And I'm not sure what to,

2:41:59.020 --> 2:42:02.260
 because on the surface,

2:42:02.260 --> 2:42:05.340
 it feels like a path towards progress.

2:42:05.340 --> 2:42:08.740
 At first, when I'm like zoomed out, you know,

2:42:08.740 --> 2:42:11.700
 just like squinting my eyes, you know,

2:42:11.700 --> 2:42:13.940
 not even in detail looking at things,

2:42:13.940 --> 2:42:15.780
 but when I actually joined the conversation

2:42:15.780 --> 2:42:20.320
 to like listen in the conversation on quote unquote diversity,

2:42:20.320 --> 2:42:23.820
 it quickly makes me realize

2:42:23.820 --> 2:42:28.820
 that there's no interest in making a better world.

2:42:29.900 --> 2:42:31.340
 No, no, it's about domination.

2:42:31.340 --> 2:42:33.500
 It's about getting, yeah.

2:42:33.500 --> 2:42:37.780
 It's a way for, if you are a lowest status white person,

2:42:37.780 --> 2:42:41.080
 using anti racism is the only mechanism you will have

2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:43.380
 to feel superior to another human being.

2:42:43.380 --> 2:42:48.160
 So it's very useful for them in terms of fighting it.

2:42:48.160 --> 2:42:50.500
 One of my suggestions has been to seize

2:42:50.500 --> 2:42:51.980
 all university endowments,

2:42:51.980 --> 2:42:54.140
 which are the crystallization of privilege

2:42:54.140 --> 2:42:56.660
 and distribute that money as reparations.

2:42:56.660 --> 2:42:59.040
 So be very effective by turning two populations

2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:01.360
 against each other and strongly diminishing

2:43:01.360 --> 2:43:04.260
 the university's intellectual hegemony.

2:43:04.260 --> 2:43:07.020
 The universities are absolutely the real villains

2:43:07.020 --> 2:43:08.000
 in the picture.

2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:10.180
 Thankfully, they're also the least prepared

2:43:10.180 --> 2:43:12.140
 to be aggressed upon.

2:43:12.140 --> 2:43:15.460
 And after the government and the corporate press,

2:43:15.460 --> 2:43:17.320
 they are the last leg of the stool,

2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:18.460
 and they don't know what's coming,

2:43:18.460 --> 2:43:21.380
 and it's gonna get ugly, and I cannot wait.

2:43:21.380 --> 2:43:22.900
 So this is where you and I disagree.

2:43:22.900 --> 2:43:25.740
 Part one, yeah, we disagree in the sense

2:43:25.740 --> 2:43:30.740
 that you want to dismantle broken institutions.

2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:31.640
 I don't think they're broken.

2:43:31.640 --> 2:43:32.460
 They're powerful.

2:43:32.460 --> 2:43:33.300
 They're working like by design.

2:43:33.300 --> 2:43:34.940
 I think for over 100 years,

2:43:34.940 --> 2:43:36.820
 they have been talking about bringing

2:43:36.820 --> 2:43:38.700
 the next generation of American leaders,

2:43:38.700 --> 2:43:42.340
 which is code, for promulgating an ideology

2:43:42.340 --> 2:43:46.700
 based on egalitarian principles and world domination.

2:43:47.540 --> 2:43:50.180
 Let me try to express my lived experience.

2:43:50.180 --> 2:43:51.020
 Okay, sure.

2:43:51.900 --> 2:43:56.460
 My experience at MIT is that there's a bunch

2:43:56.460 --> 2:44:00.300
 of administrators that are, the bureaucracy,

2:44:00.300 --> 2:44:03.980
 that I can say, this is the nice thing

2:44:03.980 --> 2:44:06.100
 about having a podcast, I don't give a damn,

2:44:06.100 --> 2:44:07.540
 is they're pretty useless.

2:44:07.540 --> 2:44:09.380
 In fact, they get in the way.

2:44:09.380 --> 2:44:12.480
 But there's faculty, there's professors,

2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:15.140
 that are incredible.

2:44:15.140 --> 2:44:16.580
 They're incredible human beings

2:44:16.580 --> 2:44:20.580
 that all they do all day, they're too busy,

2:44:20.580 --> 2:44:23.660
 but for the most part, what they do all day

2:44:23.660 --> 2:44:26.940
 is just like continually pursue different

2:44:26.940 --> 2:44:29.580
 little trajectories of curiosities

2:44:29.580 --> 2:44:33.100
 in the various avenues of science that they work on.

2:44:33.100 --> 2:44:38.100
 And as a side effect of that, they mentor

2:44:38.140 --> 2:44:40.740
 a group of students, sometimes a large group of students,

2:44:40.740 --> 2:44:43.300
 and also teach courses, and they're constantly

2:44:43.300 --> 2:44:45.900
 sharing their passion with others.

2:44:45.900 --> 2:44:49.220
 And my experience is it's just a bunch of people

2:44:49.220 --> 2:44:52.160
 who are curious about engineering and math

2:44:52.160 --> 2:44:55.060
 and science, chemistry, artificial intelligence,

2:44:55.060 --> 2:44:57.700
 computer science, what I'm most familiar with.

2:44:57.700 --> 2:45:01.220
 And there's never this feeling of MIT

2:45:01.220 --> 2:45:04.700
 being broken somehow, like this kind of feeling.

2:45:04.700 --> 2:45:08.300
 Like if I talk to you just now, or like Eric Weinstein,

2:45:08.300 --> 2:45:11.540
 there's a feeling like stuff is on fire, right?

2:45:11.540 --> 2:45:13.900
 There's something deeply broken.

2:45:13.900 --> 2:45:18.900
 But when I'm in the system, especially before the COVID,

2:45:19.020 --> 2:45:22.680
 before this kind of tension, everything was great.

2:45:22.680 --> 2:45:25.360
 There was no discussion of, even diversity,

2:45:25.360 --> 2:45:28.100
 all that kind of stuff, the toxic stuff

2:45:28.100 --> 2:45:30.020
 that we might be talking about right now,

2:45:30.020 --> 2:45:30.960
 none of that was happening.

2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:35.060
 There was a bunch of people just in love with cool ideas,

2:45:35.060 --> 2:45:37.300
 exploring ideas, being curious, and learning,

2:45:37.300 --> 2:45:38.540
 and all that kind of stuff.

2:45:38.540 --> 2:45:43.380
 So I don't, my sense of academia was this is the place

2:45:43.380 --> 2:45:47.860
 where kids in their 20s, 30s, and 40s can continue

2:45:47.860 --> 2:45:50.740
 the playground of science, having fun.

2:45:50.740 --> 2:45:54.100
 It's, if you destroy academia, if you destroy universities,

2:45:54.100 --> 2:45:58.100
 like you're suggesting kind of lessening their power,

2:45:58.100 --> 2:46:00.180
 you take away the playground from these kids

2:46:00.180 --> 2:46:01.860
 to play.

2:46:01.860 --> 2:46:03.500
 It's gonna be hard for you to tell me

2:46:03.500 --> 2:46:05.020
 that I'm anti playground.

2:46:05.020 --> 2:46:07.100
 Yeah, well, I guess I'm saying you're anti

2:46:07.100 --> 2:46:08.980
 certain kinds of playgrounds, which is.

2:46:08.980 --> 2:46:10.820
 Yeah, the ones that have the broken glass on the floor.

2:46:10.820 --> 2:46:13.180
 Yeah, I am against those kinds of playgrounds.

2:46:14.220 --> 2:46:18.060
 No, you're, you're, you're.

2:46:18.060 --> 2:46:18.900
 Yes. Nope.

2:46:18.900 --> 2:46:19.740
 See, see.

2:46:19.740 --> 2:46:21.460
 Now you see, now you listen.

2:46:21.460 --> 2:46:22.940
 Now you, now you wait.

2:46:22.940 --> 2:46:27.460
 Yeah, I would say you're being the watchful mother who,

2:46:27.460 --> 2:46:29.860
 the one kid who hurt themselves in the glass.

2:46:29.860 --> 2:46:32.420
 One kid, it's an entire, it's generation after generation.

2:46:32.420 --> 2:46:33.260
 I'm not a watchful mother.

2:46:33.260 --> 2:46:34.660
 I'm the guy with the flamethrower.

2:46:34.660 --> 2:46:36.900
 No, I, I, I understand that.

2:46:37.780 --> 2:46:41.220
 But you're using the one kid who was always kind of like

2:46:41.220 --> 2:46:44.180
 weird, aka gender studies department.

2:46:44.180 --> 2:46:45.020
 Okay.

2:46:45.020 --> 2:46:47.340
 That, that hurt themselves on the glass,

2:46:47.340 --> 2:46:49.220
 as opposed to the people who are like,

2:46:49.220 --> 2:46:53.900
 obviously having fun in the playground and not playing

2:46:53.900 --> 2:46:55.580
 by the glass, the broken glass.

2:46:55.580 --> 2:46:57.960
 And they're just, I mean, to me,

2:46:57.960 --> 2:47:00.180
 some of the best innovations in science

2:47:00.180 --> 2:47:02.060
 happen in universities.

2:47:02.060 --> 2:47:02.900
 Okay.

2:47:02.900 --> 2:47:07.020
 You can't forget that universities don't have this

2:47:07.020 --> 2:47:12.020
 liberal, like politics literally in every conversation

2:47:13.100 --> 2:47:15.180
 until this year, until this year,

2:47:15.180 --> 2:47:16.500
 there's something happening.

2:47:16.500 --> 2:47:19.420
 But every conversation I've ever had had nothing to do

2:47:19.420 --> 2:47:20.260
 with politics.

2:47:20.260 --> 2:47:22.220
 We never, Trump never came up.

2:47:22.220 --> 2:47:23.840
 None of that ever come up.

2:47:23.840 --> 2:47:24.680
 Nothing.

2:47:24.680 --> 2:47:27.340
 Like all this kind of idea that there's liberal, all that.

2:47:27.340 --> 2:47:29.820
 But that, that's in the humanities.

2:47:29.820 --> 2:47:30.660
 Yeah.

2:47:30.660 --> 2:47:33.460
 But do you think MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

2:47:33.460 --> 2:47:34.740
 might be a little bit of an outlier?

2:47:34.740 --> 2:47:35.900
 Yeah, that probably is.

2:47:35.900 --> 2:47:36.740
 Yeah.

2:47:36.740 --> 2:47:40.540
 But I, I don't, I honestly don't think when people

2:47:40.540 --> 2:47:43.860
 criticize academia, they're looking at,

2:47:43.860 --> 2:47:46.700
 they're in fact also picking the outliers,

2:47:46.700 --> 2:47:49.460
 which is they're picking some of the quote unquote

2:47:49.460 --> 2:47:51.300
 strongest gender studies departments.

2:47:51.300 --> 2:47:52.140
 This is nonsensical.

2:47:52.140 --> 2:47:55.060
 When I was at Bucknell, it was a college student.

2:47:55.060 --> 2:47:57.580
 We had to take, you know, we had a bunch of electives

2:47:57.580 --> 2:47:59.500
 and I wanted to take a class on individual,

2:47:59.500 --> 2:48:01.140
 American individualism.

2:48:01.140 --> 2:48:04.440
 One of the texts of the five that we had to read

2:48:04.440 --> 2:48:07.440
 was Birth of a Nation, the movie about the Klan.

2:48:08.300 --> 2:48:12.720
 So there's no department where these people

2:48:12.720 --> 2:48:17.400
 are not thoroughgoing, hardcore ideologues.

2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:18.240
 This is not a gender.

2:48:18.240 --> 2:48:19.340
 That's the humanities, that's the humanities.

2:48:19.340 --> 2:48:21.940
 Fine, all the humanities, not just gender studies.

2:48:21.940 --> 2:48:22.780
 Okay, fine.

2:48:22.780 --> 2:48:23.620
 I can give you.

2:48:23.620 --> 2:48:27.100
 Theory, English, all of them, every university,

2:48:27.100 --> 2:48:31.620
 as you know, has it mandatory in the curriculum

2:48:31.620 --> 2:48:34.480
 they have to take a bunch of these propaganda classes.

2:48:35.700 --> 2:48:37.580
 I look forward to YouTube comments

2:48:37.580 --> 2:48:39.680
 because you're being more eloquent

2:48:39.680 --> 2:48:40.940
 and you're speaking to the thing

2:48:40.940 --> 2:48:42.340
 that a lot of people agree with

2:48:42.340 --> 2:48:44.220
 and I'm being my usual slow self

2:48:44.220 --> 2:48:46.980
 and people are going to say not very nice things about me.

2:48:46.980 --> 2:48:50.100
 Don't say anything that nice about Lex, please.

2:48:50.100 --> 2:48:51.020
 Let me try to just.

2:48:51.020 --> 2:48:52.940
 Just shoot up a school.

2:48:52.940 --> 2:48:54.380
 That would be preferable.

2:48:54.380 --> 2:48:55.720
 There he goes again.

2:48:55.720 --> 2:48:56.560
 Only the teachers.

2:48:56.560 --> 2:48:58.300
 Going to the darkest possible place.

2:48:58.300 --> 2:48:59.700
 That's sunshine, baby, schools.

2:48:59.700 --> 2:49:01.620
 That's where everyone goes to be happy, playgrounds.

2:49:01.620 --> 2:49:03.400
 There he goes, dark ear.

2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:07.500
 Just dives right in, just go dark

2:49:07.500 --> 2:49:09.660
 and then just comes back up to the surface.

2:49:10.620 --> 2:49:13.300
 I don't have to feel this way anymore.

2:49:13.300 --> 2:49:15.300
 Just one day in the world.

2:49:18.340 --> 2:49:19.920
 You're probably a figment of my imagination.

2:49:19.920 --> 2:49:21.260
 I'm not even having this podcast.

2:49:21.260 --> 2:49:23.140
 Well, after 18 Red Bulls, I'm surprised

2:49:23.140 --> 2:49:24.580
 you could see anything.

2:49:24.580 --> 2:49:25.580
 This is like Fight Club.

2:49:25.580 --> 2:49:27.020
 Red Bull gives you delirium.

2:49:27.020 --> 2:49:27.860
 Yeah.

2:49:29.500 --> 2:49:32.360
 I got into it with Ed Norton yesterday on Twitter.

2:49:32.360 --> 2:49:33.200
 Oh, really?

2:49:33.200 --> 2:49:34.020
 Yeah.

2:49:34.020 --> 2:49:35.940
 Is he like the rest of the celebrities?

2:49:35.940 --> 2:49:38.060
 Yeah, he's like, oh, this is an existential threat

2:49:38.060 --> 2:49:39.540
 to America, Trump's a fascist.

2:49:39.540 --> 2:49:41.340
 He's delegitimizing the Oval Office.

2:49:41.340 --> 2:49:43.340
 I said, what an odd endorsement of Trump.

2:49:44.220 --> 2:49:45.620
 Well, you should have went with a bad pit.

2:49:45.620 --> 2:49:46.980
 He might have a different opinion.

2:49:46.980 --> 2:49:47.820
 That's true.

2:49:47.820 --> 2:49:49.980
 So Fight Club reference, okay.

2:49:49.980 --> 2:49:52.620
 This conversation is over.

2:49:52.620 --> 2:49:53.460
 It's interesting.

2:49:53.460 --> 2:49:56.020
 I'd like to draw a line between science and engineering

2:49:56.020 --> 2:50:00.860
 and science not including like the biological aspect,

2:50:00.860 --> 2:50:03.620
 the parts of biology that touch

2:50:03.620 --> 2:50:04.980
 and humanities and biology.

2:50:04.980 --> 2:50:08.060
 Like I feel because humanities,

2:50:08.060 --> 2:50:10.720
 if you just look at the percentage of universities,

2:50:10.720 --> 2:50:13.520
 it's still a minority percentage.

2:50:13.520 --> 2:50:16.260
 And I would actually draw a different,

2:50:16.260 --> 2:50:18.340
 I think they serve very different purposes.

2:50:18.340 --> 2:50:19.180
 Sure.

2:50:19.180 --> 2:50:22.340
 And that's actually a broken part about universities

2:50:22.340 --> 2:50:27.060
 about like, why is some of the best research

2:50:27.060 --> 2:50:28.300
 in the world done at universities?

2:50:28.300 --> 2:50:31.340
 That doesn't, like there might be a different,

2:50:31.340 --> 2:50:34.540
 like MIT, it feels weird that a faculty.

2:50:34.540 --> 2:50:35.900
 Yeah, these are conceptually different things.

2:50:35.900 --> 2:50:37.160
 Like we do research and we teach,

2:50:37.160 --> 2:50:38.000
 why is this the same diagram?

2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:38.900
 Yeah, it feels weird.

2:50:38.900 --> 2:50:40.860
 But that's just, but I'm also,

2:50:40.860 --> 2:50:44.680
 I'm coming to like the defense of the engineers

2:50:44.680 --> 2:50:45.980
 that never talk about,

2:50:45.980 --> 2:50:49.260
 I'm not like, my mind isn't,

2:50:49.260 --> 2:50:51.000
 I'm not like deluded or something

2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:53.940
 where I'm not seeing the house on fire.

2:50:53.940 --> 2:50:55.780
 I'm just saying, I am seeing the house

2:50:55.780 --> 2:50:57.320
 because I also lived in Harvard Square.

2:50:57.320 --> 2:50:59.580
 I'm seeing Harvard, but in.

2:50:59.580 --> 2:51:00.740
 And you see the tanks coming?

2:51:00.740 --> 2:51:01.660
 They're coming, Lex.

2:51:01.660 --> 2:51:02.500
 They're coming.

2:51:02.500 --> 2:51:03.340
 It's gonna be so beautiful.

2:51:03.340 --> 2:51:06.140
 It'll be like the American beauty, the plastic bag.

2:51:06.140 --> 2:51:07.260
 I just won't be able to stop crying

2:51:07.260 --> 2:51:08.180
 because it'll be so beautiful.

2:51:08.180 --> 2:51:11.220
 Yeah, I can already see it.

2:51:11.220 --> 2:51:14.620
 But the engineering departments where like,

2:51:14.620 --> 2:51:18.100
 I believe that the Elon Musk's of the world,

2:51:18.100 --> 2:51:20.660
 that the, like the innovation

2:51:20.660 --> 2:51:22.980
 that will make a better world is happening.

2:51:22.980 --> 2:51:25.200
 And like, let's not burn that down.

2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:27.280
 Cause that has nothing to do with any,

2:51:27.280 --> 2:51:29.260
 like they're all like sitting quietly

2:51:29.260 --> 2:51:32.740
 in the, while like, while the humanities

2:51:32.740 --> 2:51:34.180
 and all these kinds of diversity programs,

2:51:34.180 --> 2:51:36.700
 they're not having any of these discussions.

2:51:36.700 --> 2:51:39.180
 Listen, my Soviet brother, you both know,

2:51:39.180 --> 2:51:41.460
 we both know that ice water runs in our veins.

2:51:41.460 --> 2:51:42.820
 So if you're calling for mercy,

2:51:42.820 --> 2:51:44.420
 that is not how I'm wired,

2:51:44.420 --> 2:51:46.500
 but I'm not closing the door.

2:51:46.500 --> 2:51:48.540
 Yeah, I'm actually realizing now,

2:51:48.540 --> 2:51:50.660
 so for people listening to this,

2:51:50.660 --> 2:51:52.660
 I'll probably prepend this in saying that

2:51:52.660 --> 2:51:54.940
 I'm even slower than usual.

2:51:54.940 --> 2:51:56.540
 I didn't sleep last night,

2:51:56.540 --> 2:52:00.820
 but I feel I'm actually realizing just how slow I am

2:52:00.820 --> 2:52:03.100
 and how much preparation I need to do.

2:52:03.100 --> 2:52:06.740
 And if I would like to defend aspects of academia,

2:52:06.740 --> 2:52:08.500
 I better come prepared.

2:52:08.500 --> 2:52:09.680
 I don't think you need to defend them.

2:52:09.680 --> 2:52:12.600
 I think I'm granting you your premise freely.

2:52:12.600 --> 2:52:13.620
 No, you might be.

2:52:13.620 --> 2:52:14.540
 Okay.

2:52:14.540 --> 2:52:16.340
 I don't think the world is.

2:52:16.340 --> 2:52:18.420
 But actually you just defeat your own argument

2:52:18.420 --> 2:52:21.540
 because it is not at all have to be the way

2:52:21.540 --> 2:52:24.580
 that a phenomenal research institution like MIT,

2:52:24.580 --> 2:52:25.940
 which no one disputes,

2:52:25.940 --> 2:52:28.740
 has to also be an educational establishment.

2:52:28.740 --> 2:52:32.140
 These two things are not at all necessarily interconnected.

2:52:32.140 --> 2:52:34.580
 But then you have to offer a way to separate.

2:52:34.580 --> 2:52:35.420
 Correct.

2:52:35.420 --> 2:52:38.940
 But like, I'm not a big fan, everybody's different,

2:52:38.940 --> 2:52:41.100
 but I'm not a fan of criticizing institutions

2:52:41.100 --> 2:52:43.340
 without offering a way to change.

2:52:43.340 --> 2:52:46.060
 And especially when I'm like, have ability to change,

2:52:46.060 --> 2:52:49.300
 I'd like to, yeah, I'd like to offer a path.

2:52:49.300 --> 2:52:50.140
 Like.

2:52:50.140 --> 2:52:51.700
 What if they were in students, they were all mentor,

2:52:51.700 --> 2:52:55.940
 like, what's the opposite of a mentor?

2:52:55.940 --> 2:52:56.780
 Mentee.

2:52:56.780 --> 2:52:57.600
 Protege?

2:52:57.600 --> 2:52:58.440
 What's the term when you like.

2:52:58.440 --> 2:52:59.280
 Graduate students.

2:52:59.280 --> 2:53:01.300
 When you work at a place, like interns,

2:53:01.300 --> 2:53:02.860
 not an intern, it's not the word I'm thinking of.

2:53:02.860 --> 2:53:04.900
 But anyway, like basically they're working there

2:53:04.900 --> 2:53:06.660
 instead of going to college there.

2:53:06.660 --> 2:53:08.820
 It's possible, but it's going against tradition.

2:53:08.820 --> 2:53:11.780
 And so you have to build new institutions and.

2:53:11.780 --> 2:53:15.100
 And have these engineers building new things, that's crazy.

2:53:15.100 --> 2:53:16.420
 These research engineers,

2:53:16.420 --> 2:53:18.980
 where they're going to be building things.

2:53:18.980 --> 2:53:21.300
 Well, one of the things, cause you're kind of a.

2:53:21.300 --> 2:53:22.600
 Apprentice, that's the word I was looking at.

2:53:22.600 --> 2:53:23.440
 Apprentice.

2:53:23.440 --> 2:53:24.620
 Which is ironic, we're talking about Trump

2:53:24.620 --> 2:53:26.740
 and we couldn't think of the word apprentice.

2:53:26.740 --> 2:53:28.260
 Yeah, well done.

2:53:28.260 --> 2:53:29.100
 We should both be fired.

2:53:29.100 --> 2:53:29.940
 You're fired.

2:53:29.940 --> 2:53:30.900
 Yeah, there you go.

2:53:31.780 --> 2:53:34.480
 These Russian Jews, so quick with their wit.

2:53:34.480 --> 2:53:35.320
 Okay.

2:53:35.320 --> 2:53:37.700
 But the thing is, you're a fan of freedom.

2:53:37.700 --> 2:53:38.940
 I am.

2:53:38.940 --> 2:53:42.260
 And there is intellectual freedom.

2:53:42.260 --> 2:53:45.180
 People, this is what I was trying to articulate,

2:53:45.180 --> 2:53:47.100
 I'm failing to articulate,

2:53:47.100 --> 2:53:50.260
 but there truly is complete intellectual freedom

2:53:50.260 --> 2:53:55.260
 within universities on topics of science and engineering.

2:53:56.100 --> 2:53:57.980
 I believe you, I agree with you.

2:53:57.980 --> 2:53:59.540
 I don't think it's going to take much persuasion,

2:53:59.540 --> 2:54:01.460
 but I'll give you an example.

2:54:01.460 --> 2:54:04.620
 When that, I'm sure you know more details about this

2:54:04.620 --> 2:54:05.560
 than I do.

2:54:05.560 --> 2:54:09.580
 When that scientist engineered that probe

2:54:09.580 --> 2:54:11.740
 to land on that comet,

2:54:11.740 --> 2:54:12.980
 and the articles are written

2:54:12.980 --> 2:54:15.240
 because this Hawaiian shirt he was wearing

2:54:15.240 --> 2:54:16.380
 had like pinup girls on it,

2:54:16.380 --> 2:54:18.380
 which I think his female student sewed for him

2:54:18.380 --> 2:54:19.820
 or something, or his ex girlfriend.

2:54:19.820 --> 2:54:21.600
 And he had to apologize.

2:54:21.600 --> 2:54:23.620
 This is what Rand was talking about.

2:54:23.620 --> 2:54:26.440
 That the great accomplishments of men

2:54:26.440 --> 2:54:29.260
 have to say I'm sorry to the lowest,

2:54:29.260 --> 2:54:31.260
 most despicable, disgusting people.

2:54:32.420 --> 2:54:34.240
 Yeah, I don't know.

2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:36.900
 Let me bring this case up because I think about this.

2:54:37.860 --> 2:54:39.060
 This might not mean much to you,

2:54:39.060 --> 2:54:41.140
 but it means a lot to certain aspects

2:54:41.140 --> 2:54:42.540
 of the computer science community.

2:54:42.540 --> 2:54:44.740
 There's a guy named Richard Stallman.

2:54:44.740 --> 2:54:46.980
 I don't know if you know who that is.

2:54:46.980 --> 2:54:51.280
 He's the founder of the Free Software Foundation.

2:54:51.280 --> 2:54:52.260
 He's like a big Linux.

2:54:52.260 --> 2:54:53.340
 He's one of the key people

2:54:53.340 --> 2:54:54.900
 in the history of computer science,

2:54:54.900 --> 2:54:56.800
 one of those open source people, right?

2:54:56.800 --> 2:55:00.260
 But he is like, I believe he's one of the hardcore ones,

2:55:00.260 --> 2:55:02.740
 which is like all software should be free.

2:55:02.740 --> 2:55:05.360
 Okay, so it's very interesting personality,

2:55:05.360 --> 2:55:07.260
 very key person in the GNU,

2:55:07.260 --> 2:55:10.160
 just like Linus Torvald, key person.

2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:13.500
 So, but he also kind of speaks his mind.

2:55:13.500 --> 2:55:18.500
 And on a certain chain of conversations at MIT

2:55:20.100 --> 2:55:22.300
 that was leaked to the New York Times,

2:55:22.300 --> 2:55:26.460
 then it was published, led him to be fired

2:55:26.460 --> 2:55:30.660
 or pushed out of MIT recently, maybe a year ago.

2:55:30.660 --> 2:55:32.740
 And it always sat weird with me.

2:55:32.740 --> 2:55:37.740
 So what happened is there's a few undergraduate students

2:55:38.860 --> 2:55:41.220
 that called Marvin Minsky.

2:55:41.220 --> 2:55:42.700
 Not sure if you're familiar with who that is.

2:55:42.700 --> 2:55:43.540
 I've heard the name.

2:55:43.540 --> 2:55:46.460
 He's one of the seminal people in artificial intelligence.

2:55:46.460 --> 2:55:49.960
 They said that they called him a rapist

2:55:49.960 --> 2:55:53.020
 because he met with Jeffrey Epstein.

2:55:53.020 --> 2:55:56.880
 And Jeffrey Epstein solicited,

2:55:58.180 --> 2:55:59.980
 these are the best facts known to me

2:55:59.980 --> 2:56:02.820
 that I'm aware of, that's what was stated on the chain,

2:56:02.820 --> 2:56:04.740
 is he solicited a 17,

2:56:04.740 --> 2:56:07.020
 but it might've been an 18 year old girl,

2:56:07.020 --> 2:56:09.160
 to come up to Marvin Minsky

2:56:09.160 --> 2:56:12.240
 and ask him if he wanted to have sex with her.

2:56:13.580 --> 2:56:15.860
 So Jeffrey Epstein told the girl.

2:56:16.800 --> 2:56:18.140
 She came up to Marvin Minsky,

2:56:18.140 --> 2:56:20.680
 who was at that time, I think, seven years old.

2:56:20.680 --> 2:56:23.220
 And his wife was there too, Marvin Minsky's wife.

2:56:23.220 --> 2:56:28.220
 And he said no, or like awkwardly saying no thanks.

2:56:28.220 --> 2:56:33.220
 And that was stated in the email thread

2:56:34.420 --> 2:56:39.420
 as Marvin participating in sexual assault

2:56:39.460 --> 2:56:43.460
 and rape of this unwilling sexual assault.

2:56:43.460 --> 2:56:47.460
 And it was called rape of this person, right?

2:56:47.460 --> 2:56:50.500
 Of this woman that propositioned him.

2:56:50.500 --> 2:56:55.500
 And then Richard Stallman, who's, he's kind of known for this.

2:56:55.500 --> 2:56:59.220
 He's very, he's, you make fun of me being a robot,

2:56:59.220 --> 2:57:01.140
 but he's kind of like a debugger.

2:57:01.140 --> 2:57:03.140
 He's like, well, that sentence is not,

2:57:03.140 --> 2:57:05.300
 what you said is not correct.

2:57:05.300 --> 2:57:07.280
 So he like corrected the person,

2:57:08.540 --> 2:57:13.540
 basically made it seem like the use of the word rape

2:57:13.760 --> 2:57:16.660
 is not correct, because that's not the definition of rape.

2:57:16.660 --> 2:57:19.140
 And then he was attacked for saying,

2:57:19.140 --> 2:57:21.100
 oh, now you're playing with definitions of rape.

2:57:21.100 --> 2:57:23.780
 Rape is rape is the answer, right?

2:57:23.780 --> 2:57:27.220
 And then that was leaked in him defending.

2:57:27.220 --> 2:57:28.460
 So the way it was leaked,

2:57:28.460 --> 2:57:33.460
 it was reported as him defending rape.

2:57:35.260 --> 2:57:36.940
 That's the way it was reported.

2:57:36.940 --> 2:57:40.940
 And he was pushed out and he didn't really give a damn.

2:57:40.940 --> 2:57:44.420
 It's, he doesn't seem to make a big deal out of it.

2:57:44.420 --> 2:57:45.260
 He just left.

2:57:45.260 --> 2:57:46.460
 He made an example of him.

2:57:46.460 --> 2:57:48.020
 They made an example and that,

2:57:48.020 --> 2:57:51.700
 and that everyone was afraid to defend him.

2:57:51.700 --> 2:57:53.220
 So like, there's a bunch of faculty.

2:57:53.220 --> 2:57:54.060
 One.

2:57:54.060 --> 2:57:54.880
 Dude, you're from the Soviet Union.

2:57:54.880 --> 2:57:57.160
 Doesn't this hit close to home for you?

2:57:58.540 --> 2:57:59.580
 I don't know what to think of it.

2:57:59.580 --> 2:58:03.100
 It hits close to home, but it was basically,

2:58:03.100 --> 2:58:06.660
 at least at MIT, now MIT is such a light place with this.

2:58:06.660 --> 2:58:08.460
 It's not common at MIT,

2:58:08.460 --> 2:58:11.100
 but it was like 18, 19 year old kids,

2:58:11.100 --> 2:58:14.380
 undergraduate kids with this kind of fire in them.

2:58:14.380 --> 2:58:15.920
 There's just very few of them,

2:58:15.920 --> 2:58:19.140
 but they're the ones that raise all this kind of fuss.

2:58:19.140 --> 2:58:23.060
 And the entirety of the administration,

2:58:23.060 --> 2:58:25.740
 all the faculty are afraid to stand up to them.

2:58:26.740 --> 2:58:28.320
 It's so interesting to me.

2:58:28.320 --> 2:58:31.860
 Like, I don't know if I should be afraid of that.

2:58:31.860 --> 2:58:32.980
 You don't think you should be afraid

2:58:32.980 --> 2:58:34.900
 that someone who's trying to be specific

2:58:34.900 --> 2:58:37.260
 when it comes to charges of violent assault

2:58:37.260 --> 2:58:38.620
 is looking for that clarity,

2:58:38.620 --> 2:58:40.660
 can get their life out of search of his room?

2:58:40.660 --> 2:58:42.400
 Let me give you more context.

2:58:43.420 --> 2:58:46.020
 There's a little bit more context to Richard Stallman,

2:58:46.020 --> 2:58:46.860
 which is.

2:58:46.860 --> 2:58:47.700
 He was also a rapist.

2:58:47.700 --> 2:58:49.260
 No.

2:58:49.260 --> 2:58:50.100
 I left out that part.

2:58:50.100 --> 2:58:51.100
 He liked raping people.

2:58:51.100 --> 2:58:54.220
 But he's had a history through his life

2:58:55.900 --> 2:59:00.020
 of every once in a while wearing the Hawaiian shirt with,

2:59:00.020 --> 2:59:01.220
 like he would make.

2:59:01.220 --> 2:59:02.500
 He's a fat.

2:59:04.180 --> 2:59:06.940
 Sorry, but he's a fat unattractive.

2:59:06.940 --> 2:59:08.780
 Like what Trump referred to the hacker.

2:59:08.780 --> 2:59:11.220
 Yeah, yeah, the guy in the basement.

2:59:11.220 --> 2:59:12.060
 That's Richard.

2:59:12.060 --> 2:59:12.900
 Okay, I love.

2:59:14.560 --> 2:59:15.580
 He is what he is.

2:59:16.420 --> 2:59:18.420
 He like, he would eat his own.

2:59:18.420 --> 2:59:20.780
 He would pick skin from his feet in lectures

2:59:20.780 --> 2:59:21.620
 and just eat it.

2:59:21.620 --> 2:59:22.460
 No.

2:59:22.460 --> 2:59:23.280
 Okay, yeah.

2:59:23.280 --> 2:59:24.660
 Those videos of him doing that.

2:59:24.660 --> 2:59:25.500
 I'm not joking.

2:59:25.500 --> 2:59:26.920
 He must really be behind the spectrum then.

2:59:26.920 --> 2:59:27.760
 Yeah, okay.

2:59:27.760 --> 2:59:28.980
 Oh, yeah.

2:59:28.980 --> 2:59:32.220
 And you know,

2:59:32.220 --> 2:59:36.140
 I think in his office,

2:59:36.140 --> 2:59:37.980
 door, he wrote something like

2:59:41.080 --> 2:59:45.820
 hacker plus lover of ladies or something like that.

2:59:45.820 --> 2:59:47.500
 Like something kind of.

2:59:47.500 --> 2:59:48.940
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:59:48.940 --> 2:59:50.140
 Unprofessional.

2:59:50.140 --> 2:59:50.980
 Yeah, unprofessional.

2:59:50.980 --> 2:59:51.940
 And a little creepy.

2:59:51.940 --> 2:59:52.780
 Yeah, yeah.

2:59:52.780 --> 2:59:53.600
 No, that's fair.

2:59:53.600 --> 2:59:54.440
 So he was also.

2:59:54.440 --> 2:59:56.580
 So they're looking for an excuse to get rid of him,

2:59:56.580 --> 2:59:58.020
 it sounds like.

2:59:58.020 --> 3:00:00.700
 No, he was just, who's they?

3:00:00.700 --> 3:00:01.800
 The administration.

3:00:02.700 --> 3:00:04.060
 Yeah, probably, probably.

3:00:04.060 --> 3:00:06.020
 A lot of times what people don't realize,

3:00:06.020 --> 3:00:08.580
 and this would be my defense of cancel culture.

3:00:08.580 --> 3:00:10.140
 A lot of times when someone gets fired

3:00:10.140 --> 3:00:12.260
 over something like this, this isn't why.

3:00:12.260 --> 3:00:14.540
 This is just giving them cover to get rid of them

3:00:14.540 --> 3:00:15.620
 without getting a lawsuit.

3:00:15.620 --> 3:00:17.660
 Yeah, but it's still.

3:00:17.660 --> 3:00:21.460
 Right, so I think, I guess what I'm trying to communicate

3:00:21.460 --> 3:00:23.500
 is he was a little weird and creepy

3:00:23.500 --> 3:00:27.380
 and he may not be the best for the community,

3:00:27.380 --> 3:00:30.460
 but that's not necessarily the message it's sent

3:00:30.460 --> 3:00:31.780
 to the rest of the community.

3:00:31.780 --> 3:00:34.340
 The message is sent to the rest of the community

3:00:34.340 --> 3:00:37.020
 that being clear about words

3:00:37.020 --> 3:00:39.180
 or the usage of the word rape

3:00:39.180 --> 3:00:41.940
 is like you should call everything rape.

3:00:41.940 --> 3:00:44.500
 That's basically the message it was sent.

3:00:44.500 --> 3:00:46.880
 Or you should call it we say rape, rape.

3:00:46.880 --> 3:00:48.380
 It's about submission.

3:00:48.380 --> 3:00:50.580
 I think you'd be very happy to know

3:00:50.580 --> 3:00:52.060
 that there's a lot of people,

3:00:52.060 --> 3:00:53.340
 and she's very crucified of this,

3:00:53.340 --> 3:00:56.060
 like Betsy DeVos, the performance department of education,

3:00:56.060 --> 3:00:58.140
 who are aware of this.

3:00:58.140 --> 3:01:01.520
 They are aware that this completely contradicts due process.

3:01:01.520 --> 3:01:03.740
 They're aware of how a rape accusation

3:01:03.740 --> 3:01:05.560
 is something not to be taken seriously,

3:01:05.560 --> 3:01:07.180
 but because it's not to be taken seriously,

3:01:07.180 --> 3:01:09.460
 it has to be also taken seriously in the other context

3:01:09.460 --> 3:01:12.060
 that once that word is around a male,

3:01:12.060 --> 3:01:13.700
 this can ruin his entire life.

3:01:13.700 --> 3:01:17.380
 That's the sticky thing of the word.

3:01:17.380 --> 3:01:22.380
 Like I, like I think about this a lot that,

3:01:24.860 --> 3:01:26.540
 like how would I defend it if somebody,

3:01:26.540 --> 3:01:28.260
 like I've never, I can honestly say

3:01:28.260 --> 3:01:32.500
 I've never done anything close to creepy in my life

3:01:32.500 --> 3:01:34.860
 like with women.

3:01:34.860 --> 3:01:36.460
 But you wouldn't know it if you had, right?

3:01:36.460 --> 3:01:37.300
 That's the thing.

3:01:37.300 --> 3:01:39.120
 A lot of these creepy guys don't think they're creepy.

3:01:39.120 --> 3:01:40.940
 They think they're being cute.

3:01:40.940 --> 3:01:42.020
 Yeah, but I'm just telling you,

3:01:42.020 --> 3:01:45.860
 even like, fine, let's say, right,

3:01:45.860 --> 3:01:47.180
 let's say I'm not aware of it.

3:01:47.180 --> 3:01:50.060
 But the point that I am aware of

3:01:50.060 --> 3:01:52.580
 is that somebody could just completely make something up.

3:01:52.580 --> 3:01:54.180
 Correct, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

3:01:54.180 --> 3:01:55.820
 And like how, what would I?

3:01:55.820 --> 3:01:57.340
 No, he denied the charges.

3:01:57.340 --> 3:01:59.540
 There's an article around everything he did, supposedly,

3:01:59.540 --> 3:02:02.620
 and it goes, Mr. Friedman denied the charges, yeah.

3:02:02.620 --> 3:02:04.340
 But what creeps me out?

3:02:04.340 --> 3:02:05.420
 That happened, can I interrupt?

3:02:05.420 --> 3:02:07.420
 Zora Neale Hurston is one of my favorite writers.

3:02:07.420 --> 3:02:09.780
 She's from the Harlem Renaissance.

3:02:09.780 --> 3:02:11.420
 She wrote, Their Eyes Are Watching God,

3:02:11.420 --> 3:02:12.460
 and a couple of other books.

3:02:12.460 --> 3:02:14.300
 She was just an amazing, amazing figure.

3:02:14.300 --> 3:02:16.680
 Her biography is called Wrapped in Rainbows.

3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:17.800
 It's just a masterpiece.

3:02:17.800 --> 3:02:18.780
 I think I read it one day.

3:02:18.780 --> 3:02:19.780
 Can't recommend her enough.

3:02:19.780 --> 3:02:21.640
 Fascinating, fascinating woman.

3:02:21.640 --> 3:02:24.780
 During the 30s, I think it was, or 1940,

3:02:24.780 --> 3:02:26.340
 she was out of the country.

3:02:26.340 --> 3:02:29.860
 She was accused of molesting a teenage boy.

3:02:29.860 --> 3:02:31.900
 She wasn't in America.

3:02:31.900 --> 3:02:33.220
 This could be proven.

3:02:33.220 --> 3:02:36.060
 So it's absolutely false, not even a question.

3:02:36.060 --> 3:02:39.900
 She was indicted, and she wanted to kill herself

3:02:39.900 --> 3:02:43.820
 because she's like, people are gonna see these things,

3:02:43.820 --> 3:02:45.460
 and they're gonna think maybe there's some truth to it.

3:02:45.460 --> 3:02:46.920
 Maybe it's voluntary.

3:02:46.920 --> 3:02:49.180
 What they're just gonna, and you could understand

3:02:49.180 --> 3:02:50.940
 why she'd be suicidal over this.

3:02:50.940 --> 3:02:52.940
 So yeah, this is something that's been going on

3:02:52.940 --> 3:02:55.560
 for a long time, and the fact that it's becoming,

3:02:55.560 --> 3:02:57.180
 I do agree, it's important.

3:02:57.180 --> 3:02:59.580
 I know a lot of women who have been sexually assaulted,

3:02:59.580 --> 3:03:01.560
 more than I'm happy that I know.

3:03:01.560 --> 3:03:03.820
 And if I know that many, that means there's more.

3:03:03.820 --> 3:03:08.540
 So I think it's a good idea that they feel seen,

3:03:08.540 --> 3:03:10.540
 that they don't feel wounded, they don't feel damaged,

3:03:10.540 --> 3:03:12.020
 that they could talk to their friends.

3:03:12.020 --> 3:03:13.920
 And I'm like, man, this sucks is happening to you.

3:03:13.920 --> 3:03:15.720
 And I don't think you're a slut.

3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:16.860
 I don't think you're asking for it.

3:03:16.860 --> 3:03:17.860
 I think you feel violated.

3:03:17.860 --> 3:03:19.180
 I think it's gross.

3:03:19.180 --> 3:03:20.020
 Talk to me.

3:03:20.020 --> 3:03:21.940
 I do think that that's important.

3:03:21.940 --> 3:03:23.820
 And I also think it's important though,

3:03:23.820 --> 3:03:26.540
 when things get kind of in a frenzy,

3:03:26.540 --> 3:03:27.820
 that a lot of people are like,

3:03:27.820 --> 3:03:29.500
 yeah, I also had something happen.

3:03:29.500 --> 3:03:33.200
 And very quickly the line between he grabbed my boob

3:03:33.200 --> 3:03:34.900
 and he violently raped me,

3:03:34.900 --> 3:03:37.080
 I don't think these two things are the same at all.

3:03:37.080 --> 3:03:39.020
 I think they're both sexual assault,

3:03:39.020 --> 3:03:41.820
 but in terms of what someone can deal with the next day,

3:03:41.820 --> 3:03:43.620
 the next month, 10 years later,

3:03:43.620 --> 3:03:45.920
 I don't think they're similar scenarios.

3:03:47.420 --> 3:03:49.240
 I had Juanita Brodrick on my show

3:03:49.240 --> 3:03:53.820
 and hearing her talk about her alleged rape by Bill Clinton

3:03:53.820 --> 3:03:56.940
 was very disturbing for me, very disturbing to hear.

3:03:56.940 --> 3:03:58.800
 Because it was like half an hour.

3:03:58.800 --> 3:04:00.300
 So we think of these things and think,

3:04:00.300 --> 3:04:01.960
 okay, hold her down, blah, blah, blah.

3:04:01.960 --> 3:04:02.800
 And then it's done.

3:04:02.800 --> 3:04:03.660
 Half an hour when,

3:04:03.660 --> 3:04:05.460
 just even someone physically holding you down

3:04:05.460 --> 3:04:06.620
 for half an hour.

3:04:06.620 --> 3:04:08.300
 Like not even a sexual assault.

3:04:08.300 --> 3:04:09.980
 Like that's traumatic.

3:04:09.980 --> 3:04:12.460
 You think, your brain's gonna think, am I gonna die?

3:04:12.460 --> 3:04:14.040
 When I zoom out,

3:04:14.040 --> 3:04:16.860
 I think that ultimately this is gonna lead

3:04:16.860 --> 3:04:18.700
 to a better world.

3:04:18.700 --> 3:04:23.580
 Like empowering women to speak to those kinds of experiences,

3:04:24.460 --> 3:04:27.500
 the benefit of it outweighs the...

3:04:27.500 --> 3:04:30.300
 The issue is whenever people are given a weapon,

3:04:30.300 --> 3:04:33.300
 some are going to use it in nefarious ways.

3:04:33.300 --> 3:04:34.540
 And that's the lesson of history.

3:04:34.540 --> 3:04:38.580
 Males, females, whites, blacks, children, adults.

3:04:38.580 --> 3:04:40.980
 When people are given a mechanism to execute power

3:04:40.980 --> 3:04:43.500
 over others, some are gonna use it.

3:04:43.500 --> 3:04:46.480
 Can I ask you for a therapy thing?

3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:47.320
 Sure.

3:04:48.620 --> 3:04:50.440
 On trolling, in a sense.

3:04:51.520 --> 3:04:55.060
 Because I mentioned somebody making up something about me.

3:04:55.060 --> 3:04:57.420
 I feel, because I wear my heart on my sleeve,

3:04:59.560 --> 3:05:01.960
 I'm not good with these attacks.

3:05:01.960 --> 3:05:03.820
 Like I've been attacked recently,

3:05:03.820 --> 3:05:06.420
 just being called a fraud and all that kind of stuff.

3:05:06.420 --> 3:05:07.300
 Just light stuff.

3:05:07.300 --> 3:05:11.880
 Like I haven't, you know, it was like, it hurt.

3:05:11.880 --> 3:05:13.460
 Okay, well, let me help you.

3:05:13.460 --> 3:05:15.860
 Maybe it's because I'm a New Yorker.

3:05:15.860 --> 3:05:16.700
 No, I'm serious.

3:05:16.700 --> 3:05:17.860
 Here's why.

3:05:17.860 --> 3:05:21.140
 In New York, a lot of times you'll be walking

3:05:21.140 --> 3:05:24.660
 with your friend and a homeless person will come up to you

3:05:24.660 --> 3:05:26.740
 and start yelling things at you.

3:05:26.740 --> 3:05:29.740
 Your reaction isn't in those circumstances.

3:05:29.740 --> 3:05:31.360
 Let me hear this out.

3:05:31.360 --> 3:05:35.060
 Your reaction is physical safety and getting away.

3:05:35.060 --> 3:05:38.500
 Now, it's not impossible that that homeless person

3:05:38.500 --> 3:05:39.900
 is actually saying the truth.

3:05:39.900 --> 3:05:42.020
 This happened to a friend of mine.

3:05:42.020 --> 3:05:43.220
 This guy wasn't homeless

3:05:44.340 --> 3:05:46.940
 and he's walking down the street on Smith Street

3:05:46.940 --> 3:05:48.640
 and he's just talking out loud.

3:05:48.640 --> 3:05:50.600
 And he goes, why they call them hipsters?

3:05:50.600 --> 3:05:52.020
 What are they hip to?

3:05:52.020 --> 3:05:53.420
 And she chuckles.

3:05:53.420 --> 3:05:55.180
 And he goes, what are you laughing at, fatso?

3:05:55.180 --> 3:05:57.220
 You start something, I'll finish it.

3:05:57.220 --> 3:05:59.060
 And she just couldn't move.

3:05:59.060 --> 3:06:02.460
 And it's like, it's my main problem

3:06:02.460 --> 3:06:04.340
 because that's the first thing he went to.

3:06:04.340 --> 3:06:07.980
 And I don't know that I have any advice,

3:06:07.980 --> 3:06:11.020
 but when you hear something like this,

3:06:11.020 --> 3:06:13.580
 I think you need to be better in terms of boundaries.

3:06:13.580 --> 3:06:16.220
 I think you should not perceive this as a fellow human,

3:06:16.220 --> 3:06:18.780
 but as a crazy homeless person,

3:06:18.780 --> 3:06:21.460
 because if this fellow human,

3:06:21.460 --> 3:06:24.660
 if I thought that you were a fraud in some context,

3:06:24.660 --> 3:06:25.900
 that's a very weird word to use

3:06:25.900 --> 3:06:29.020
 because fraudulent podcaster, these are real mics,

3:06:29.020 --> 3:06:29.860
 but if I thought.

3:06:29.860 --> 3:06:31.900
 Well, a scientist or a human.

3:06:31.900 --> 3:06:33.720
 Sure, but I would ask myself,

3:06:33.720 --> 3:06:36.420
 is this person in a position to make this judgment

3:06:36.420 --> 3:06:37.880
 or are they backing it up?

3:06:37.880 --> 3:06:40.620
 Are they saying, here, your conclusions were wrong,

3:06:40.620 --> 3:06:42.620
 here's some mistakes in your data

3:06:42.620 --> 3:06:44.660
 and you can engage with them in ideas,

3:06:44.660 --> 3:06:46.140
 but whenever someone uses a word

3:06:46.140 --> 3:06:48.000
 to entirely dismiss your life

3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:50.620
 without having the knowledge of your life,

3:06:50.620 --> 3:06:53.660
 you do not have to take that seriously.

3:06:53.660 --> 3:06:55.280
 I appreciate that kind of idea,

3:06:55.280 --> 3:06:58.300
 but some things aren't about data,

3:06:58.300 --> 3:07:02.060
 like I see myself as a fraud often

3:07:02.060 --> 3:07:05.480
 and it's more psychology of it.

3:07:06.800 --> 3:07:09.120
 If I can reduce something to reason,

3:07:09.120 --> 3:07:11.140
 I can probably be fine.

3:07:11.140 --> 3:07:14.580
 My worry is the same as the worry of teenage girls

3:07:14.580 --> 3:07:16.260
 that get bullied online.

3:07:16.260 --> 3:07:19.220
 It's like when I'm being open and fragile on the internet,

3:07:20.140 --> 3:07:22.460
 it affects me in a way where I can't,

3:07:22.460 --> 3:07:23.980
 the reason doesn't help.

3:07:23.980 --> 3:07:24.820
 So it helps me, but.

3:07:24.820 --> 3:07:26.220
 You don't block people enough.

3:07:26.220 --> 3:07:27.420
 I'm very heavy with the blocking.

3:07:27.420 --> 3:07:29.180
 No, so yeah, I block.

3:07:29.180 --> 3:07:30.100
 Very heavy.

3:07:30.100 --> 3:07:31.860
 I block, it's helped a lot.

3:07:31.860 --> 3:07:34.420
 Any aggressive banality, I block immediately.

3:07:34.420 --> 3:07:36.380
 I also think time is gonna help.

3:07:36.380 --> 3:07:37.540
 I don't think you're,

3:07:37.540 --> 3:07:40.260
 like you didn't grow up wanting to be a podcaster, right?

3:07:40.260 --> 3:07:41.740
 That wasn't your aspiration.

3:07:41.740 --> 3:07:43.660
 So in some sense, you are gonna feel like a fraud

3:07:43.660 --> 3:07:45.140
 because you're like, I don't have any training for this.

3:07:45.140 --> 3:07:46.460
 I have a training for a scientist.

3:07:46.460 --> 3:07:48.040
 I can talk to you about artificial intelligence

3:07:48.040 --> 3:07:49.980
 for literally hours, but in terms of this,

3:07:49.980 --> 3:07:50.980
 like I don't know what I'm doing.

3:07:50.980 --> 3:07:53.580
 I'm kind of, so when they call you a fake,

3:07:53.580 --> 3:07:55.140
 it's like, yeah, you're kind of right

3:07:55.140 --> 3:07:57.740
 because like I did kind of stumble into this

3:07:57.740 --> 3:07:59.720
 and this is not my pedigree.

3:07:59.720 --> 3:08:01.940
 So I think that kind of probably speaks to you

3:08:01.940 --> 3:08:02.780
 on some level.

3:08:02.780 --> 3:08:05.220
 Well, but they're attacking not the podcast thing,

3:08:05.220 --> 3:08:07.260
 but more like the same,

3:08:07.260 --> 3:08:08.860
 people call Elon Musk a fraud too,

3:08:08.860 --> 3:08:11.120
 which that's the way I rationalize it.

3:08:11.120 --> 3:08:13.980
 Like, well, if they're calling him a fraud

3:08:13.980 --> 3:08:15.700
 and they're calling me a fraud,

3:08:17.100 --> 3:08:20.420
 like even if you have rockets that go into,

3:08:20.420 --> 3:08:22.260
 like if you successfully have rockets

3:08:22.260 --> 3:08:26.300
 landing back on earth, reusable rockets,

3:08:26.300 --> 3:08:29.800
 you're still being called a fraud, then it's okay.

3:08:30.980 --> 3:08:31.820
 Not necessarily.

3:08:31.820 --> 3:08:32.640
 It could be that he's not a fraud.

3:08:32.640 --> 3:08:33.480
 You really are.

3:08:35.060 --> 3:08:36.940
 That's, but it's not resonating with you

3:08:36.940 --> 3:08:38.140
 because your brain knows the logic.

3:08:38.140 --> 3:08:39.260
 So you can't trick yourself.

3:08:39.260 --> 3:08:42.620
 But yeah, yeah.

3:08:42.620 --> 3:08:44.940
 But I don't know, this whole trolling thing,

3:08:44.940 --> 3:08:49.940
 you seem to be much better at seeing it as a game.

3:08:50.740 --> 3:08:51.780
 You know why?

3:08:51.780 --> 3:08:54.380
 Because you are under the delusion

3:08:54.380 --> 3:08:56.220
 that every human being is capable

3:08:56.220 --> 3:08:57.940
 of intelligent reasoned decisions.

3:08:57.940 --> 3:08:58.780
 Still think I'm right.

3:08:58.780 --> 3:09:01.460
 And I perceive them as literally animals.

3:09:01.460 --> 3:09:03.780
 So when a dog starts barking,

3:09:03.780 --> 3:09:05.820
 all it's saying is that the dog is agitated

3:09:05.820 --> 3:09:08.260
 and this is not going to change my life one iota

3:09:08.260 --> 3:09:09.940
 other than crossing the street, perhaps.

3:09:09.940 --> 3:09:12.900
 Yeah, I'm going to prove you wrong one day.

3:09:12.900 --> 3:09:13.900
 You're going to kill yourself

3:09:13.900 --> 3:09:15.540
 because they can drive you to it.

3:09:15.540 --> 3:09:17.540
 The first shoot up of school.

3:09:17.540 --> 3:09:19.340
 But if I don't, I'll prove you wrong.

3:09:19.340 --> 3:09:20.660
 I'll bring the data.

3:09:20.660 --> 3:09:22.300
 And they'd be like, you're right, Lex.

3:09:22.300 --> 3:09:23.340
 I have the receipts.

3:09:23.340 --> 3:09:24.980
 I have the receipts.

3:09:24.980 --> 3:09:27.660
 Okay, so we mentioned Camus.

3:09:27.660 --> 3:09:29.260
 Oh yeah, I love him.

3:09:29.260 --> 3:09:34.260
 Is there, this is a question that people like love

3:09:34.340 --> 3:09:35.500
 when I ask.

3:09:35.500 --> 3:09:37.380
 I'm a really smart people.

3:09:37.380 --> 3:09:38.340
 What it is, love?

3:09:39.660 --> 3:09:44.660
 No, what books, let's say three books,

3:09:44.780 --> 3:09:47.940
 if you can think of them, technical, fiction,

3:09:47.940 --> 3:09:52.060
 philosophical, would you, had a big impact on you

3:09:52.060 --> 3:09:53.700
 or would you recommend to others?

3:09:53.700 --> 3:09:54.540
 Sure.

3:09:54.540 --> 3:09:56.940
 The Machiavellians by James Burnham.

3:09:56.940 --> 3:09:59.820
 This is a book about how politics works in reality

3:09:59.820 --> 3:10:02.460
 as opposed to how people imagine it working.

3:10:03.380 --> 3:10:05.660
 Mentis Moldbug, who's a figure in these circles,

3:10:05.660 --> 3:10:07.460
 who's respected by a lot of people.

3:10:07.460 --> 3:10:10.380
 I was giving a talk and there was a bunch of panelists

3:10:10.380 --> 3:10:12.620
 and we were asked, what book would you recommend?

3:10:12.620 --> 3:10:14.020
 I said, The Machiavellians.

3:10:14.020 --> 3:10:17.060
 Independently of me, that was the book he had recommended.

3:10:17.060 --> 3:10:18.580
 It's out of print, it's hard to find,

3:10:18.580 --> 3:10:19.860
 but that would be one.

3:10:19.860 --> 3:10:20.900
 Is that his book or no?

3:10:20.900 --> 3:10:23.620
 James Burnham, it came out in 1941, I think.

3:10:23.620 --> 3:10:26.820
 So can you pause on the, what's his?

3:10:26.820 --> 3:10:28.180
 Mentis Moldbug.

3:10:28.180 --> 3:10:29.740
 That's a code name, right?

3:10:29.740 --> 3:10:31.060
 That guy's pen name.

3:10:31.060 --> 3:10:33.460
 Curtis Yarvin, that's his real name.

3:10:33.460 --> 3:10:35.620
 He swims in your circles.

3:10:35.620 --> 3:10:36.460
 Which circles?

3:10:36.460 --> 3:10:37.300
 He does some kind of programming.

3:10:37.300 --> 3:10:38.660
 Oh, he's originally a programmer.

3:10:38.660 --> 3:10:43.660
 Yeah, he comes up as a person that I should talk with

3:10:43.740 --> 3:10:46.820
 or I should know about, but then I read a few of his things

3:10:46.820 --> 3:10:49.180
 and they seem quite dangerous.

3:10:49.180 --> 3:10:50.780
 They're very long and verbose,

3:10:50.780 --> 3:10:53.100
 but I think he's an amazing thinker.

3:10:53.100 --> 3:10:53.940
 Yeah, but.

3:10:53.940 --> 3:10:54.780
 But he's the one who had the idea

3:10:54.780 --> 3:10:56.460
 of sending the tanks to Harvard Yard.

3:10:56.460 --> 3:10:58.100
 But doesn't he have like,

3:11:00.380 --> 3:11:01.300
 he has some radical views.

3:11:01.300 --> 3:11:02.140
 I forget what they are.

3:11:02.140 --> 3:11:04.540
 Very radical views, yeah, he wants a military coup.

3:11:06.620 --> 3:11:08.420
 But you're saying he's a serious thinker

3:11:08.420 --> 3:11:11.780
 that is worthy of, not worthy.

3:11:11.780 --> 3:11:13.200
 I don't know that you would enjoy

3:11:13.200 --> 3:11:14.340
 having a conversation with him.

3:11:14.340 --> 3:11:16.140
 I think a lot of people enjoy seeing it happen,

3:11:16.140 --> 3:11:18.220
 but I think it would be a lot of talking past each other

3:11:18.220 --> 3:11:20.660
 and it would be interesting.

3:11:20.660 --> 3:11:21.500
 What do you agree?

3:11:21.500 --> 3:11:22.340
 I didn't agree with him to watch.

3:11:22.340 --> 3:11:24.100
 What do you disagree, okay.

3:11:24.100 --> 3:11:25.380
 What do you agree, what do you disagree with him?

3:11:25.380 --> 3:11:28.900
 I agree with him that politics has to be looked at

3:11:28.900 --> 3:11:33.200
 objectively and without kind of an emotional connection

3:11:33.200 --> 3:11:34.580
 to different schools.

3:11:34.580 --> 3:11:37.060
 I talk about him a lot in my book on the New Right.

3:11:38.280 --> 3:11:42.140
 Disagree, I don't think a military coup is a good idea.

3:11:42.140 --> 3:11:47.060
 He doesn't think anarchism is stable, I disagree.

3:11:47.060 --> 3:11:49.140
 I mean, me and him, I did a live stream with him

3:11:49.140 --> 3:11:50.460
 which just dorked out a lot about history

3:11:50.460 --> 3:11:52.820
 and people who've fallen in the memory hole.

3:11:52.820 --> 3:11:56.220
 So, I mean, he's got a lot of writing, so.

3:11:56.220 --> 3:11:58.980
 So, you know, the sense I got from him

3:11:58.980 --> 3:12:01.580
 was that if I talk with him,

3:12:01.580 --> 3:12:03.740
 a lot of people would be upset with me

3:12:03.740 --> 3:12:05.220
 for giving him a platform.

3:12:05.220 --> 3:12:07.220
 Yeah, I think he's on that edge

3:12:07.220 --> 3:12:09.620
 where they want to read him out of

3:12:09.620 --> 3:12:11.500
 what is acceptable discourse.

3:12:11.500 --> 3:12:13.460
 What's his most controversial,

3:12:13.460 --> 3:12:15.220
 I mean, you keep mentioning the tanks.

3:12:15.220 --> 3:12:17.120
 Is that the most controversial viewpoint?

3:12:17.120 --> 3:12:18.340
 Does he have a race thing?

3:12:18.340 --> 3:12:21.420
 No, the alt right doesn't particularly like him

3:12:21.420 --> 3:12:24.140
 in many ways because he's not a big on the race thing.

3:12:24.140 --> 3:12:27.580
 I don't know what would be his most controversial view,

3:12:27.580 --> 3:12:28.580
 to be honest.

3:12:28.580 --> 3:12:33.220
 I think because he is radical in terms of his analysis

3:12:33.220 --> 3:12:34.960
 of culture, anytime someone's a radical,

3:12:34.960 --> 3:12:35.800
 that is dangerous.

3:12:35.800 --> 3:12:36.940
 Yeah, it's dangerous.

3:12:36.940 --> 3:12:39.100
 Okay, book, so that's one.

3:12:39.100 --> 3:12:40.180
 The Fountainhead.

3:12:40.180 --> 3:12:41.260
 The Fountainhead.

3:12:41.260 --> 3:12:43.380
 Which is a, I would say.

3:12:43.380 --> 3:12:44.300
 Not Atlas Shrugged?

3:12:44.300 --> 3:12:46.180
 No, and if you read Atlas Shrugged

3:12:46.180 --> 3:12:47.140
 before reading The Fountainhead,

3:12:47.140 --> 3:12:48.660
 you're doing yourself an enormous disservice.

3:12:48.660 --> 3:12:49.980
 Don't you dare do it.

3:12:49.980 --> 3:12:52.380
 On the philosophical or because the novel is better?

3:12:52.380 --> 3:12:53.220
 On every level.

3:12:53.220 --> 3:12:54.580
 Fountainhead's a better novel.

3:12:54.580 --> 3:12:57.140
 Fountainhead's superfluous if you read Atlas Shrugged first.

3:12:57.140 --> 3:13:00.460
 Fountainhead's about psychology and ethics.

3:13:00.460 --> 3:13:02.260
 It does not have to do with her politics

3:13:02.260 --> 3:13:03.820
 other than its implications.

3:13:03.820 --> 3:13:06.020
 So it's by far the superior book.

3:13:06.020 --> 3:13:08.140
 The third one.

3:13:08.140 --> 3:13:09.500
 Ooh, this is a good one question.

3:13:09.500 --> 3:13:10.340
 Let me see.

3:13:10.340 --> 3:13:13.180
 There's so many good books out there that I love.

3:13:13.180 --> 3:13:16.300
 I'm going to, this is not really my third choice,

3:13:16.300 --> 3:13:18.340
 but I'll throw it out there because I,

3:13:19.220 --> 3:13:21.140
 this is such an important worldview,

3:13:21.140 --> 3:13:22.820
 especially for people on the right.

3:13:22.820 --> 3:13:24.180
 Are you virtue signaling?

3:13:24.180 --> 3:13:25.740
 No, this is counter signaling.

3:13:26.780 --> 3:13:27.860
 Thaddeus Russell's book,

3:13:27.860 --> 3:13:29.620
 A Renegade History of the United States.

3:13:29.620 --> 3:13:33.240
 His thesis is that it's the degenerates

3:13:33.240 --> 3:13:35.080
 that give us all freedom.

3:13:36.020 --> 3:13:38.580
 And things like prostitutes, things like madams,

3:13:38.580 --> 3:13:41.540
 things like slaves, things like immigrants,

3:13:41.540 --> 3:13:44.420
 because they were so low status,

3:13:44.420 --> 3:13:46.000
 they could get away with things

3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:47.940
 that then people who are higher status demanded

3:13:47.940 --> 3:13:48.900
 and so on and so forth.

3:13:48.900 --> 3:13:50.540
 So I think that thesis,

3:13:50.540 --> 3:13:55.440
 and it really has extreme consequences in thinking.

3:13:57.340 --> 3:13:59.900
 And no, Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind.

3:13:59.900 --> 3:14:01.340
 That's, those are the four.

3:14:02.740 --> 3:14:03.580
 Is that his best?

3:14:03.580 --> 3:14:04.700
 I haven't read any of his stuff.

3:14:04.700 --> 3:14:06.060
 The Righteous Mind is the only one you want.

3:14:06.060 --> 3:14:10.340
 Okay, that was four, but of course.

3:14:10.340 --> 3:14:12.540
 Forget Thaddeus Russell, put Haidt in there.

3:14:12.540 --> 3:14:14.080
 Of course he would.

3:14:14.080 --> 3:14:16.180
 No, forget Thaddeus, those are the three.

3:14:17.380 --> 3:14:18.820
 So we talked about love.

3:14:18.820 --> 3:14:21.720
 Let me ask you the other question I'm obsessed with.

3:14:22.740 --> 3:14:26.300
 Are you, do you ponder your own mortality?

3:14:26.300 --> 3:14:29.780
 I do, a lot, especially now that I'm an uncle,

3:14:29.780 --> 3:14:31.860
 especially now that I have like these younger people

3:14:31.860 --> 3:14:33.640
 that I mentor.

3:14:33.640 --> 3:14:36.140
 I was just yesterday, my friend, John Girguis,

3:14:36.140 --> 3:14:37.700
 who did my theme song for my podcast,

3:14:37.700 --> 3:14:40.900
 who did the book cover for Dear Reader,

3:14:40.900 --> 3:14:42.940
 who's like the most talented person I know.

3:14:42.940 --> 3:14:45.460
 His song came on the iPod at the gym

3:14:45.460 --> 3:14:46.500
 and I almost messaged him.

3:14:46.500 --> 3:14:48.900
 I go, you know, one day one of us is gonna bury the other

3:14:48.900 --> 3:14:50.420
 and it's gonna be really sad.

3:14:50.420 --> 3:14:52.080
 And I thought about that and it was kind of like,

3:14:52.080 --> 3:14:54.020
 oh man, that's really gonna suck.

3:14:54.020 --> 3:14:56.380
 And I don't know which scenario would be better.

3:14:56.380 --> 3:14:58.660
 Like I will be very sad if he's gone.

3:14:58.660 --> 3:15:00.620
 I'm sure he'd be very sad if I'm gone.

3:15:01.540 --> 3:15:03.420
 I mean, what do you, are you afraid of it?

3:15:03.420 --> 3:15:08.180
 No, you know, Rand had this quote about how

3:15:08.180 --> 3:15:10.340
 I won't die, the world will end.

3:15:10.340 --> 3:15:13.580
 So I've had enough experiences that I am,

3:15:13.580 --> 3:15:16.980
 I've really, at this point,

3:15:16.980 --> 3:15:18.820
 and everything's icing on the cake.

3:15:18.820 --> 3:15:20.800
 So if you, if I were to kill you

3:15:20.800 --> 3:15:24.420
 at the end of this podcast, it feels painless.

3:15:24.420 --> 3:15:25.260
 That would be okay?

3:15:25.260 --> 3:15:26.620
 Yeah, you know why?

3:15:26.620 --> 3:15:28.340
 Does anyone know you're here by the way?

3:15:28.340 --> 3:15:30.460
 You know why?

3:15:30.460 --> 3:15:32.140
 Just asking for a friend.

3:15:32.140 --> 3:15:34.620
 Here's why, there's that wit.

3:15:34.620 --> 3:15:36.020
 Save that for Twitter likes.

3:15:37.420 --> 3:15:38.940
 Do they call you Sasha?

3:15:38.940 --> 3:15:40.300
 No, I'm a Lyosha.

3:15:40.300 --> 3:15:41.940
 Oh, that's my sister's husband.

3:15:41.940 --> 3:15:45.580
 Okay, so here's why.

3:15:45.580 --> 3:15:47.260
 I strongly believe,

3:15:47.260 --> 3:15:49.520
 and this is a very kind of Jewish perspective,

3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:50.980
 that you just have to leave the world

3:15:50.980 --> 3:15:52.340
 a little bit better than you found it.

3:15:52.340 --> 3:15:54.420
 That all you could do is move the needle a little.

3:15:54.420 --> 3:15:56.500
 And one of the things I set out to do

3:15:56.500 --> 3:15:58.860
 with Dear Reader, my book on North Korea,

3:15:58.860 --> 3:16:01.420
 I was at a point in my career where I could do something

3:16:01.420 --> 3:16:02.740
 to make a difference instead of just writing,

3:16:02.740 --> 3:16:04.500
 like coauthoring books for celebrities,

3:16:04.500 --> 3:16:07.540
 which I'm very proud of, but are neither here nor there.

3:16:07.540 --> 3:16:09.780
 And I thought, all right, I know how to tell stories,

3:16:09.780 --> 3:16:12.140
 I know how to inform people, I know how to entertain people.

3:16:12.140 --> 3:16:14.420
 If I move the needle in America, who cares?

3:16:14.420 --> 3:16:15.740
 We got it really good here.

3:16:15.740 --> 3:16:18.360
 If I move the needle in North Korea a little bit,

3:16:18.360 --> 3:16:20.300
 the cost benefits through the roof.

3:16:20.300 --> 3:16:22.380
 I never thought of that actually.

3:16:22.380 --> 3:16:24.820
 I never thought of Dear Reader from that perspective.

3:16:24.820 --> 3:16:28.000
 So when I set out to write it, I'm like, okay,

3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:28.840
 what can I do?

3:16:28.840 --> 3:16:30.740
 I'm not gonna be able to liberate the North Korean regime.

3:16:30.740 --> 3:16:34.620
 What I can do is the camera right now is focused on,

3:16:34.620 --> 3:16:36.980
 at the time, Kim Jong Il, now Kim Jong Un.

3:16:36.980 --> 3:16:38.940
 And I can do just this a little bit.

3:16:38.940 --> 3:16:42.700
 And I go, behind that guy, who you think is funny clown,

3:16:42.700 --> 3:16:44.500
 there's millions of dead people.

3:16:44.500 --> 3:16:46.220
 There's children being starved.

3:16:46.220 --> 3:16:47.860
 There's people who are performing

3:16:47.860 --> 3:16:49.620
 because they have a gun to their kid's head.

3:16:49.620 --> 3:16:51.060
 And if someone put a gun to your kid's head,

3:16:51.060 --> 3:16:53.160
 you'd put on those dancing shoes real quick.

3:16:53.160 --> 3:16:57.420
 And I and others have managed to change the conversation

3:16:57.420 --> 3:17:00.660
 about North Korea in terms of look at those silly buffoons

3:17:00.660 --> 3:17:02.940
 to those poor people.

3:17:02.940 --> 3:17:05.620
 So the fact that that little thing I can say

3:17:05.620 --> 3:17:07.740
 with a straight face, I did,

3:17:07.740 --> 3:17:09.380
 doesn't make me a great person,

3:17:09.380 --> 3:17:13.060
 but it does make me someone who, if I have to go tomorrow,

3:17:13.060 --> 3:17:15.600
 I can say I did a little bit

3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:17.780
 to make the world a better place.

3:17:17.780 --> 3:17:20.220
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

3:17:21.060 --> 3:17:23.820
 I think the meaning of life is...

3:17:26.380 --> 3:17:27.620
 Why are we here?

3:17:27.620 --> 3:17:29.560
 Oh, well, I'm a Camu person.

3:17:29.560 --> 3:17:31.340
 So I'll give the Camu answer.

3:17:31.340 --> 3:17:33.740
 So there's two types of people.

3:17:33.740 --> 3:17:35.020
 Those who know how to use binary...

3:17:35.020 --> 3:17:35.860
 No.

3:17:35.860 --> 3:17:36.700
 There's...

3:17:36.700 --> 3:17:40.700
 Thanks for relating to the audience.

3:17:41.620 --> 3:17:42.940
 One, one, one, zero, zero, one, two.

3:17:42.940 --> 3:17:43.780
 Two?

3:17:45.300 --> 3:17:46.140
 Down vote.

3:17:47.540 --> 3:17:50.100
 What kind of radical freak is this Lex?

3:17:50.100 --> 3:17:53.340
 So, and I use this example of my forthcoming book.

3:17:53.340 --> 3:17:56.060
 You go into a countryside, a mountainside,

3:17:56.060 --> 3:17:59.020
 and you see a blank canvas on an easel.

3:17:59.020 --> 3:18:00.620
 And one kind of mentality goes,

3:18:00.620 --> 3:18:02.860
 this is just a blank canvas.

3:18:02.860 --> 3:18:03.700
 This is stupid.

3:18:03.700 --> 3:18:05.020
 This is what am I looking at?

3:18:05.020 --> 3:18:08.300
 And the other type goes, what a great opportunity.

3:18:08.300 --> 3:18:09.780
 I'm in this beautiful space.

3:18:09.780 --> 3:18:11.460
 I have this entire canvas to paint.

3:18:11.460 --> 3:18:13.280
 I could do anything I want with it.

3:18:13.280 --> 3:18:16.620
 So I am very much of that type two person.

3:18:16.620 --> 3:18:21.620
 And I hope others start to think of life in that way.

3:18:21.940 --> 3:18:23.700
 You and I have both been more successful

3:18:23.700 --> 3:18:25.900
 than we expected to, especially growing up,

3:18:25.900 --> 3:18:28.620
 and in ways we did not expect.

3:18:28.620 --> 3:18:30.020
 And when you're young,

3:18:30.020 --> 3:18:33.020
 you are so intent on driving the car.

3:18:33.020 --> 3:18:34.220
 And after a certain point,

3:18:34.220 --> 3:18:35.780
 you realize it's not about driving the car.

3:18:35.780 --> 3:18:37.300
 It's you're being a surfer,

3:18:37.300 --> 3:18:39.280
 that you can only control this little board

3:18:39.280 --> 3:18:41.060
 and you have no idea where the waves will take you.

3:18:41.060 --> 3:18:42.160
 And sometimes you're gonna fall down

3:18:42.160 --> 3:18:43.140
 and something's gonna really gonna suck

3:18:43.140 --> 3:18:44.800
 and you're gonna swallow some saltwater.

3:18:44.800 --> 3:18:47.440
 But at a certain point, you stop trying to drive

3:18:47.440 --> 3:18:48.820
 and you're like, this is freaking awesome

3:18:48.820 --> 3:18:50.660
 and I have no idea where it's gonna go.

3:18:51.860 --> 3:18:53.380
 Beautifully put.

3:18:53.380 --> 3:18:54.980
 I know I speak for a lot of people.

3:18:54.980 --> 3:18:58.820
 First of all, everyone loves the game you play

3:18:58.820 --> 3:18:59.660
 on the intranet.

3:18:59.660 --> 3:19:00.740
 It's fun.

3:19:00.740 --> 3:19:02.220
 You make the world not everyone.

3:19:02.220 --> 3:19:05.220
 Today, oof, they came for me hard.

3:19:05.220 --> 3:19:08.540
 But it makes the world seem fun.

3:19:08.540 --> 3:19:12.580
 And especially in this dark time, it's much appreciated.

3:19:12.580 --> 3:19:14.580
 And we can't wait till the next book

3:19:14.580 --> 3:19:15.580
 and the many to come

3:19:15.580 --> 3:19:18.580
 and to hopefully many more Joe Rogan appearances.

3:19:18.580 --> 3:19:20.300
 You guys do some great magic together.

3:19:20.300 --> 3:19:21.140
 This is fun.

3:19:21.140 --> 3:19:26.140
 It's, you, yeah, you're one of my favorite guests on this show

3:19:26.540 --> 3:19:27.500
 so I can't wait.

3:19:27.500 --> 3:19:30.700
 Especially if you can make it before the election.

3:19:30.700 --> 3:19:32.260
 Thanks so much for making today happen.

3:19:32.260 --> 3:19:33.740
 I'm glad you came down.

3:19:33.740 --> 3:19:34.580
 You're awesome.

3:19:34.580 --> 3:19:35.400
 Thank you so much.
