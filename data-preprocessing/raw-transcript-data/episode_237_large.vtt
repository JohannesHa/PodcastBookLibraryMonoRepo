00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
 The following is a conversation with Steve Vasile,

00:02.640 --> 00:06.020
 formerly a truck driver and now a sociologist

00:06.020 --> 00:07.960
 at the University of Pennsylvania

00:07.960 --> 00:10.760
 who studies freight transportation.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.920
 His first book, The Big Rig,

00:12.920 --> 00:15.280
 Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream,

00:15.280 --> 00:17.640
 explains how long haul trucking

00:17.640 --> 00:20.020
 went from being one of the best blue collar jobs

00:20.020 --> 00:22.120
 to one of the toughest.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.020
 His current ongoing book project,

00:24.020 --> 00:26.120
 Driverless, Autonomous Trucks

00:26.120 --> 00:28.080
 and the Future of the American Trucker,

00:28.080 --> 00:30.100
 explores self driving trucks

00:30.100 --> 00:33.220
 and their potential impacts on labor and on society.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.440
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.640
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:38.640 --> 00:39.820
 in the description.

00:39.820 --> 00:43.740
 And now, here's my conversation with Steve Vasile.

00:45.060 --> 00:47.040
 You wrote a book about trucking

00:47.040 --> 00:49.720
 called The Big Rig, Trucking and the Decline

00:49.720 --> 00:51.120
 of the American Dream,

00:51.120 --> 00:53.760
 and you're currently working on a book

00:53.760 --> 00:56.920
 about autonomous trucking called Driverless,

00:56.920 --> 01:00.640
 Autonomous Trucks and the Future of the American Trucker.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.200
 I have to bring up some Johnny Cash to you

01:02.200 --> 01:03.560
 because I was just listening to this song.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.080
 He has a ton of songs about trucking,

01:06.080 --> 01:08.560
 but one of them I was just listening to,

01:08.560 --> 01:10.740
 it's called All I Do is Drive,

01:11.580 --> 01:13.520
 where he's talking to an old truck driver.

01:13.520 --> 01:17.240
 It goes, I asked them if those trucking songs

01:17.240 --> 01:19.240
 tell about a life like his.

01:19.240 --> 01:22.320
 He said, if you want to know the truth about it,

01:22.320 --> 01:24.160
 here's the way it is.

01:24.160 --> 01:27.160
 All I do is drive, drive, drive,

01:27.160 --> 01:29.440
 try to stay alive, that's the chorus,

01:29.440 --> 01:30.880
 and keep my mind on my load,

01:30.880 --> 01:32.260
 keep my eye upon the road.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.760
 I got nothing in common with any man

01:34.760 --> 01:36.360
 who's home every day at five.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.360
 All I do is drive, drive, drive,

01:39.360 --> 01:41.960
 drive, drive, drive, drive.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.600
 So I got to ask you,

01:43.600 --> 01:45.760
 same thing that he asked the trucker.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.680
 You worked as a trucker for six months

01:48.680 --> 01:50.440
 while working on the previous book.

01:50.440 --> 01:54.980
 What's it like to be a truck driver?

01:54.980 --> 01:56.280
 I think that captures it.

01:57.940 --> 01:59.660
 It really does.

01:59.660 --> 02:01.620
 Can you take me through the whole experience,

02:01.620 --> 02:03.960
 what it takes to become a trucker,

02:03.960 --> 02:06.580
 what actual day to day life was on day one,

02:06.580 --> 02:09.340
 week one, and then over time how that changed?

02:09.340 --> 02:10.660
 Yeah.

02:10.660 --> 02:14.880
 Well, the book is really about how that changed over time.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.980
 So my experience, and I'm an ethnographer, right?

02:17.980 --> 02:21.060
 So I go in, I live with people,

02:21.060 --> 02:23.500
 I work with people, I talk to them,

02:23.500 --> 02:26.860
 try to understand their world.

02:26.860 --> 02:29.380
 Ethnographer, by the way, what is that?

02:29.380 --> 02:34.380
 The science and art of capturing the spirit of a people?

02:35.140 --> 02:36.540
 Yeah, life ways.

02:36.540 --> 02:38.580
 I think that would be a good way to capture it,

02:38.580 --> 02:43.580
 try to understand what makes them unique as a society,

02:43.580 --> 02:47.420
 maybe as a subculture, what kind of makes them tick,

02:47.420 --> 02:52.420
 that might be different than the way you and I are wired.

02:52.420 --> 02:54.900
 And really sort of thickly describe it

02:54.900 --> 02:56.980
 would be at least one component of it.

02:56.980 --> 02:59.020
 That's sort of the basic essential.

02:59.020 --> 03:04.020
 And then for me, I want to exercise what C. Wright Mills

03:04.740 --> 03:07.340
 called the sociological imagination,

03:07.340 --> 03:11.140
 which is to put that individual biography

03:11.140 --> 03:15.580
 into the long historical sweep of humanity,

03:15.580 --> 03:17.540
 if at all possible.

03:17.540 --> 03:21.020
 My goals are typically more modest than C. Wright Mills's.

03:21.020 --> 03:26.020
 And to then put that biography in the larger social structure

03:26.820 --> 03:29.580
 to try to understand that person's life

03:29.580 --> 03:31.900
 and the way they see the world,

03:31.900 --> 03:34.340
 their decisions in light of their interests

03:34.340 --> 03:36.740
 relative to others and conflict and power

03:36.740 --> 03:38.700
 and all these things that I find interesting.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.180
 And conflict and power.

03:40.180 --> 03:41.020
 And interesting.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.860
 In the context of society and in the context of history.

03:43.860 --> 03:44.700
 Yeah.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.940
 And the small tangent, what does it take to do that,

03:47.940 --> 03:52.940
 to capture this particular group, the spirit, the music,

03:54.500 --> 03:56.340
 the full landscape of experiences

03:56.340 --> 03:58.900
 that a particular group goes through

03:58.900 --> 04:00.780
 in the context of everything else?

04:00.780 --> 04:02.500
 You only have a limited amount of time

04:02.500 --> 04:06.060
 and you come to the table probably with preconceived notions

04:06.060 --> 04:08.820
 that are then quickly destroyed, all that whole process.

04:08.820 --> 04:11.500
 So I don't know if it's more art or science,

04:11.500 --> 04:13.620
 but what does it take to be great at this?

04:14.500 --> 04:18.580
 I do think my first book was a success

04:18.580 --> 04:22.740
 relative to my goals of trying to really get at the heart

04:22.740 --> 04:25.140
 of sort of the central issues

04:25.140 --> 04:28.100
 and the lives being led by people.

04:28.100 --> 04:32.580
 If I have a resource, a talent,

04:32.580 --> 04:34.220
 it's that I'm a good listener.

04:34.220 --> 04:38.900
 I can talk with anybody.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.860
 My wife loves to remark on this

04:41.860 --> 04:44.540
 that I can sort of sit down with anyone.

04:45.460 --> 04:49.020
 I think I learned that from my dad who worked at a factory

04:49.020 --> 04:51.660
 and actually had a lot of truckers go through

04:51.660 --> 04:53.740
 the gate that he operated.

04:53.740 --> 04:57.100
 And he always had a story, a joke for everybody,

04:57.100 --> 04:59.420
 kind of got to know everyone individually.

04:59.420 --> 05:02.460
 And he just taught me that essentially

05:02.460 --> 05:04.740
 everyone has something to teach you.

05:04.740 --> 05:06.500
 And I try to embody that.

05:06.500 --> 05:11.500
 Like that's the rule is for me is every single person

05:11.700 --> 05:14.740
 I interact with can teach me something.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.780
 I gotta ask you, I'm sorry to interrupt

05:16.780 --> 05:19.660
 because I'm clearly of the two of us, the poorer listener.

05:19.660 --> 05:23.060
 I think you're a great listener.

05:23.060 --> 05:23.900
 Thank you.

05:23.900 --> 05:24.940
 I've been listening to the podcast.

05:24.940 --> 05:26.300
 I think you're a great listener.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.420
 I really appreciate that.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.380
 You've done a large number of interviews,

05:30.380 --> 05:32.700
 like you said, of truckers for this book.

05:33.860 --> 05:38.460
 I'm just curious, what are some lessons you've learned

05:38.460 --> 05:43.220
 about what it takes to listen to a person enough,

05:43.220 --> 05:46.380
 maybe guide the conversation enough

05:46.380 --> 05:49.220
 to get to the core of the person, the idea,

05:49.220 --> 05:54.020
 again, the ethnographer goal to get to the core?

05:54.020 --> 05:58.540
 Yeah, I think it doesn't happen in the moment, right?

05:58.540 --> 06:01.900
 So I'm a ruminator.

06:01.900 --> 06:05.780
 I just sit with the data for years.

06:05.780 --> 06:10.300
 I sat with the trucking data for almost 10 full years

06:10.300 --> 06:13.860
 and just thought about the problems and the questions

06:13.860 --> 06:16.900
 using everything that I possibly could.

06:16.900 --> 06:21.900
 And so in the moment, my ideal interview is I open up

06:22.100 --> 06:24.820
 and I say, tell me about your life as a trucker.

06:24.820 --> 06:26.900
 And they never shut up.

06:26.900 --> 06:29.740
 And they keep telling me the things that I'm interested in.

06:29.740 --> 06:32.100
 Now, it never works out that way

06:32.100 --> 06:34.500
 because they don't know what you're interested in, right?

06:34.500 --> 06:38.620
 And so a lot of it is the, as you know,

06:38.620 --> 06:41.620
 I think you're a great interviewer, prep, right?

06:41.620 --> 06:45.060
 So you try to get to know a little bit about the person

06:45.060 --> 06:48.580
 and sort of understand kind of the central questions

06:48.580 --> 06:51.660
 you're interested in that they can help you explore.

06:52.820 --> 06:56.820
 And so I've done hundreds of interviews with truck drivers

06:56.820 --> 06:59.940
 at this point and I should really go back

06:59.940 --> 07:01.220
 and read the original ones.

07:01.220 --> 07:02.460
 They were probably terrible.

07:02.460 --> 07:03.380
 What's the process like?

07:03.380 --> 07:05.460
 You're sitting down, do you have an audio recorder

07:05.460 --> 07:08.900
 and also taking notes or do you do no audio, just notes or?

07:08.900 --> 07:11.980
 Yeah, audio recorder and social scientists

07:11.980 --> 07:13.980
 always have to struggle with sampling, right?

07:13.980 --> 07:15.140
 Like who do you interview?

07:15.140 --> 07:15.980
 Where do you find them?

07:15.980 --> 07:17.540
 How do you recruit them?

07:17.540 --> 07:21.020
 I just happened to have a sort of natural place to go

07:21.020 --> 07:23.140
 that gave me essentially the population

07:23.140 --> 07:24.900
 that I was interested in.

07:24.900 --> 07:27.660
 So all these long haul truck drivers that I was interested in

07:27.660 --> 07:29.380
 they have to stop and get fuel

07:29.380 --> 07:31.900
 and get services at truck stops.

07:31.900 --> 07:35.100
 So I picked a truck stop at the juncture

07:35.100 --> 07:36.980
 of a couple of major interstates,

07:36.980 --> 07:40.460
 went into the lounge that drivers have to walk through

07:40.460 --> 07:44.140
 with my clipboard and everybody who came through,

07:44.140 --> 07:46.660
 I said, hey, are you on break?

07:46.660 --> 07:49.540
 And that was sort of the first criteria was,

07:49.540 --> 07:50.740
 do you have time, right?

07:51.740 --> 07:53.460
 And if they said, yes, I said,

07:53.460 --> 07:57.580
 I'd say, I'm a graduate student at Indiana University.

07:57.580 --> 07:59.260
 I'm doing a study,

07:59.260 --> 08:01.460
 trying to understand more about truck drivers.

08:01.460 --> 08:02.460
 Will you sit down with me?

08:02.460 --> 08:04.940
 And I think the first,

08:04.940 --> 08:08.380
 I think I probably asked like 104 or 103 people

08:08.380 --> 08:09.940
 to get the first 100 interviews.

08:10.820 --> 08:11.860
 That's pretty good odds.

08:11.860 --> 08:13.660
 It's amazing, right?

08:13.660 --> 08:16.700
 For any response rate like that for interviewing,

08:16.700 --> 08:19.580
 these are people who sat down and gave me an hour

08:19.580 --> 08:21.580
 or sometimes more of their time,

08:21.580 --> 08:23.100
 just randomly at a truck stop.

08:23.100 --> 08:26.300
 And it just tells you something about like,

08:26.300 --> 08:28.140
 truckers have something to say.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.220
 They're alone a lot.

08:30.220 --> 08:33.020
 And so I had to figure out how to kind of

08:33.020 --> 08:35.260
 turn the spigot on, you know?

08:35.260 --> 08:38.540
 And I got pretty good at it, I think, yeah.

08:38.540 --> 08:40.180
 So they have good stories to tell

08:40.180 --> 08:41.860
 and they have an active life in the mind

08:41.860 --> 08:43.660
 because they spend so much time on the road

08:43.660 --> 08:45.300
 just basically thinking.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.940
 Yeah, there's a lot of reflection,

08:49.140 --> 08:50.540
 a lot of struggles, you know?

08:50.540 --> 08:53.860
 And they take different forms.

08:53.860 --> 08:55.100
 One of the things that they talk about

08:55.100 --> 08:56.860
 is the impact on their families.

08:56.860 --> 08:59.220
 They say truckers have the same rate of divorce

08:59.220 --> 09:00.380
 as everybody else.

09:00.380 --> 09:03.060
 And that's because trucking saves so many marriages

09:03.060 --> 09:05.220
 because you're not around and ruins so many.

09:05.220 --> 09:06.980
 And so it ends up being a wash.

09:08.900 --> 09:12.820
 So I had this experience.

09:12.820 --> 09:16.420
 I met another person and he recognized me from a podcast.

09:16.420 --> 09:18.980
 And he said, you know, I'm a fan of yours

09:18.980 --> 09:22.660
 and a fan of Joe Rogan, but you guys never talk.

09:22.660 --> 09:24.980
 You always talk to people with Nobel Prizes.

09:24.980 --> 09:27.140
 You always talk to these kinds of people.

09:27.140 --> 09:30.180
 You never talk to us regular folk.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.500
 And that guy really stuck with me.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.620
 First of all, the idea of regular folk is a silly notion.

09:36.620 --> 09:39.260
 I think people that win Nobel Prizes

09:39.260 --> 09:42.260
 are often more boring than the people, these regular folks

09:42.260 --> 09:45.780
 in terms of stories, in terms of richness of experience,

09:45.780 --> 09:48.020
 in terms of the ups and downs of life.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.460
 And, you know, that really stuck with me

09:51.460 --> 09:53.700
 because I set that as a goal for myself

09:53.700 --> 09:56.620
 to make sure I talked to regular folk.

09:57.900 --> 10:02.900
 And you did just this talking, again, regular folk.

10:03.140 --> 10:04.860
 It's human beings.

10:05.940 --> 10:07.500
 All of them have experiences.

10:08.700 --> 10:13.700
 If you were to recommend to talk some of these folks

10:14.340 --> 10:16.900
 with stories, how would you find them?

10:16.900 --> 10:19.620
 Yeah, so I do do this sometimes for journalists

10:19.620 --> 10:21.660
 who will come and they want to write about

10:21.660 --> 10:25.020
 sort of what's happening right now in trucking, you know.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.660
 And I send them to truck stops.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.140
 I say, you know, yeah, there's a town

10:29.140 --> 10:31.460
 called Effingham, Illinois.

10:31.460 --> 10:34.060
 And it's just this place where, you know,

10:34.060 --> 10:36.460
 bunch of huge truck stops, tons of trucks

10:36.460 --> 10:38.740
 and really nothing else out there.

10:38.740 --> 10:41.740
 You know, it's in the middle of corn country.

10:41.740 --> 10:44.660
 And, you know, again, truckers in this, you know,

10:44.660 --> 10:48.100
 sadly, I think, you know, the politics of the day,

10:48.100 --> 10:50.300
 it's changing a little bit.

10:50.300 --> 10:54.060
 I think there's a little, the polarization is getting

10:54.060 --> 10:57.660
 to the trucking industry in ways that, you know,

10:57.660 --> 11:02.420
 maybe we're seeing in other parts of our social world.

11:02.420 --> 11:04.420
 But truckers are generally, you know,

11:04.420 --> 11:07.700
 real open sort of friendly folks.

11:07.700 --> 11:11.380
 Some of them ultimately like to work alone and be alone.

11:11.380 --> 11:15.400
 That's a relatively small subset, I think.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.500
 But all of them are generally, you know,

11:17.500 --> 11:20.140
 kind of open, you know, trusting,

11:20.140 --> 11:21.500
 willing to have a conversation.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.820
 And so, you know, you go to the truck stop

11:23.820 --> 11:26.340
 and you go in the lounge and they're usually,

11:26.340 --> 11:27.460
 there's usually a booth down there

11:27.460 --> 11:28.900
 and somebody is sitting at their laptop

11:28.900 --> 11:32.140
 or on their phone and willing to strike up a conversation.

11:32.140 --> 11:32.980
 You should try that.

11:32.980 --> 11:33.800
 You should, you know.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.060
 That 100% will try this.

11:35.060 --> 11:36.340
 Yeah.

11:36.340 --> 11:38.700
 Just again, we're just going from tangent to tangent.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.720
 We'll return to the main question,

11:40.720 --> 11:43.220
 but what do they listen to?

11:43.220 --> 11:45.700
 Do they listen to talk radio?

11:45.700 --> 11:47.700
 Do they listen to podcasts, audio books?

11:47.700 --> 11:48.820
 Do they listen to music?

11:48.820 --> 11:50.940
 Do they listen to silence?

11:50.940 --> 11:51.780
 Everything.

11:51.780 --> 11:52.600
 Everything.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.440
 Everything.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.440
 Some, I mean, and some still listen to the CB,

11:55.440 --> 11:59.420
 which, you know, it's a ever dwindling group.

11:59.420 --> 12:02.200
 They'll call it the Original Internet Citizens Band.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.860
 You know, back in the 70s,

12:03.860 --> 12:07.300
 they thought it was going to be the medium of democracy.

12:07.300 --> 12:08.980
 And they love to just get on there

12:08.980 --> 12:13.060
 and, you know, cruise along one truck after the other

12:13.060 --> 12:13.900
 and chat away.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.580
 Usually, you know, it's guys who know each other

12:15.580 --> 12:18.620
 from the same company or happen to run into each other.

12:18.620 --> 12:21.860
 But other than that, it's everything under the sun.

12:21.860 --> 12:24.620
 You know, and that's, it's probably one of the stereotypes

12:24.620 --> 12:28.140
 and it's, I think it was more true in the past, you know,

12:28.140 --> 12:32.260
 about the sort of heterogeneity of truck drivers.

12:32.260 --> 12:33.860
 They're a really diverse group now.

12:33.860 --> 12:37.060
 You know, there's definitely a large,

12:37.060 --> 12:40.140
 still a large component of rural white guys

12:40.140 --> 12:42.420
 who work in the industry,

12:42.420 --> 12:45.580
 but there's a huge growing chunk of the industry

12:45.580 --> 12:50.120
 that's immigrants, people of color, and even some women.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.700
 Still huge barriers to women entering it,

12:52.700 --> 12:55.900
 but it's a much more diverse place than most people think.

12:57.060 --> 13:00.140
 So let's return to your journey as a truck driver.

13:00.140 --> 13:03.500
 What did it take to become a truck driver?

13:03.500 --> 13:05.100
 What were the early days like?

13:05.100 --> 13:07.140
 Yeah, so this is, I mean, this is a central part

13:07.140 --> 13:09.900
 of the story, right, that I uncovered.

13:09.900 --> 13:12.000
 And the good part was that I went in

13:12.000 --> 13:14.300
 without knowing what was gonna happen.

13:14.300 --> 13:19.120
 So I was able to experience it as a new truck driver would.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.880
 It's one of the important stories in the book

13:20.880 --> 13:24.620
 is how that experience is constructed by employers

13:24.620 --> 13:28.060
 to sort of, you know, help you think the way

13:28.060 --> 13:29.900
 that they would like you to think about the job

13:29.900 --> 13:32.980
 and about the industry and about the social relations of it.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.640
 So it's super intimidating.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.080
 I say in the book, you know, pretty handy guy,

13:40.080 --> 13:41.840
 you know, familiar with tools, machines,

13:41.840 --> 13:44.000
 like, you know, comfortable operating stuff,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.780
 like from time I was a kid.

13:46.780 --> 13:50.560
 The truck was just like a whole nother experience.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.840
 I mean, as I think most people think about it,

13:52.840 --> 13:55.320
 it's this big, huge vehicle, right?

13:55.320 --> 13:58.120
 It's really long, it's 70 feet long,

13:58.120 --> 14:00.520
 it can weigh 80,000 pounds.

14:00.520 --> 14:02.640
 You know, it does not stop like a car.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.420
 It does not turn like a car.

14:05.920 --> 14:10.520
 But at least when I started, and this has changed

14:10.520 --> 14:13.120
 and it's part of the technology story of trucking,

14:13.120 --> 14:15.840
 the first thing you had to do was learn how to shift it.

14:15.840 --> 14:19.560
 And it doesn't shift like a manual car.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.080
 The clutch isn't synchronized.

14:21.080 --> 14:24.040
 So you have to do what's called double clutch.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.920
 And it's basically the foundational skill

14:26.920 --> 14:29.560
 that a truck driver used to have to learn.

14:29.560 --> 14:33.640
 So you would, you know, accelerate, say you're in first gear,

14:33.640 --> 14:35.040
 you push in the clutch,

14:35.040 --> 14:37.640
 you pull the shifter out of first gear,

14:37.640 --> 14:39.080
 you let the clutch out,

14:39.080 --> 14:44.080
 and then you let the RPMs of the engine drop an exact amount.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.480
 Then you push the clutch back in

14:46.480 --> 14:48.360
 and you put it in second gear.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.380
 If your timing is off,

14:50.380 --> 14:52.600
 those gears aren't gonna go together.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.800
 So if you're in an intersection,

14:54.800 --> 14:57.280
 you're just gonna get this horrible grinding sound

14:57.280 --> 15:00.720
 as you coast, you know, to a dead stop in the,

15:00.720 --> 15:03.200
 you know, underneath the stoplight or whatever it is.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.240
 So the first thing you have to do is learn to shift it.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.600
 And so at least for me and a lot of drivers

15:09.600 --> 15:12.260
 who are going to private company CDL schools,

15:12.260 --> 15:14.640
 what happens is it's kind of like a bootcamp.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.600
 They ship me three states away from home,

15:17.600 --> 15:19.240
 send you a bus ticket and say,

15:19.240 --> 15:21.580
 ''Hey, we'll put you up for two weeks.''

15:21.580 --> 15:22.860
 You sit in a classroom,

15:22.860 --> 15:25.280
 you sort of learn the theory of shifting,

15:25.280 --> 15:29.400
 the theory of kind of how you fill out your log book,

15:29.400 --> 15:32.680
 rules of the road, you know, you do that maybe half the day.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.500
 And then the other half you're in this giant parking lot

15:35.500 --> 15:38.220
 with one of these old trucks and just like, you know,

15:38.220 --> 15:41.140
 destroying what's left of the thing, you know,

15:41.140 --> 15:43.420
 and it's lurching and belching smoke

15:43.420 --> 15:45.960
 and just making horrible noises and like rattling.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.400
 I mean, in these things, like there's a lot of torque.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.000
 And so if you do manage to get it into gear,

15:51.000 --> 15:52.240
 but the engine's lugging,

15:52.240 --> 15:54.520
 I mean, it can throw you right out of the seat, right?

15:54.520 --> 15:56.560
 So it's this, it's like, you know, it's bull,

15:56.560 --> 15:59.600
 you're trying to ride and it's super intimidating.

16:00.540 --> 16:04.100
 And the thing about it is that for everybody there,

16:04.100 --> 16:07.680
 it's almost everybody there, it's super high stakes.

16:07.680 --> 16:11.080
 So trucking has become a job of last resort

16:11.080 --> 16:12.820
 for a lot of people.

16:12.820 --> 16:16.840
 And so they, you know, they lose a job in manufacturing,

16:16.840 --> 16:20.480
 they get too old to do construction any longer, right?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.320
 The knees can no longer handle it.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.200
 And they get replaced by a machine,

16:25.200 --> 16:27.480
 their job gets, you know, offshored

16:27.480 --> 16:30.080
 and they end up going to trucking because it's a place

16:30.080 --> 16:31.600
 where they can maintain their income.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.540
 And so it's super high stress.

16:34.540 --> 16:36.360
 Like they've left their family behind,

16:36.360 --> 16:38.200
 maybe they quit another job.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.160
 They're typically being charged a lot of money.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.920
 So that first couple of weeks,

16:41.920 --> 16:45.080
 like you might get charged $8,000 by the company

16:45.080 --> 16:47.740
 that you have to pay back if you don't get hired.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.580
 And so the stakes are high and this machine is huge

16:50.580 --> 16:52.460
 and it's intimidating.

16:52.460 --> 16:53.840
 And so it's super stressful.

16:53.840 --> 16:57.660
 I mean, I watched, you know, grown men break down crying

16:57.660 --> 17:00.660
 about like how they couldn't go home and tell their son

17:00.660 --> 17:02.520
 that they had been telling they were gonna, you know,

17:02.520 --> 17:05.200
 go become a long haul truck driver that they'd failed.

17:05.200 --> 17:08.240
 And it's kind of this super high stress system.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.580
 And it's designed that way partly

17:09.580 --> 17:11.960
 because as one of my trainers later told me,

17:11.960 --> 17:14.440
 it's basically a two week job interview.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.520
 Like they're testing you, they're seeing like, you know,

17:16.520 --> 17:19.960
 how's this person gonna respond when it's tough, you know,

17:19.960 --> 17:22.760
 when they have to do the right thing and it's slow

17:22.760 --> 17:24.580
 and, you know, they need to learn something,

17:24.580 --> 17:26.640
 are they gonna rush, you know,

17:26.640 --> 17:29.740
 or are they gonna kind of stay calm, figure it out,

17:29.740 --> 17:31.560
 you know, nose to the grindstone.

17:31.560 --> 17:34.020
 Cause when you're a new truck driver, you're unsupervised,

17:34.020 --> 17:35.780
 you know, and that's what they're really looking for

17:35.780 --> 17:39.600
 is that kind of quality of conscientious work

17:39.600 --> 17:41.160
 that's gonna carry through to the job.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.700
 Well, so the truck is such an imposing part

17:43.700 --> 17:45.880
 of a traffic scenario.

17:45.880 --> 17:49.320
 So you said like turning, it stresses me out every time

17:49.320 --> 17:51.000
 I look at a truck cause they, I mean,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.840
 the geometry of the problem is so tricky.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.280
 And so if you combine the fact that they have to,

17:56.280 --> 17:58.240
 like everybody, basically all the cars in the scene

17:58.240 --> 17:59.960
 are staring at the truck and they're waiting,

17:59.960 --> 18:02.080
 often in frustration.

18:02.080 --> 18:06.920
 And in that mode, you have to then shift gears perfectly

18:06.920 --> 18:08.420
 and move perfectly.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.080
 And if, when you're new, especially,

18:11.080 --> 18:12.700
 like you'll probably, for somebody like me,

18:12.700 --> 18:15.580
 it feels like it would take years to become calm

18:15.580 --> 18:17.360
 and comfortable in that situation

18:17.360 --> 18:20.600
 as opposed to be exceptionally stressed under the eyes

18:20.600 --> 18:24.360
 of the road, everybody looking at you, waiting for you.

18:24.360 --> 18:27.280
 Is that the psychological pressure of that?

18:27.280 --> 18:28.960
 Is that something that was really difficult?

18:28.960 --> 18:30.080
 Yeah, absolutely.

18:30.080 --> 18:33.200
 Again, just, I saw people freeze up, you know,

18:33.200 --> 18:36.380
 in that intersection as, you know, horns are blaring

18:36.380 --> 18:38.800
 and the truck's grinding, you know, gears

18:38.800 --> 18:40.720
 and you just can't, you know, and they just shut down.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.980
 They're like, this isn't for me, I can't do it.

18:42.980 --> 18:45.160
 You're right, it takes years.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.920
 If, you know, trucking is not considered

18:47.920 --> 18:52.360
 a skilled occupation, but, you know, my six months there,

18:52.360 --> 18:54.920
 and I was a pretty good rookie, but when I finished,

18:54.920 --> 18:59.800
 I was still a rookie, even shifting, definitely backing,

18:59.800 --> 19:02.120
 tight corners and situations, you know,

19:02.120 --> 19:05.480
 I could drive competently, but the difference between me

19:05.480 --> 19:08.000
 and someone who had, you know, two, three years

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
 of experience was, it was a giant gulf between us.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.780
 And between that and the really skilled drivers

19:16.780 --> 19:19.540
 who've been doing it for 20 years, you know,

19:19.540 --> 19:21.180
 it's still another step beyond that.

19:21.180 --> 19:22.660
 So it is highly skilled.

19:22.660 --> 19:25.580
 Would it be fair to break trucking into the task

19:25.580 --> 19:28.420
 of driving a truck into two categories?

19:28.420 --> 19:31.320
 One is like the local stuff, getting out of the parking lot,

19:31.320 --> 19:35.060
 getting into, you know, driving down local streets

19:35.060 --> 19:38.780
 and then highway driving, those two tasks.

19:38.780 --> 19:41.640
 What are the challenges associated with each task?

19:41.640 --> 19:43.900
 You kind of emphasized the first one.

19:43.900 --> 19:48.040
 What about the actual like long haul highway driving?

19:48.040 --> 19:51.540
 Yeah, so, I mean, and they are very different, right?

19:51.540 --> 19:56.540
 And the key with the long haul driving is really a set of,

19:58.340 --> 20:03.260
 the way I came to understand it was a set of habits, right?

20:03.260 --> 20:07.080
 We have a sense of driving, particularly men, I think,

20:07.080 --> 20:10.180
 have a sense of driving as like being really skilled,

20:10.180 --> 20:13.260
 is like the goal and you can kind of maneuver yourself

20:13.260 --> 20:16.540
 out of in and out of tight spaces with great speed

20:16.540 --> 20:18.820
 and breaking and acceleration, you know.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.240
 For a really good truck driver,

20:22.240 --> 20:26.860
 it's about understanding traffic and traffic patterns

20:26.860 --> 20:28.100
 and making good decisions

20:28.100 --> 20:30.380
 so you never have to use those skills.

20:30.380 --> 20:33.740
 And the really good drivers, you know,

20:33.740 --> 20:37.600
 the mantra is always leave yourself an out, right?

20:37.600 --> 20:40.980
 So always have that safe place that you can put that truck

20:40.980 --> 20:43.740
 in case that four wheeler in front of you

20:43.740 --> 20:45.620
 who's texting loses control.

20:46.620 --> 20:50.140
 You know, what are you gonna do in that situation?

20:50.140 --> 20:54.740
 And what really good truck drivers do on the highway

20:54.740 --> 20:56.800
 is they just keep themselves

20:56.800 --> 20:59.500
 out of those situations entirely.

20:59.500 --> 21:03.480
 They see it, they slow down, you know, they avoid it.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.940
 And then the local driving is really something

21:06.940 --> 21:10.540
 that takes just practice and routine to learn.

21:10.540 --> 21:12.260
 You know, this quarter turn,

21:12.260 --> 21:15.900
 it feels like the back of the truck sometimes is on delay

21:15.900 --> 21:16.740
 when you're backing it up.

21:16.740 --> 21:18.480
 So it's like, all right, I'm gonna do a quarter turn

21:18.480 --> 21:22.060
 of the wheel now to get the effect that I want

21:22.060 --> 21:24.060
 like five seconds from now

21:24.060 --> 21:26.780
 in where that tail of that trailer is gonna be.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.260
 And there's just no,

21:28.260 --> 21:30.520
 I mean, some people have a natural talent for that,

21:30.520 --> 21:32.440
 you know, spatial visualization

21:32.440 --> 21:35.060
 and kind of calculating those angles and everything,

21:35.060 --> 21:37.900
 but there's really no escaping the fact

21:37.900 --> 21:40.500
 that you've gotta just do it over and over again

21:40.500 --> 21:42.900
 before you're gonna learn how to do it well.

21:42.900 --> 21:46.500
 Do you mind sharing how much you were getting paid,

21:46.500 --> 21:48.740
 how much you were making as a truck driver

21:48.740 --> 21:50.580
 in your time as a truck driver?

21:50.580 --> 21:54.140
 Yeah, I started out at 25 cents a mile

21:54.140 --> 21:56.780
 and then I got bumped up to 26 cents a mile.

21:56.780 --> 22:01.340
 So we had a minimum pay,

22:01.340 --> 22:03.580
 which was sort of a new pay scheme

22:03.580 --> 22:07.060
 that the industry had started to introduce to, you know,

22:07.060 --> 22:10.180
 because there's lots of unpaid work and time.

22:10.180 --> 22:12.660
 And so we had a minimum pay of $500 a week

22:12.660 --> 22:13.940
 that you would get

22:13.940 --> 22:16.340
 if you didn't drive enough miles to exceed that.

22:17.300 --> 22:19.540
 You get paid in sort of,

22:19.540 --> 22:21.740
 so you get paid when you turn the bills in,

22:21.740 --> 22:24.340
 which is the paperwork that goes with the load.

22:24.340 --> 22:28.480
 So, you know, you have to get that back to your company

22:28.480 --> 22:30.340
 and then that's how they bill the customer.

22:30.340 --> 22:32.460
 And so you might get a bunch of those bills

22:32.460 --> 22:34.420
 that kind of bunch up in one week.

22:34.420 --> 22:38.300
 So, you know, I might get a paycheck for, you know, $1,200.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.980
 And I mean, I was a poor graduate student.

22:40.980 --> 22:44.020
 So this was real, real money to me.

22:44.020 --> 22:47.780
 And so I had this sort of natural incentive to,

22:47.780 --> 22:51.420
 you know, earn a lot or to maximize my pay.

22:51.420 --> 22:54.660
 Some weeks were that minimum, 500, very few.

22:54.660 --> 22:57.340
 And then some I'd get 1200, 1300 bucks.

22:58.220 --> 23:00.660
 Pay has gone up, you know,

23:00.660 --> 23:03.420
 typical drivers now starting in the 30s, you know,

23:03.420 --> 23:05.420
 in the kind of job that I was in.

23:05.420 --> 23:09.020
 30 cents per mile, 30 to 35.

23:09.020 --> 23:12.020
 So can we try to reverse engineer that math,

23:12.020 --> 23:14.540
 how that maps to the actual hours?

23:14.540 --> 23:19.020
 So the hours connected to driving are so widely dispersed,

23:19.020 --> 23:21.540
 as you said, some of them don't count as actual work,

23:21.540 --> 23:22.780
 some of it does.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.220
 That's a very interesting discussion

23:24.220 --> 23:25.660
 that we'll then continue

23:25.660 --> 23:28.020
 when we start talking about autonomous trucking.

23:28.020 --> 23:31.140
 But, you know, you're saying all these cents per mile

23:31.140 --> 23:31.980
 kind of thing.

23:31.980 --> 23:36.980
 What, how does that map to like average hourly wage?

23:38.060 --> 23:41.100
 Yeah, so, I mean, and this is kind of the,

23:41.100 --> 23:44.020
 this is also an interesting technology story in the end.

23:44.020 --> 23:46.980
 And it's the technology story that didn't happen.

23:46.980 --> 23:49.420
 So pay per mile was, you know,

23:49.420 --> 23:52.500
 invented by companies when you couldn't surveil drivers,

23:52.500 --> 23:53.660
 you didn't know what they were doing, right?

23:53.660 --> 23:56.020
 And you wanted them to have some skin in the game.

23:56.020 --> 23:58.460
 And so you'd say, you know, here's the load,

23:58.460 --> 24:00.780
 it's going from, you know, for me,

24:00.780 --> 24:03.340
 I might start in, you know, the Northeast,

24:03.340 --> 24:05.700
 maybe in upstate New York with a load of beer,

24:05.700 --> 24:07.540
 and say, here's this load of beer,

24:07.540 --> 24:09.420
 bring it to this address in Michigan,

24:09.420 --> 24:11.420
 we're gonna pay you by the mile, right?

24:11.420 --> 24:12.900
 If I was being paid by the hour,

24:12.900 --> 24:16.420
 I might just pull over at the diner and have breakfast.

24:16.420 --> 24:19.060
 So you're paid by the mile,

24:19.060 --> 24:22.500
 but increasingly over time,

24:22.500 --> 24:26.860
 the typical driver is spending more and more time

24:26.860 --> 24:28.300
 doing non driving tasks.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.260
 There's lots of reasons for that.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.980
 One of which is railroads captured a lot of freight

24:32.980 --> 24:34.540
 that goes long distances now.

24:34.540 --> 24:37.380
 Another one is traffic congestion.

24:37.380 --> 24:39.620
 And the other one is that drivers are pretty cheap.

24:39.620 --> 24:41.860
 And they're almost always the low people

24:41.860 --> 24:44.380
 on the totem pole in some segments.

24:44.380 --> 24:48.420
 And so their time is used really inefficiently.

24:48.420 --> 24:51.260
 So I might go to that brewery

24:51.260 --> 24:54.700
 to pick up that load of Bud Light.

24:54.700 --> 24:58.700
 And, you know, their dock staff may be busy

24:58.700 --> 25:00.860
 loading up five other trucks.

25:00.860 --> 25:03.420
 And they'll say, you know, go over there and sit and wait,

25:03.420 --> 25:05.780
 and we'll call you on the CB when the dock's ready.

25:05.780 --> 25:08.900
 So you wait there a couple hours, they bring you in,

25:08.900 --> 25:10.780
 you know, you never know what's happening in the truck.

25:10.780 --> 25:12.660
 Sometimes they're loading it with a forklift,

25:12.660 --> 25:16.260
 maybe they're throwing 14 pallets on there full of kegs.

25:16.260 --> 25:18.420
 But sometimes it'll take them hours, you know,

25:18.420 --> 25:19.860
 and you're sitting in that truck.

25:19.860 --> 25:22.700
 And you're essentially unpaid.

25:22.700 --> 25:26.140
 You know, then you pull out, you've got control

25:26.140 --> 25:27.820
 over what you're gonna get paid

25:27.820 --> 25:29.500
 based on how you drive that load.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.500
 And then on the other end,

25:31.500 --> 25:34.260
 you got a similar situation of kind of waiting, so.

25:34.260 --> 25:37.220
 So if that's the way truck drivers are paid,

25:37.220 --> 25:40.500
 then there's a low incentive for the optimization

25:40.500 --> 25:43.380
 of the supply chain to make them more efficient, right?

25:43.380 --> 25:46.980
 To utilize truck labor more efficiently.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.420
 Absolutely.

25:48.420 --> 25:51.660
 So that's a technology problem that,

25:51.660 --> 25:55.160
 one of several technology problems that could be addressed.

25:57.300 --> 26:01.940
 I mean, so what did, if we just linger on it,

26:01.940 --> 26:06.580
 what are we talking about in terms of dollars per hour?

26:06.580 --> 26:08.260
 Is it close to minimum wage?

26:08.260 --> 26:10.660
 Is it, you know, there's something you talk about,

26:10.660 --> 26:15.660
 there was a conception or a misconception

26:15.660 --> 26:19.780
 that truckers get paid a lot for their work.

26:19.780 --> 26:21.760
 Do they get paid a lot for their work?

26:21.760 --> 26:23.300
 Some do.

26:23.300 --> 26:26.020
 And I think that's part of the complexity.

26:26.020 --> 26:28.900
 So, you know, what interested me as an ethnographer

26:28.900 --> 26:31.020
 about this was, you know, I'm interested

26:31.020 --> 26:32.780
 in the kind of economic conceptions

26:32.780 --> 26:34.300
 that people have in their heads

26:34.300 --> 26:38.380
 and how they lead to certain decisions in labor markets.

26:38.380 --> 26:40.540
 You know, why some people become an entrepreneur

26:40.540 --> 26:43.120
 and other people become a wage laborer,

26:43.120 --> 26:45.700
 or, you know, why some people wanna be doctors

26:45.700 --> 26:47.540
 and other people wanna be truck drivers.

26:47.540 --> 26:50.620
 That conception, right, is getting shaped

26:50.620 --> 26:53.820
 in these labor markets is the argument of the book.

26:53.820 --> 26:57.420
 And the fact that drivers can hear,

26:57.420 --> 26:59.780
 or potential drivers can hear about these, you know,

26:59.780 --> 27:01.940
 workers who make $100,000 plus,

27:01.940 --> 27:04.420
 which happens regularly in the trucking industry.

27:04.420 --> 27:06.700
 There are many truck drivers who make more

27:06.700 --> 27:10.900
 than $100,000 a year, you know, is an attraction.

27:10.900 --> 27:13.780
 But the industry is highly segmented.

27:13.780 --> 27:16.380
 And so the entry level segment,

27:16.380 --> 27:18.500
 and we can probably get into this,

27:18.500 --> 27:20.860
 but, you know, the industry is dominated

27:20.860 --> 27:24.940
 by a few dozen really large companies

27:24.940 --> 27:28.580
 that are self insured and can train new drivers.

27:28.580 --> 27:30.200
 So if you want those good jobs,

27:30.200 --> 27:32.740
 you've gotta have several years,

27:32.740 --> 27:35.020
 up until recently, now the labor market's becoming tighter,

27:35.020 --> 27:38.060
 but you had to have several years of accident free,

27:38.060 --> 27:40.620
 you know, perfectly clean record driving

27:40.620 --> 27:41.760
 to get into them.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.480
 The other part of the segment, you know,

27:44.480 --> 27:46.780
 those drivers often don't make minimum wage.

27:47.820 --> 27:50.340
 But this leads to one of the sort of central issues

27:50.340 --> 27:52.020
 that has been in the courts,

27:52.020 --> 27:56.340
 and in the legislature, in some states,

27:56.340 --> 27:59.260
 is, you know, what should truck drivers get paid for?

27:59.260 --> 28:01.100
 Right, the industry, you know,

28:01.100 --> 28:04.300
 for the last 30 years or so has said, essentially,

28:04.300 --> 28:07.540
 it's the hours that they log for safety reasons

28:07.540 --> 28:11.220
 for the Department of Transportation, right?

28:11.220 --> 28:14.500
 Now, since the drivers are paid by the mile,

28:14.500 --> 28:15.920
 they try to minimize those,

28:15.920 --> 28:19.020
 because those hours are limited by the federal government.

28:19.020 --> 28:19.940
 So the federal government says,

28:19.940 --> 28:22.580
 you can't drive more than 60 hours in a week

28:22.580 --> 28:24.180
 as a long haul truck driver.

28:24.180 --> 28:26.520
 And so you wanna drive as many miles as you can

28:26.520 --> 28:31.460
 in those 60 hours, and so you under report them, right?

28:31.460 --> 28:34.460
 And so what happens is the companies say,

28:34.460 --> 28:38.100
 well, that guy, you know, he only said he logged 45 hours

28:38.100 --> 28:40.580
 of work that week, or 50 hours of work.

28:40.580 --> 28:43.620
 That's all we have to pay him minimum wage for.

28:43.620 --> 28:47.140
 When in fact, typical truck driver in these jobs will work,

28:47.140 --> 28:49.500
 according to most people, would sort of define it as like,

28:49.500 --> 28:51.580
 okay, I'm at the customer location, I'm waiting to load,

28:51.580 --> 28:53.500
 I'm doing some paperwork, you know,

28:53.500 --> 28:55.820
 inspecting the truck, I'm fueling it,

28:55.820 --> 28:58.160
 just waiting to, you know, get put in the dock,

28:58.160 --> 29:01.980
 80 to 90 hours would be sort of a typical work week

29:01.980 --> 29:04.620
 for one of these drivers.

29:04.620 --> 29:05.900
 And just when you look at that,

29:05.900 --> 29:07.340
 they don't make minimum wage oftentimes.

29:07.340 --> 29:10.420
 Right, just to be clear, what we're dancing around here

29:10.420 --> 29:14.180
 is that a little bit over, a little bit under minimum wage

29:14.180 --> 29:17.500
 is nevertheless most truck drivers seem to be making

29:17.500 --> 29:19.380
 close to minimum wage.

29:19.380 --> 29:23.980
 Like this is the, so like we maybe haven't made that clear.

29:23.980 --> 29:27.180
 There's a few that make quite a bit of money,

29:27.180 --> 29:31.220
 but like you're as an entry and for years,

29:31.220 --> 29:35.500
 you're operating essentially minimum wage

29:35.500 --> 29:37.820
 and potentially far less than minimum wage

29:37.820 --> 29:39.980
 if you actually count the number of hours

29:40.900 --> 29:42.780
 that are taken out of your life

29:42.780 --> 29:44.700
 due to your dedication to trucking.

29:45.780 --> 29:49.420
 Well, if you count like the hours taken out of your life,

29:49.420 --> 29:52.780
 then you gotta go, you know, maybe a full 24.

29:52.780 --> 29:54.340
 That's right, yeah, from family,

29:54.340 --> 29:59.340
 from the high quality of life parts of your life.

29:59.340 --> 30:01.940
 Yeah, and there's a whole nother set of rules

30:01.940 --> 30:03.820
 that the Department of Labor has,

30:03.820 --> 30:06.460
 which basically say that a truck driver

30:06.460 --> 30:09.780
 who's dispatched away from home for more than a day

30:09.780 --> 30:13.300
 should get minimum wage 24 hours a day.

30:13.300 --> 30:16.460
 And that could be a state minimum wage,

30:16.460 --> 30:19.620
 but typically what it would work out to for most drivers

30:19.620 --> 30:22.940
 is that, you know, the minimum wage for a truck driver

30:22.940 --> 30:26.900
 should be 50s of thousands, you know, 55, $60,000

30:26.900 --> 30:28.860
 should be the minimum wage of a truck driver.

30:28.860 --> 30:31.500
 And you've probably heard about the truck driver shortage.

30:31.500 --> 30:34.660
 If, you know, which I hope we can talk about,

30:35.740 --> 30:37.660
 if the minimum wage for truck drivers

30:37.660 --> 30:40.260
 is as it should be on the books at, you know,

30:40.260 --> 30:44.220
 around $60,000, we wouldn't have a shortage of truck drivers.

30:44.220 --> 30:45.420
 Oh, wow.

30:46.340 --> 30:49.300
 And to me, 60,000 is not a lot of money

30:49.300 --> 30:51.340
 for this kind of job.

30:51.340 --> 30:56.340
 Cause you're, this isn't, this is essentially two jobs

30:56.500 --> 30:58.620
 and two jobs where you don't get to sleep

30:58.620 --> 31:03.420
 with your wife or see your kids at night.

31:03.420 --> 31:06.500
 That's 60,000 is a very little money for that.

31:06.500 --> 31:09.540
 But you're saying if it was 60,000,

31:09.540 --> 31:11.300
 you wouldn't even have the shortage.

31:11.300 --> 31:12.540
 If that was the minimum.

31:12.540 --> 31:13.460
 If that was the minimum.

31:13.460 --> 31:14.780
 And I think that's what,

31:14.780 --> 31:17.020
 now we have drivers who start in the 30s.

31:18.180 --> 31:19.580
 Wow, but yeah.

31:19.580 --> 31:22.100
 And I mean, so we're talking two, three jobs really,

31:22.100 --> 31:23.340
 when you look at the total hours

31:23.340 --> 31:25.540
 that people are working at, you know,

31:25.540 --> 31:26.700
 they can work over a hundred.

31:26.700 --> 31:28.540
 If they're a trainer, you know,

31:28.540 --> 31:29.660
 training other truck drivers,

31:29.660 --> 31:31.780
 well over a hundred hours a week.

31:31.780 --> 31:34.260
 So a job of last resort.

31:34.260 --> 31:37.500
 Maybe you can jump around from tangent to tangent.

31:37.500 --> 31:41.540
 This is such a fascinating and difficult topic.

31:41.540 --> 31:46.420
 I heard that there's a shortage of truck drivers.

31:46.420 --> 31:48.300
 So there's more jobs than truck drivers

31:48.300 --> 31:49.780
 willing to take on the job.

31:49.780 --> 31:53.260
 Is that the state of affairs currently?

31:53.260 --> 31:57.460
 I mean, I think the way that you just put that is right.

31:57.460 --> 31:59.820
 We don't have a shortage of people

31:59.820 --> 32:02.860
 who are currently licensed to do the jobs.

32:02.860 --> 32:05.220
 So I'm working on a project for the state of California

32:05.220 --> 32:07.100
 to look at the shortage of agricultural drivers.

32:07.100 --> 32:11.420
 And the first thing that the DMV commissioner of the state

32:11.420 --> 32:13.660
 wanted to look at was, you know,

32:13.660 --> 32:15.700
 is there actually a shortage of licensed drivers?

32:15.700 --> 32:17.740
 He's like, I've got a database here

32:17.740 --> 32:20.020
 of all the people who have a commercial driver's license

32:20.020 --> 32:24.180
 who could potentially have the credential to do this.

32:24.180 --> 32:28.380
 There are about 145,000 jobs in California

32:28.380 --> 32:31.460
 that require a class A CDL,

32:31.460 --> 32:33.580
 which would be that commercial driver's license

32:33.580 --> 32:36.340
 that you need for the big trucks.

32:36.340 --> 32:37.940
 About 145,000 jobs.

32:37.940 --> 32:39.940
 The industry in their, you know,

32:39.940 --> 32:43.820
 regular promotion of the idea that there's a shortage

32:43.820 --> 32:45.900
 is always projecting forward and says,

32:45.900 --> 32:48.540
 you know, we're gonna need 165,000 or so

32:48.540 --> 32:50.500
 in the next 10 years.

32:50.500 --> 32:53.820
 They're currently like 435,000 people licensed

32:53.820 --> 32:57.260
 in the state of California to drive one of these big trucks.

32:57.260 --> 33:01.780
 So it is not at all an absence of people who,

33:01.780 --> 33:03.340
 I mean, and again, going back

33:03.340 --> 33:05.300
 to what we were talking about before,

33:05.300 --> 33:07.180
 getting that license is not something

33:07.180 --> 33:10.460
 that you just walk down to the DMV and take the test.

33:10.460 --> 33:13.940
 Like this is somebody who probably quit another job,

33:13.940 --> 33:18.940
 was unemployed, and took months to go to a training school,

33:19.700 --> 33:22.060
 paid for that training school oftentimes,

33:22.060 --> 33:24.140
 left their family for months,

33:24.140 --> 33:26.540
 invested in what they thought was gonna be

33:26.540 --> 33:28.780
 a long term career, and then said,

33:28.780 --> 33:31.280
 you know what, forget it, I can't, I can't do it.

33:33.540 --> 33:35.460
 So yeah, so it's not just skill,

33:35.460 --> 33:37.540
 it's like they were psychologically invested

33:37.540 --> 33:39.340
 potentially for months, if not years,

33:39.340 --> 33:42.660
 into this kinds of position as perhaps a position

33:42.660 --> 33:46.220
 that if they lose their current job, they could fall too.

33:46.220 --> 33:47.940
 Okay, so that's an indication

33:47.940 --> 33:50.420
 that there's something deeply wrong with the job,

33:50.420 --> 33:53.300
 if so many licensed people are not willing to take it.

33:53.300 --> 33:55.300
 What are the biggest problems

33:55.300 --> 33:59.180
 of the job of truck driver currently?

33:59.180 --> 34:01.540
 Yeah, the job, the problems with the job

34:01.540 --> 34:02.700
 and the labor market, right?

34:02.700 --> 34:07.420
 But let's start with the job, which is, you know, again,

34:07.420 --> 34:11.020
 just so much time that's not compensated directly

34:11.020 --> 34:12.980
 for the amount of time.

34:12.980 --> 34:15.140
 And that's just psychologically,

34:15.140 --> 34:17.980
 and this was a big part of what I studied

34:17.980 --> 34:20.420
 for the first book was, you know,

34:20.420 --> 34:24.460
 that conception of like, what's my time worth, right?

34:24.460 --> 34:28.720
 And like, what truck drivers love is oftentimes,

34:28.720 --> 34:32.980
 is that tangible outcome based compensation.

34:32.980 --> 34:37.020
 So they say, you know what, you know, honest days work,

34:37.020 --> 34:38.820
 I work hard, I get paid for what I do,

34:38.820 --> 34:40.540
 I drive 500 miles today,

34:40.540 --> 34:42.580
 that's what I'm gonna get paid for.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.060
 And then you get to that dock,

34:44.060 --> 34:46.940
 and they tell you, sorry, the load's not ready,

34:46.940 --> 34:49.700
 go sit over there, and you stew.

34:49.700 --> 34:51.580
 And that weight can break you psychologically

34:51.580 --> 34:56.580
 because your time every second becomes more worthless.

34:57.860 --> 34:58.700
 Yeah.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.060
 Or worth less.

35:00.060 --> 35:04.500
 Yeah, and again, the industry is gonna say, for instance,

35:04.500 --> 35:06.300
 okay, well, you know, they've got skin in the game, right?

35:06.300 --> 35:08.060
 That argument about sort of compensation

35:08.060 --> 35:10.700
 based on sort of output, right?

35:10.700 --> 35:12.180
 But that's a holdover from when you couldn't

35:12.180 --> 35:13.020
 observe truckers.

35:13.020 --> 35:15.740
 Now they all have, you know, satellite linked computers

35:15.740 --> 35:18.580
 in the trucks that tell these large companies,

35:18.580 --> 35:21.120
 this driver was, you know, at this GPS location

35:21.120 --> 35:22.780
 for four and a half hours, right?

35:22.780 --> 35:25.900
 So if you wanted to compensate them for that time directly,

35:25.900 --> 35:28.060
 and the trucker can't control what's happening

35:28.060 --> 35:29.740
 on that customer location, you know,

35:29.740 --> 35:31.860
 they're waiting for that, you know, firm,

35:31.860 --> 35:35.100
 that customer to tell them, hey, pull in there.

35:35.100 --> 35:38.260
 And so what it becomes is just a way to shift

35:38.260 --> 35:43.260
 the inefficiencies and the cost of that onto that driver.

35:43.580 --> 35:45.580
 Now it's competitive for customers.

35:45.580 --> 35:48.500
 So if you're Walmart, you might have your choice

35:48.500 --> 35:50.620
 of a dozen different trucking companies

35:50.620 --> 35:52.140
 that could move your stuff.

35:52.140 --> 35:54.500
 And if one of them tells you, hey, you're not moving

35:54.500 --> 35:57.660
 our trucks in and out of your docks fast enough,

35:57.660 --> 35:59.660
 we're gonna charge you for how long our truck

35:59.660 --> 36:01.220
 is sitting on your lot.

36:01.220 --> 36:02.220
 If you're Walmart, you're gonna say,

36:02.220 --> 36:04.580
 I'll go see what the other guy says, right?

36:04.580 --> 36:08.160
 And so companies are gonna allow that customer

36:08.160 --> 36:11.540
 to essentially waste that driver's time, you know,

36:11.540 --> 36:13.440
 in order to keep that business.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.820
 Can you try to describe the economics,

36:16.820 --> 36:18.420
 the labor market of the situation?

36:18.420 --> 36:20.940
 You mentioned freight and railroad.

36:20.940 --> 36:25.940
 What is the sort of the dynamic financials,

36:27.180 --> 36:32.180
 the economics of this that allow for such low salaries

36:32.180 --> 36:35.520
 to be paid to truckers?

36:35.520 --> 36:37.340
 Like what's the competition?

36:37.340 --> 36:41.780
 What's the alternative to transporting goods via trucks?

36:41.780 --> 36:43.340
 Like what seems to be broken here

36:43.340 --> 36:44.860
 from an economics perspective?

36:44.860 --> 36:47.280
 Yeah, so it's, well, nothing.

36:47.280 --> 36:50.560
 It's a perfect market, right?

36:50.560 --> 36:53.400
 I mean, so for economists, this is how it should work, right?

36:53.400 --> 36:55.080
 But the inefficiencies, like you said,

36:55.080 --> 36:59.200
 sorry to interrupt, are pushed to the truck driver.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.280
 Doesn't that like spiral, doesn't that lead to

37:02.280 --> 37:04.480
 a poor performance on the part of the truck driver

37:04.480 --> 37:08.000
 and just like make the whole thing more and more inefficient

37:08.000 --> 37:10.840
 and it results in lower payment

37:10.840 --> 37:12.760
 to the truck driver and so on.

37:12.760 --> 37:17.000
 It just feels like in capitalism,

37:17.000 --> 37:19.720
 you should have a competing solution

37:19.720 --> 37:21.680
 in terms of truck drivers.

37:21.680 --> 37:25.840
 Like another company that provides transportation via trucks

37:25.840 --> 37:28.640
 that creates a much better experience for truck drivers,

37:28.640 --> 37:32.320
 making them more efficient, all those kinds of things.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.800
 How is the competition being suppressed here?

37:34.800 --> 37:39.320
 Yeah, so it is, the competition is based on who's cheaper.

37:39.320 --> 37:42.040
 And this is the cheapest way to move the freight.

37:42.040 --> 37:44.320
 Now, there are externalities, right?

37:44.320 --> 37:46.800
 I mean, so this is the explanation

37:46.800 --> 37:49.620
 that I think is obvious for this, right?

37:49.620 --> 37:53.820
 There are lots of costs that,

37:53.820 --> 37:55.000
 whether it's that driver's time,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.880
 whether it's the time without their family,

37:57.880 --> 38:02.640
 whether it's the fact that they drive through congestion

38:02.640 --> 38:06.940
 and spew lots of diesel particulates into cities

38:06.940 --> 38:09.760
 where kids have asthma and make our commutes longer

38:09.760 --> 38:11.960
 rather than more efficiently use their time

38:11.960 --> 38:14.800
 by sort of routing them around congestion

38:14.800 --> 38:17.320
 and rush hour and things like that.

38:17.320 --> 38:21.080
 This is the cheapest way to move freight.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.600
 And so it's the most competitive.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.720
 A big part of this is public subsidy of training.

38:26.720 --> 38:31.240
 So when those workers are not paying for the training,

38:31.240 --> 38:32.840
 you and I often are.

38:32.840 --> 38:37.840
 So if you lose your job because of foreign trade

38:38.480 --> 38:43.480
 or you're a veteran using your GI benefits,

38:44.200 --> 38:48.360
 you may very well be offered training,

38:48.360 --> 38:50.640
 publicly subsidized training to become a truck driver.

38:50.640 --> 38:53.200
 And so all of these are externalities

38:53.200 --> 38:55.920
 that the companies don't have to pay for.

38:55.920 --> 38:58.680
 And so this makes it the most profitable way to move freight.

38:58.680 --> 39:02.960
 So trucks is way cheaper than trains?

39:02.960 --> 39:03.920
 Well, over the long,

39:03.920 --> 39:07.720
 so one of the big stories for these companies

39:07.720 --> 39:10.040
 is that the average length of haul,

39:10.040 --> 39:12.960
 which becomes very important for self driving trucks,

39:12.960 --> 39:16.040
 the average length of haul has been steadily declining.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.400
 Over the last 15 years or so,

39:19.400 --> 39:21.080
 and this is industry collected data

39:21.080 --> 39:23.200
 from sort of the big firms that report it,

39:23.200 --> 39:26.640
 but roughly been cut in half from typically

39:26.640 --> 39:30.560
 about a thousand miles to under 500.

39:30.560 --> 39:35.560
 And under 500 is what a driver can move in a day, right?

39:36.200 --> 39:40.960
 So you can get loaded, drive and unload,

39:40.960 --> 39:43.120
 around 400 miles or something like that.

39:44.520 --> 39:48.000
 I wanna steal a good question from the Penn Gazette

39:48.000 --> 39:49.960
 interview you did, which people should read.

39:49.960 --> 39:51.480
 It's a great interview.

39:51.480 --> 39:55.320
 Was there a golden age for long haul truckers in America?

39:55.320 --> 39:58.280
 And if so, this is just a journalistic question.

39:58.280 --> 40:02.560
 And if so, what enabled it and what brought it to an end?

40:02.560 --> 40:05.320
 Wow, I might have to have you read my answer to that.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.600
 That was a few years ago,

40:07.600 --> 40:10.800
 be interesting to compare what I'll say, but.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.880
 I mean, one bigger question to ask, I guess,

40:12.880 --> 40:17.880
 is like Johnny Cash wrote a lot of songs about truckers.

40:17.880 --> 40:22.120
 There used to be a time when perhaps falsely,

40:22.120 --> 40:24.320
 perhaps it's part of the kind of perception

40:24.320 --> 40:26.480
 that you study with the labor markets and so on.

40:26.480 --> 40:28.960
 There was a perception of truckers being,

40:28.960 --> 40:30.320
 first of all, a lucrative job

40:30.320 --> 40:34.440
 and second of all, a job to be desired.

40:34.440 --> 40:37.560
 Yeah, so I mean, this is,

40:37.560 --> 40:40.280
 the trucking industry to me is fascinating,

40:40.280 --> 40:43.600
 but I think it should be fascinating to a lot of people.

40:43.600 --> 40:47.800
 So the golden age was really two different kinds

40:47.800 --> 40:51.080
 of markets as well, right?

40:51.080 --> 40:54.520
 Today we have really good jobs and some really bad jobs.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.760
 We had the Teamsters Union

40:55.760 --> 41:00.760
 that controlled the vast majority of employee jobs.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.360
 And even where they had something called

41:03.360 --> 41:05.480
 the National Master Freight Agreement.

41:05.480 --> 41:10.400
 And this was Jimmy Hoffa who led the union

41:10.400 --> 41:15.400
 through its sort of critical period by the mid 60s

41:15.400 --> 41:19.000
 had unified essentially the entire nation's

41:19.000 --> 41:22.080
 trucking labor force under one contract.

41:22.080 --> 41:26.000
 Now you were either covered by that contract

41:26.000 --> 41:29.040
 or your employer paid a lot of attention to it.

41:29.040 --> 41:32.920
 And so by the end of the 1970s,

41:32.920 --> 41:34.720
 the typical truck driver was making

41:34.720 --> 41:36.360
 well more than $100,000,

41:36.360 --> 41:39.080
 typical truck driver was making more than $100,000

41:39.080 --> 41:41.840
 in today's dollars and was home every night.

41:41.840 --> 41:46.480
 That was without a doubt and even more

41:46.480 --> 41:49.600
 than unionized auto workers, steel workers,

41:49.600 --> 41:52.920
 10, 20% more than those workers made.

41:53.800 --> 41:56.360
 That was the golden age for sort of job quality,

41:56.360 --> 41:57.680
 wages, teamster power.

41:57.680 --> 42:00.360
 They were without a doubt the most powerful union

42:00.360 --> 42:03.160
 in the United States at that time.

42:03.160 --> 42:05.240
 At the same time in the 1970s,

42:05.240 --> 42:09.160
 you had the mythic long haul trucker.

42:09.160 --> 42:13.240
 And these were the guys who were kind of on the margins

42:13.240 --> 42:15.000
 of the regulated market,

42:15.000 --> 42:16.720
 which is what the teamsters controlled.

42:16.720 --> 42:17.960
 A lot of them were in agriculture,

42:17.960 --> 42:19.560
 which was never regulated.

42:19.560 --> 42:22.360
 So in the new deal, when they decided to regulate trucking,

42:22.360 --> 42:23.760
 they didn't regulate agriculture

42:23.760 --> 42:25.960
 because they didn't wanna drive up food prices,

42:25.960 --> 42:28.240
 which would hurt workers in urban areas.

42:28.240 --> 42:32.280
 So they essentially left agricultural truckers out of it.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.480
 And that's where a lot of the kind of outlaw,

42:34.480 --> 42:39.480
 you know, asphalt cowboy imagery that we get.

42:40.440 --> 42:44.320
 And I grew up, I know you didn't grow up in the US

42:44.320 --> 42:47.280
 at this sort of, you know, as a young child.

42:47.280 --> 42:51.120
 And I'm a bit older than you, but in the late 70s,

42:51.120 --> 42:54.920
 there were movies and TV shows and CBs were a craze.

42:54.920 --> 42:57.600
 And it was all these kind of outlaw truckers

42:57.600 --> 43:00.360
 who were out there hauling some unregulated freight.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.600
 They weren't supposed to be trying to avoid the bears,

43:02.600 --> 43:03.760
 you know, who are the cops.

43:03.760 --> 43:07.080
 And, you know, with all this salty language

43:07.080 --> 43:10.560
 and these like, you know, terms that only they understood

43:10.560 --> 43:13.480
 and, you know, the partying at diners and popping pills,

43:13.480 --> 43:15.600
 you know, the California turnarounds.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.960
 So asphalt cowboys, truly.

43:17.960 --> 43:20.960
 So it's like another form of cowboy movies.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.520
 Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

43:22.520 --> 43:27.520
 And I think that sort of masculine ethos of like,

43:27.920 --> 43:30.080
 you got 40,000 pounds of something you care about,

43:30.080 --> 43:31.280
 I'm your guy, you know,

43:31.280 --> 43:33.360
 you needed to go from New York to California,

43:33.360 --> 43:34.920
 don't worry about it, I got it.

43:34.920 --> 43:37.000
 That's appealing and it's tangible, right?

43:37.000 --> 43:39.600
 And you think about people who don't wanna be paper pusher

43:39.600 --> 43:41.360
 and sit in the, I deal with office politics,

43:41.360 --> 43:42.840
 like just give me what you care about

43:42.840 --> 43:44.800
 and I'll take care of it, you know, just pay me fair,

43:44.800 --> 43:46.760
 you know, and that appeals.

43:46.760 --> 43:49.560
 You mentioned unions, Teamsters, Jimmy Hoffa.

43:51.040 --> 43:53.320
 Big question, maybe difficult question.

43:53.320 --> 43:56.200
 What are some pros and cons of unions historically

43:56.200 --> 43:58.600
 and today in the trucking space?

43:58.600 --> 44:03.600
 Yeah, well, if you're a worker, there are a lot of pros.

44:03.600 --> 44:04.760
 And I don't, you know,

44:04.760 --> 44:06.680
 and this was one of the things I talked to truckers about

44:06.680 --> 44:07.520
 a lot.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.400
 Yeah, what's their perception of Jimmy Hoffa,

44:09.400 --> 44:11.600
 for example, of unions?

44:11.600 --> 44:15.200
 Yeah, so, and this was probably one of the central

44:15.200 --> 44:16.840
 hypotheses that I had going in there.

44:16.840 --> 44:19.280
 And it may sound, you know,

44:19.280 --> 44:21.040
 someone who does hard science, right?

44:21.040 --> 44:23.640
 You may hear a social scientist, you know,

44:23.640 --> 44:24.840
 sort of use that terminology,

44:24.840 --> 44:26.040
 even other social scientists.

44:26.040 --> 44:26.880
 Hypothesis?

44:26.880 --> 44:28.360
 Yeah, you know, they don't like it,

44:28.360 --> 44:31.040
 but I do like to think that way.

44:31.040 --> 44:33.720
 And my initial hypothesis was that, you know,

44:33.720 --> 44:35.120
 and it's very simple,

44:35.120 --> 44:39.400
 that, you know, the tenure of the driver in the industry

44:39.400 --> 44:43.040
 would have a strong effect on how they viewed unions.

44:43.040 --> 44:45.920
 That, you know, somebody who had experienced unions

44:45.920 --> 44:48.040
 would be more favorable

44:48.040 --> 44:50.880
 and someone who had not would not be, right?

44:51.880 --> 44:55.440
 And that turned out to be the case without a doubt.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.720
 But in an interesting way,

44:57.720 --> 44:59.680
 which was that even the drivers

44:59.680 --> 45:01.680
 who were not part of the union,

45:02.760 --> 45:07.760
 who in the kind of public debate of deregulation

45:09.640 --> 45:12.600
 were portrayed as these kind of small business truckers

45:12.600 --> 45:16.120
 who were getting shut out by the big regulated monopolies

45:16.120 --> 45:17.520
 and the Teamsters Union, you know,

45:17.520 --> 45:19.400
 the corrupt Teamsters Union.

45:19.400 --> 45:22.680
 Even those drivers longed for the days of the Teamsters

45:22.680 --> 45:27.040
 because they recognized the overall market impact

45:27.040 --> 45:27.880
 that they had.

45:27.880 --> 45:31.040
 That trucking just naturally

45:31.040 --> 45:33.680
 tended toward excessive competition

45:33.680 --> 45:36.800
 that meant that there was no profit to be made

45:36.800 --> 45:39.160
 and oftentimes you'd be operating at a loss.

45:39.160 --> 45:41.480
 And so even these, you know,

45:41.480 --> 45:44.480
 the asphalt cowboy owner operators from back in the day

45:44.480 --> 45:47.640
 would tell me when the Teamsters were in power,

45:47.640 --> 45:48.960
 I made a lot more money.

45:48.960 --> 45:51.800
 And, you know, this is, you know, unions,

45:51.800 --> 45:55.360
 at least those kinds of unions, like the Teamsters,

45:55.360 --> 45:58.720
 you know, there's, I think a lot of misconceptions today

45:58.720 --> 46:01.960
 sort of popularly about what unions did back then.

46:01.960 --> 46:04.240
 They tied wages to productivity.

46:04.240 --> 46:08.920
 Like that was the central thing that the Teamsters Union did.

46:08.920 --> 46:11.320
 And, you know, there were great accounts

46:11.320 --> 46:13.960
 of sort of Jimmy Hoffa's perspective

46:13.960 --> 46:17.000
 for all his portrayal as sort of corrupt

46:17.000 --> 46:19.720
 and criminal, and there's, you know, I'm not disputing that.

46:19.720 --> 46:21.200
 He broke a lot of laws.

46:22.600 --> 46:27.600
 He was remarkably open about who he was and what he did.

46:27.600 --> 46:30.400
 He actually invited a pair, a husband and wife team

46:30.400 --> 46:34.000
 of Harvard economists to follow him around

46:34.000 --> 46:37.200
 and like opened up the Teamsters books to them

46:37.200 --> 46:40.240
 so that they could see how he was, you know,

46:40.240 --> 46:43.520
 thinking about negotiating with the employers.

46:43.520 --> 46:46.440
 And the Teamsters, and this goes back to the beginning,

46:46.440 --> 46:48.760
 and this goes back well before Hoffa,

46:48.760 --> 46:52.840
 back to the, you know, 1800s,

46:52.840 --> 46:55.840
 they understood that workers did better

46:55.840 --> 46:57.440
 if their employers did better.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.400
 And the only way the employers would do better

46:59.400 --> 47:01.800
 was if they controlled the market.

47:01.800 --> 47:04.520
 And so oftentimes the corruption in trucking

47:04.520 --> 47:07.720
 was initiated by employers who wanted to limit competition

47:07.720 --> 47:09.560
 and they knew they couldn't limit competition

47:09.560 --> 47:10.880
 without the support of labor.

47:10.880 --> 47:12.920
 And so you'd get these collusive arrangements

47:12.920 --> 47:17.280
 between employers and labor to say no new trucking companies.

47:17.280 --> 47:19.000
 There are 10 of us, that's enough.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.960
 We control Seattle, we're gonna set the price

47:21.960 --> 47:23.680
 and we're not gonna be undercut.

47:24.720 --> 47:27.200
 When there's a shortage of trucks around, it's great,

47:27.200 --> 47:30.160
 rates go up, but you get too many trucks.

47:30.160 --> 47:33.200
 It's very often that you end up operating at a loss

47:33.200 --> 47:35.400
 just to keep the doors open.

47:35.400 --> 47:36.520
 You know, you don't have any choice.

47:36.520 --> 47:39.520
 You can't, it's what economists called derived demand.

47:39.520 --> 47:41.720
 You can't like make up a bunch of trucking services

47:41.720 --> 47:43.040
 and store it in a warehouse, right?

47:43.040 --> 47:46.040
 You gotta keep those trucks moving to pay the bills.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.400
 Can we also lay out the kind of jobs that are in trucking?

47:50.400 --> 47:52.200
 What are the best jobs in trucking?

47:52.200 --> 47:53.760
 What are the worst jobs in trucking?

47:53.760 --> 47:56.880
 What are we, how many jobs are we talking about today?

47:56.880 --> 47:57.720
 Yeah.

47:57.720 --> 47:59.800
 And what kind of jobs are there?

48:00.880 --> 48:04.200
 So there are a number of different segments

48:04.200 --> 48:08.080
 and the first part would be, you know, are you offering,

48:08.080 --> 48:08.920
 the first question would be,

48:08.920 --> 48:11.280
 are you offering services to the public

48:11.280 --> 48:13.080
 or are you moving your own freight, right?

48:13.080 --> 48:17.680
 So are you a retailer, say Walmart or, you know,

48:17.680 --> 48:19.160
 a paper company or something like that

48:19.160 --> 48:22.080
 that's operating your own fleet of trucks?

48:22.080 --> 48:25.760
 That's private trucking.

48:25.760 --> 48:28.600
 For hire are the folks who, you know,

48:28.600 --> 48:31.080
 offer their services out to other customers.

48:31.080 --> 48:33.000
 So you have private and for hire.

48:33.000 --> 48:37.920
 In general, for hire pays less.

48:37.920 --> 48:40.400
 Is that because of the, something you talk about

48:40.400 --> 48:43.720
 with employee versus contractor situation

48:43.720 --> 48:48.720
 or are they all tricked or led to become contractors?

48:48.840 --> 48:52.040
 That can become a part of it as a strategy,

48:52.040 --> 48:54.840
 but the fundamental reason is competition.

48:54.840 --> 48:58.800
 So those private carriers aren't in competition

48:58.800 --> 49:00.320
 with other trucking fleets, right?

49:00.320 --> 49:02.160
 For their own in house services.

49:02.160 --> 49:05.440
 So, you know, they tend to, and this, you know,

49:05.440 --> 49:07.920
 the question of why private versus for hire

49:07.920 --> 49:09.840
 because for hire is cheaper, right?

49:09.840 --> 49:14.000
 And so if you need that, if that trucking service

49:14.000 --> 49:17.200
 is central to what you do and you cannot afford disruptions

49:17.200 --> 49:19.840
 or volatility in the price of it, you keep it in house.

49:19.840 --> 49:21.440
 You should be willing to pay more for that

49:21.440 --> 49:22.560
 because it's more valuable too

49:22.560 --> 49:23.840
 and you keep it in house and that.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.480
 So that's an interesting distinction.

49:25.480 --> 49:27.400
 What about, and this is kind of moving towards

49:27.400 --> 49:30.200
 our conversation of what can and can't be automated.

49:31.840 --> 49:36.160
 How else does it divide the different trucking jobs?

49:36.160 --> 49:38.160
 So the next big chunk is kind of

49:38.160 --> 49:40.320
 how much stuff are you moving, right?

49:40.320 --> 49:43.520
 And so we have what's called truckload

49:43.520 --> 49:45.960
 and truckload means, you know, you can fill up a trailer

49:45.960 --> 49:50.400
 either by volume or by weight and then less than truckload.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.560
 Less than truckload, the official definition

49:52.560 --> 49:54.280
 is like less than 10,000 pounds.

49:55.600 --> 49:57.360
 You know, this is gonna be a couple of pallets of this,

49:57.360 --> 49:58.720
 a couple of pallets of that.

49:58.720 --> 50:00.960
 The process looks really different, right?

50:00.960 --> 50:04.160
 So that truckload is, you know, point A to point B,

50:04.160 --> 50:08.480
 I'm buying, you know, a truckload of bounty paper towels,

50:08.480 --> 50:11.720
 I'm bringing it into, you know, my distribution center,

50:11.720 --> 50:13.880
 go pick it up at the bounty plant,

50:13.880 --> 50:15.640
 bring it to my distribution center, right?

50:15.640 --> 50:18.000
 Nowhere in between do you stop.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.520
 At least process that freight.

50:19.520 --> 50:22.800
 Less than truckload, what you've got is terminal systems.

50:22.800 --> 50:26.080
 And this is what you had under regulation too.

50:26.080 --> 50:27.880
 And so these terminal systems, what you do is you do

50:27.880 --> 50:29.600
 a bunch of local pickup and delivery,

50:29.600 --> 50:31.160
 maybe with smaller trucks,

50:32.000 --> 50:33.560
 and you pick up two pallets of this here,

50:33.560 --> 50:36.200
 four pallets of this there, you bring it to the terminal,

50:36.200 --> 50:38.360
 you combine it based on the destination,

50:38.360 --> 50:43.040
 you then create a full truckload, you know, trailer,

50:43.040 --> 50:44.560
 and you send it to another terminal

50:44.560 --> 50:46.000
 where it gets broken back down,

50:46.000 --> 50:47.960
 and then out for local delivery.

50:47.960 --> 50:52.240
 That's gonna look a lot like if you send a package by UPS,

50:52.240 --> 50:54.640
 right, they pick all these parcels, right,

50:54.640 --> 50:55.800
 figure out where they're all going,

50:55.800 --> 50:57.640
 put them on planes or in trailers

50:57.640 --> 50:58.720
 going to the same destination,

50:58.720 --> 50:59.720
 then break them out to put them

50:59.720 --> 51:01.440
 in what they call package cars.

51:01.440 --> 51:06.240
 So, before I ask you about autonomous trucks,

51:06.240 --> 51:09.840
 let's just pause for your experience as a trucker.

51:11.080 --> 51:12.480
 Did it get lonely?

51:12.480 --> 51:15.080
 Like, can you talk about some of your experiences

51:15.080 --> 51:16.760
 of what it was actually like?

51:16.760 --> 51:17.920
 Did it get lonely?

51:17.920 --> 51:21.280
 Yeah, no, I mean, it was, I didn't have kids at the time.

51:21.280 --> 51:23.520
 Now I have kids, I can't even imagine it.

51:25.640 --> 51:29.600
 You know, I've been married for five years at the time.

51:29.600 --> 51:31.800
 My wife hated it, I hated it.

51:31.800 --> 51:34.520
 You know, I describe in the book

51:34.520 --> 51:37.080
 the experience of being stuck,

51:37.080 --> 51:39.240
 if I remember correctly, it was like Ohio

51:40.280 --> 51:42.520
 at this truck stop in the middle of nowhere

51:42.520 --> 51:46.320
 and like, you know, sitting on this concrete barrier

51:46.320 --> 51:48.720
 and just watching fireworks in the distance

51:48.720 --> 51:51.960
 and like eating Chinese food on the 4th of July.

51:51.960 --> 51:55.480
 And you know, my wife calls me from like the family barbecue

51:55.480 --> 51:57.400
 and our anniversary is July 8th.

51:57.400 --> 51:59.080
 And she's like, are you gonna be home?

51:59.080 --> 52:01.760
 And I'm like, I don't know, you know.

52:03.200 --> 52:08.200
 I have a cousin whose husband drove truck

52:09.400 --> 52:12.000
 as a truck driver would say, drove truck for a while.

52:13.520 --> 52:15.360
 And he told me before I went into it,

52:15.360 --> 52:18.600
 he was like, the advantage you have is that you know

52:18.600 --> 52:21.000
 that you're not gonna be doing this long term.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.480
 Like, and Lex, I can't even like,

52:24.480 --> 52:27.800
 the emotional content of some of these interviews,

52:27.800 --> 52:30.440
 I mean, I would sit down at a truck stop with somebody

52:30.440 --> 52:33.920
 I had never met before and you know, you open the spicket

52:33.920 --> 52:37.560
 and the last question I would ask drivers

52:37.560 --> 52:40.720
 was that by the time I really sort of figured out

52:40.720 --> 52:43.160
 how to do it, the last question I would ask them is,

52:43.160 --> 52:45.800
 you know, what advice would you give to somebody,

52:45.800 --> 52:50.200
 like your nephew, you know, a family friend asks you

52:50.200 --> 52:52.200
 about what it's like to be a driver and should they do it?

52:52.200 --> 52:54.120
 What advice would you give them?

52:54.120 --> 52:57.120
 And this question, some of these, you know,

52:57.120 --> 53:00.800
 grizzled old drivers, you know, tough, tough guys,

53:00.800 --> 53:04.400
 would that question would like, some of them would break down

53:04.400 --> 53:06.920
 and they would say, I would say to them,

53:06.920 --> 53:08.680
 you better have everything

53:08.680 --> 53:11.680
 that you ever wanted in life already.

53:11.680 --> 53:15.280
 Because I've had a car that I've had for 10 years,

53:15.280 --> 53:17.080
 it's got 7,000 miles on it.

53:17.080 --> 53:21.800
 I own a boat that hasn't seen the water in five years.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.200
 My kids, I didn't raise them.

53:24.200 --> 53:27.360
 Like I'd be out for two weeks at a time,

53:27.360 --> 53:31.480
 I'd come home, my wife would give me two kids to punish,

53:31.480 --> 53:34.560
 a list of things to do, you know, on Saturday night

53:34.560 --> 53:37.400
 and I might leave out Sunday night or Monday morning.

53:37.400 --> 53:39.480
 You know, I come home dead tired,

53:39.480 --> 53:41.840
 my kids don't know who I am.

53:41.840 --> 53:43.840
 And you know, it was just like,

53:44.720 --> 53:46.920
 it was heartbreaking to hear those stories.

53:46.920 --> 53:49.400
 And then before you know it, you know,

53:49.400 --> 53:52.520
 life is short and just the years run away.

53:52.520 --> 53:54.840
 Yeah.

53:54.840 --> 53:56.600
 Hard question to ask in that context,

53:56.600 --> 53:58.440
 but what's the best,

53:58.440 --> 54:02.200
 what was the best part of being a truck driver?

54:04.120 --> 54:08.160
 Was there moments that you truly enjoyed on the road?

54:08.160 --> 54:09.000
 Oh, absolutely.

54:09.000 --> 54:13.120
 There was, there's definitely a pride and mastery of,

54:13.120 --> 54:14.600
 you know, even basic competence

54:14.600 --> 54:17.080
 of sort of piloting this thing safely.

54:17.080 --> 54:18.600
 There's a lot of responsibility to it.

54:18.600 --> 54:21.320
 That thing's dangerous and you know it.

54:21.320 --> 54:23.280
 So there's some pride there.

54:23.280 --> 54:26.320
 For me personally, and I know for a lot of other drivers,

54:26.320 --> 54:29.320
 it's just like seeing these behind the scenes places

54:29.320 --> 54:32.280
 that you know exist in our economy.

54:32.280 --> 54:35.840
 And I think we're all much more aware of them now

54:35.840 --> 54:38.960
 after COVID and supply chain mess that we have.

54:38.960 --> 54:40.360
 I don't know if we'll talk about that,

54:40.360 --> 54:42.800
 but you know, you get to see those places.

54:42.800 --> 54:44.320
 You know, you get to see those ports.

54:44.320 --> 54:47.840
 You get to see the place where they make the cardboard boxes

54:47.840 --> 54:49.600
 that the Huggies diapers go in.

54:49.600 --> 54:52.320
 Or the warehouse full of Bud Light.

54:52.320 --> 54:55.400
 I moved Bud Light from like upstate New York

54:55.400 --> 54:58.680
 and the first load like went to Atlanta, you know?

54:58.680 --> 55:00.240
 And then a couple months later,

55:00.240 --> 55:02.360
 I circled back through that same brewery

55:02.360 --> 55:07.040
 and I brought a load of Bud Light out to Michigan.

55:07.040 --> 55:09.720
 And I was like, holy shit, all the Bud Light,

55:09.720 --> 55:12.280
 like, you know, for this whole giant swath

55:12.280 --> 55:14.320
 of the United States comes from this one plant,

55:14.320 --> 55:16.560
 this cavernous plant with like kegs of beer.

55:16.560 --> 55:18.760
 And you see that part of the economy

55:18.760 --> 55:22.680
 and it's like, you're almost like you're an economic tourist.

55:22.680 --> 55:25.760
 And I think all, everybody kind of appreciates that.

55:25.760 --> 55:28.560
 Like kind of, it's almost like a behind the scenes tour.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.240
 That wears off after a few months, you know?

55:31.240 --> 55:34.320
 You start to see new things less and less frequently.

55:34.320 --> 55:37.240
 At first, everything's novel and sort of life on the road.

55:37.240 --> 55:40.600
 And then it becomes just endless miles of white lines

55:40.600 --> 55:43.000
 and yellow lines and truck stops.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.280
 And the days just blur together.

55:46.280 --> 55:47.760
 You know, it's one loading dock.

55:47.760 --> 55:49.640
 It's one loading dock after another.

55:49.640 --> 55:52.440
 So you lose the magic of being on the road.

55:52.440 --> 55:55.080
 Yeah, it's very rare the driver that doesn't.

55:58.320 --> 56:00.480
 You mentioned COVID and supply chain.

56:01.320 --> 56:04.880
 While being this, for a brief time,

56:04.880 --> 56:06.960
 this member of the supply chain,

56:06.960 --> 56:11.320
 what have you come to understand about our supply chain,

56:11.320 --> 56:14.800
 United States and global and its resilience

56:14.800 --> 56:18.680
 against strategies, catastrophic in the world?

56:18.680 --> 56:20.240
 Like COVID, for example.

56:20.240 --> 56:24.360
 Yeah, I mean, we have built really long,

56:24.360 --> 56:26.840
 really lean supply chains.

56:26.840 --> 56:30.400
 And just by definition, they're fragile.

56:31.520 --> 56:34.320
 You know, the current mess that we have,

56:34.320 --> 56:37.240
 it's not gonna clear by Christmas.

56:37.240 --> 56:39.960
 It will be lucky if it clears by next Christmas.

56:39.960 --> 56:42.000
 Can you describe the current mess in supply chain

56:42.000 --> 56:43.080
 that you're referring to?

56:43.080 --> 56:46.960
 Yeah, so we've got pile ups of ships

56:46.960 --> 56:50.240
 off the coast of California, Long Beach,

56:50.240 --> 56:54.840
 and LA in particular, in bad shape.

56:54.840 --> 56:56.880
 You know, last I checked, it was around 60 ships,

56:56.880 --> 57:00.560
 all of which are holding thousands of containers

57:00.560 --> 57:02.720
 full of stuff that retailers were hoping

57:02.720 --> 57:06.180
 was gonna be on shelves for the holiday season.

57:07.380 --> 57:10.460
 Meanwhile, the port itself has stacks and stacks

57:10.460 --> 57:12.760
 of containers that they can't get rid of.

57:12.760 --> 57:15.760
 The truckers aren't showing up to pick up

57:15.760 --> 57:17.560
 the containers that are there,

57:17.560 --> 57:21.620
 so they can't offload the ships that are waiting.

57:22.820 --> 57:26.240
 And why aren't the truckers picking it up?

57:26.240 --> 57:28.280
 Partly because there's a long history of inefficiency

57:28.280 --> 57:29.600
 in making them wait,

57:29.600 --> 57:31.940
 but it's because the warehouses are full.

57:31.940 --> 57:36.500
 So we've had all these perverse outcomes

57:36.500 --> 57:38.040
 that no one really expected.

57:38.040 --> 57:40.360
 Like in the middle of all these shortages,

57:40.360 --> 57:43.320
 people are stockpiling stuff.

57:43.320 --> 57:47.240
 So there are suppliers who used to keep two months

57:47.240 --> 57:50.640
 of supply of bottled water on hand.

57:50.640 --> 57:53.600
 And after going through COVID and not having supply

57:53.600 --> 57:55.520
 to send to their customers,

57:55.520 --> 57:58.280
 they're like, we need three months.

57:58.280 --> 58:02.520
 Well, our system is not designed for major storage of goods

58:02.520 --> 58:04.680
 to go up 50% in a category.

58:04.680 --> 58:05.720
 It's lean.

58:05.720 --> 58:07.040
 If you're a warehouse operator,

58:07.040 --> 58:08.660
 you know, you wanna be 90% plus.

58:08.660 --> 58:10.740
 You don't want a lot of open bays sitting around.

58:10.740 --> 58:15.740
 So we don't have 10% extra capacity in warehouses.

58:16.280 --> 58:18.080
 We don't have 10% of them.

58:18.080 --> 58:19.780
 Trucking capacity can fluctuate a bit,

58:19.780 --> 58:23.600
 but you don't have that kind of slack.

58:23.600 --> 58:26.000
 And now, I mean, and we saw this

58:26.000 --> 58:28.280
 right when people shifted consumption.

58:28.280 --> 58:32.760
 And I get a little mad when people talk about panic buying

58:32.760 --> 58:36.680
 as kind of the reason that we had all these shortages.

58:36.680 --> 58:40.320
 It really, like it's preventing us from understanding,

58:40.320 --> 58:42.360
 you know, the real problem there,

58:42.360 --> 58:44.940
 which is that lean supply chain.

58:44.940 --> 58:46.800
 Sure, there was some panic buying, you know,

58:46.800 --> 58:47.920
 no doubt about it,

58:47.920 --> 58:51.840
 but we had an enormous shift in people's behavior.

58:51.840 --> 58:55.320
 So with my sister and brother in law,

58:55.320 --> 58:58.560
 I own a couple of small businesses and we serve food, right?

58:58.560 --> 59:01.540
 So we get, you know, food from Cisco.

59:02.760 --> 59:04.720
 Cisco couldn't get rid of food, right?

59:04.720 --> 59:05.960
 Because nobody's eating out.

59:05.960 --> 59:09.520
 So they've got, you know, 50 pounds sacks of flour,

59:09.520 --> 59:11.080
 you know, sitting in their warehouse

59:11.080 --> 59:11.920
 that they can't get rid of.

59:11.920 --> 59:14.960
 They've got cases of lettuce and meat and everything else

59:14.960 --> 59:16.220
 that's just gonna go bad.

59:17.360 --> 59:20.800
 So that panic buying certainly exacerbated some things

59:20.800 --> 59:22.000
 like toilet paper and whatever,

59:22.000 --> 59:25.640
 but we saw just a massive change in demand.

59:25.640 --> 59:28.760
 And our supply chains are based on historical data, right?

59:28.760 --> 59:31.440
 So, you know, that stuff leaves Asia,

59:31.440 --> 59:34.480
 you know, months before you wanna have it on the shelves

59:34.480 --> 59:37.000
 and you're predicting based on last year, you know,

59:37.000 --> 59:39.820
 what you want on that shelf.

59:39.820 --> 59:43.280
 And so it's a, you know, I guess at its best,

59:43.280 --> 59:47.000
 it's a beautiful symphony of lots of moving parts,

59:48.520 --> 59:52.760
 but now everyone can't get on the same page of music.

59:52.760 --> 59:54.440
 But it's not resilient to changes

59:54.440 --> 59:59.440
 in on mass human behavior.

59:59.520 --> 1:00:03.400
 So even like I read somewhere,

1:00:03.400 --> 1:00:06.400
 maybe you can tell me if it's true in relation to food,

1:00:06.400 --> 1:00:08.280
 it's just the change of human behavior

1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:11.880
 between going out to restaurants versus eating at home.

1:00:11.880 --> 1:00:15.520
 As a species, we consume a lot less food that way.

1:00:15.520 --> 1:00:18.440
 Apparently what I read in restaurants,

1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:20.600
 like there's a lot of food just thrown out.

1:00:20.600 --> 1:00:23.080
 It's part of the business model.

1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:26.200
 And so like you then have to move a lot more food

1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:28.040
 through the whole supply chain.

1:00:28.040 --> 1:00:31.560
 And now because you're consuming, you know,

1:00:31.560 --> 1:00:32.900
 there's leftovers at home,

1:00:32.900 --> 1:00:37.160
 you're consuming much more of the food you're getting

1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:38.620
 when you're eating at home,

1:00:38.620 --> 1:00:41.000
 that's creating these bottleneck situations,

1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:42.540
 problems as you're referring to,

1:00:42.540 --> 1:00:45.240
 too much in a certain place, not enough in another place.

1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:47.880
 And it's just the supply chain is not robust

1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:52.880
 those kinds of dynamic shifts in who gets what where.

1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:54.140
 Yeah.

1:00:54.140 --> 1:00:57.440
 Yeah, I mean, so, and I have worked in agriculture a bit

1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:01.200
 on sort of the supply side, you know,

1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:03.120
 and there are product categories, right?

1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:07.440
 Where 30% of the crop raised does not get used, right?

1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:09.960
 Just gets plowed under or wasted.

1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:12.200
 But here's the importance of this

1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:14.440
 in sort of getting this right, you know, like that,

1:01:14.440 --> 1:01:16.540
 not that like panic buying, you know,

1:01:16.540 --> 1:01:18.960
 blame the irrational consumer, you know,

1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:21.240
 look at the hard sort of truth

1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:24.240
 of the way we've set up our economy.

1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:29.240
 And I'll ask you this, Lex, I know you're a hopeful,

1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:30.600
 optimistic person.

1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:31.940
 100%, yes.

1:01:31.940 --> 1:01:32.960
 Yeah, I am too.

1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:34.800
 I mean, I write about problems all the time.

1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:36.560
 And so people think I'm sort of like a,

1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:39.960
 just a Debbie Downer, you know, pessimist,

1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:43.080
 but I'm a glass half full kind of guy.

1:01:43.080 --> 1:01:47.360
 Like I want to identify problems so we can solve them.

1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:48.340
 So let me ask you this,

1:01:48.340 --> 1:01:52.020
 we've got these long lean supply chains.

1:01:52.020 --> 1:01:57.020
 In the future, do you see more environmental problems

1:01:57.020 --> 1:02:00.480
 that could disrupt them,

1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:05.480
 more geopolitical problems that could disrupt trade

1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:10.560
 from Asia, you know, other institutional failures?

1:02:10.920 --> 1:02:13.840
 Do those things seem, you know,

1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:16.280
 potentially more likely in the future

1:02:16.280 --> 1:02:18.640
 than they have been in say the last 20 years?

1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:21.860
 Yeah, it almost absolutely seems to be the case.

1:02:21.860 --> 1:02:24.400
 So you then have to ask the question of

1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:28.960
 how do we change our supply chains?

1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:31.040
 Whether it's making more resilient

1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:34.140
 or make them less densely connected,

1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:38.760
 you know, building a, it's like a, what is it?

1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:43.400
 You know, the Tesla model for in the automotive sector

1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:45.040
 of like trying to build everything,

1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:48.600
 like trying to get the factory to do as much as possible

1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:53.480
 with as little reliance on widely distributed sources

1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:55.000
 of the supply chain as possible.

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.640
 So maybe like rethinking how much we rely

1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:00.840
 on the infrastructure of the supply chain.

1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:03.760
 Yeah, I mean, you know, there's some basic,

1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:08.160
 and I assume, right, that there are a lot of folks

1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:10.600
 in corporate boardrooms looking at risk

1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:13.080
 and saying that didn't go well,

1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:15.140
 and maybe it could have even gone worse.

1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:19.720
 Maybe we need to think about reshoring, right?

1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:22.760
 At the very least, one of the things

1:03:22.760 --> 1:03:24.120
 that I'm hearing about anecdotally

1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:26.320
 is that they're starting stuff up, you know,

1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:28.080
 when they can, right?

1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:31.360
 Which is, that's probably not sustainable, right?

1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:34.080
 I mean, at some point, somebody in that corporate boardroom

1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:36.660
 is gonna say, you know, guys, inventory is getting

1:03:36.660 --> 1:03:38.160
 kind of heavy and the cost of that is like,

1:03:38.160 --> 1:03:40.040
 do we, can we really justify that much longer

1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:41.780
 to the shareholders, right?

1:03:41.780 --> 1:03:43.560
 We can back off and start, you know,

1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:45.520
 back, things are back to normal, let's lean out.

1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:48.400
 Well, my hope is that there's a technology solution

1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:49.600
 to a lot of aspects of this.

1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:51.440
 So one of them on the supply chain side

1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:53.080
 is collecting a lot more data,

1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:57.040
 like having much more integrated

1:03:57.040 --> 1:03:59.380
 and accurate representation of the inventory

1:03:59.380 --> 1:04:00.680
 all over the place,

1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:03.400
 and the available transportation mechanisms,

1:04:03.400 --> 1:04:06.080
 the trucks, the all kinds of freight,

1:04:06.080 --> 1:04:08.660
 and how in the different models

1:04:08.660 --> 1:04:13.240
 of the possible catastrophes that can happen,

1:04:14.660 --> 1:04:15.960
 like how will the system respond?

1:04:15.960 --> 1:04:19.300
 So having a really solid model that you're operating under

1:04:19.300 --> 1:04:23.500
 as opposed to just kind of being in emergency response mode

1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:26.160
 under poor, incomplete information,

1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:30.480
 which is what seems like is more commonly the case,

1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:34.100
 except for things like you said, Walmart and Amazon,

1:04:34.100 --> 1:04:36.740
 they're trying to internally get their stuff together

1:04:36.740 --> 1:04:38.640
 on that front, but that doesn't help

1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:40.240
 the rest of the economy.

1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:44.920
 So another exciting technological development

1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:48.080
 as you write about, as you think about is autonomous trucks.

1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:52.320
 So these are often brought up in different contexts

1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:57.320
 as the examples of AI and robots taking our jobs.

1:04:57.440 --> 1:04:58.720
 How true is this?

1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:00.300
 Should we be concerned?

1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:03.760
 I think they've really come to epitomize

1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:06.400
 this anxiety over automation, right?

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:09.560
 It's such a simple idea, right?

1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:11.800
 Truck that drives itself,

1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:15.240
 classic blue collar job that pays well,

1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:20.240
 guy maybe with not a lot of other good options, right?

1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:22.840
 To sort of make that same income easily,

1:05:23.720 --> 1:05:27.380
 and you build a robot to take his job away, right?

1:05:28.700 --> 1:05:32.420
 So I think 2016 or so,

1:05:32.420 --> 1:05:35.280
 that was the sort of big question out there,

1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:38.380
 and that's actually how I started studying it, right?

1:05:38.380 --> 1:05:40.080
 I just wrapped up the book,

1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:43.200
 just so happened that somebody was working at Uber,

1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:45.760
 Uber had just bought auto, saw the book and was like,

1:05:45.760 --> 1:05:48.840
 hey, can you come out and talk to our engineering teams

1:05:48.840 --> 1:05:51.760
 about what life is like for truck drivers

1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:54.700
 and maybe how our technology could make it better.

1:05:54.700 --> 1:05:58.620
 And at that time, there were a lot of different ideas

1:05:58.620 --> 1:06:00.220
 about how they were gonna play out, right?

1:06:00.220 --> 1:06:03.400
 So while the press was saying,

1:06:03.400 --> 1:06:05.280
 all truckers are gonna lose their jobs,

1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:08.120
 there were a lot of people in these engineering teams

1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:11.240
 who thought, okay, if we've got an individual owner operator

1:06:11.240 --> 1:06:15.920
 and they can only drive eight or 10 hours a day,

1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:19.880
 they hop in the back, they get their rest,

1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:23.000
 and the asset that they own works for them, right?

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:24.740
 Sort of perfect, right?

1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:28.620
 And at that time, there were a bunch of reports

1:06:28.620 --> 1:06:30.480
 that came out and sort of basically what people did

1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:33.080
 was they took the category of truck driver.

1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:35.840
 Some people took a larger category from BLS

1:06:35.840 --> 1:06:37.640
 of sales and delivery workers

1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:40.180
 that was about three and a half million workers

1:06:40.180 --> 1:06:43.560
 and others took the heavy duty truck driver category,

1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:46.720
 which was at the time about 1.8 million or so.

1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:49.400
 And they picked a start date and a slope

1:06:49.400 --> 1:06:52.280
 and said, let's assume that all these jobs

1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:53.480
 are just gonna disappear.

1:06:53.480 --> 1:06:57.560
 And really smart researcher, Annette Bernhardt

1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:00.680
 at the Labor Center at UC Berkeley

1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:03.720
 was sort of looking around for people

1:07:03.720 --> 1:07:06.600
 who were sort of deeply into industries

1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:10.240
 to complicate those analyses, right?

1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:11.660
 And reached out to me and was like,

1:07:11.660 --> 1:07:12.540
 what do you think of this?

1:07:12.540 --> 1:07:15.240
 And I said, the industry is super diverse.

1:07:15.240 --> 1:07:17.920
 I haven't given a ton of thought, but it can't be that.

1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:21.200
 It's not that simple, it never is.

1:07:21.200 --> 1:07:23.800
 And so she was like, will you do this?

1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:26.280
 And I was like ready to move on to another topic.

1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:28.720
 I had like been in trucking for 10 years

1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:31.000
 and that's how I started looking at it.

1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.640
 And it is, it's a lot more complicated.

1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:38.560
 And the initial impacts, and here's the challenge I think,

1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:40.640
 and it's not just a research challenge,

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:43.600
 it's the fundamental public policy challenge

1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:46.920
 is we look at the existing industry

1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:50.040
 and the impacts, the potential impacts,

1:07:50.040 --> 1:07:53.040
 they're not, you know, nothing.

1:07:53.040 --> 1:07:56.240
 For some communities and some kinds of drivers,

1:07:56.240 --> 1:07:57.200
 they're gonna be hard.

1:07:57.200 --> 1:07:59.280
 And there are a significant number of them.

1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:00.920
 Nowhere near what people thought.

1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:04.280
 You know, I estimate it's like around 300,000,

1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:08.060
 but that's a static picture of the existing industry.

1:08:08.060 --> 1:08:13.060
 And here's the key with this is, at least in my conclusion

1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:17.060
 is this is a transformative technology.

1:08:17.060 --> 1:08:20.860
 We are not going to swap in self driving trucks

1:08:20.860 --> 1:08:24.200
 for human driven trucks and all else stays the same.

1:08:24.200 --> 1:08:27.420
 This is gonna reshape our supply chains.

1:08:27.420 --> 1:08:29.360
 It's gonna reshape landscapes.

1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:32.440
 It's gonna affect our ability to fight climate change.

1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:37.680
 This is a really important technology in this space.

1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:40.140
 Do you think it's possible to predict the future

1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:44.400
 of the kind of opportunities it will create,

1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:46.720
 how it will change the world?

1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:48.520
 So like when you have the internet,

1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:53.120
 you can start saying like all the kinds of ways

1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:55.420
 that office work, all jobs will be lost

1:08:55.420 --> 1:08:57.040
 because it's easy to network.

1:08:57.040 --> 1:08:59.760
 And then software engineering allows you to automate

1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:03.320
 a lot of the tasks like Microsoft Excel does, you know.

1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:08.040
 But it opened up so many opportunities,

1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:10.220
 even with things that are difficult to imagine,

1:09:10.220 --> 1:09:12.680
 like with the internet, I don't know, Wikipedia,

1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:15.920
 which is widely making accessible information.

1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:20.920
 And that increased the general education globally by a lot,

1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:22.760
 all those kinds of things.

1:09:22.760 --> 1:09:25.400
 And then the ripple effects of that

1:09:25.400 --> 1:09:29.080
 in terms of your ability to find other jobs

1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:31.000
 is probably immeasurable.

1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.720
 So is it just a hopeless pursuit to try to predict

1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.480
 if you talk about these six different trajectories

1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:44.360
 that we might take in automating trucks,

1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:47.660
 but like as a result of taking those trajectories,

1:09:47.660 --> 1:09:49.180
 is it a hopeless pursuit to predict

1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:50.840
 what the future will result in?

1:09:50.840 --> 1:09:52.160
 Yeah, it is.

1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:54.680
 It absolutely is.

1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:56.900
 Because it's the wrong question.

1:09:56.900 --> 1:09:59.280
 The question is, what do we want the future to be

1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:01.960
 and let's shape it, right?

1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:06.000
 And I think this is, and this is the only point

1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.360
 that I really wanna make in my work

1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:10.240
 for the foreseeable future,

1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:15.240
 is that we have got to get out of this mindset

1:10:16.500 --> 1:10:20.400
 that we're just gonna let technology kind of go

1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:22.520
 and it's a natural process and whatever pops out

1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:24.360
 will fix the problems on the backside.

1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:28.160
 And we've got to recognize that one,

1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:30.920
 that's not what we do, right?

1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:33.320
 You know, and self driving vehicles

1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:35.120
 is just such a perfect example, right?

1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:37.200
 We would not be sitting here today

1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:38.520
 if the Defense Department, right?

1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:43.520
 If Congress in 2000 had not written into legislation

1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:46.760
 funding for the DARPA challenges,

1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:49.080
 which followed, actually I think the funding came

1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:50.060
 a couple of years later,

1:10:50.060 --> 1:10:52.040
 but the priority that they wrote in 2000

1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:55.540
 was let's get a third of all ground vehicles

1:10:55.540 --> 1:10:58.440
 in our military forces unmanned, right?

1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:01.440
 And this was before aerial unmanned vehicles

1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:02.840
 had really sort of proven their worth.

1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:04.480
 They would come to be incredibly,

1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:07.880
 like, you know, just blow people's minds

1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:09.760
 in terms of their additional capabilities,

1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:10.880
 the lower costs, you know,

1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:13.680
 keeping soldiers out of harm's way.

1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:15.480
 Now, of course they raised other problems

1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:17.640
 and considerations that I think we're still wrestling with,

1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:21.140
 but that was even before that they had this priority.

1:11:21.140 --> 1:11:22.720
 We would not be sitting here today

1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:26.500
 if Congress in 2000 had not said, let's bring this about.

1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:29.080
 So they already had that vision, actually.

1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:30.020
 I didn't know about that.

1:11:30.020 --> 1:11:32.700
 So for people who don't know the DARPA challenges

1:11:32.700 --> 1:11:36.320
 is the events that were just kind of like

1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:39.640
 these seemingly small scale challenges

1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:41.800
 that brought together some of the smartest roboticists

1:11:41.800 --> 1:11:45.480
 in the world, and that somehow created enough of a magic

1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:49.000
 where ideas flourished,

1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.600
 both engineering and scientific,

1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:54.700
 that eventually then was the catalyst

1:11:54.700 --> 1:11:56.320
 for creating all these different companies

1:11:56.320 --> 1:11:57.200
 that took on the challenge.

1:11:57.200 --> 1:11:58.800
 Some failed, some succeeded,

1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:01.040
 some are still fighting the good fight.

1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:03.440
 And that somehow just that little bit of challenge

1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:07.420
 was the essential spark of progress

1:12:07.420 --> 1:12:10.840
 that now resulted in this beautiful up and down wave

1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:15.180
 of hype and profit and all this kind of weird dance

1:12:15.180 --> 1:12:18.080
 where the B word, billions of dollars

1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:21.120
 have been thrown around and we still don't know.

1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:23.380
 And the T word, trillions of dollars

1:12:23.380 --> 1:12:25.700
 in terms of transformative effects of autonomous vehicles.

1:12:25.700 --> 1:12:27.360
 And all that started from DARPA

1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:31.320
 and that initial vision of, I guess, as you're saying,

1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:35.320
 of automating part of the military supply chain.

1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:36.240
 I did not know that.

1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:37.080
 That's interesting.

1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:39.940
 So they had the same kind of vision for the military

1:12:39.940 --> 1:12:43.340
 as we're not talking about a vision for the civilian,

1:12:43.340 --> 1:12:45.740
 whether it's trucking or whether it's autonomous vehicle,

1:12:45.740 --> 1:12:48.400
 sort of a ride sharing kind of application.

1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:51.880
 Yeah, I mean, what an incredible spark, right?

1:12:53.100 --> 1:12:57.760
 And just the story of what it produced, right?

1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:01.260
 I mean, your own work on self driving, right?

1:13:01.260 --> 1:13:04.120
 I mean, you've studied it as an academic, right?

1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:08.460
 How many great researchers and minds have been harnessed

1:13:08.460 --> 1:13:11.340
 by this outcome of that spark, right?

1:13:11.340 --> 1:13:14.200
 And I think this is sort of theoretically about technology,

1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:15.920
 right, this is what makes it sort of so great

1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:18.480
 is that this is what makes us human, in my opinion, right?

1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:21.360
 Is that you conceive of something in your mind

1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:23.580
 and then you bring it into reality, right?

1:13:23.580 --> 1:13:26.560
 I mean, that's what is so great about it.

1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:29.880
 Sometimes you're too dumb to realize how difficult it is

1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:30.720
 so you take it.

1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:31.960
 Right.

1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:36.760
 And then eventually you're in too deep.

1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:38.760
 You might as well solve the problem.

1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:41.360
 Well, and maybe we're in that situation right now

1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:42.320
 with self driving.

1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:44.320
 But, you know, and so let me throw this out there.

1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:46.340
 I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on it.

1:13:46.340 --> 1:13:50.160
 But truck drivers always ask me, like, is this for real?

1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:52.840
 Like, is this really, like, it's harder than they think,

1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:55.760
 like, right, and they can't really do this.

1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:59.320
 And, you know, at first I was like, look, you know,

1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:01.560
 this is like the defense department

1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:04.320
 and like basically the top computer science

1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:07.740
 and robotics departments in the world.

1:14:07.740 --> 1:14:12.740
 And now Silicon Valley with billions of dollars in funding

1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:17.380
 and just, you know, some of the smartest, hardest working,

1:14:17.380 --> 1:14:21.200
 most visionary people focused on what is clearly,

1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:24.660
 you know, a gigantic market, right?

1:14:24.660 --> 1:14:26.780
 And what I tell them is like,

1:14:26.780 --> 1:14:31.200
 if self driving vehicles don't happen,

1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:34.640
 I think this will be the biggest technology failure story

1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:35.680
 in human history.

1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:39.880
 I don't know of anything else that is just galvanized.

1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:42.800
 I mean, you've had people in garages or weird inventors

1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:44.960
 work on things their whole lives and come really close

1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:48.140
 and it never happens and it's a great failure story, right?

1:14:48.140 --> 1:14:50.320
 But never have we had like whole,

1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:53.040
 I mean, we're talking about GM, right?

1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:55.840
 And these are not, you know, these are not tech companies,

1:14:55.840 --> 1:14:58.200
 right, these are industrial giants, right?

1:14:58.200 --> 1:15:00.440
 What were in the 20th century,

1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:03.240
 the pinnacle of industrial production in the world

1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:05.280
 in human history, right?

1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:07.280
 And they're focused on it now.

1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:11.320
 So if we don't pull this off, it's like, wow.

1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:12.560
 It's fascinating to think about.

1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:14.500
 I've never thought of it that way.

1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:18.400
 There was a mass hysteria on a level

1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:20.640
 in terms of excitement and hype

1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:23.640
 on a level that's probably unparalleled in technology space.

1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:26.400
 Like I've seen that kind of hysteria just studying history

1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:28.740
 when you talk about military conflict.

1:15:28.740 --> 1:15:32.680
 So we often wage war with a dream of making a better world

1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:34.800
 and then realize it costs trillions of dollars

1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:37.800
 and then we step back and like, and go, wait a minute,

1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:40.120
 what do we actually get for this?

1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:41.600
 But in the space of technology,

1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:44.080
 it seems like all these kinds of large efforts

1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:45.620
 have paid off.

1:15:45.620 --> 1:15:47.100
 This, you're right.

1:15:47.100 --> 1:15:51.360
 It seems like, it seems like even GM and Ford

1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:54.520
 and all these companies now are a little bit like,

1:15:54.520 --> 1:15:58.720
 hey, or Toyota and even Tesla,

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:01.800
 like, are we sure about this?

1:16:01.800 --> 1:16:02.640
 Yeah.

1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:04.320
 And it's fascinating to think about

1:16:04.320 --> 1:16:06.100
 when you tell the story of this,

1:16:06.100 --> 1:16:10.120
 this could be one of the big first, perhaps,

1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:14.120
 but by far the biggest failures of the dream

1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:16.200
 in the space of technology.

1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:17.880
 That's really interesting to think about.

1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:19.840
 I was a skeptic for a long time

1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:22.880
 because of the human factor.

1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:25.160
 Because for business to work in the space,

1:16:25.160 --> 1:16:26.320
 you have to work with humans

1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:29.240
 and you have to work with humans at every level.

1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:30.520
 So in the truck driving space,

1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:32.480
 you have to work with the truck driver,

1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:34.320
 but you also have to work with the society

1:16:34.320 --> 1:16:37.000
 that has a certain conception of what driving means.

1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:38.760
 And also you have to have work with businesses

1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:43.760
 that are not used to this extreme level of technology,

1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:48.620
 you know, in the basic operation of their business.

1:16:48.620 --> 1:16:50.120
 So I thought it would be really difficult

1:16:50.120 --> 1:16:53.160
 to move to autonomous vehicles in that way.

1:16:53.160 --> 1:16:56.200
 But then I realized that there's certain companies

1:16:56.200 --> 1:16:58.960
 that are just willing to take big risks

1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:00.280
 and really innovate.

1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:04.320
 I think the first impressive company to me was Waymo

1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:07.000
 or what was used to be the Google self driving car.

1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:11.080
 And I saw, okay, here's a company

1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:13.480
 that's willing to really think longterm

1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:17.240
 and really try to solve this problem, hire great engineers.

1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:22.640
 Then I saw Tesla with Mobileye when they first had.

1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:25.760
 I thought, actually Mobileye is the thing that impressed me.

1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:27.160
 When I sat down, I thought,

1:17:27.160 --> 1:17:28.400
 because I'm a computer vision person,

1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:33.400
 I thought there's no way a system could keep me in lane

1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:36.680
 long enough for it to be a pleasant experience for me.

1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:38.120
 So from a computer vision perspective,

1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:39.520
 I thought there'd be too many failures.

1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:40.640
 It'd be really annoying.

1:17:40.640 --> 1:17:42.280
 It'd be a gimmick, a toy.

1:17:42.280 --> 1:17:44.840
 It wouldn't actually create a pleasant experience.

1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:47.520
 And when I first was gotten Tesla with Mobileye,

1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:49.080
 the initial Mobileye system,

1:17:49.080 --> 1:17:52.560
 it actually held to lane for quite a long time

1:17:52.560 --> 1:17:54.560
 to where I could relax a little bit.

1:17:54.560 --> 1:17:56.080
 And it was a really pleasant experience.

1:17:56.080 --> 1:17:58.600
 I couldn't exactly explain why it's pleasant

1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:01.080
 because it's not like I still have to really pay attention,

1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:03.200
 but I can relax my shoulders a little bit.

1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:07.000
 I can look around a little bit more.

1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:10.600
 And for some reason that was really reducing the stress.

1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:15.000
 And then over time, Tesla with a lot of the revolutionary

1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.400
 stuff they're doing on the machine learning space

1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:22.000
 made me believe that there's opportunities here to innovate,

1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:23.840
 to come up with totally new ideas.

1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:27.720
 Another very sad story that I was really excited about

1:18:27.720 --> 1:18:29.520
 is Cadillac SuperCruise system.

1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:32.880
 It is a sad story because I think I vaguely read in the news

1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:36.120
 they just said they're discontinuing SuperCruise,

1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:39.040
 but it's a nice innovative way

1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:41.320
 of doing driver attention monitoring

1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:43.280
 and also doing lane keeping.

1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:45.680
 And it just innovation could solve this

1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:47.360
 in ways we don't predict.

1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:49.600
 And same with in the trucking space,

1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:52.760
 it might not be as simple as like journalists envision

1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:55.680
 a few years ago, where everything's just automated.

1:18:55.680 --> 1:19:00.120
 It might be gradually helping out the truck driver

1:19:00.120 --> 1:19:03.360
 in some ways that make their life more efficient,

1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:05.920
 more effective, more pleasant,

1:19:07.720 --> 1:19:09.240
 remove some of the inefficiencies

1:19:09.240 --> 1:19:12.520
 that we've been talking about in totally innovative ways.

1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:14.840
 And that I still have that dream

1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:18.680
 that I believe to solve the fully autonomous driving problem

1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:20.400
 we're still many years away,

1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:22.880
 but on the way to solving that problem,

1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:25.040
 it feels like there could be,

1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:29.400
 if there's bold risk takers and innovators in this space,

1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:30.760
 there's an opportunity to come up

1:19:30.760 --> 1:19:35.760
 with like subtle technologies that make all the difference.

1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:38.840
 That's actually just what I realized

1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:41.400
 is sometimes little design decisions

1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:42.920
 make all the difference.

1:19:42.920 --> 1:19:45.080
 It's the Blackberry versus the iPhone.

1:19:45.080 --> 1:19:50.080
 Why is it that you have a glass and you're using your finger

1:19:50.760 --> 1:19:52.800
 for all of the work versus the buttons

1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:54.280
 makes all the difference.

1:19:54.280 --> 1:19:57.200
 This idea that now that you have a giant screen

1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:00.120
 so that every part of the experience

1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:01.960
 is now a digital experience.

1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:05.040
 So you can have things like apps that change everything.

1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:07.600
 You can't, when you first thinking about

1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:10.120
 do I want a keyboard or not on a smartphone,

1:20:10.120 --> 1:20:13.360
 you think it's just the keyboard decision.

1:20:13.360 --> 1:20:17.840
 But then you later realize by removing the keyboard,

1:20:17.840 --> 1:20:21.920
 you're enabling a whole ecosystem of technologies

1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:23.120
 that are inside the phone.

1:20:23.120 --> 1:20:25.480
 And now you're making the smartphone into a computer.

1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:27.360
 And that same way,

1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:30.480
 who knows how you can transform trucks, right?

1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:32.520
 By like automating some parts of it,

1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:36.480
 maybe adding some displays,

1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:37.640
 maybe allows you to,

1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:40.840
 maybe giving the truck driver some control

1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:43.160
 in the supply chain to make decisions

1:20:43.160 --> 1:20:44.440
 all those kinds of things.

1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:45.800
 Yeah.

1:20:45.800 --> 1:20:46.960
 So, I don't know.

1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:51.640
 So where are you on the spectrum of hope

1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:55.280
 for the role of automation in trucking?

1:20:56.960 --> 1:20:59.520
 I think automation is inevitable.

1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:04.520
 And again, I think this is really going to be transformative

1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:06.160
 and it's gonna be,

1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:09.680
 I've studied the history of trucking technology

1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:11.000
 as much as I can.

1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:12.960
 There's not a lot of great stuff written

1:21:12.960 --> 1:21:14.960
 and you kind of have to,

1:21:14.960 --> 1:21:16.880
 there isn't a lot of data and places to know

1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:19.240
 sort of volumes of stuff and how they're changing, et cetera.

1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:24.240
 But the big revolutionary changes in trucking

1:21:24.480 --> 1:21:27.960
 are because of constellations of factors.

1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:29.640
 It's not just one thing, right?

1:21:29.640 --> 1:21:32.040
 So Daimler builds a motorized truck

1:21:32.040 --> 1:21:35.320
 and I think it's 1896, right?

1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:37.560
 Intercity trucking.

1:21:37.560 --> 1:21:39.080
 So basically what they use that truck for

1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:41.800
 is just to swap out horses, right?

1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:42.960
 They basically do the same thing.

1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:45.960
 The service doesn't really change, you know?

1:21:45.960 --> 1:21:48.760
 And then World War I really spurs the development

1:21:48.760 --> 1:21:50.720
 of sort of bigger, larger trucks,

1:21:50.720 --> 1:21:54.600
 like spreads air filled tires.

1:21:54.600 --> 1:21:57.880
 And then we start paving roads, right?

1:21:57.880 --> 1:22:00.440
 And paved roads, right?

1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:04.440
 Air filled tires and the internal combustion engine.

1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:05.720
 Now you got a winning mix.

1:22:05.720 --> 1:22:09.360
 Now it met with demand for people who wanted to get out

1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:12.160
 from under the thumb of the railroads, right?

1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:14.680
 So there was all of this pent up demand

1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:18.360
 to get cheaper freight from the countryside

1:22:18.360 --> 1:22:20.760
 into cities and between cities

1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:22.800
 that typically had to go by rail.

1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:25.840
 And so now, you know, 40 years

1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:28.320
 after that internal combustion engine,

1:22:28.320 --> 1:22:30.960
 it becomes this absolutely essential, right?

1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:34.320
 This necessary but not sufficient piece of technology

1:22:34.320 --> 1:22:38.840
 to create the modern trucking industry in the 1930s.

1:22:38.840 --> 1:22:41.600
 And I think self driving is gonna be,

1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:43.600
 self driving trucks are gonna be part of that.

1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:47.640
 And the idea, I guess we credit Jeff Bezos.

1:22:47.640 --> 1:22:52.240
 The idea is, you know, okay, so Sam Walton,

1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:54.000
 if we can do it like a slight tangent

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:57.000
 on sort of the importance of trucking to business strategy

1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.520
 and sort of how it has transformed our world.

1:23:00.760 --> 1:23:03.440
 The central insight that Sam Walton had

1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:06.120
 that made him the giant that he was

1:23:06.120 --> 1:23:10.440
 in influencing the way that so many people get stuff

1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:12.560
 was a trucking insight.

1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:17.560
 And so if you look at the way that he developed his system,

1:23:17.840 --> 1:23:19.600
 you build a distribution center

1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:22.360
 and then you ring it with stores.

1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:24.960
 Those stores are never further out

1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:26.200
 from that distribution center

1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:28.040
 than a human driven truck

1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:30.800
 can drive back and forth in one day.

1:23:31.760 --> 1:23:34.880
 And so rather than the way all of his competitors

1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:37.920
 were doing it with sending trucks all over the place

1:23:37.920 --> 1:23:39.480
 and having people sleep overnight

1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:43.240
 and sort of making the trucking service fit

1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:45.200
 where they had stores,

1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:48.280
 he designed the layout of the stores

1:23:49.320 --> 1:23:51.360
 to fit what trucks could do.

1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:53.920
 And so transportation and logistics

1:23:53.920 --> 1:23:57.320
 become Walmart's edge

1:23:57.320 --> 1:23:59.360
 and allows them to dominate the space.

1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:02.040
 That's the challenge that Amazon has now.

1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:05.720
 They've mastered the digital part of it.

1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:07.480
 And now they got to figure out

1:24:07.480 --> 1:24:11.600
 how do we dominate the actual physical movement

1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:14.240
 that complements that.

1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:16.680
 Others are obviously gonna follow.

1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:18.800
 But the capabilities of these trucks

1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:20.440
 is completely different

1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:22.840
 than the capability of a human driven truck.

1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:25.760
 So if you're Smith packing

1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:30.240
 and you've got a bunch of meat in a warehouse

1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:33.800
 and it's going to grocery distribution centers,

1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:37.280
 you have that trucker probably come in the night before

1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:38.360
 and you make him wait

1:24:38.360 --> 1:24:41.440
 so that he has a full 10 hour break,

1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:42.680
 which is what the law requires

1:24:42.680 --> 1:24:45.680
 so that he can get to the furthest reaches

1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:48.240
 that he can of one of those stores.

1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:50.440
 So he can drive his full 11 hours

1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:51.600
 and bring that meat

1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:53.280
 so it doesn't have to sit overnight

1:24:53.280 --> 1:24:55.480
 in that refrigerated trailer.

1:24:55.480 --> 1:24:57.440
 And so their system is based on that.

1:24:57.440 --> 1:25:00.680
 Now, what happens when that truck

1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:04.120
 can now travel two times as far, right?

1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:05.840
 Three times as far.

1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:08.800
 Now you don't need the warehouses where they were.

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:11.680
 Now you can go super lean with your inventory.

1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:14.440
 Instead of having meat here, meat there, meat there,

1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:16.200
 you can put it all right here.

1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:18.120
 And if it's cheap enough,

1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:20.360
 substitute those transportation costs

1:25:20.360 --> 1:25:22.400
 for all that warehousing costs, right?

1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:24.680
 So this is gonna remake landscapes

1:25:24.680 --> 1:25:29.240
 in the same way that big box supply chains did, right?

1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:32.920
 And then of course, the further compliment of that is,

1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:37.600
 how do you then get it to two people at their door, right?

1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:39.480
 And the big box supply chain,

1:25:39.480 --> 1:25:44.280
 it moves very few items in really large quantities

1:25:44.280 --> 1:25:48.360
 to very few locations pretty slowly, right?

1:25:49.440 --> 1:25:53.640
 Ecommerce aspires to do something completely different,

1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:57.720
 move huge varieties of things in small quantities,

1:25:57.720 --> 1:26:01.080
 virtually everywhere as fast as possible, right?

1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:05.560
 And so that is like that intercity trucking

1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:10.360
 under the, in the era of railroad monopolies, right?

1:26:10.360 --> 1:26:14.240
 The demand for that is potentially enormous, right?

1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:16.840
 And so there's such a,

1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:20.400
 so right now I think a lot of the business plans

1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:22.200
 for sort of automated trucks, right?

1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:24.920
 And sort of the way that the journalistic accounts portray it

1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:28.720
 is like, okay, if we swap out a human for a computer,

1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:30.280
 what are the labor costs per mile?

1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:31.800
 And like, oh, here's the profitability

1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:34.200
 of self driving trucks, uh uh.

1:26:34.200 --> 1:26:36.320
 Like this is transformative technology.

1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:39.040
 We're gonna change the way we get stuff.

1:26:39.040 --> 1:26:41.920
 So we could actually get a lot more trucks period

1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:43.160
 with like with autonomous trucks

1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:45.840
 because they would enable a very different kind

1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:47.560
 of transportation networks you think.

1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:50.240
 Yeah, here's, and this is where it's like, uh oh.

1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:54.640
 Like, yeah, so we really thought

1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:57.400
 we were gonna be electrifying trucks.

1:26:57.400 --> 1:26:59.040
 If they're going twice as far,

1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:01.480
 if they're moving three times as much,

1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:03.320
 if they're going three times as far, right?

1:27:03.320 --> 1:27:05.480
 What does that mean for how far we are

1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:06.800
 behind on batteries, right?

1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:09.360
 We've got sort of these, you know, ideas about like, man,

1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:10.360
 we, you know, here's how far,

1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:12.800
 how close we could get to meet this demand.

1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:15.040
 That demand is gonna radically change, right?

1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:17.720
 These trucks are, you know, so then we've got to think

1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:20.720
 about, all right, if it's not batteries, you know,

1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:22.600
 how are we powering these things?

1:27:22.600 --> 1:27:25.280
 And how many of them are they're gonna be?

1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:28.440
 Like right now we've got 5 million containers

1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:33.440
 that move from LA and Long Beach to Chicago on rail.

1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:38.520
 Rail is three or four times at least more efficient

1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:42.600
 than trucks in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.

1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:45.720
 And on that lane, it varies a lot depending on demand,

1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:50.040
 but maybe rail has a 20% advantage in cost, maybe 25%,

1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:52.120
 but it's a couple of days slower.

1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:54.600
 So now you cut the cost of that truck,

1:27:54.600 --> 1:27:57.480
 transportation per mile by 30%.

1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:00.640
 Now it's cheaper than rail and it gets the stuff there

1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:02.520
 five days faster than rail.

1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:05.640
 How many millions of containers are gonna leave LA

1:28:05.640 --> 1:28:08.840
 and Long Beach on self driving trucks and go to Chicago?

1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:10.920
 And it might look very much like a train

1:28:10.920 --> 1:28:14.060
 if we go with the platooning solution,

1:28:14.060 --> 1:28:18.540
 where you have these rows of like,

1:28:18.540 --> 1:28:21.660
 imagine like rows of like 10, like dozens of trucks

1:28:21.660 --> 1:28:25.180
 or like hundreds of trucks, like some absurd situation.

1:28:25.180 --> 1:28:29.620
 Just going from LA to Chicago, just this train,

1:28:29.620 --> 1:28:31.780
 but taking up a highway.

1:28:31.780 --> 1:28:34.780
 I mean, this is probably a good place

1:28:34.780 --> 1:28:37.980
 to talk about various scenarios.

1:28:37.980 --> 1:28:39.300
 Well, before we get there,

1:28:39.300 --> 1:28:41.740
 can I just make one interesting observation

1:28:41.740 --> 1:28:44.820
 that I made as a driver?

1:28:44.820 --> 1:28:46.620
 When you're in a truck, you're up higher.

1:28:46.620 --> 1:28:50.020
 So you can see further and you can see the traffic patterns

1:28:50.020 --> 1:28:54.140
 and cars move in packs.

1:28:54.140 --> 1:28:56.460
 I'm sure there's academic research on this, right?

1:28:56.460 --> 1:28:57.340
 But they move in packs.

1:28:57.340 --> 1:28:59.620
 They kind of bunch up behind a slower car

1:28:59.620 --> 1:29:01.200
 and then a bunch of them break free.

1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:03.880
 And this is sort of on almost free flowing highways.

1:29:03.880 --> 1:29:05.160
 They kind of move in packs

1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:07.540
 and you can kind of see them in the truck.

1:29:07.540 --> 1:29:09.220
 So, rather than platoons,

1:29:09.220 --> 1:29:11.940
 we might have like hives of trucks, right?

1:29:11.940 --> 1:29:13.940
 So you have like 20 trucks moving

1:29:13.940 --> 1:29:15.900
 in some coordinated fashion, right?

1:29:15.900 --> 1:29:18.440
 And then maybe the self driving cars are,

1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:19.980
 cause people don't like to be around them

1:29:19.980 --> 1:29:21.340
 or whatever it is, right?

1:29:21.340 --> 1:29:24.080
 You might have a pod of 20 self driving cars

1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:26.540
 sort of moving in a packet behind them.

1:29:26.540 --> 1:29:28.840
 This is what, if the aliens came down

1:29:28.840 --> 1:29:30.900
 or we're just observing cars,

1:29:30.900 --> 1:29:34.620
 which is one of the sort of prevalent characteristics

1:29:34.620 --> 1:29:37.340
 of human civilization is there seems to be these cars

1:29:37.340 --> 1:29:40.260
 like moving around that would do this kind of analysis

1:29:40.260 --> 1:29:42.480
 of like, huh, what's the interesting clustering

1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:43.680
 of situations here,

1:29:46.020 --> 1:29:48.660
 especially with autonomous vehicles, I like this.

1:29:48.660 --> 1:29:52.180
 Okay, so what technologically speaking

1:29:52.180 --> 1:29:55.200
 do you see are the different scenarios

1:29:55.200 --> 1:29:58.120
 of increasing automation in trucks?

1:29:58.120 --> 1:30:00.860
 What are some ideas that you think about?

1:30:00.860 --> 1:30:04.840
 For the most part, I have no influence

1:30:04.840 --> 1:30:06.360
 on sort of what these ideas were.

1:30:06.360 --> 1:30:11.220
 So what the project was that I did was I said,

1:30:11.220 --> 1:30:14.380
 technology is created by people, they solve for X

1:30:14.380 --> 1:30:17.660
 and they have some conception of what they wanna do.

1:30:17.660 --> 1:30:19.940
 And that's where we should start in sort of thinking

1:30:19.940 --> 1:30:22.160
 about what the impacts might be.

1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:25.200
 So I went and I talked to everybody I could find

1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:28.620
 who was thinking about developing a self driving truck.

1:30:28.620 --> 1:30:31.280
 And the question was essentially,

1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:32.780
 what are you trying to build?

1:30:32.780 --> 1:30:35.700
 Like, what do you envision this thing doing?

1:30:35.700 --> 1:30:39.140
 It turned out that that for a lot of them

1:30:39.140 --> 1:30:40.440
 was an afterthought.

1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:43.780
 They knew the sort of technological capabilities

1:30:43.780 --> 1:30:45.380
 that a self driving vehicle would have.

1:30:45.380 --> 1:30:48.220
 And those were the problems that they were tackling.

1:30:48.220 --> 1:30:50.300
 They were engineers and computer scientists and...

1:30:50.300 --> 1:30:53.580
 Oh, robotics people, I love you so much.

1:30:53.580 --> 1:30:56.700
 This is, I could talk forever about this,

1:30:56.700 --> 1:30:58.300
 but yes, there's a technology problem,

1:30:58.300 --> 1:30:59.700
 let's focus on that and we'll figure out

1:30:59.700 --> 1:31:02.380
 the actual impact on society,

1:31:02.380 --> 1:31:03.780
 how it's actually going to be applied,

1:31:03.780 --> 1:31:05.600
 how it's actually going to be integrated

1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:08.300
 from a policy and from a human perspective,

1:31:08.300 --> 1:31:09.820
 from a business perspective later.

1:31:09.820 --> 1:31:11.540
 First, let's solve the technology problem.

1:31:11.540 --> 1:31:14.380
 That's not how life works, friends, but okay, I'm sorry.

1:31:14.380 --> 1:31:16.180
 Yeah, yeah, so I mean,

1:31:16.180 --> 1:31:18.060
 I'm sure you know the division of labor

1:31:18.060 --> 1:31:18.980
 in these companies, right?

1:31:18.980 --> 1:31:21.060
 There's sort of a business development side,

1:31:21.060 --> 1:31:22.900
 you know, and then there's the engineering side, right?

1:31:22.900 --> 1:31:24.420
 And the engineers are like, oh my God,

1:31:24.420 --> 1:31:26.340
 what are these business development people, you know,

1:31:26.340 --> 1:31:30.100
 why are they involved in this process?

1:31:30.100 --> 1:31:34.420
 So I ended up sort of coming up with a few different ideas

1:31:34.420 --> 1:31:36.980
 that people seem to be batting around

1:31:36.980 --> 1:31:39.580
 and then really tried to zero in

1:31:39.580 --> 1:31:42.700
 on a layman's understanding of the limitations, right?

1:31:42.700 --> 1:31:47.500
 And it turns out that's really obvious and quite simple.

1:31:47.500 --> 1:31:49.940
 Highway driving's a lot simpler, right?

1:31:49.940 --> 1:31:53.580
 So, you know, the plan is simplify the problem, right?

1:31:53.580 --> 1:31:56.180
 And focus on highways because city driving

1:31:56.180 --> 1:31:59.820
 is so much more complicated.

1:31:59.820 --> 1:32:04.260
 So from that, I came up with basically six scenarios,

1:32:04.260 --> 1:32:06.620
 actually I came up with five

1:32:06.620 --> 1:32:08.620
 that the developers were talking about.

1:32:08.620 --> 1:32:11.380
 And then one that I thought was a good idea

1:32:11.380 --> 1:32:16.380
 that I had read about, I think in like 2013 or 2014,

1:32:16.820 --> 1:32:18.260
 which was actually something

1:32:18.260 --> 1:32:20.500
 that the US military was looking at.

1:32:20.500 --> 1:32:23.140
 I actually first heard about the idea

1:32:23.140 --> 1:32:27.620
 of this kind of automation, at least in sketched out form

1:32:27.620 --> 1:32:30.780
 in like 2011, I guess it was with Peloton,

1:32:30.780 --> 1:32:33.940
 which was this sort of early technology entrant

1:32:33.940 --> 1:32:35.940
 into the trucking industry,

1:32:35.940 --> 1:32:39.220
 which was working on platooning trucks.

1:32:39.220 --> 1:32:41.220
 And all they were doing was, you know,

1:32:41.220 --> 1:32:43.100
 a cooperative adaptive cruise control

1:32:43.100 --> 1:32:44.600
 as they came to call it.

1:32:45.740 --> 1:32:48.240
 And we ended up on a panel together.

1:32:48.240 --> 1:32:52.020
 And it's kind of interesting because I was on that panel

1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:55.660
 because I was thinking about how we got the best return

1:32:55.660 --> 1:32:58.380
 on investment for fuel efficient technologies.

1:32:58.380 --> 1:33:01.180
 And if it's cool, I'll sort of set this up

1:33:01.180 --> 1:33:03.500
 because it does, it comes into sort of the story

1:33:03.500 --> 1:33:05.700
 of some of these scenarios.

1:33:05.700 --> 1:33:09.260
 So when I studied the drivers,

1:33:09.260 --> 1:33:14.260
 you had this like complete difference in the driving tasks,

1:33:15.160 --> 1:33:16.260
 like we were talking about before

1:33:16.260 --> 1:33:18.860
 with long haul and city, right?

1:33:18.860 --> 1:33:21.500
 And you're not paid in the city,

1:33:21.500 --> 1:33:24.500
 you've got congestion, the turns are tight.

1:33:25.540 --> 1:33:27.900
 There's lots of, you know, pedestrians, you know,

1:33:27.900 --> 1:33:29.900
 all the things that self driving trucks don't like,

1:33:29.900 --> 1:33:31.920
 truckers don't like, right?

1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:35.700
 And they're not paid, there's lots of waiting time.

1:33:35.700 --> 1:33:37.900
 And then in the highway, they get to cruise,

1:33:37.900 --> 1:33:39.780
 they're getting paid, they have control,

1:33:39.780 --> 1:33:41.180
 they go at their own pace,

1:33:41.180 --> 1:33:43.180
 they're making money, they're happy.

1:33:43.180 --> 1:33:45.980
 Well, it turned out, I guess it was around 2010,

1:33:45.980 --> 1:33:47.380
 this is still when we were thinking

1:33:47.380 --> 1:33:48.980
 about regenerative braking, you know,

1:33:48.980 --> 1:33:51.420
 and hybrid trucks being sort of like the solution.

1:33:53.260 --> 1:33:56.140
 The problems with them sort of,

1:33:56.140 --> 1:33:57.660
 and the advantages, you know,

1:33:57.660 --> 1:33:59.380
 also split on what I was thinking of

1:33:59.380 --> 1:34:01.660
 as kind of the rural urban divide at that time, right?

1:34:01.660 --> 1:34:05.140
 So, like you got the regenerative braking, right?

1:34:05.140 --> 1:34:06.540
 You can make the truck lighter,

1:34:06.540 --> 1:34:08.420
 you can keep it local, right?

1:34:08.420 --> 1:34:10.780
 You don't get any benefit from that, you know,

1:34:10.780 --> 1:34:15.700
 hybrid electric on the rural highway,

1:34:15.700 --> 1:34:17.940
 you want aerodynamics, right?

1:34:17.940 --> 1:34:20.460
 There, you want low rolling resistance tires

1:34:20.460 --> 1:34:23.140
 and these super aerodynamic sleek trucks, right?

1:34:23.140 --> 1:34:26.220
 Where we know with off the shelf technology today,

1:34:26.220 --> 1:34:27.820
 we could double the fuel economy,

1:34:27.820 --> 1:34:30.380
 more than double the fuel economy of the typical truck

1:34:30.380 --> 1:34:32.300
 in that highway segment,

1:34:32.300 --> 1:34:34.620
 if we segmented the duty cycle, right?

1:34:34.620 --> 1:34:36.580
 And so in the urban environment,

1:34:36.580 --> 1:34:37.780
 you want a clean burning truck,

1:34:37.780 --> 1:34:39.460
 so you're not giving kids asthma,

1:34:39.460 --> 1:34:40.300
 you want it lighter,

1:34:40.300 --> 1:34:45.140
 so it's not destroying those less strong pavements, right?

1:34:45.140 --> 1:34:47.020
 You're not, you can make tighter turns,

1:34:47.020 --> 1:34:48.360
 you don't need a sleeper cab,

1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:49.260
 because the driver, you know,

1:34:49.260 --> 1:34:51.260
 hopefully is getting home at night, right?

1:34:51.260 --> 1:34:54.160
 In the long haul, you want that super aerodynamic stuff.

1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:55.760
 Now that doesn't get you anything in the city,

1:34:55.760 --> 1:34:57.360
 and in fact, it causes all kinds of problems,

1:34:57.360 --> 1:34:58.540
 because you turn too tight,

1:34:58.540 --> 1:35:00.060
 you crunch up all the aerodynamics

1:35:00.060 --> 1:35:02.900
 that connect the tractor and the trailer.

1:35:02.900 --> 1:35:05.820
 So the idea that I had was like, okay,

1:35:05.820 --> 1:35:08.100
 what if we deliberately segmented it?

1:35:08.100 --> 1:35:12.480
 Like, what if we created these droplets outside cities,

1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:16.580
 where, you know, a local city driver who's paid by the hour

1:35:16.580 --> 1:35:18.940
 kind of runs these trailers out once they're loaded,

1:35:18.940 --> 1:35:20.780
 you know, doesn't sit there and wait while it's being loaded,

1:35:20.780 --> 1:35:23.080
 they drop off a trailer, they go pick up one that's loaded,

1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:25.140
 they run it out, when it's loaded, they call them,

1:35:25.140 --> 1:35:27.260
 and they just run them out there and stage them.

1:35:27.260 --> 1:35:30.180
 It's like an Uber driver, but for truckloads.

1:35:30.180 --> 1:35:32.020
 Yeah, and we have like intermodal.

1:35:32.020 --> 1:35:34.660
 We have like, basically this would be the equivalent

1:35:34.660 --> 1:35:37.180
 of like rail to truck intermodal, right?

1:35:37.180 --> 1:35:38.780
 So you put it on the rail, and then, you know,

1:35:38.780 --> 1:35:40.500
 a trucker picks it up and delivers it, right?

1:35:40.500 --> 1:35:42.140
 So instead of having the rail,

1:35:42.140 --> 1:35:44.900
 you'd have these super aerodynamic, hopefully platoons,

1:35:44.900 --> 1:35:48.780
 or what at the time was called long combination vehicles,

1:35:48.780 --> 1:35:51.020
 which is basically two trailers connected together, right?

1:35:51.020 --> 1:35:54.060
 Because this is like a huge productivity gain, right?

1:35:54.060 --> 1:35:56.220
 And then instead of that driver like me,

1:35:56.220 --> 1:35:57.740
 I would pick up something in upstate New York,

1:35:57.740 --> 1:35:59.940
 drive to Michigan, drive to Alabama, you know,

1:35:59.940 --> 1:36:01.820
 drive to Wisconsin, drive to Florida, you know,

1:36:01.820 --> 1:36:03.180
 I'd get home every two weeks.

1:36:03.180 --> 1:36:08.020
 If I'm just running that, you know, that double trailer,

1:36:08.020 --> 1:36:09.540
 I might be able to go back and forth

1:36:09.540 --> 1:36:11.680
 from Chicago to Detroit, right?

1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:14.340
 Take two trailers there, pick up two trailers going back,

1:36:14.340 --> 1:36:16.120
 right, and be home every night.

1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:17.580
 Now, the problem with that at the time,

1:36:17.580 --> 1:36:20.360
 or one of them was, you know, bridge weights.

1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:23.080
 So you can't, not all bridges can handle

1:36:23.080 --> 1:36:25.320
 that much weight on them.

1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:26.620
 They can't handle these doubles, right?

1:36:26.620 --> 1:36:28.560
 And some places can, some places can't.

1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:31.660
 And so this platooning idea was happening at the same time,

1:36:31.660 --> 1:36:33.220
 and we ended up on the same panel,

1:36:33.220 --> 1:36:35.180
 and the founders were like,

1:36:35.180 --> 1:36:37.420
 hey, so what's it like to follow

1:36:37.420 --> 1:36:39.040
 really close behind another truck?

1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:41.300
 Which was kind of the stage that they were at was like,

1:36:41.300 --> 1:36:43.380
 you know, what's that experience gonna be like?

1:36:43.380 --> 1:36:46.360
 And I was like, truckers aren't gonna like it, you know?

1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:48.540
 I mean, that's just like the cardinal rule

1:36:48.540 --> 1:36:49.760
 is following distance.

1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:52.940
 Like that's the one you really shouldn't violate, right?

1:36:52.940 --> 1:36:54.060
 And when you're out on the road,

1:36:54.060 --> 1:36:56.220
 like you have that trucker like right on your ass,

1:36:56.220 --> 1:36:58.200
 you know, people remember that.

1:36:58.200 --> 1:37:01.280
 They don't remember the 99.9% of truckers

1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:03.200
 that are not on their ass, you know?

1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:05.360
 Like they're very careful about that.

1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:07.560
 But when the trucks are really close together,

1:37:07.560 --> 1:37:10.120
 there's benefits in terms of aerodynamics.

1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:11.600
 So that's the idea.

1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:16.520
 So like if you want to get some benefits of a platoon,

1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:17.800
 you want them to be close together,

1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:20.240
 but you're saying that's very uncomfortable for truckers.

1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:22.200
 Yeah, so I mean, I think that ended up at the,

1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:25.260
 I mean, Peloton I think is sort of winding down

1:37:25.260 --> 1:37:27.400
 their work on this.

1:37:27.400 --> 1:37:31.000
 And I think that ended up being still an open question.

1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:33.440
 Like, and I had a chance to interview a couple drivers

1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:36.040
 who at least one, maybe two of which

1:37:36.040 --> 1:37:37.840
 had actually driven in their platoons.

1:37:38.740 --> 1:37:41.280
 And I got completely different experiences.

1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:43.360
 Some of them were like, it's really cool.

1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:46.460
 You know, I'm like in communication with that other driver.

1:37:46.460 --> 1:37:49.680
 You know, I can see on a screen what's out,

1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:51.400
 you know, the front of his truck.

1:37:51.400 --> 1:37:53.920
 And then some were like, it's too close.

1:37:53.920 --> 1:37:55.280
 And it might be one of those things that's just,

1:37:55.280 --> 1:37:57.960
 you know, it takes an adjustment to sort of get there.

1:37:57.960 --> 1:37:59.440
 So you get the aerodynamic advantage,

1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:01.940
 which, you know, saves fuel.

1:38:01.940 --> 1:38:03.360
 There's some problems though, right?

1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:07.000
 So, you know, you're getting that aerodynamic advantage

1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:08.360
 because there's a low pressure system

1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:10.400
 in front of that following truck.

1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:14.480
 But the engine is designed with higher pressure

1:38:14.480 --> 1:38:15.960
 feeding that engine, right?

1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:18.120
 So there are sort of adjustments that you need to make

1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:21.880
 and, you know, still the benefits are there.

1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:22.960
 That's one scenario.

1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:24.120
 And that's just the automation

1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:26.920
 of that acceleration and braking.

1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:29.620
 Starsky, which, you know,

1:38:29.620 --> 1:38:32.340
 probably a lot of your listeners heard about,

1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:34.820
 was working on another scenario,

1:38:34.820 --> 1:38:38.200
 which was, you know, to solve that local problem

1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:40.480
 was gonna do teleoperation, right?

1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:41.900
 Sort of remote piloting.

1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:44.280
 I had the chance to, you know,

1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:46.320
 sort of watch them do that.

1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:49.640
 You know, they drove a truck in Florida

1:38:49.640 --> 1:38:53.640
 from San Francisco in one of their offices.

1:38:53.640 --> 1:38:54.840
 That was really interesting.

1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:55.680
 And then...

1:38:55.680 --> 1:38:56.500
 In case it's not clear,

1:38:56.500 --> 1:38:59.480
 teleoperation means you're controlling the truck remotely,

1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:00.780
 like it's a video game.

1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:05.020
 So you've gotten the chance to witness it.

1:39:05.020 --> 1:39:06.840
 Does it actually work?

1:39:06.840 --> 1:39:08.840
 Yeah, I mean, so it's a...

1:39:08.840 --> 1:39:10.200
 What are the pros and cons?

1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:12.680
 You know, one of the problems with doing research like this

1:39:12.680 --> 1:39:16.560
 with all these Silicon Valley folks is the NDAs.

1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:17.760
 Oh, right.

1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:20.560
 So, you know, I don't know what I'm able to say

1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:21.960
 about sort of watching it,

1:39:21.960 --> 1:39:24.160
 but obviously they're public statements

1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:25.520
 about sort of what the challenges are, right?

1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:27.680
 And it's about the latency

1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:31.200
 and the ability to sort of in real time.

1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:32.140
 There's challenges there.

1:39:32.140 --> 1:39:33.640
 Let me say one thing.

1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:36.200
 So I'm talking to the...

1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:38.440
 You know, I've talked to the Waymo CTO.

1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:39.720
 I'm in conversations with them.

1:39:39.720 --> 1:39:43.920
 I'm talking to the head of trucking, Boris Softman,

1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:45.540
 in next month, actually.

1:39:45.540 --> 1:39:48.120
 I'm a huge fan of his because he was,

1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:49.320
 I think the founder of Anki,

1:39:49.320 --> 1:39:52.300
 which is a toy robotics company.

1:39:52.300 --> 1:39:55.640
 So I love human robot interaction.

1:39:55.640 --> 1:39:58.840
 And he created one of the most effective

1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:02.120
 and beautiful toy robots.

1:40:03.080 --> 1:40:07.320
 Anyway, I keep complaining to them on email privately

1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:11.960
 that there's way too much marketing in these conversations

1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:14.960
 and not enough showing off both the challenge

1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:16.840
 and the beauty of the engineering efforts.

1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:18.160
 And that seems to be the case

1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:21.300
 for a lot of these Silicon Valley tech companies.

1:40:21.300 --> 1:40:24.200
 They put up this, you're talking about NDAs.

1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:29.640
 For some reason, rightfully or wrongfully,

1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:31.040
 because there's been so much hype

1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:33.120
 and so much money being made,

1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:38.120
 they don't see the upside in being transparent

1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:43.300
 and educating the public about how difficult the problem is.

1:40:43.300 --> 1:40:45.520
 It's much more effective for them to say,

1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:46.720
 we have everything solved.

1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:47.840
 This will change everything.

1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:49.440
 This will change society as we know it.

1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:51.120
 And just kind of wave their hands

1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:53.040
 as opposed to exploring together

1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:54.340
 like these different scenarios.

1:40:54.340 --> 1:40:55.880
 What are the pros and cons?

1:40:55.880 --> 1:40:57.700
 Why is it really difficult?

1:40:57.700 --> 1:41:00.000
 You know, what are the gray areas

1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:01.760
 of where it works and doesn't?

1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:03.880
 What's the role of the human in this picture

1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:06.480
 of the both sort of the operators

1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:08.000
 and the other humans on the road?

1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:11.520
 All of that, which are fascinating human problems,

1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:12.960
 fascinating engineering problems

1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:15.320
 that I wish we could have a conversation about

1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:19.160
 as opposed to always feeling like it's just marketing talk.

1:41:19.160 --> 1:41:22.480
 Because a lot of what we're talking about now,

1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:26.700
 even you with having private conversations under NDA,

1:41:26.700 --> 1:41:29.520
 you still don't have the full picture of everything,

1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:31.240
 of how difficult this problem is.

1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:34.400
 One of the big questions I've had,

1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:37.000
 still have is how difficult is driving?

1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:41.020
 I disagree with Elon Musk and Jim Keller on this point.

1:41:41.020 --> 1:41:44.440
 I have a sense that driving is really difficult.

1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:47.680
 You know, the task of driving, just broadly.

1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:49.400
 This is like philosophy talk.

1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:54.300
 How much intelligence is required to drive a car?

1:41:55.360 --> 1:41:58.000
 So from like a Jim Keller,

1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.340
 who used to be the head of autopilot,

1:42:00.340 --> 1:42:03.080
 the idea is that it's just a collision avoidance problem.

1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:04.320
 It's like billiard balls.

1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:06.960
 It's like you have to convert the drive.

1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:08.600
 You have to do some basic perception,

1:42:08.600 --> 1:42:13.080
 a computer vision to convert driving into a game of pool.

1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:15.880
 And then you just have to get everything into a pocket.

1:42:15.880 --> 1:42:19.160
 To me, there just seems to be some game theoretic dance

1:42:19.160 --> 1:42:21.820
 combined with the fact that people's life is at stake.

1:42:21.820 --> 1:42:24.480
 And then when people die at the hands of a robot,

1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:26.500
 the reaction is going to be much more complicated.

1:42:26.500 --> 1:42:28.880
 So all of that, but that's still an open question.

1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:31.920
 And the cool thing is all of these companies

1:42:31.920 --> 1:42:34.160
 are struggling with this question

1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:38.000
 of how difficult is it to solve this problem sufficiently

1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:39.880
 such that we can build a business on top of it

1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:41.720
 and have a product that's going to make

1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:42.880
 a huge amount of money

1:42:42.880 --> 1:42:46.680
 and compete with the manually driven vehicles.

1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:49.680
 And so their teleoperation from Starsky's

1:42:49.680 --> 1:42:50.800
 is really interesting idea.

1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:53.560
 How much can, I mean,

1:42:53.560 --> 1:42:55.320
 there's a few autonomous vehicle companies

1:42:55.320 --> 1:42:59.000
 that tried to integrate teleoperation in the picture.

1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:02.220
 Can we reduce some of the costs

1:43:02.220 --> 1:43:04.640
 while still having reliability,

1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:09.640
 like catch when the vehicle fails

1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:11.680
 by having teleoperation?

1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:12.840
 It's an open question.

1:43:13.800 --> 1:43:17.020
 So that's for you scenario number two

1:43:17.020 --> 1:43:20.080
 is to use teleoperation as part of the picture.

1:43:20.080 --> 1:43:22.240
 Yeah, let me follow up on that question

1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:23.380
 of how hard driving is,

1:43:23.380 --> 1:43:26.560
 because this becomes a big question for researchers

1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:28.520
 who are thinking about labor market impacts,

1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:31.520
 because we start from a perspective

1:43:31.520 --> 1:43:33.800
 of what's hard or easy for humans.

1:43:34.840 --> 1:43:39.840
 And so if you were to look at truck driving prior to a lot,

1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:41.920
 I mean, there's been a lot of thinking and debate

1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:45.040
 in academic research circles

1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:47.760
 around sort of how you estimate labor impacts,

1:43:47.760 --> 1:43:49.000
 what these models look like.

1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:52.120
 And a lot of it is about how automatable is a job,

1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:54.960
 object recognition, really easy for people, right?

1:43:54.960 --> 1:43:56.400
 Really hard for computers.

1:43:56.400 --> 1:43:58.440
 And so there's a whole bunch of things

1:43:58.440 --> 1:44:03.440
 that truck drivers do that we see as super easy

1:44:03.840 --> 1:44:07.040
 and as it would have been characterized 10 years ago,

1:44:07.040 --> 1:44:10.520
 routine, and it's not for a computer, right?

1:44:10.520 --> 1:44:13.560
 It turns out to be something that we do naturally

1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:16.480
 that is sort of cutting edge, right?

1:44:16.480 --> 1:44:17.920
 Computer science.

1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:20.160
 So on the teleoperation question,

1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:23.960
 I think this is a more interesting one

1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:28.060
 than people would like to sort of let on, I think, publicly.

1:44:29.860 --> 1:44:32.160
 There are gonna be problems, right?

1:44:32.160 --> 1:44:33.680
 And this is one of the complexities

1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:35.480
 of sort of putting these things out in the world.

1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:37.880
 And if you see the real world of trucking,

1:44:37.880 --> 1:44:40.900
 you realize, wow, it's rough.

1:44:40.900 --> 1:44:42.480
 There are dirt lots, there's gravel,

1:44:42.480 --> 1:44:44.720
 there's salt and ice and cold weather,

1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:46.720
 and there's equipment that just gets left out

1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:47.680
 in the middle of nowhere,

1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:49.580
 and the brakes don't get maintained,

1:44:49.580 --> 1:44:51.560
 and somebody was supposed to service something

1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:53.200
 and they didn't, you know?

1:44:53.200 --> 1:44:56.000
 And so you imagine, okay, we've got this vehicle

1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:57.140
 that can drive itself,

1:44:57.140 --> 1:44:59.040
 which is gonna require a whole lot of sensors

1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:02.120
 to tell it that the doors are still closed

1:45:02.120 --> 1:45:03.600
 and the trailer's still hooked up

1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:05.760
 and each of the tires has adequate pressure,

1:45:05.760 --> 1:45:09.100
 and any number of, probably hundreds of sensors

1:45:09.100 --> 1:45:11.880
 that are gonna be sort of relaying information.

1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:15.800
 And one of them, after 500,000 miles or whatever,

1:45:15.800 --> 1:45:17.060
 it goes out.

1:45:17.060 --> 1:45:20.280
 Now, do we have some fleet of technicians

1:45:20.280 --> 1:45:22.460
 sort of continually cruising the highways

1:45:22.460 --> 1:45:25.120
 and sort of servicing these things as they do what?

1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:27.240
 Pull themselves off to the side of the road

1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:30.120
 and say, I've got a sensor fault, I'm pulling over,

1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:32.960
 or maybe there's some level of safety critical faults

1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:36.280
 or whatever it might be.

1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:40.640
 So that suggests that there might be a role

1:45:40.640 --> 1:45:43.760
 for teleoperation even with self driving.

1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:47.920
 And when I push people on it in the conversations,

1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:50.240
 they all are like, yeah, we kind of have that

1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:52.000
 on the bottom of the list,

1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.440
 figure out how to rescue truck, you know?

1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:56.760
 I guess on the to do list, right?

1:45:56.760 --> 1:46:00.100
 After solving the self driving question is like,

1:46:00.100 --> 1:46:02.600
 yeah, what do we do with the problems, right?

1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:04.920
 I mean, no, we could imagine like, all right,

1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:08.440
 we have some protocol that the truck is not,

1:46:08.440 --> 1:46:11.540
 realizes the system says not safe for operation,

1:46:11.540 --> 1:46:13.160
 pull to the side.

1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:15.720
 Good, you have a crash, but now you got a truck stranded

1:46:15.720 --> 1:46:17.020
 on the side of the road.

1:46:17.020 --> 1:46:19.920
 You're gonna send out somebody to like calibrate things

1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:21.240
 and check out what's going on,

1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:23.200
 or that sounds like expensive labor,

1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:26.280
 it sounds like downtime, it sounds like the kind of things

1:46:26.280 --> 1:46:28.840
 that shippers don't like to happen to their freight,

1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:30.920
 you know, in a just in time world.

1:46:30.920 --> 1:46:33.660
 And so wouldn't it be great if you could just sort of,

1:46:33.660 --> 1:46:36.960
 you know, loop your way into the controls of that truck

1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:38.920
 and say, all right, we've got a sensor out,

1:46:38.920 --> 1:46:40.600
 says that the tire is bad,

1:46:40.600 --> 1:46:43.280
 but I can see visually from the camera, looks fine,

1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:45.560
 I'm gonna drive it to our next depot,

1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:48.560
 you know, maybe the next rider or Penske location, right?

1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:50.480
 Sort of all these service locations around

1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:52.680
 and have a technician take a look at it.

1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:57.000
 So teleoperation often gets this, you know,

1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:02.000
 so dismissive, you know, commentary from other folks

1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:04.040
 working on other scenarios.

1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:07.000
 But I think it's potentially more relevant

1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:09.880
 than we hear publicly.

1:47:09.880 --> 1:47:11.800
 But it's a hard problem.

1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:16.800
 And, you know, for me, I've gotten a chance

1:47:17.640 --> 1:47:19.680
 to interact with people that take on hard problems

1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:21.520
 and solve them and they're rare.

1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:24.480
 What Tesla has done with their data engine.

1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:29.440
 So I thought autonomous driving cannot be solved

1:47:29.440 --> 1:47:31.320
 without collecting a huge amount of data

1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:32.280
 and organizing it well,

1:47:32.280 --> 1:47:34.800
 not just collecting, but organizing it.

1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:37.300
 And exactly what Tesla is doing now

1:47:37.300 --> 1:47:38.640
 is what I thought it would be,

1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:40.600
 like I couldn't see car companies doing that,

1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:42.200
 including Tesla.

1:47:42.200 --> 1:47:44.640
 And now that they're doing that, it's like, oh, okay.

1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:48.160
 So it's possible to take on this huge effort seriously.

1:47:48.160 --> 1:47:51.880
 To me, teleoperation is another huge effort like that.

1:47:51.880 --> 1:47:56.880
 It's like taking seriously what happens when it fails.

1:47:56.960 --> 1:48:00.840
 What's the, in the case of Waymo for the consumer,

1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:04.320
 like ride sharing, what's the customer experience like?

1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:06.000
 There's a bunch of videos online now

1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:09.200
 where people are like the car fails and it pulls off

1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:11.600
 to the side and you call like customer service

1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:13.880
 and you're basically sitting there for a long time

1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:15.000
 and there's confusion.

1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:17.000
 And then there's a rescue that comes

1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:17.840
 and they start to drive.

1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:19.760
 I mean, just the whole experience is a mess

1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:23.360
 that has a ripple effect to how you trust

1:48:23.360 --> 1:48:25.400
 in the entirety of the experience.

1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:27.560
 But like actually taking on the problem

1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:32.080
 of that failure case and revolutionizing that experience,

1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:34.400
 both for trucking and for ride sharing,

1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:35.920
 that's an amazing opportunity there

1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:40.080
 because that feels like it would change everything.

1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:42.720
 If you can reliably know when the failures happen,

1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:45.120
 which they will, you have a clear plan

1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:47.800
 that doesn't significantly affect the efficiency

1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:51.720
 of the whole process, that could be the game changer.

1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:53.200
 And if teleoperation is part of that,

1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:54.880
 it could be just like you're saying,

1:48:54.880 --> 1:48:57.920
 it could be teleoperation or it could be like a fleet

1:48:57.920 --> 1:49:01.400
 of rescuers that can come in, which is a similar idea.

1:49:01.400 --> 1:49:04.360
 But teleoperation, obviously that allows you

1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:07.360
 to just have a network of monitors

1:49:07.360 --> 1:49:10.680
 of people monitoring this giant fleet of trucks

1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:12.760
 and taking over when needed.

1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:14.720
 And it's a beautiful vision of the future

1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:18.160
 where there's millions of robots

1:49:18.160 --> 1:49:20.920
 and only thousands of humans monitoring

1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:22.720
 those millions of robots.

1:49:22.720 --> 1:49:27.360
 That seems like a perfect dance

1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:29.560
 of allowing humans to do what they do best

1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:31.960
 and allowing robots to do what they do best.

1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:34.760
 Yeah, yeah, so I mean, I think there are,

1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:37.840
 and we just applied for an NSF we didn't get,

1:49:37.840 --> 1:49:41.560
 anybody's watching, but with some folks from Wisconsin

1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:43.640
 who do teleoperation, right?

1:49:43.640 --> 1:49:46.000
 And some of this is used for like rovers

1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:50.480
 and I mean, really high stakes, difficult problems.

1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:52.120
 But one of the things we wanted to study

1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:55.480
 were these mines, these Rio Tinto mines in Australia

1:49:55.480 --> 1:49:59.520
 where they remotely pilot the trucks.

1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:01.600
 And there's some autonomy, I guess,

1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:05.160
 but it's overseen by a remote operator

1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:09.360
 and it's near Perth and it's quite remote

1:50:09.360 --> 1:50:13.400
 and they retrained the truck drivers

1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:15.800
 to be the remote operators, right?

1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:18.320
 There's autonomy in the port of Rotterdam

1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:21.040
 and places like that where there are jobs there.

1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:24.000
 And so I think, and maybe we'll get to this later,

1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:25.400
 but there's a real policy question

1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:28.760
 about sort of who's gonna lose and what we do about it

1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:31.280
 and whether or not there are opportunities there

1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:33.760
 that maybe we need to put our thumb on the scale

1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:38.640
 a little bit to make sure that there's some give back

1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:41.720
 to the community that's taking the hit.

1:50:41.720 --> 1:50:45.120
 So for instance, if there were teleoperation centers,

1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:46.800
 maybe they go in these communities

1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:50.480
 that we disproportionately source truck drivers from today.

1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:52.000
 Now, I mean, what does that mean?

1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:53.560
 It may not be the cheapest place to do it

1:50:53.560 --> 1:50:55.160
 if they don't have great connectivity

1:50:55.160 --> 1:50:58.520
 and it may not be where the upper level managers wanna be

1:50:58.520 --> 1:51:01.080
 and places like that, issues like that, right?

1:51:01.080 --> 1:51:04.880
 So I do think it's an interesting question,

1:51:04.880 --> 1:51:09.760
 both from sort of a practical scenario situation

1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:13.960
 of how it's gonna work, but also from a policy perspective.

1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:16.960
 So there's platoons, there's teleoperation,

1:51:16.960 --> 1:51:20.040
 and this is taking care of some of the highway driving

1:51:20.040 --> 1:51:21.160
 that we're talking about.

1:51:21.160 --> 1:51:22.900
 Is there other ideas like,

1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:26.880
 is there other ideas, scenarios

1:51:26.880 --> 1:51:28.840
 that you have for autonomous trucks?

1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:31.560
 Yeah, so I mean, the most obvious one actually

1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:34.760
 is just facility to facility, right?

1:51:34.760 --> 1:51:37.640
 The sort of, it can't go everywhere,

1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:40.480
 but a lot of logistics facilities

1:51:40.480 --> 1:51:42.120
 are very close to interstates

1:51:42.120 --> 1:51:45.140
 and they're on big commercial roads

1:51:45.140 --> 1:51:48.900
 without bikes and parked cars and all that stuff.

1:51:48.900 --> 1:51:51.740
 And some of the jobs that I think are really first

1:51:51.740 --> 1:51:54.520
 on the chopping block are these LTL,

1:51:54.520 --> 1:51:57.180
 that less than truckload, what's called line haul, right?

1:51:57.180 --> 1:51:59.880
 So these are the drivers who go from terminal to terminal

1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:01.520
 with those full trailers.

1:52:02.360 --> 1:52:05.000
 And those facilities are often located strategically

1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.080
 to avoid congestion, right?

1:52:07.080 --> 1:52:10.120
 And to be in big industrial facilities.

1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:14.200
 So you could imagine that being the first place

1:52:14.200 --> 1:52:17.640
 you see a Waymo self driving truck rollout

1:52:17.640 --> 1:52:21.800
 might be sort of direct facility to facility

1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:25.640
 for UPS or FedEx or less than truckload care.

1:52:25.640 --> 1:52:27.320
 And the idea there is fully driverless,

1:52:27.320 --> 1:52:30.120
 so potentially not even a driver in the truck,

1:52:30.120 --> 1:52:33.360
 it's just going from facility to facility empty,

1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:34.900
 zero occupancy.

1:52:34.900 --> 1:52:38.020
 Yeah, and those, because that labor is expensive,

1:52:38.020 --> 1:52:39.520
 they don't keep those drivers out overnight,

1:52:39.520 --> 1:52:42.520
 those drivers do a run back and forth typically,

1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:45.800
 or in a team go back and forth in one day.

1:52:47.020 --> 1:52:49.840
 So from the people you've spoken with so far,

1:52:49.840 --> 1:52:50.660
 what's your sense?

1:52:50.660 --> 1:52:53.920
 How far are we away from, which scenario is closest

1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:56.960
 and how far away are we from that scenario

1:52:56.960 --> 1:53:01.960
 of autonomy being a big part of our trucking fleet?

1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:05.680
 Most folks are focused on another scenario,

1:53:05.680 --> 1:53:07.740
 which is the exit to exit, right?

1:53:07.740 --> 1:53:10.920
 Which looks like that urban truck ports thing

1:53:10.920 --> 1:53:12.820
 that I laid out earlier.

1:53:12.820 --> 1:53:14.280
 So you have a human driven truck

1:53:14.280 --> 1:53:16.940
 that comes out to a drop lot,

1:53:16.940 --> 1:53:19.820
 it meets up with an autonomous truck,

1:53:19.820 --> 1:53:23.880
 that truck then drives it on the interstate to another lot,

1:53:23.880 --> 1:53:27.920
 and then a human driver picks it up.

1:53:27.920 --> 1:53:31.160
 There are a couple variations maybe on that.

1:53:32.420 --> 1:53:36.040
 So, or let me just run through the last two scenarios.

1:53:36.040 --> 1:53:36.880
 Sure.

1:53:37.740 --> 1:53:39.920
 The other thing you could do, right,

1:53:39.920 --> 1:53:43.880
 is to say, all right, I've got a truck that can drive itself,

1:53:43.880 --> 1:53:46.200
 and I refer to this one as autopilot,

1:53:46.200 --> 1:53:49.900
 but you have a human drive it out to the interstate,

1:53:49.900 --> 1:53:52.640
 but rather than have that transaction

1:53:52.640 --> 1:53:55.920
 where the human driven truck detaches the trailer

1:53:55.920 --> 1:53:58.760
 and it gets coupled up to a self driving truck,

1:53:58.760 --> 1:54:01.840
 they just, that human driver just hops on the interstate

1:54:01.840 --> 1:54:05.560
 with that truck and goes in back and goes off duty

1:54:05.560 --> 1:54:07.200
 while the truck drives itself.

1:54:07.200 --> 1:54:09.120
 And so you have a self driving truck

1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:11.360
 that's not driverless, right?

1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:12.360
 And just to clarify,

1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:15.480
 because Tesla uses the term autopilot instead of airplanes,

1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:17.720
 and so everybody uses the word autopilot,

1:54:17.720 --> 1:54:20.620
 we're referring to essentially full autonomy,

1:54:20.620 --> 1:54:22.100
 but because it's exit to exit,

1:54:22.100 --> 1:54:24.640
 the truck driver is onboard the truck,

1:54:24.640 --> 1:54:26.800
 but they're sleeping in the back or whatever.

1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:30.720
 Yeah, and this gets to the really weedy policy questions,

1:54:30.720 --> 1:54:31.560
 right?

1:54:31.560 --> 1:54:34.160
 So basically for the Department of Transportation,

1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:36.360
 for you to be off duty for safety reasons,

1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:39.340
 you have to be completely relieved of all responsibility.

1:54:39.340 --> 1:54:44.340
 So that truck has to not encounter a construction site

1:54:44.340 --> 1:54:47.820
 or inclement weather or whatever it might be,

1:54:47.820 --> 1:54:49.980
 and call to you and say, hey, you know,

1:54:49.980 --> 1:54:51.140
 or I mean, obviously, right,

1:54:51.140 --> 1:54:53.460
 we're imagining connected vehicles as well, right?

1:54:53.460 --> 1:54:55.700
 So you're in a self driving truck,

1:54:55.700 --> 1:54:58.980
 you're in the back and trucks 20 miles ahead

1:54:58.980 --> 1:55:01.740
 experience some problem, right?

1:55:01.740 --> 1:55:04.380
 That may require teleoperation or whatever it is, right?

1:55:04.380 --> 1:55:05.680
 And it signals to your truck,

1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:08.620
 hey, you know, tell the driver 20 miles ahead,

1:55:08.620 --> 1:55:10.660
 he's got to hop in the seat.

1:55:10.660 --> 1:55:12.140
 That would mean that they're on duty

1:55:12.140 --> 1:55:14.220
 according to the way that the current rules are written,

1:55:14.220 --> 1:55:15.700
 they have some responsibility.

1:55:15.700 --> 1:55:17.140
 And part of that is, you know,

1:55:17.140 --> 1:55:19.300
 we need them to get rest, right?

1:55:19.300 --> 1:55:22.540
 They need to have uninterrupted sleep.

1:55:22.540 --> 1:55:25.420
 So that's what I call autopilot.

1:55:25.420 --> 1:55:30.420
 The final scenario is one that I thought was actually

1:55:30.540 --> 1:55:34.500
 the one scenario that was good for labor, you know,

1:55:34.500 --> 1:55:38.260
 which I proposed is I was like, well, here's an idea,

1:55:38.260 --> 1:55:41.460
 you know, that would be like, actually good for workers.

1:55:41.460 --> 1:55:45.620
 And just another brief aside here.

1:55:46.940 --> 1:55:51.300
 The history of trucking over the last, you know, 40 years,

1:55:51.300 --> 1:55:53.100
 there's been a lot of technological change.

1:55:53.100 --> 1:55:55.700
 So when I learned to drive the truck,

1:55:55.700 --> 1:55:57.900
 I had to learn to manually shift it like I was describing,

1:55:57.900 --> 1:56:00.620
 you had to read these fairly complicated, you know,

1:56:00.620 --> 1:56:02.940
 big sets of laminated maps to figure out

1:56:02.940 --> 1:56:04.820
 where the truck can go and where it couldn't,

1:56:04.820 --> 1:56:06.180
 which is a big deal, you know,

1:56:06.180 --> 1:56:07.820
 I mean, you take these trucks on the wrong road

1:56:07.820 --> 1:56:09.380
 and you're destroying a bridge

1:56:09.380 --> 1:56:10.460
 or you're doing a can opener,

1:56:10.460 --> 1:56:12.820
 which is where you try to drive it under a bridge too low.

1:56:12.820 --> 1:56:14.420
 You've probably seen that on YouTube,

1:56:14.420 --> 1:56:17.540
 if not, you know, check it out, you know, truck can opener.

1:56:18.660 --> 1:56:20.660
 You know, there's some bridges that are famous for it,

1:56:20.660 --> 1:56:23.180
 right, and there's one I think called the can opener

1:56:23.180 --> 1:56:24.740
 and you can find on YouTube.

1:56:26.580 --> 1:56:30.180
 And, you know, you had to log those hours like manually

1:56:30.180 --> 1:56:34.260
 and sort of do the math and plan your work routine.

1:56:34.260 --> 1:56:35.300
 And I would do this every day.

1:56:35.300 --> 1:56:37.340
 I'd say like, okay, I'm gonna get up at five.

1:56:37.340 --> 1:56:40.020
 I've got to think about Buffalo and there's traffic there.

1:56:40.020 --> 1:56:43.420
 So I wanna be through Buffalo by 6.30, you know,

1:56:43.420 --> 1:56:47.300
 and then that'll put me, you know, in Cleveland at,

1:56:47.300 --> 1:56:51.820
 you know, 9.30, which means I'll miss that rush hour, right,

1:56:51.820 --> 1:56:53.580
 which is gonna put me in Chicago, you know,

1:56:53.580 --> 1:56:57.420
 and so you do this and now today, you know,

1:56:57.420 --> 1:57:00.620
 15 years later, truck drivers don't have to do any of that.

1:57:01.620 --> 1:57:03.780
 You know, you don't have to shift the truck,

1:57:03.780 --> 1:57:05.940
 you don't have to map, you know,

1:57:05.940 --> 1:57:09.460
 you can figure out the least congested route

1:57:09.460 --> 1:57:12.660
 to go on and your hours of service are recorded

1:57:12.660 --> 1:57:17.060
 or a good portion of them are reported automatically.

1:57:17.060 --> 1:57:19.860
 All of that has been a substantial de skilling

1:57:19.860 --> 1:57:23.300
 that has, you know, put downward pressure on wages

1:57:23.300 --> 1:57:26.220
 and allowed companies to kind of speed up, monitor

1:57:26.220 --> 1:57:29.820
 and direct, I mean, the key technology, you know,

1:57:29.820 --> 1:57:32.500
 that I did work under is satellite linked computers.

1:57:32.500 --> 1:57:34.820
 So before you could kind of go out and plan your own work

1:57:34.820 --> 1:57:36.860
 and the boss really couldn't see what you were doing

1:57:36.860 --> 1:57:39.460
 and push you and say, you know, you've been on break

1:57:39.460 --> 1:57:41.260
 for 10 hours, why aren't you moving?

1:57:41.260 --> 1:57:43.860
 You know, and you might tell them, you know,

1:57:43.860 --> 1:57:45.940
 cause I'm tired, you know, like I didn't sleep well,

1:57:45.940 --> 1:57:48.380
 I've got to get a couple more hours, you know,

1:57:48.380 --> 1:57:50.380
 they're only gonna accept that so many times

1:57:50.380 --> 1:57:51.980
 or at least some of those dispatchers are.

1:57:51.980 --> 1:57:56.060
 So all this technology has made the job sort of, you know,

1:57:56.060 --> 1:57:58.740
 de skilled the job, you know, hurt drivers

1:57:58.740 --> 1:58:01.740
 in the labor market, made the work worse.

1:58:01.740 --> 1:58:06.740
 So I think the burden it's really on the technologists

1:58:07.100 --> 1:58:09.940
 who are like, oh, this will make truck driver jobs better

1:58:09.940 --> 1:58:11.500
 and sort of envision ways that it would.

1:58:11.500 --> 1:58:14.780
 It's like, the burden's really, a proof is really on you

1:58:14.780 --> 1:58:17.540
 to sort of really clearly lay out what that

1:58:17.540 --> 1:58:21.820
 is gonna look like because it's 30 or 40 years of history

1:58:21.820 --> 1:58:25.180
 suggests that that technology into labor markets

1:58:25.180 --> 1:58:29.580
 where workers are really weak and cheap is what wins

1:58:29.580 --> 1:58:31.700
 that new technology doesn't help workers

1:58:31.700 --> 1:58:33.060
 or raise their wages.

1:58:33.940 --> 1:58:36.620
 So it lowers the bar of entry in terms of skill.

1:58:36.620 --> 1:58:38.140
 Yeah.

1:58:38.140 --> 1:58:41.140
 So that's really, that's tough.

1:58:43.860 --> 1:58:46.420
 That's tough to know what to do with because yeah,

1:58:46.420 --> 1:58:48.980
 from a technology perspective, you wanna make the life

1:58:48.980 --> 1:58:51.700
 of the people doing the job today easier.

1:58:51.700 --> 1:58:52.740
 Is it?

1:58:52.740 --> 1:58:54.020
 Is that what you want?

1:58:54.020 --> 1:58:58.660
 No, but that like, when you think about like what exactly,

1:58:58.660 --> 1:59:01.940
 because the reality is you will make their life

1:59:01.940 --> 1:59:04.100
 potentially a little bit easier,

1:59:04.100 --> 1:59:07.340
 but that will allow the companies to then hire people

1:59:07.340 --> 1:59:10.060
 that are less skilled, get those people

1:59:10.060 --> 1:59:13.740
 that were previously working there fired or lower wages.

1:59:13.740 --> 1:59:18.740
 And so the result of this easier is a lower quality of life.

1:59:19.620 --> 1:59:20.460
 Yeah.

1:59:20.460 --> 1:59:21.460
 That's dark actually.

1:59:21.460 --> 1:59:23.260
 I know, I'm sorry.

1:59:23.260 --> 1:59:27.140
 But you were saying that was for you initially the hopeful.

1:59:27.140 --> 1:59:28.860
 Oh no, so I'll get to that.

1:59:28.860 --> 1:59:31.220
 But one more thing, cause this is not stopping.

1:59:31.220 --> 1:59:32.900
 And this is another interesting question

1:59:32.900 --> 1:59:34.020
 about the sort of automation.

1:59:34.020 --> 1:59:38.460
 And I think Uber is an interesting example here

1:59:38.460 --> 1:59:40.900
 where it's like, okay, if we had self driving trucks

1:59:40.900 --> 1:59:43.780
 or self driving cars, we could automate

1:59:43.780 --> 1:59:46.060
 what used to be taxi service.

1:59:46.060 --> 1:59:46.980
 There's a whole bunch of stuff

1:59:46.980 --> 1:59:49.540
 that's already been automated, like the dispatching.

1:59:49.540 --> 1:59:52.980
 So the dispatchers are already out of work in rideshare

1:59:52.980 --> 1:59:55.180
 and the payment is already automated.

1:59:55.180 --> 1:59:57.460
 So you have to automate steps like this.

1:59:57.460 --> 2:00:00.820
 So you have to have that initial link to dispatch the truck.

2:00:00.820 --> 2:00:04.140
 You have to have the automated mapping.

2:00:04.140 --> 2:00:07.780
 So we're sort of done all this incremental automation

2:00:07.780 --> 2:00:11.460
 that could make the truck completely driverless.

2:00:11.460 --> 2:00:13.980
 There's some important things happening right now

2:00:13.980 --> 2:00:15.260
 with the remaining good jobs.

2:00:15.260 --> 2:00:17.340
 So what you're really paying for

2:00:17.340 --> 2:00:20.340
 when you get a good truck driver is, like I said,

2:00:20.340 --> 2:00:22.580
 you get those kind of local skills

2:00:22.580 --> 2:00:26.300
 of like backing and congested traffic.

2:00:26.300 --> 2:00:28.660
 Those, it's really impressive to watch

2:00:28.660 --> 2:00:30.340
 and there's some value on it certainly,

2:00:30.340 --> 2:00:33.580
 but it's relatively low value

2:00:33.580 --> 2:00:35.940
 in the actual driving technique, right?

2:00:35.940 --> 2:00:39.100
 So you bump something backing into the dock,

2:00:39.100 --> 2:00:41.300
 it might be a couple of thousand dollars

2:00:41.300 --> 2:00:43.500
 because you ruin a canopy or something over a dock

2:00:43.500 --> 2:00:44.500
 or tear up a trailer.

2:00:45.380 --> 2:00:46.460
 What you really want,

2:00:46.460 --> 2:00:50.500
 those highly skilled conscientious drivers,

2:00:50.500 --> 2:00:52.060
 and that's really what it is.

2:00:52.060 --> 2:00:53.900
 And that's what computers are really good at

2:00:53.900 --> 2:00:55.780
 is about being conscientious, right?

2:00:55.780 --> 2:00:59.140
 In the sense of like, they pay attention continually, right?

2:00:59.140 --> 2:01:02.220
 And how I was describing those long haul segments

2:01:02.220 --> 2:01:06.540
 where the driver just keeps out of the situations

2:01:06.540 --> 2:01:08.820
 that could become problematic

2:01:08.820 --> 2:01:10.780
 and just, they don't look at their phone.

2:01:10.780 --> 2:01:13.300
 I mean, they take the job seriously and they're safe

2:01:13.300 --> 2:01:16.820
 and you can give somebody a skills test, right?

2:01:16.820 --> 2:01:19.100
 As a CDL examiner, you could take them out and say,

2:01:19.100 --> 2:01:20.580
 all right, I need you to go around these cones

2:01:20.580 --> 2:01:24.180
 and drive safely through this school zone.

2:01:24.180 --> 2:01:27.020
 But what really proves that you're a safe driver

2:01:27.020 --> 2:01:29.580
 is two years without an accident, right?

2:01:29.580 --> 2:01:31.740
 Because that means that day after day,

2:01:31.740 --> 2:01:34.180
 hour after hour, mile after mile,

2:01:34.180 --> 2:01:36.580
 you did the right thing, right?

2:01:36.580 --> 2:01:39.340
 And not when it was like, oh, some situations emerging,

2:01:39.340 --> 2:01:41.340
 but just consistently over time

2:01:41.340 --> 2:01:43.660
 kept yourself out of accident situations.

2:01:43.660 --> 2:01:46.180
 And you can see this with drivers who are a million

2:01:46.180 --> 2:01:47.980
 or 2 million safe miles.

2:01:47.980 --> 2:01:50.300
 The value of those drivers for Walmart

2:01:50.300 --> 2:01:52.780
 is they don't run over minivans.

2:01:52.780 --> 2:01:54.780
 The company I worked for,

2:01:54.780 --> 2:01:57.180
 they ran over minivans on a regular basis.

2:01:57.180 --> 2:02:00.540
 So when I was trained, they said, we kill 20 people a year.

2:02:03.100 --> 2:02:04.780
 We send someone to the funeral,

2:02:04.780 --> 2:02:08.700
 there's a big check involved, don't be that.

2:02:08.700 --> 2:02:10.460
 We don't wanna go to your funeral

2:02:10.460 --> 2:02:15.220
 and you don't wanna be the person who caused that funeral.

2:02:15.220 --> 2:02:18.340
 Okay, so they just write that off.

2:02:18.340 --> 2:02:20.780
 Okay, that's just part of the business model.

2:02:20.780 --> 2:02:23.700
 Now, forward collision avoidance

2:02:25.340 --> 2:02:29.500
 can basically eliminate the vast majority

2:02:29.500 --> 2:02:30.980
 of those accidents.

2:02:30.980 --> 2:02:33.260
 That's what the value of a really expensive

2:02:33.260 --> 2:02:35.020
 conscientious driver is based on.

2:02:35.020 --> 2:02:37.060
 They don't run over minivans.

2:02:37.060 --> 2:02:40.340
 So as soon as you have that forward collision avoidance,

2:02:40.340 --> 2:02:43.460
 what's gonna happen to the wages of those drivers?

2:02:43.460 --> 2:02:48.460
 By way of a therapy session, help me understand,

2:02:48.500 --> 2:02:51.060
 is a collision avoidance,

2:02:52.660 --> 2:02:55.300
 automated collision avoidance systems,

2:02:55.300 --> 2:02:57.820
 are they good or bad for society?

2:02:57.820 --> 2:03:02.220
 Yeah, I mean, this is, they're good.

2:03:02.220 --> 2:03:03.540
 Right. They're good.

2:03:03.540 --> 2:03:08.540
 But what do we do about the pain of a workforce

2:03:08.540 --> 2:03:13.540
 in the short term because their wages are gonna go down

2:03:13.740 --> 2:03:16.740
 because the job starts requiring less and less skill?

2:03:18.140 --> 2:03:20.340
 Is there a hopeful message here

2:03:20.340 --> 2:03:22.660
 where other jobs are created?

2:03:22.660 --> 2:03:24.660
 So I'm a sociologist, right?

2:03:24.660 --> 2:03:28.380
 So I'm gonna think about what's the structure behind that

2:03:28.380 --> 2:03:30.140
 that creates that pain, right?

2:03:30.140 --> 2:03:32.860
 And it's ownership, right?

2:03:32.860 --> 2:03:35.660
 We don't call it capitalism for nothing.

2:03:35.660 --> 2:03:39.100
 What capitalists do is they figure out cheaper,

2:03:39.100 --> 2:03:40.700
 more efficient ways to do stuff.

2:03:40.700 --> 2:03:43.260
 And they use technology to do that oftentimes, right?

2:03:43.260 --> 2:03:47.620
 This is the remarkable history of the last couple centuries

2:03:47.620 --> 2:03:50.620
 and all the productivity gains is,

2:03:50.620 --> 2:03:54.460
 people who were in a competitive market saying,

2:03:54.460 --> 2:03:56.500
 if I have to do it, right?

2:03:56.500 --> 2:03:57.460
 I don't have a choice.

2:03:57.460 --> 2:04:00.420
 Cause like my competitor over there is gonna eat my lunch

2:04:00.420 --> 2:04:02.420
 if I'm not on my game.

2:04:03.540 --> 2:04:04.500
 I don't have a choice.

2:04:04.500 --> 2:04:06.780
 I've got to invest in this technology

2:04:06.780 --> 2:04:10.860
 to make it more efficient, to make it cheaper.

2:04:10.860 --> 2:04:12.300
 And what do you look for?

2:04:12.300 --> 2:04:16.060
 You look for oftentimes, you look for labor costs, right?

2:04:16.060 --> 2:04:17.460
 You look for high value labor.

2:04:17.460 --> 2:04:19.740
 If I can take a hundred and,

2:04:19.740 --> 2:04:21.060
 a lot of these truck drivers make good money,

2:04:21.060 --> 2:04:22.660
 a hundred thousand dollars, good benefits,

2:04:22.660 --> 2:04:25.340
 vacation, retirement.

2:04:25.340 --> 2:04:28.460
 If I can replace them with a $35,000 worker

2:04:28.460 --> 2:04:32.340
 when I'm competing with maybe a low wage retail employer

2:04:32.340 --> 2:04:34.700
 rather than some other more expensive employers

2:04:34.700 --> 2:04:39.020
 for skilled blue collar workers, I'm gonna do that.

2:04:39.020 --> 2:04:41.700
 And that's just, that's what we do.

2:04:41.700 --> 2:04:45.620
 And so I think those are the bigger questions

2:04:45.620 --> 2:04:46.820
 around this technology, right?

2:04:46.820 --> 2:04:50.140
 Is like, are workers gonna get screwed by this?

2:04:50.140 --> 2:04:51.580
 Like, yeah, most likely.

2:04:51.580 --> 2:04:54.060
 Like that's what we do.

2:04:54.060 --> 2:04:55.180
 So one of the things you say is,

2:04:55.180 --> 2:04:56.860
 I mean, first of all, the numbers of workers

2:04:56.860 --> 2:05:00.020
 that will feel this pain is not perhaps as large

2:05:00.020 --> 2:05:02.780
 as the journalists kind of articulate,

2:05:02.780 --> 2:05:05.260
 but nevertheless, the pain is real.

2:05:05.260 --> 2:05:10.260
 And I guess my question here is,

2:05:11.500 --> 2:05:12.860
 do you have an optimistic vision

2:05:12.860 --> 2:05:14.380
 about the transformative effects

2:05:14.380 --> 2:05:16.500
 of autonomous trucks on society?

2:05:17.420 --> 2:05:21.380
 Like if you look 20 years from now

2:05:21.380 --> 2:05:24.500
 and perhaps see maybe 30 years from now,

2:05:24.500 --> 2:05:26.580
 perhaps see these autonomous trucks

2:05:26.580 --> 2:05:30.260
 doing the various parts of the scenarios you listed.

2:05:30.260 --> 2:05:33.380
 And there's just hundreds of thousands of them,

2:05:33.380 --> 2:05:38.380
 just like veins, like blood flowing through veins

2:05:38.380 --> 2:05:40.420
 on the interstate system.

2:05:43.580 --> 2:05:46.300
 What kind of world do you see that's a better world

2:05:46.300 --> 2:05:48.460
 than today that involves such trucks?

2:05:48.460 --> 2:05:51.020
 Yeah, can I defend myself first?

2:05:51.020 --> 2:05:53.740
 Because I'm reading the comments right now

2:05:53.740 --> 2:05:56.020
 of people, of the economists who are telling me.

2:05:56.020 --> 2:05:59.500
 Another commenter, dear PhD in economics.

2:05:59.500 --> 2:06:02.540
 Yes, yes, dear PhD in economics,

2:06:02.540 --> 2:06:05.300
 I know that higher skilled jobs

2:06:05.300 --> 2:06:09.060
 are created by technological advancement, right?

2:06:09.060 --> 2:06:11.580
 I mean, there are big questions about how many of them,

2:06:11.580 --> 2:06:14.060
 right, so the idea that we would create

2:06:14.060 --> 2:06:19.060
 more expensive labor positions, right,

2:06:19.500 --> 2:06:20.660
 with a new technology, right?

2:06:20.660 --> 2:06:22.540
 You better check your business plan

2:06:22.540 --> 2:06:26.300
 if your idea is to take a bunch of low wage labor

2:06:26.300 --> 2:06:28.700
 and replace it with the same amount of high wage labor,

2:06:28.700 --> 2:06:31.740
 right, so there's a question about how many of those jobs.

2:06:31.740 --> 2:06:34.060
 And there's the really important social

2:06:34.060 --> 2:06:38.140
 and political question of are they the same people, right?

2:06:38.140 --> 2:06:39.700
 And do they live in the same places?

2:06:39.700 --> 2:06:42.460
 And I think that kind of geography

2:06:42.460 --> 2:06:45.380
 is a huge issue here with the impacts, right?

2:06:45.380 --> 2:06:47.540
 Lots of rural workers.

2:06:47.540 --> 2:06:50.020
 Interesting politically, lots of red state workers, right?

2:06:50.020 --> 2:06:51.940
 Lots of blue state, maybe union folks

2:06:51.940 --> 2:06:53.980
 who are gonna try to slow autonomy

2:06:53.980 --> 2:06:57.260
 and lots of red state representatives in the house maybe

2:06:57.260 --> 2:07:01.460
 who wanna stand up for their trucker constituents.

2:07:01.460 --> 2:07:03.220
 So just to defend myself.

2:07:03.220 --> 2:07:06.620
 Yeah, and to elaborate, I think economics as a field

2:07:06.620 --> 2:07:08.300
 is not good at measuring the landscape

2:07:08.300 --> 2:07:10.220
 of human pain and suffering.

2:07:10.220 --> 2:07:13.780
 So sometimes you can forget in the numbers

2:07:13.780 --> 2:07:15.380
 that it's real lives that are at stake.

2:07:15.380 --> 2:07:18.460
 That's what I suppose sociology is better at doing.

2:07:18.460 --> 2:07:20.660
 So we try sometimes, sometimes.

2:07:20.660 --> 2:07:22.140
 Well, the problem with, I mean,

2:07:22.140 --> 2:07:25.940
 I'm somebody who loves psychology and psychiatry

2:07:25.940 --> 2:07:28.820
 and a little bit, I guess, of sociology.

2:07:28.820 --> 2:07:33.260
 I realize how little, how tragically flawed the field is,

2:07:33.260 --> 2:07:34.740
 not because of lack of trying,

2:07:34.740 --> 2:07:37.420
 but just how difficult the problems are.

2:07:37.420 --> 2:07:39.740
 To do really thorough studies

2:07:39.740 --> 2:07:42.380
 that understand the fundamentals of human behavior

2:07:42.380 --> 2:07:45.740
 and this, yes, landscape of human suffering,

2:07:45.740 --> 2:07:48.700
 it's almost an impossible task without the data.

2:07:48.700 --> 2:07:53.540
 And we currently don't, not everybody's richly integrated

2:07:53.540 --> 2:07:54.900
 to where they're fully connected

2:07:54.900 --> 2:07:58.700
 and all their information is being recorded

2:07:58.700 --> 2:08:00.580
 for sociologists to study.

2:08:00.580 --> 2:08:02.260
 So you have to make a lot of inferences.

2:08:02.260 --> 2:08:03.460
 You have to talk to people.

2:08:03.460 --> 2:08:05.140
 You have to do the interviews as you're doing.

2:08:05.140 --> 2:08:07.860
 And through that really difficult work,

2:08:07.860 --> 2:08:11.660
 try to understand, hear the music

2:08:11.660 --> 2:08:13.420
 that nobody else is hearing,

2:08:13.420 --> 2:08:15.820
 the music of what people are feeling,

2:08:15.820 --> 2:08:19.780
 their hopes, their dreams, and the crushing of their dreams

2:08:19.780 --> 2:08:22.300
 due to some kind of economic forces.

2:08:22.300 --> 2:08:24.660
 Yeah, I mean, we've just lived that

2:08:24.660 --> 2:08:28.620
 for four and a half years of probably elites,

2:08:28.620 --> 2:08:30.820
 let me just go out on a limb and say,

2:08:30.820 --> 2:08:33.740
 not understanding the sort of emotional

2:08:33.740 --> 2:08:35.020
 and psychological currents

2:08:35.020 --> 2:08:37.780
 of a large portion of the population, right?

2:08:37.780 --> 2:08:41.180
 And just being stunned by it and confused, right?

2:08:41.180 --> 2:08:46.180
 It wasn't confusing for me after having talked to truckers.

2:08:46.180 --> 2:08:48.860
 Again, trucking is a job of last resort.

2:08:48.860 --> 2:08:50.540
 These are people who've already lost

2:08:50.540 --> 2:08:52.380
 that manufacturing job oftentimes,

2:08:52.380 --> 2:08:57.380
 already lost that construction job to just aging, right?

2:08:57.380 --> 2:08:59.500
 So what can we do, right?

2:08:59.500 --> 2:09:01.100
 What's sort of the positive vision?

2:09:01.100 --> 2:09:04.140
 Because like, we've got tons of highway deaths.

2:09:04.140 --> 2:09:09.140
 We've got, and just the big picture is,

2:09:09.140 --> 2:09:12.180
 and this is the opportunity, I guess, for investors,

2:09:13.060 --> 2:09:15.660
 it's a hugely inefficient system.

2:09:15.660 --> 2:09:17.340
 So we buy this truck,

2:09:17.340 --> 2:09:19.660
 there's this low wage worker in it oftentimes.

2:09:19.660 --> 2:09:21.900
 And again, I'm setting aside those really good

2:09:21.900 --> 2:09:24.640
 line haul jobs in LTL, those are a different case.

2:09:26.140 --> 2:09:30.540
 That low wage worker is driving a truck that they might,

2:09:30.540 --> 2:09:32.460
 the wheels might roll seven to eight hours a day.

2:09:32.460 --> 2:09:33.940
 That's what the truck is designed to do

2:09:33.940 --> 2:09:36.300
 and that's what makes the money for the company.

2:09:36.300 --> 2:09:37.980
 In other seven, eight hours a day,

2:09:37.980 --> 2:09:39.860
 the driver's doing other kinds of work

2:09:39.860 --> 2:09:41.940
 that is not driving.

2:09:41.940 --> 2:09:42.820
 And then the rest of the day,

2:09:42.820 --> 2:09:45.540
 they're basically living out of the truck.

2:09:45.540 --> 2:09:49.020
 You really can't find a more inefficient use of an asset

2:09:49.020 --> 2:09:51.140
 than that, right?

2:09:51.140 --> 2:09:53.020
 Now, a big part of that is we pay for the roads

2:09:53.020 --> 2:09:55.660
 and we pay for the rest areas and all this other stuff.

2:09:55.660 --> 2:09:59.100
 So the way that I work and the way that I think

2:09:59.100 --> 2:10:01.380
 about these problems is I try to find analogies, right?

2:10:01.380 --> 2:10:04.620
 Sort of labor processes and things that make economic sense

2:10:04.620 --> 2:10:09.620
 that seem in the same area of the economy,

2:10:11.580 --> 2:10:15.420
 but have some different characteristics for workers, right?

2:10:15.420 --> 2:10:17.020
 And sort of try to figure out

2:10:17.020 --> 2:10:19.540
 why does the economics work there, right?

2:10:19.540 --> 2:10:24.460
 And so if you look at those really good jobs,

2:10:24.460 --> 2:10:29.100
 the most likely way that you as a passenger car driver

2:10:29.100 --> 2:10:30.820
 would know that it's one of those drivers

2:10:30.820 --> 2:10:33.060
 is that there are multiple trailers, right?

2:10:33.060 --> 2:10:35.580
 So you see these, like maybe it's three small trailers,

2:10:35.580 --> 2:10:37.860
 maybe it's two sort of medium sized trailers.

2:10:37.860 --> 2:10:39.020
 Some places you might even see

2:10:39.020 --> 2:10:40.700
 two really big trailers together.

2:10:42.260 --> 2:10:44.500
 You do that because labor is expensive, right?

2:10:44.500 --> 2:10:45.660
 And it's highly skilled.

2:10:45.660 --> 2:10:48.740
 And so you use it efficiently and you say, all right,

2:10:48.740 --> 2:10:51.340
 rather than having you haul that little trailer

2:10:51.340 --> 2:10:54.020
 out of the ports, that sort of half size container,

2:10:54.020 --> 2:10:55.100
 we're gonna wait till we get three

2:10:55.100 --> 2:10:56.540
 or we're gonna coordinate the movement

2:10:56.540 --> 2:10:57.780
 so that they're three ready.

2:10:57.780 --> 2:11:00.580
 You go do what truckers call make a set,

2:11:00.580 --> 2:11:03.140
 put them together, right, and you go.

2:11:04.020 --> 2:11:06.060
 That's a massive productivity gain, right?

2:11:06.060 --> 2:11:09.860
 Because you're hauling two, three times as much freight.

2:11:09.860 --> 2:11:13.820
 So the positive scenario that I threw out in 2018

2:11:13.820 --> 2:11:18.740
 was why not have a human driven truck

2:11:18.740 --> 2:11:20.660
 with a self driving truck that follows it, right?

2:11:20.660 --> 2:11:21.940
 Just a drone unit.

2:11:23.180 --> 2:11:28.180
 And to me, this seemed as a non computer scientist,

2:11:28.180 --> 2:11:31.180
 a non computer scientist, a sociologist, right?

2:11:31.180 --> 2:11:33.620
 This made a lot of sense because when I got done talking

2:11:33.620 --> 2:11:36.740
 to the computer scientists and the engineers,

2:11:36.740 --> 2:11:38.940
 they were like, well, it's like object recognition,

2:11:38.940 --> 2:11:40.740
 decision making algorithm, all this stuff.

2:11:40.740 --> 2:11:43.460
 It's like, all right, so why don't you leave

2:11:43.460 --> 2:11:46.820
 the human brain in the lead vehicle, right?

2:11:46.820 --> 2:11:50.620
 You got all that processing and then all that following.

2:11:50.620 --> 2:11:54.620
 Now, again, this is sort of me being a lay person.

2:11:54.620 --> 2:11:57.140
 I said, why don't, then that following truck, right,

2:11:57.140 --> 2:11:58.380
 makes direction from the front.

2:11:58.380 --> 2:12:01.140
 It uses the rear of the trailer as a reference point.

2:12:01.140 --> 2:12:02.220
 It maintains the lane.

2:12:02.220 --> 2:12:04.740
 You've got cooperative adaptive cruise control

2:12:04.740 --> 2:12:08.700
 and that you double the productivity of that driver.

2:12:08.700 --> 2:12:11.620
 You solve that problem that I hated

2:12:11.620 --> 2:12:15.700
 in my urban truck ports thing about the bridge weight.

2:12:15.700 --> 2:12:17.500
 Cause when you get to the bridges,

2:12:17.500 --> 2:12:20.380
 the two trucks can just spread out just enough

2:12:20.380 --> 2:12:21.500
 to make the bridge weight, right?

2:12:21.500 --> 2:12:22.740
 And you can just program that in

2:12:22.740 --> 2:12:24.580
 and they're 50 feet further apart,

2:12:24.580 --> 2:12:28.420
 100 feet further apart.

2:12:28.420 --> 2:12:32.500
 So interesting sort of, I think, story about this

2:12:32.500 --> 2:12:35.220
 that leads to kind of, I think, the policy questions.

2:12:36.700 --> 2:12:41.700
 In, I guess, 2017, Jack Reed and Susan Collins

2:12:42.260 --> 2:12:44.580
 and requested from the Senate,

2:12:44.580 --> 2:12:47.180
 the Senate requested research on what the impacts

2:12:47.180 --> 2:12:48.820
 of self driving trucks would be.

2:12:48.820 --> 2:12:51.780
 And the first stage of that was for the GAO

2:12:51.780 --> 2:12:56.780
 to do a report, sort of looking at the lay of the land,

2:12:56.940 --> 2:12:58.260
 talking to some experts.

2:12:59.420 --> 2:13:03.180
 And I was working on my 2018 report,

2:13:03.180 --> 2:13:06.260
 help contribute to that GAO report.

2:13:06.260 --> 2:13:08.940
 And I had the six scenarios, right?

2:13:08.940 --> 2:13:12.180
 I'm like, okay, here's what Starsky's doing.

2:13:12.180 --> 2:13:16.060
 Here's what Embark and Uber are doing.

2:13:16.060 --> 2:13:18.580
 Here's what Waymo might be doing.

2:13:18.580 --> 2:13:20.700
 Nobody really knows, right?

2:13:20.700 --> 2:13:22.300
 Here's what Peloton's doing.

2:13:23.340 --> 2:13:25.300
 Here's the autopilot scenario.

2:13:25.300 --> 2:13:27.180
 And then here's this one that I think

2:13:27.180 --> 2:13:29.500
 actually could be good for drivers.

2:13:29.500 --> 2:13:31.900
 So now you've got that driver who's got

2:13:31.900 --> 2:13:34.460
 two times the freight.

2:13:34.460 --> 2:13:35.700
 Their decisions are more important.

2:13:35.700 --> 2:13:37.660
 They're managing a more complex system, right?

2:13:37.660 --> 2:13:38.620
 They're probably gonna have to have

2:13:38.620 --> 2:13:40.620
 some global understanding of how to,

2:13:40.620 --> 2:13:42.540
 the environments in which it can operate safely, right?

2:13:42.540 --> 2:13:44.580
 Now we're talking upskilling, right?

2:13:44.580 --> 2:13:49.580
 And so the GAO sort of writes up these different scenarios

2:13:52.260 --> 2:13:54.340
 and the idea is that it's gonna prepare

2:13:54.340 --> 2:13:56.020
 for this Department of Transportation,

2:13:56.020 --> 2:13:58.780
 Department of Labor set of processes

2:13:58.780 --> 2:14:03.780
 to engage stakeholders and sort of get industry perspectives

2:14:05.300 --> 2:14:07.700
 and then do a study on the labor impacts.

2:14:07.700 --> 2:14:12.700
 So that DOT, DOL process starts to happen

2:14:12.700 --> 2:14:17.700
 and I get to the workshop and a friend was sitting

2:14:18.180 --> 2:14:22.460
 at the table next to me and he holds up the scenarios

2:14:22.460 --> 2:14:24.980
 that they're gonna have us discuss at this workshop.

2:14:24.980 --> 2:14:27.900
 And he's like, hey, these look really familiar, right?

2:14:27.900 --> 2:14:30.740
 They were the scenarios from the report,

2:14:30.740 --> 2:14:33.740
 but there were only five instead of six.

2:14:33.740 --> 2:14:34.860
 Interesting.

2:14:34.860 --> 2:14:37.900
 The sixth scenario, which was the upskilling labor,

2:14:37.900 --> 2:14:42.180
 good for workers scenario, wasn't discussed.

2:14:42.180 --> 2:14:45.700
 So to clarify that the integral piece of technology

2:14:45.700 --> 2:14:47.420
 there is platooning.

2:14:47.420 --> 2:14:50.020
 Yeah, I mean, in a sense it's platooning,

2:14:50.020 --> 2:14:54.940
 but, and in fairness, right, as I pitched that idea

2:14:54.940 --> 2:14:58.660
 or sort of ran that idea by the computer scientists

2:14:58.660 --> 2:15:01.540
 and engineers and product managers that I would talk to,

2:15:01.540 --> 2:15:05.340
 they would say, we thought about that,

2:15:05.340 --> 2:15:09.660
 but that following truck, it's not that simple.

2:15:09.660 --> 2:15:12.620
 That thing, basically we had to engineer that

2:15:12.620 --> 2:15:15.980
 to be capable of independent self driving,

2:15:15.980 --> 2:15:17.660
 because what if there was a cut in

2:15:17.660 --> 2:15:21.660
 or any number of scenarios in which it lost

2:15:21.660 --> 2:15:25.260
 that connection to the lead truck for whatever reason.

2:15:25.260 --> 2:15:26.340
 Now, I mean, I don't know.

2:15:26.340 --> 2:15:29.700
 Boo hoo, platooning is hard.

2:15:29.700 --> 2:15:30.700
 There's edge cases.

2:15:30.700 --> 2:15:33.740
 I guarantee the number of edge cases in platooning

2:15:33.740 --> 2:15:37.380
 is orders of magnitude lower than the number of edge cases

2:15:37.380 --> 2:15:40.660
 in the general solo full self drive.

2:15:40.660 --> 2:15:43.860
 You do not need to solve the full self driving problem.

2:15:43.860 --> 2:15:46.300
 I mean, if you're talking about

2:15:46.300 --> 2:15:49.340
 probability of dangerous events,

2:15:49.340 --> 2:15:50.860
 it just seems with platooning,

2:15:50.860 --> 2:15:54.780
 then like you can deal with cut ins.

2:15:54.780 --> 2:15:56.820
 Yeah, so this is beyond,

2:15:56.820 --> 2:15:59.180
 this is one of the challenge obviously of being a researcher

2:15:59.180 --> 2:16:02.140
 who doesn't really have any background

2:16:02.140 --> 2:16:04.500
 in the technology, right?

2:16:04.500 --> 2:16:05.780
 So I can dream this up.

2:16:05.780 --> 2:16:08.140
 I don't, you know, I have no idea if it's feasible.

2:16:08.140 --> 2:16:10.700
 Well, let me speak, you spoke to the PhDs in economics.

2:16:10.700 --> 2:16:12.940
 Let me speak to the PhDs in computer science.

2:16:12.940 --> 2:16:14.580
 If you think platooning is as hard

2:16:14.580 --> 2:16:16.220
 as the full self driving problem,

2:16:17.940 --> 2:16:20.380
 we need to talk, because I think that's ridiculous.

2:16:20.380 --> 2:16:22.820
 I think platooning, and in fact,

2:16:22.820 --> 2:16:24.500
 I think platooning is an interesting idea

2:16:24.500 --> 2:16:26.700
 for ride sharing as well,

2:16:26.700 --> 2:16:28.420
 for the general autonomous driving problem,

2:16:28.420 --> 2:16:30.380
 not just trucking, but obviously trucking

2:16:30.380 --> 2:16:32.140
 is the big, big benefit,

2:16:32.140 --> 2:16:35.380
 because the number of A to B points in trucking

2:16:35.380 --> 2:16:38.100
 is much, much lower than the general ride sharing problem.

2:16:38.100 --> 2:16:40.460
 But anyway, I think that's a great idea,

2:16:40.460 --> 2:16:42.660
 but you're saying it was removed.

2:16:42.660 --> 2:16:44.980
 Yeah, and so you can go, you know,

2:16:44.980 --> 2:16:47.180
 and listeners could go to these reports.

2:16:47.180 --> 2:16:48.700
 They're publicly available.

2:16:48.700 --> 2:16:51.540
 And they explain why in the footnote.

2:16:51.540 --> 2:16:54.980
 And they note that there was this other scenario

2:16:54.980 --> 2:16:56.140
 suggested by at least me,

2:16:56.140 --> 2:16:58.980
 and I can't remember if they said someone else did too.

2:16:58.980 --> 2:17:01.920
 But they said, you know, we didn't include it

2:17:01.920 --> 2:17:04.980
 because no developers were working on it.

2:17:04.980 --> 2:17:05.860
 Interesting.

2:17:05.860 --> 2:17:07.460
 Full disclosure,

2:17:07.460 --> 2:17:11.100
 that was the approach that I took in my research, right?

2:17:11.100 --> 2:17:13.380
 Which was to go to the developers and say,

2:17:13.380 --> 2:17:14.860
 what's your vision, right?

2:17:14.860 --> 2:17:16.980
 What are you trying to develop?

2:17:17.820 --> 2:17:19.020
 That's what I was trying to do.

2:17:19.020 --> 2:17:20.140
 And maybe, you know,

2:17:20.140 --> 2:17:22.220
 and then I tried to think outside the box at the end

2:17:22.220 --> 2:17:23.300
 by adding that one, right?

2:17:23.300 --> 2:17:24.460
 Like, here's one that I have, you know,

2:17:24.460 --> 2:17:25.960
 people aren't talking about that could be cool.

2:17:25.960 --> 2:17:29.100
 Now, again, it had been proposed in like 2014

2:17:29.100 --> 2:17:31.340
 for like fuel convoys.

2:17:31.340 --> 2:17:35.060
 So you could just have like one super armored lead fuel

2:17:35.060 --> 2:17:35.900
 truck, right?

2:17:35.900 --> 2:17:38.180
 In a, you know, bringing fuel to forward operating bases

2:17:38.180 --> 2:17:39.140
 in Afghanistan.

2:17:39.140 --> 2:17:41.980
 And then you wouldn't need, you know, the super heavy,

2:17:41.980 --> 2:17:43.280
 you know, you wouldn't have to protect the human life

2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:44.120
 in the following truck.

2:17:44.120 --> 2:17:44.960
 So that's interesting.

2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:46.540
 You're saying like, when you talk to Waymo,

2:17:46.540 --> 2:17:48.540
 when you talk to these kinds of companies,

2:17:48.540 --> 2:17:52.100
 they weren't at least openly saying they're working on this.

2:17:52.100 --> 2:17:56.100
 So then it doesn't make sense to include in the list.

2:17:56.100 --> 2:17:56.940
 Yeah.

2:17:56.940 --> 2:17:58.620
 And so, but here's the thing, right?

2:17:58.620 --> 2:18:01.060
 This is the Department of Transportation, right?

2:18:01.060 --> 2:18:03.100
 And the Department of Labor.

2:18:03.100 --> 2:18:04.740
 Maybe they could consider some scenarios.

2:18:04.740 --> 2:18:07.560
 Like maybe we could say, you know, this, we,

2:18:07.560 --> 2:18:08.960
 this technology has got a lot of potential.

2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:10.580
 Here's what we'd like it to do.

2:18:10.580 --> 2:18:12.700
 You know, we'd like it to reduce highway deaths,

2:18:12.700 --> 2:18:14.880
 help us fight climate change, reduce congestion,

2:18:14.880 --> 2:18:16.740
 you know, all these other, other things.

2:18:16.740 --> 2:18:19.100
 But that's not how our policy conversation

2:18:19.100 --> 2:18:20.520
 around technology is happening.

2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:24.660
 We're not, and people don't think that we should.

2:18:24.660 --> 2:18:26.420
 And I think that's the fundamental shift

2:18:26.420 --> 2:18:27.820
 that we need to have, right?

2:18:27.820 --> 2:18:31.740
 I've been involved with this a little bit like NHTSA and DOT.

2:18:31.740 --> 2:18:33.340
 The approach they took is saying,

2:18:33.340 --> 2:18:34.900
 we don't know what the heck we're doing.

2:18:34.900 --> 2:18:38.300
 So we're going to just let the innovators do their thing

2:18:38.300 --> 2:18:41.360
 and not regulate it for a while, just to see.

2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:42.820
 You don't, you think that's,

2:18:43.680 --> 2:18:46.500
 you think DOT should provide ideas themselves.

2:18:46.500 --> 2:18:49.900
 Well, so this is the, this is the great trick

2:18:49.900 --> 2:18:53.660
 in policy of private actors,

2:18:53.660 --> 2:18:58.660
 is you get narrow mandates for government agencies, right?

2:18:58.680 --> 2:19:01.900
 So, you know, the safety case will be handled

2:19:01.900 --> 2:19:04.780
 by organizations whose mandate is safety.

2:19:04.780 --> 2:19:07.780
 So the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,

2:19:07.780 --> 2:19:11.180
 who is, you know, going to be a key player,

2:19:11.180 --> 2:19:13.540
 I argue in an article that I wrote, you know,

2:19:13.540 --> 2:19:15.620
 they're going to be a key player in actually determining

2:19:15.620 --> 2:19:17.980
 which scenario is most profitable

2:19:17.980 --> 2:19:20.140
 by setting the rules for truck drivers.

2:19:20.140 --> 2:19:22.380
 Their mandate is safety, right?

2:19:22.380 --> 2:19:25.060
 Now they have lots of good people there who want,

2:19:25.060 --> 2:19:26.460
 you know, who care about truck drivers

2:19:26.460 --> 2:19:29.340
 and who wish truck drivers jobs were better,

2:19:29.340 --> 2:19:32.860
 but they don't have the authority to say,

2:19:32.860 --> 2:19:34.020
 hey, we're going to write this rule

2:19:34.020 --> 2:19:35.580
 because it's good for truck drivers, right?

2:19:35.580 --> 2:19:40.300
 And so when you, you know, we need to say,

2:19:40.300 --> 2:19:44.020
 you know, as a society, we need to not restrict technology,

2:19:44.020 --> 2:19:45.620
 not stand in the way of things.

2:19:45.620 --> 2:19:48.860
 We need to harness it towards the goals that matter, right?

2:19:48.860 --> 2:19:52.060
 Not whatever comes out the end of the pipeline

2:19:52.060 --> 2:19:53.780
 because it's the easiest thing to develop

2:19:53.780 --> 2:19:57.060
 or whatever is most profitable for the first actor

2:19:57.060 --> 2:19:58.740
 or whatever, but, you know, and we do,

2:19:58.740 --> 2:20:00.740
 the thing is we do that, right?

2:20:00.740 --> 2:20:04.220
 I mean, like when we sent people to the moon,

2:20:04.220 --> 2:20:06.140
 you know, we did that,

2:20:06.140 --> 2:20:07.820
 and there were tremendous benefits

2:20:07.820 --> 2:20:09.380
 that followed from it, right?

2:20:09.380 --> 2:20:11.420
 And we do this all the time in, you know,

2:20:11.420 --> 2:20:13.580
 trying to cure cancer or whatever it is, right?

2:20:13.580 --> 2:20:17.220
 I mean, we can do this, right?

2:20:17.220 --> 2:20:21.940
 Now the interesting sort of epilogue to that story is,

2:20:21.940 --> 2:20:25.180
 you know, six months or so, I don't know how long it was,

2:20:25.180 --> 2:20:28.220
 after those meetings in which that sixth scenario

2:20:28.220 --> 2:20:32.780
 was not considered, a company called Locomation,

2:20:33.780 --> 2:20:36.660
 you know, ends up using that,

2:20:36.660 --> 2:20:39.940
 essentially that basic scenario with a slight variation.

2:20:39.940 --> 2:20:43.780
 So they leave the human driver in both trucks

2:20:43.780 --> 2:20:46.100
 and then that following driver goes off duty.

2:20:46.100 --> 2:20:50.020
 And then, you know, I've been trying to think

2:20:50.020 --> 2:20:50.940
 of what the term is, they kind of,

2:20:50.940 --> 2:20:52.860
 I think of it as like slingshotting,

2:20:52.860 --> 2:20:54.460
 they sort of, when one runs out of hours,

2:20:54.460 --> 2:20:56.500
 you know, the one who's off duty goes in front and,

2:20:56.500 --> 2:21:00.540
 you know, and so, you know, if only they had been,

2:21:01.380 --> 2:21:04.380
 you know, around six months earlier,

2:21:04.380 --> 2:21:06.460
 that might've been considered by the OT,

2:21:06.460 --> 2:21:08.620
 but it just says, you know, who has the authority

2:21:08.620 --> 2:21:10.820
 to propose what these visions of the future are?

2:21:10.820 --> 2:21:13.740
 Well, some of it is also just the company stepping up

2:21:13.740 --> 2:21:16.300
 and just doing it, screw the authority,

2:21:16.300 --> 2:21:18.020
 and showing that it's possible,

2:21:18.020 --> 2:21:19.660
 and then the authority follows.

2:21:19.660 --> 2:21:24.660
 So that's why I really love innovators in the space.

2:21:24.740 --> 2:21:29.460
 The criticism I have, the very sort of real,

2:21:29.460 --> 2:21:31.020
 I don't know, harsh criticism I have

2:21:31.020 --> 2:21:34.380
 towards autonomous vehicle companies in the space

2:21:34.380 --> 2:21:37.140
 is they've gotten culturally,

2:21:38.140 --> 2:21:41.380
 they've, it's become acceptable somehow

2:21:42.780 --> 2:21:45.380
 to do demos and videos,

2:21:46.260 --> 2:21:48.740
 as opposed to the old school American way

2:21:48.740 --> 2:21:50.580
 of solving problems.

2:21:50.580 --> 2:21:53.220
 There's a culture in Silicon Valley

2:21:53.220 --> 2:21:54.820
 where you're talking to VCs

2:21:56.100 --> 2:22:01.100
 that have lost that kind of love of solving problems.

2:22:01.860 --> 2:22:03.700
 They kind of like envision,

2:22:03.700 --> 2:22:07.340
 if the story you told me in your PowerPoint presentation

2:22:07.340 --> 2:22:09.380
 is true, how many trillions of dollars

2:22:09.380 --> 2:22:10.700
 might I be able to make?

2:22:10.700 --> 2:22:13.220
 There's something lost in that conversation

2:22:13.220 --> 2:22:16.900
 where you're not really taking on like the problem

2:22:16.900 --> 2:22:19.660
 in a real way, so these autonomous vehicle companies

2:22:19.660 --> 2:22:21.020
 realize we don't need to,

2:22:21.020 --> 2:22:24.140
 we just need to make nice PowerPoint presentations

2:22:24.140 --> 2:22:26.020
 and not actually deliver products

2:22:26.020 --> 2:22:29.380
 that like everybody looks outside and says,

2:22:29.380 --> 2:22:31.980
 holy shit, this is life changing.

2:22:31.980 --> 2:22:34.180
 This is where I have to give props to Waymo

2:22:34.180 --> 2:22:37.980
 is they put driverless cars on the road

2:22:37.980 --> 2:22:41.500
 and like forget PowerPoint slide presentations,

2:22:41.500 --> 2:22:42.540
 actual cars on the road.

2:22:42.540 --> 2:22:43.980
 Then you can criticize like,

2:22:43.980 --> 2:22:45.580
 is that actually going to work?

2:22:45.580 --> 2:22:48.300
 Who knows, but the thing is they have cars on the road

2:22:48.300 --> 2:22:49.780
 and that's why I have to give props to Tesla.

2:22:49.780 --> 2:22:52.940
 They have whatever you want to say about risk

2:22:52.940 --> 2:22:54.180
 and all those kinds of things,

2:22:54.180 --> 2:22:55.700
 they have cars on the road

2:22:55.700 --> 2:22:57.380
 that have some level of automation

2:22:57.380 --> 2:23:00.260
 and soon they have trucks on the road as well.

2:23:00.260 --> 2:23:03.900
 And that kind of, that component,

2:23:03.900 --> 2:23:06.780
 I think is important part of the policy conversation

2:23:06.780 --> 2:23:10.300
 because you start getting data from these companies

2:23:10.300 --> 2:23:12.140
 that are willing to take the big risks

2:23:12.140 --> 2:23:14.380
 as opposed to making slide decks,

2:23:14.380 --> 2:23:16.620
 they're actually putting cars on the road

2:23:16.620 --> 2:23:19.340
 and like real lives are at stake.

2:23:19.340 --> 2:23:21.980
 They could be lost and they could bankrupt the company

2:23:21.980 --> 2:23:23.500
 if they make the wrong decisions.

2:23:23.500 --> 2:23:25.900
 And that's deeply admirable to me.

2:23:25.900 --> 2:23:28.940
 Speaking of which I have to ask Waymo trucks,

2:23:28.940 --> 2:23:31.020
 I think it's called Waymo Via.

2:23:31.980 --> 2:23:34.660
 So I'm talking to the head of trucking at Waymo.

2:23:34.660 --> 2:23:35.620
 I don't know if you've gotten a chance

2:23:35.620 --> 2:23:37.380
 to interact with them.

2:23:37.380 --> 2:23:39.500
 What's a good question to ask the guy?

2:23:39.500 --> 2:23:41.340
 What's a good question of Waymo?

2:23:41.340 --> 2:23:45.060
 Because they seem to be one of the leaders in the space.

2:23:45.060 --> 2:23:47.700
 They have the zen like calm

2:23:47.700 --> 2:23:51.540
 of like being willing to stick with it for the longterm

2:23:51.540 --> 2:23:53.340
 in order to solve the problem.

2:23:53.340 --> 2:23:55.860
 Yeah, and I guess they have that luxury, right?

2:23:56.860 --> 2:23:58.420
 Which I don't think I,

2:23:59.380 --> 2:24:01.860
 if I had another life as a researcher,

2:24:01.860 --> 2:24:05.380
 I would love to just study the business strategies

2:24:05.380 --> 2:24:10.020
 of startups and Silicon Valley sort of structure.

2:24:10.020 --> 2:24:12.180
 Would you consider Waymo a startup?

2:24:12.180 --> 2:24:13.020
 No.

2:24:13.020 --> 2:24:13.860
 No.

2:24:13.860 --> 2:24:14.700
 No, right?

2:24:14.700 --> 2:24:16.260
 I mean, it's at least not in the things

2:24:16.260 --> 2:24:18.940
 that seem to matter in this self driving space.

2:24:18.940 --> 2:24:20.700
 So you mentioned the demos,

2:24:21.980 --> 2:24:24.340
 and I don't have enough data as a sociologist

2:24:24.340 --> 2:24:27.260
 to really say like, oh, this is why they do what they do.

2:24:27.260 --> 2:24:30.020
 But my hypothesis is,

2:24:30.020 --> 2:24:33.500
 there's a real scarcity of talent and money for this.

2:24:33.500 --> 2:24:36.260
 And there certainly was a scarcity of like partnerships

2:24:36.260 --> 2:24:39.940
 with OEMs and the big trucking companies.

2:24:39.940 --> 2:24:42.020
 And there was a race for it, right?

2:24:42.020 --> 2:24:47.020
 And the way that if you don't have the backing of Alphabet,

2:24:47.900 --> 2:24:49.820
 you do a demo, right?

2:24:49.820 --> 2:24:52.060
 And you get a few more good engineers who say,

2:24:52.060 --> 2:24:54.060
 hey, look, they did that cool thing.

2:24:54.060 --> 2:24:56.700
 Like Anthony Levandowski did with Otto

2:24:56.700 --> 2:25:00.140
 and that resulted in the Uber purchase of that program.

2:25:01.700 --> 2:25:03.220
 So what would I ask?

2:25:03.220 --> 2:25:06.580
 I mean, I think I would ask a lot of questions,

2:25:06.580 --> 2:25:07.420
 but I think the markets.

2:25:07.420 --> 2:25:09.780
 Well, there's also on record and off record conversations

2:25:09.780 --> 2:25:11.420
 which unfortunately,

2:25:11.420 --> 2:25:14.300
 I'm asking for an on record conversation.

2:25:14.300 --> 2:25:18.700
 And that I don't know if these companies

2:25:18.700 --> 2:25:21.780
 are willing to have interesting on record conversations.

2:25:21.780 --> 2:25:24.780
 Yeah, I mean, I assume that like there are questions

2:25:24.780 --> 2:25:26.180
 that I don't think you'd have to ask.

2:25:26.180 --> 2:25:28.620
 Like I assume they're gonna be actually driverless, right?

2:25:28.620 --> 2:25:31.220
 They're not gonna like keep the driver in there.

2:25:31.220 --> 2:25:33.460
 So I mean, for the industry,

2:25:33.460 --> 2:25:35.660
 I think it would be interesting to know

2:25:36.580 --> 2:25:39.380
 where they see that first adopter, right?

2:25:39.380 --> 2:25:42.020
 Oh, you mean from like the scenarios that laid out

2:25:42.020 --> 2:25:44.060
 which one are they going to take on?

2:25:44.060 --> 2:25:45.820
 Yeah, I mean, cause that's gonna,

2:25:45.820 --> 2:25:48.500
 again, it's those really expensive good jobs, right?

2:25:48.500 --> 2:25:51.380
 So those LTL jobs, the like UPS jobs.

2:25:51.380 --> 2:25:54.060
 Now that's gonna be, that's where labor is too, right?

2:25:54.060 --> 2:25:54.980
 That's where the teamsters are.

2:25:54.980 --> 2:25:57.220
 That's the only place they are left, right?

2:25:57.220 --> 2:26:00.460
 So that's gonna be the big fight on the hill

2:26:00.460 --> 2:26:03.300
 and if labor can muster it, right?

2:26:03.300 --> 2:26:04.140
 I don't know.

2:26:04.940 --> 2:26:06.460
 There's a really cool,

2:26:06.460 --> 2:26:10.340
 like one thing I would recommend to you and your listeners,

2:26:10.340 --> 2:26:13.180
 if you really wanna see some like a remarkable page

2:26:13.180 --> 2:26:15.860
 in sort of the history of labor and automation,

2:26:15.860 --> 2:26:18.780
 there's a report that Harry Bridges,

2:26:18.780 --> 2:26:23.620
 who was the socialist leader of the Longshoremen

2:26:23.620 --> 2:26:26.300
 on the West Coast and just, you know, galvanize that union

2:26:26.300 --> 2:26:28.340
 and they still control the ports today

2:26:28.340 --> 2:26:31.860
 because of the sort of vision that he laid down.

2:26:31.860 --> 2:26:35.780
 In the 1960s, he put out a photo journal report

2:26:35.780 --> 2:26:39.220
 called Men and Machines and basically what it was,

2:26:39.220 --> 2:26:42.060
 was it was an internal education campaign

2:26:42.060 --> 2:26:44.020
 to convince the membership

2:26:44.020 --> 2:26:46.700
 that they had to go along with automation.

2:26:46.700 --> 2:26:48.260
 Machines were coming for their jobs

2:26:48.260 --> 2:26:49.900
 and what the photo journal,

2:26:49.900 --> 2:26:51.900
 it's almost like a hundred pages or something like that

2:26:51.900 --> 2:26:54.100
 is like, here's how we used to do it.

2:26:54.100 --> 2:26:56.140
 Some of you old timers remember it.

2:26:56.140 --> 2:26:58.620
 Like we used to take the barrels of olive oil

2:26:58.620 --> 2:27:01.500
 and we'd stack them in the hold and we'd roll them by hand

2:27:01.500 --> 2:27:03.340
 and we'd put the timber in and we'd, you know,

2:27:03.340 --> 2:27:05.620
 stack the crates tight, you know,

2:27:05.620 --> 2:27:07.620
 and that was the pride of the Longshoremen,

2:27:07.620 --> 2:27:09.980
 was a tight stow.

2:27:09.980 --> 2:27:12.020
 And now you all know, you know,

2:27:12.020 --> 2:27:13.300
 there are cranes that come down

2:27:13.300 --> 2:27:15.540
 and there's no longer any, you know, rope slings

2:27:15.540 --> 2:27:17.740
 and we're loading bulldozers into the hold

2:27:17.740 --> 2:27:19.660
 to push the ore up into piles

2:27:19.660 --> 2:27:21.180
 and then clamshells are coming down

2:27:21.180 --> 2:27:25.140
 and he made this case to them and he said,

2:27:25.140 --> 2:27:27.820
 this is why we're signing this agreement

2:27:27.820 --> 2:27:32.820
 to basically allow the employer to automate

2:27:33.140 --> 2:27:34.740
 and we're gonna lose jobs,

2:27:34.740 --> 2:27:37.660
 but we're gonna get a share of the benefits.

2:27:37.660 --> 2:27:39.300
 And so our wages are gonna go up.

2:27:39.300 --> 2:27:41.100
 We're gonna continue to control the hiring

2:27:41.100 --> 2:27:42.620
 and training of workers.

2:27:42.620 --> 2:27:44.060
 Our numbers are gonna go down,

2:27:44.060 --> 2:27:46.500
 but you know, basically that last son of a bitch

2:27:46.500 --> 2:27:48.060
 who's working at the ports,

2:27:48.060 --> 2:27:51.500
 he's gonna be one really well paid son of a bitch,

2:27:51.500 --> 2:27:53.900
 you know, he may just be one standing,

2:27:53.900 --> 2:27:55.580
 but he's gonna love his job.

2:27:56.660 --> 2:27:57.860
 You should check out that report.

2:27:57.860 --> 2:27:59.700
 That's an interesting vision of a future

2:27:59.700 --> 2:28:01.940
 that probably still holds.

2:28:01.940 --> 2:28:04.140
 That is, I mean, there is some level

2:28:04.140 --> 2:28:07.100
 to which you have to embrace the automation.

2:28:07.100 --> 2:28:08.540
 Yeah, I mean, and who gets, you know,

2:28:08.540 --> 2:28:09.500
 it's the benefits, right?

2:28:09.500 --> 2:28:12.060
 It's like, I mean, think of the public dollars

2:28:12.060 --> 2:28:14.020
 that went into developing self driving vehicles

2:28:14.020 --> 2:28:14.900
 in the early days, right?

2:28:14.900 --> 2:28:16.260
 Not just the vision of it, right?

2:28:16.260 --> 2:28:18.860
 Which was a public vision to, you know,

2:28:18.860 --> 2:28:20.500
 take soldiers out of harm's way,

2:28:21.580 --> 2:28:24.780
 but you know, a lot of money.

2:28:24.780 --> 2:28:27.340
 And there's some way if you are a business

2:28:27.340 --> 2:28:29.660
 that's leveraging the technology

2:28:29.660 --> 2:28:33.780
 from a broad historical ethical perspective,

2:28:33.780 --> 2:28:38.780
 you do owe it to the bigger community to pay back,

2:28:41.260 --> 2:28:44.940
 like for all the investment that was paid

2:28:44.940 --> 2:28:47.180
 to make that technology a reality.

2:28:47.180 --> 2:28:50.940
 In some sense, I don't know how to make that right, right?

2:28:50.940 --> 2:28:54.300
 On one, there's this pure capitalism

2:28:54.300 --> 2:28:57.300
 and then there's communism and I'm not sure,

2:28:57.300 --> 2:29:02.300
 I'm not sure how to get that balance right.

2:29:04.380 --> 2:29:06.260
 You know, I don't have all the answers in here,

2:29:06.260 --> 2:29:09.100
 you know, and I wouldn't expect, you know,

2:29:09.100 --> 2:29:11.940
 individual private companies to kind of kick back, right?

2:29:11.940 --> 2:29:14.060
 That's, capitalism doesn't allow that, right?

2:29:14.060 --> 2:29:15.820
 Unless you have a huge monopoly, right?

2:29:15.820 --> 2:29:17.540
 And then you can on the backside,

2:29:17.540 --> 2:29:20.260
 create music halls and libraries and things like that.

2:29:21.260 --> 2:29:23.500
 But you know, here's what I think, you know,

2:29:23.500 --> 2:29:28.500
 the basic obligation is, is, you know, come to the table,

2:29:28.860 --> 2:29:31.820
 like, and have an honest conversation

2:29:31.820 --> 2:29:35.820
 with the policymakers, with the truck drivers, you know,

2:29:35.820 --> 2:29:37.940
 with the communities that are at risk.

2:29:37.940 --> 2:29:41.860
 Like, at least let's talk about these things, you know,

2:29:41.860 --> 2:29:43.500
 in a way that doesn't look like

2:29:43.500 --> 2:29:45.340
 the way lobbying works right now.

2:29:45.340 --> 2:29:49.140
 Where you send a well paid lobbyist to the Hill

2:29:49.140 --> 2:29:52.580
 to, you know, convince some representative or Senator

2:29:52.580 --> 2:29:55.300
 to stick a sentence or two in that favors you into the,

2:29:55.300 --> 2:29:57.780
 like, let's have a real conversation.

2:29:57.780 --> 2:29:58.620
 Real human conversation.

2:29:58.620 --> 2:29:59.460
 Can we just do that?

2:29:59.460 --> 2:30:01.420
 Yeah, don't play games.

2:30:01.420 --> 2:30:03.220
 Real, real human conversation.

2:30:03.220 --> 2:30:06.500
 Let me ask you, mention Autopilot.

2:30:06.500 --> 2:30:10.100
 Gotta ask you about Tesla, this renegade little company

2:30:10.100 --> 2:30:12.220
 that seems to be, from my perspective,

2:30:12.220 --> 2:30:13.820
 revolutionizing autonomous driving

2:30:13.820 --> 2:30:15.020
 or semi autonomous driving,

2:30:15.020 --> 2:30:18.540
 or at least the problem of perception and control.

2:30:19.820 --> 2:30:22.140
 They've got a semi on the way.

2:30:22.140 --> 2:30:24.300
 They got a truck on the way.

2:30:24.300 --> 2:30:26.580
 What are your thoughts about Tesla Semi?

2:30:26.580 --> 2:30:29.140
 You know, I, and I did have

2:30:29.140 --> 2:30:31.180
 some very preliminary conversations

2:30:31.180 --> 2:30:35.020
 with, you know, policy folks there.

2:30:35.020 --> 2:30:37.260
 You know, nothing really in the tech

2:30:37.260 --> 2:30:39.980
 or business side of it too much.

2:30:39.980 --> 2:30:40.980
 And here's why.

2:30:40.980 --> 2:30:43.900
 I think because electrification and autonomy

2:30:43.900 --> 2:30:45.260
 run in opposite directions.

2:30:46.140 --> 2:30:49.980
 And I just, you know, I don't see the application,

2:30:49.980 --> 2:30:52.580
 the value in self driving for the truck

2:30:52.580 --> 2:30:55.500
 that Tesla's gonna produce in the near term.

2:30:55.500 --> 2:30:58.820
 You know, they're just, you're not gonna have the battery.

2:30:58.820 --> 2:31:01.220
 And now you could have wonderful safety systems

2:31:01.220 --> 2:31:03.900
 and, you know, reinforcing, you know, the auto,

2:31:03.900 --> 2:31:08.900
 you know, self driving features supporting a skilled driver,

2:31:08.900 --> 2:31:11.140
 but you're not gonna be able to pull that driver out

2:31:11.140 --> 2:31:12.940
 for long stretches the way that you are

2:31:12.940 --> 2:31:14.260
 with driverless trucks.

2:31:14.260 --> 2:31:18.460
 So do you think, I mean, the reason,

2:31:18.460 --> 2:31:21.020
 so yeah, the electrification

2:31:22.380 --> 2:31:24.740
 is not obviously coupled with the automation.

2:31:27.780 --> 2:31:29.860
 They have a very interesting approach

2:31:29.860 --> 2:31:34.860
 to semi autonomous pushing towards autonomous driving.

2:31:35.060 --> 2:31:36.780
 All right, it's very unique.

2:31:37.900 --> 2:31:41.260
 No LIDAR, now no radar.

2:31:41.260 --> 2:31:44.260
 It's computer vision alone from a large,

2:31:44.260 --> 2:31:47.100
 they're collecting huge amounts of data from a large fleet.

2:31:47.100 --> 2:31:49.460
 It's an interesting, unique approach,

2:31:49.460 --> 2:31:51.740
 bold and fearless in this direction.

2:31:51.740 --> 2:31:55.260
 If I were to guess whether this approach would work,

2:31:55.260 --> 2:31:58.260
 I would say, no, it started.

2:31:59.380 --> 2:32:01.500
 One, you would need a lot of data

2:32:01.500 --> 2:32:05.100
 and two, because you have actual cars deployed on the road

2:32:05.100 --> 2:32:07.940
 using a beta version of this product,

2:32:07.940 --> 2:32:11.980
 you're going to have a system that's far less safe

2:32:11.980 --> 2:32:13.380
 and you're going to run into trouble.

2:32:13.380 --> 2:32:17.580
 It's horrible PR, like it just seems like a nightmare,

2:32:17.580 --> 2:32:20.620
 but it seems to not be the case, at least up to this point.

2:32:20.620 --> 2:32:25.620
 It seems to be not, you know, on par, if not safer

2:32:26.420 --> 2:32:27.740
 and it seems to work really well

2:32:27.740 --> 2:32:32.020
 and the human factor somehow manages,

2:32:32.020 --> 2:32:33.820
 like drivers still pay attention.

2:32:33.820 --> 2:32:36.660
 Now there's a selection of who is inside

2:32:36.660 --> 2:32:39.820
 the Tesla autopilot user base, right?

2:32:39.820 --> 2:32:42.140
 There could be a self selection mechanism there,

2:32:42.140 --> 2:32:43.820
 but however it works,

2:32:43.820 --> 2:32:47.300
 these things are not running off the road all the time.

2:32:47.300 --> 2:32:50.580
 So it's very interesting whether that can sort of creep

2:32:50.580 --> 2:32:52.100
 into the trucking space.

2:32:52.940 --> 2:32:57.940
 Yes, at first the long haul problem is not solved.

2:32:57.980 --> 2:33:01.260
 They need to charge, but maybe you can solve, you know,

2:33:01.260 --> 2:33:06.260
 a lot of your scenarios involved small distances

2:33:06.940 --> 2:33:10.220
 and you know, that last mile aspect,

2:33:10.220 --> 2:33:12.140
 which is exactly what Tesla is trying to solve

2:33:12.140 --> 2:33:17.140
 for the regular passenger vehicle space

2:33:18.620 --> 2:33:20.420
 is the city driving.

2:33:20.420 --> 2:33:22.620
 It's possible that you have these trucks.

2:33:22.620 --> 2:33:27.620
 It's almost like, yeah, you solved the last mile delivery

2:33:28.220 --> 2:33:31.300
 part of some of the scenarios that you mentioned

2:33:31.300 --> 2:33:32.780
 in autonomous driving space.

2:33:32.780 --> 2:33:35.940
 Is that, do you think that's from the people you've spoken

2:33:35.940 --> 2:33:37.580
 with too difficult of a problem?

2:33:37.580 --> 2:33:41.540
 The thing that, you know, keeps me so interested

2:33:41.540 --> 2:33:43.580
 in this space and thinking that it's so important,

2:33:43.580 --> 2:33:46.900
 you know, is again, that efficiency question,

2:33:46.900 --> 2:33:50.940
 that safety question and the way that these economics

2:33:50.940 --> 2:33:53.180
 can push us potentially, you know,

2:33:53.180 --> 2:33:54.780
 toward a more efficient system.

2:33:54.780 --> 2:33:58.140
 So I wanna see those Tesla electric trucks running out

2:33:58.140 --> 2:34:01.380
 to those truck ports where you've got those two,

2:34:01.380 --> 2:34:05.620
 you know, two trucks with a human driver in front, right?

2:34:05.620 --> 2:34:08.500
 You know, I think that's now what's powering those

2:34:08.500 --> 2:34:11.300
 is that hydrogen, you know, I mean, I don't, you know,

2:34:11.300 --> 2:34:13.100
 again, it's very interesting as a researcher

2:34:13.100 --> 2:34:14.620
 who does not have a background in technology

2:34:14.620 --> 2:34:18.500
 and doesn't have a horse, you know, in this race.

2:34:18.500 --> 2:34:20.620
 I mean, you know, for all I know,

2:34:20.620 --> 2:34:22.780
 self driving trucks will ultimately be achieved

2:34:22.780 --> 2:34:26.580
 by some biomechanical sensor that uses echolocation

2:34:26.580 --> 2:34:28.460
 because we took stem cells of bats.

2:34:28.460 --> 2:34:30.980
 And you know, I mean, I don't, I don't,

2:34:30.980 --> 2:34:35.540
 I am completely unable to assess who's, you know,

2:34:35.540 --> 2:34:37.820
 who's the head or who's behind or who makes sense.

2:34:37.820 --> 2:34:39.940
 But I think one key component there,

2:34:39.940 --> 2:34:42.580
 and this is what I see with Tesla often,

2:34:42.580 --> 2:34:45.600
 and it's quite sad to me that other companies

2:34:45.600 --> 2:34:49.580
 don't do this enough, is that first principles thinking,

2:34:49.580 --> 2:34:51.180
 like, wait, wait, wait, okay.

2:34:51.180 --> 2:34:54.140
 It's looking at the inefficiencies as opposed to,

2:34:54.140 --> 2:34:57.060
 I've worked with quite a few car companies

2:34:57.060 --> 2:35:00.300
 and they basically have a lot of meetings.

2:35:00.300 --> 2:35:01.820
 There's a lot of meetings.

2:35:01.820 --> 2:35:03.300
 And the discussion is like,

2:35:03.300 --> 2:35:05.580
 how can we make this cheaper, this cheaper, this cheaper,

2:35:05.580 --> 2:35:07.420
 this component cheaper, this cheaper,

2:35:07.420 --> 2:35:10.260
 the cheapification of everything, just like you said,

2:35:10.260 --> 2:35:13.180
 as opposed to saying, wait a minute, let's step back.

2:35:13.180 --> 2:35:15.780
 Let's look at the entirety of the inefficiencies

2:35:15.780 --> 2:35:17.260
 in the system.

2:35:17.260 --> 2:35:19.220
 Like, why have we been doing this like this

2:35:19.220 --> 2:35:20.940
 for the last few decades?

2:35:20.940 --> 2:35:22.620
 Like, start from scratch.

2:35:22.620 --> 2:35:25.420
 Can this be 10X, 100X cheaper?

2:35:25.420 --> 2:35:29.780
 Like, if we not just decrease the cost

2:35:29.780 --> 2:35:32.260
 of one component here or this component here

2:35:32.260 --> 2:35:33.620
 or this component here,

2:35:33.620 --> 2:35:37.900
 but like, let's like redesign everything.

2:35:37.900 --> 2:35:42.900
 Let's infrastructure, let's have special lanes

2:35:42.900 --> 2:35:45.180
 or in terms of truck ports,

2:35:45.180 --> 2:35:47.540
 as opposed to having regular human control truck ports,

2:35:47.540 --> 2:35:51.700
 have some kind of weird like sensors,

2:35:51.700 --> 2:35:56.020
 like where everything about the truck connecting

2:35:56.020 --> 2:35:58.780
 at that final destination is automated fully

2:35:58.780 --> 2:35:59.780
 from the ground up.

2:35:59.780 --> 2:36:01.620
 You build the facility from the ground up

2:36:01.620 --> 2:36:03.460
 for the autonomous truck.

2:36:03.460 --> 2:36:06.820
 All those kinds of sort of questions are platooning.

2:36:06.820 --> 2:36:08.140
 Let's say, wait a minute.

2:36:08.140 --> 2:36:11.260
 Okay, I know we think platooning is hard,

2:36:11.260 --> 2:36:14.380
 but can we think through exactly why it's hard

2:36:14.380 --> 2:36:15.980
 and can we actually solve it?

2:36:15.980 --> 2:36:19.140
 Like if we collect a huge amount of data, can we solve it?

2:36:20.460 --> 2:36:23.380
 And then teleoperation, like, okay, yeah, yeah.

2:36:23.380 --> 2:36:25.460
 It's difficult to have good signal,

2:36:25.460 --> 2:36:27.740
 but can we actually, can we have,

2:36:27.740 --> 2:36:31.300
 can we consider the probability of those edge cases

2:36:31.300 --> 2:36:32.420
 and what to do in the edge cases

2:36:32.420 --> 2:36:34.220
 when the teleoperation fails?

2:36:34.220 --> 2:36:35.300
 Like how difficult is this?

2:36:35.300 --> 2:36:36.300
 What are the costs?

2:36:36.300 --> 2:36:39.580
 How do we actually construct a teleoperation center

2:36:39.580 --> 2:36:41.740
 full of humans that are able to pay attention

2:36:41.740 --> 2:36:44.700
 to a large fleet where the average number of vehicles

2:36:44.700 --> 2:36:46.700
 per human is like 10 or a hundred?

2:36:47.700 --> 2:36:52.100
 Like having that conversation as opposed to kind of having,

2:36:52.100 --> 2:36:54.340
 you show up to work and say, all right,

2:36:55.820 --> 2:36:58.580
 it seems like because of COVID,

2:36:58.580 --> 2:37:00.540
 we are not making as much money.

2:37:00.540 --> 2:37:02.220
 Can we have a cheaper,

2:37:02.220 --> 2:37:04.660
 can we give less salary to the trucker?

2:37:04.660 --> 2:37:09.660
 And can we build like decrease the cost

2:37:11.020 --> 2:37:14.580
 or decrease the frequency at which we buy new trucks?

2:37:14.580 --> 2:37:16.300
 And when we do buy new trucks,

2:37:16.300 --> 2:37:18.540
 make them cheaper by making them crappier,

2:37:18.540 --> 2:37:20.140
 like this kind of discussion.

2:37:20.140 --> 2:37:23.220
 This is why, to me, it's like Tesla is like rare on this.

2:37:23.220 --> 2:37:26.180
 And there's some sectors in which innovation

2:37:26.180 --> 2:37:27.580
 is part of the culture.

2:37:27.580 --> 2:37:29.260
 In the automotive sector, for some reason,

2:37:29.260 --> 2:37:31.180
 it's not as much.

2:37:31.180 --> 2:37:33.780
 This is obviously the problem that Ford and GM

2:37:33.780 --> 2:37:34.620
 are struggling with.

2:37:34.620 --> 2:37:39.300
 It's like, they're really good at making cars at scale cheap.

2:37:39.300 --> 2:37:41.220
 And they're like legit good.

2:37:41.220 --> 2:37:42.580
 Like Toyota at this,

2:37:42.580 --> 2:37:44.500
 they're some of the greatest manufacturing people

2:37:44.500 --> 2:37:45.340
 in the world, right?

2:37:45.340 --> 2:37:46.180
 That's incredible.

2:37:46.180 --> 2:37:48.820
 But then when it comes to hiring software people,

2:37:48.820 --> 2:37:49.660
 they're horrible.

2:37:49.660 --> 2:37:52.940
 So it's culture.

2:37:52.940 --> 2:37:55.140
 And then it's such a difficult thing

2:37:55.140 --> 2:37:57.060
 for them to sort of embrace,

2:37:57.060 --> 2:38:00.220
 but greatness requires that they embrace this,

2:38:01.340 --> 2:38:03.100
 embrace whatever is required

2:38:03.100 --> 2:38:04.980
 to remove the inefficiencies in the system.

2:38:04.980 --> 2:38:07.620
 And that may require you to do things very differently

2:38:07.620 --> 2:38:09.420
 than you've done in the past.

2:38:09.420 --> 2:38:12.020
 Yeah, I mean, there are certain things

2:38:12.020 --> 2:38:13.260
 that the market can do well.

2:38:13.260 --> 2:38:15.500
 And this is how I see the world, right?

2:38:17.620 --> 2:38:21.460
 That's the best way to organize certain kinds of activities

2:38:21.460 --> 2:38:24.260
 is the market and private interest.

2:38:24.260 --> 2:38:28.780
 But I think we go too far in some areas.

2:38:28.780 --> 2:38:30.140
 Transportation is,

2:38:30.140 --> 2:38:35.140
 if we can't have a public debate about the roads

2:38:35.860 --> 2:38:37.700
 that we all pay for,

2:38:39.100 --> 2:38:39.940
 forget about it.

2:38:39.940 --> 2:38:41.820
 Private factories and all these other,

2:38:41.820 --> 2:38:43.060
 healthcare and other places,

2:38:43.060 --> 2:38:45.300
 it's gonna be way harder there.

2:38:45.300 --> 2:38:49.620
 Healthcare I guess has some direct contact

2:38:49.620 --> 2:38:52.900
 with the consumer where we're probably gonna have lots of

2:38:52.900 --> 2:38:54.660
 sort of hands on public policy

2:38:54.660 --> 2:38:57.780
 about concerns around patient rights and things like that.

2:38:57.780 --> 2:39:00.060
 But if we can't figure out

2:39:00.060 --> 2:39:02.580
 how to have a public policy conversation

2:39:02.580 --> 2:39:06.980
 around how technology is gonna reform our public roadways

2:39:06.980 --> 2:39:08.740
 and our transportation system,

2:39:10.300 --> 2:39:13.940
 we're really leaving way too much to private companies.

2:39:13.940 --> 2:39:17.380
 And it's just, it's not in there.

2:39:17.380 --> 2:39:19.540
 I get asked this question, like, what should companies do?

2:39:19.540 --> 2:39:22.340
 And I'm like, just go about doing what you're doing.

2:39:22.340 --> 2:39:24.420
 I mean, please come to the table and talk about it,

2:39:24.420 --> 2:39:26.420
 but it's not their role.

2:39:26.420 --> 2:39:29.940
 I mean, I appreciate Ilan's attempts

2:39:29.940 --> 2:39:34.700
 to have species level goals,

2:39:34.700 --> 2:39:36.380
 like, we're gonna go to Mars.

2:39:36.380 --> 2:39:37.660
 I mean, that's amazing.

2:39:37.660 --> 2:39:42.660
 And that's incredible that someone can realize that,

2:39:42.940 --> 2:39:44.620
 have a chance at realizing that vision.

2:39:44.620 --> 2:39:46.020
 It's amazing.

2:39:46.020 --> 2:39:50.180
 But when it comes to so many areas of our economy,

2:39:50.180 --> 2:39:52.540
 we can't wait for a hero.

2:39:52.540 --> 2:39:53.860
 We have to have,

2:39:53.860 --> 2:39:56.500
 and there are way too many interests involved.

2:39:56.500 --> 2:39:58.420
 It's who builds the roads.

2:39:58.420 --> 2:40:02.100
 I mean, the money that sloshes around on Capitol Hill

2:40:02.100 --> 2:40:05.420
 to decide what happens in these infrastructure bills

2:40:05.420 --> 2:40:09.060
 and the transportation bill is just obscene, right?

2:40:09.060 --> 2:40:12.100
 See, I think it's an interesting view of markets.

2:40:12.940 --> 2:40:16.980
 Correct me if I'm wrong, let me propose a theory to you.

2:40:16.980 --> 2:40:21.980
 That progress in the world is made by heroes

2:40:22.020 --> 2:40:24.020
 and the markets remove the inefficiencies

2:40:24.020 --> 2:40:26.180
 from the work the heroes did.

2:40:26.180 --> 2:40:30.420
 So going to Mars from the perspective of markets

2:40:30.420 --> 2:40:32.220
 probably has no value.

2:40:32.220 --> 2:40:34.060
 Maybe you can argue it's good for hiring

2:40:34.060 --> 2:40:35.860
 to have a vision or something like that,

2:40:35.860 --> 2:40:37.940
 but like those big projects

2:40:37.940 --> 2:40:40.500
 don't seem to have an obvious value,

2:40:40.500 --> 2:40:45.500
 but our world progresses by those big leaps.

2:40:45.500 --> 2:40:48.660
 And then after the leaps are taken,

2:40:48.660 --> 2:40:50.500
 then the markets are very good

2:40:50.500 --> 2:40:52.980
 at removing sort of inefficiencies.

2:40:52.980 --> 2:40:55.940
 But it just feels like the autonomous vehicle space

2:40:55.940 --> 2:40:59.300
 and the autonomous trucking space requires leaps.

2:40:59.300 --> 2:41:03.860
 It doesn't feel like we can sneak up into a good solution

2:41:03.860 --> 2:41:05.700
 that is ultimately good for labor,

2:41:05.700 --> 2:41:07.980
 like for human beings in the system.

2:41:07.980 --> 2:41:12.980
 It feels like some, like probably a bad example,

2:41:12.980 --> 2:41:15.660
 but like a Henry Ford type of character steps in

2:41:15.660 --> 2:41:18.460
 and say like, we need to do stuff completely differently.

2:41:20.260 --> 2:41:24.140
 Yeah, and you said we can't hope for a hero,

2:41:24.140 --> 2:41:27.780
 but it's like, no, but we can say we need a hero.

2:41:27.780 --> 2:41:29.260
 We need more heroes.

2:41:29.260 --> 2:41:31.740
 So if you're a young kid right now listening to this,

2:41:31.740 --> 2:41:33.220
 we need you to be a hero.

2:41:33.220 --> 2:41:34.980
 It's not like we need you to start a company

2:41:34.980 --> 2:41:36.700
 that makes a lot of money, no.

2:41:36.700 --> 2:41:38.900
 You need to start a company that makes a lot of money

2:41:38.900 --> 2:41:41.420
 so that you can feed your family

2:41:41.420 --> 2:41:43.300
 as you become a hero and take huge risks

2:41:43.300 --> 2:41:45.220
 and potentially go bankrupt.

2:41:45.220 --> 2:41:49.180
 Those risks is how we move society forward, I think.

2:41:49.180 --> 2:41:51.340
 Maybe that's a romantic view, I don't know.

2:41:51.340 --> 2:41:52.420
 I totally disagree.

2:41:52.420 --> 2:41:53.940
 You disagree, goddammit.

2:41:53.940 --> 2:41:54.780
 I mean, I...

2:41:54.780 --> 2:41:57.620
 And out of the two of us, you're the knowledgeable one.

2:41:57.620 --> 2:41:58.860
 No, no.

2:41:58.860 --> 2:42:01.940
 No, no, I think it's a matter of like,

2:42:01.940 --> 2:42:02.940
 do we need those heroes?

2:42:02.940 --> 2:42:04.060
 Absolutely.

2:42:04.060 --> 2:42:09.060
 I mean, I saw the boosters come down from space,

2:42:09.060 --> 2:42:12.900
 boosters come down from SpaceX's rockets

2:42:12.900 --> 2:42:18.020
 and land nearly simultaneously with my kids

2:42:18.020 --> 2:42:19.820
 after school one day.

2:42:19.820 --> 2:42:21.700
 And I thought, oh my god,

2:42:21.700 --> 2:42:25.580
 like science fiction has been made real.

2:42:25.580 --> 2:42:26.620
 It's incredible.

2:42:26.620 --> 2:42:29.740
 And it's a pinnacle of human achievement, right?

2:42:29.740 --> 2:42:32.620
 It's like, this is what we're capable of.

2:42:32.620 --> 2:42:37.140
 But we need to have those heroes oriented.

2:42:37.140 --> 2:42:42.140
 We need to allow them to orient toward the goals, right?

2:42:42.940 --> 2:42:43.780
 We gotta...

2:42:43.780 --> 2:42:45.700
 Climate change, you know?

2:42:45.700 --> 2:42:48.860
 I mean, all the heroes out there, right?

2:42:48.860 --> 2:42:50.940
 I mean, it's time.

2:42:50.940 --> 2:42:52.140
 The clock is ticking.

2:42:52.140 --> 2:42:53.900
 It's past time.

2:42:53.900 --> 2:42:55.780
 I've been working on climate change issues

2:42:55.780 --> 2:42:58.100
 since the mid 90s.

2:42:59.500 --> 2:43:04.300
 I still remember the first time in 2010

2:43:04.300 --> 2:43:08.580
 when I got a grant that was completely focused

2:43:08.580 --> 2:43:11.060
 on adaptation rather than prevention.

2:43:12.060 --> 2:43:17.060
 And just when it hit me, that like, wow.

2:43:18.580 --> 2:43:22.180
 So adaptation versus prevention is like acceptance

2:43:22.180 --> 2:43:25.420
 that there's going to be catastrophic impact.

2:43:25.420 --> 2:43:28.660
 We need to figure out how do we at least live with that.

2:43:28.660 --> 2:43:29.500
 Yeah.

2:43:29.500 --> 2:43:30.340
 And you know, the grant was like,

2:43:30.340 --> 2:43:32.700
 okay, our agriculture system is gonna move,

2:43:32.700 --> 2:43:34.900
 our breadbasket is no longer gonna be California,

2:43:34.900 --> 2:43:36.460
 it's gonna be Illinois.

2:43:36.460 --> 2:43:38.580
 What does that mean for truck transportation?

2:43:38.580 --> 2:43:42.060
 So it's like, so in terms of a big philosophical

2:43:42.060 --> 2:43:44.660
 societal level, that's kind of like giving up.

2:43:44.660 --> 2:43:45.500
 Yeah.

2:43:45.500 --> 2:43:47.020
 In terms of the big heroic actions.

2:43:47.020 --> 2:43:47.860
 Yeah.

2:43:47.860 --> 2:43:51.300
 You know, failures in human history, yeah.

2:43:51.300 --> 2:43:56.180
 That's gonna be, let's hope not the biggest, but could be.

2:43:56.180 --> 2:43:57.020
 Do you...

2:43:57.020 --> 2:43:59.540
 So let me say why I disagree, right?

2:43:59.540 --> 2:44:02.500
 Henry Ford, amazing, right?

2:44:02.500 --> 2:44:04.500
 To sort of mass produce cars, right?

2:44:04.500 --> 2:44:07.500
 Daimler to put that first truck on the road

2:44:07.500 --> 2:44:09.220
 without the roads, right?

2:44:09.220 --> 2:44:11.460
 So there's like, we need that innovation.

2:44:11.460 --> 2:44:12.500
 There's no doubt about it.

2:44:12.500 --> 2:44:14.220
 And there are rules for that,

2:44:14.220 --> 2:44:19.220
 but there's big public stuff that sets the stage.

2:44:19.540 --> 2:44:20.380
 It's critical.

2:44:20.380 --> 2:44:22.420
 And you know, and what it really is,

2:44:22.420 --> 2:44:25.060
 it's a sociological problem, right?

2:44:25.060 --> 2:44:26.020
 It's a political problem.

2:44:26.020 --> 2:44:26.860
 It's a social problem.

2:44:26.860 --> 2:44:29.900
 We have to say, and we have these screwed up ideas, right?

2:44:29.900 --> 2:44:31.900
 So we have this politics right now

2:44:31.900 --> 2:44:34.340
 where like everybody feels like they're getting screwed

2:44:34.340 --> 2:44:37.980
 and someone undeserving is benefiting.

2:44:37.980 --> 2:44:40.260
 When in fact, like, you know, at least in the middle, right?

2:44:40.260 --> 2:44:41.100
 They're huge.

2:44:41.100 --> 2:44:43.500
 I used to teach this course in rich and poor,

2:44:43.500 --> 2:44:45.140
 you know, in economic inequality.

2:44:45.140 --> 2:44:49.100
 And I would go through public housing subsidies

2:44:49.100 --> 2:44:53.260
 in Philadelphia, you know, section eight subsidies,

2:44:53.260 --> 2:44:57.140
 you know, and then I would go through my housing subsidies

2:44:57.140 --> 2:45:00.300
 for my mortgage interest deduction.

2:45:00.300 --> 2:45:02.900
 And it worked out to basically the average payment

2:45:02.900 --> 2:45:06.780
 for a section eight housing voucher in my neighborhood.

2:45:06.780 --> 2:45:08.060
 I'm not a welfare recipient

2:45:08.060 --> 2:45:10.220
 according to the dominant discourse.

2:45:10.220 --> 2:45:13.180
 And so we have this completely screwed up sense

2:45:13.180 --> 2:45:15.540
 of like where our dollars go and you know,

2:45:15.540 --> 2:45:17.620
 who benefits from the investment.

2:45:17.620 --> 2:45:20.980
 And you know, we need to, you know,

2:45:20.980 --> 2:45:21.900
 I don't know that we can do it,

2:45:21.900 --> 2:45:24.700
 but you know, if we're gonna survive,

2:45:24.700 --> 2:45:28.900
 we need to figure out how to have honest conversations

2:45:28.900 --> 2:45:32.660
 where private interest is where we need it to be

2:45:32.660 --> 2:45:35.380
 in fostering innovation and, you know,

2:45:35.380 --> 2:45:37.620
 and rewarding the people who do incredible things.

2:45:37.620 --> 2:45:41.100
 Please, you know, we don't wanna squash that,

2:45:41.100 --> 2:45:42.820
 but we need to harness that power

2:45:42.820 --> 2:45:45.340
 to solve what I think are some pretty big,

2:45:45.340 --> 2:45:47.500
 you know, existential problems.

2:45:47.500 --> 2:45:50.660
 So you think there's a like government level,

2:45:50.660 --> 2:45:53.180
 national level collaboration required

2:45:53.180 --> 2:45:54.460
 for infrastructure project.

2:45:54.460 --> 2:45:59.460
 Like there's, we should really have large moonshot projects

2:46:01.300 --> 2:46:04.860
 that are funded by our governments.

2:46:04.860 --> 2:46:06.420
 At least guided by, I mean,

2:46:06.420 --> 2:46:08.140
 I think there are ways to finance them

2:46:08.140 --> 2:46:08.980
 and you know, other things,

2:46:08.980 --> 2:46:10.860
 but we gotta be careful, right?

2:46:10.860 --> 2:46:13.140
 Cause that's where you get all these sort of perverse,

2:46:13.140 --> 2:46:15.220
 you know, unintended consequences and whatnot.

2:46:15.220 --> 2:46:18.380
 But if you look at transportation in the United States

2:46:18.380 --> 2:46:21.900
 and it is the foundation of the, you know,

2:46:21.900 --> 2:46:24.900
 manifest destiny, economic growth, right?

2:46:24.900 --> 2:46:29.020
 That built the United States into the world superpower

2:46:29.020 --> 2:46:30.980
 that it became and the industrial power that it became.

2:46:30.980 --> 2:46:33.540
 It rested on transportation, right?

2:46:33.540 --> 2:46:35.580
 It was like, you know, the Erie Canal,

2:46:35.580 --> 2:46:38.380
 I grew up a few miles from where they dug

2:46:38.380 --> 2:46:40.540
 the first shovel full of the Erie Canal

2:46:40.540 --> 2:46:44.060
 and everyone thought it was, you know, crazy, right?

2:46:44.060 --> 2:46:46.660
 But those public infrastructure projects,

2:46:46.660 --> 2:46:49.020
 the canals, right, the railroads, yeah,

2:46:49.020 --> 2:46:50.100
 they were privately built,

2:46:50.100 --> 2:46:52.500
 but they wouldn't have been privately built without,

2:46:52.500 --> 2:46:55.020
 you know, Lincoln funding them essentially

2:46:55.020 --> 2:46:59.060
 and giving, you know, the railroads, you know, land

2:46:59.060 --> 2:47:01.140
 in exchange for building them.

2:47:01.140 --> 2:47:03.500
 The highway system, the Eisenhower,

2:47:03.500 --> 2:47:06.740
 the payback that the US economy got

2:47:06.740 --> 2:47:09.700
 from the Dwight D. Eisenhower interstate system

2:47:09.700 --> 2:47:12.140
 is phenomenal, right?

2:47:12.140 --> 2:47:14.020
 No private entity was gonna do that.

2:47:14.020 --> 2:47:17.060
 Electrification, dams, water, you know,

2:47:17.060 --> 2:47:21.580
 we need to do these infrastructure, infrastructure.

2:47:21.580 --> 2:47:24.340
 And now more than ever, it's been really upsetting to me

2:47:24.340 --> 2:47:25.820
 on the COVID front.

2:47:27.220 --> 2:47:29.660
 There's one of the solutions to COVID,

2:47:29.660 --> 2:47:32.500
 which seems obvious to me from the very beginning

2:47:32.500 --> 2:47:34.940
 that nobody's opposed to.

2:47:34.940 --> 2:47:39.820
 It's one of the only bipartisan things is at home testing,

2:47:39.820 --> 2:47:41.540
 rapid at home testing.

2:47:41.540 --> 2:47:45.260
 There's no reason why at the government level,

2:47:45.260 --> 2:47:47.860
 we couldn't manufacture hundreds of millions of tests

2:47:47.860 --> 2:47:48.820
 a month.

2:47:48.820 --> 2:47:51.300
 There's no reason starting in May, 2020.

2:47:51.300 --> 2:47:55.220
 And that gives power to a country that values freedom,

2:47:55.220 --> 2:47:57.140
 that gives power information to each individual

2:47:57.140 --> 2:47:59.260
 to know whether they have COVID or not.

2:47:59.260 --> 2:48:04.260
 So it's possible to manufacture them for under a dollar.

2:48:04.260 --> 2:48:05.820
 It's like an obvious thing.

2:48:05.820 --> 2:48:07.140
 It's kind of like the roads.

2:48:07.140 --> 2:48:08.980
 It's like, everybody's invested.

2:48:08.980 --> 2:48:11.580
 Let's put countless tests in the hands

2:48:11.580 --> 2:48:13.500
 of every single American citizen,

2:48:13.500 --> 2:48:16.580
 maybe every citizen of the world.

2:48:16.580 --> 2:48:19.500
 The fact that we haven't done that today

2:48:19.500 --> 2:48:21.860
 and there's some regulation stuff with the FDA,

2:48:21.860 --> 2:48:24.380
 all the kind of dragging of feet,

2:48:24.380 --> 2:48:26.060
 but there's not actually a good explanation

2:48:26.060 --> 2:48:31.060
 except our leaders and culturally,

2:48:31.460 --> 2:48:35.940
 we've lost the sort of, not lost,

2:48:35.940 --> 2:48:38.020
 but it's a little bit dormant.

2:48:38.020 --> 2:48:42.100
 The will to do these big projects that better the world.

2:48:43.140 --> 2:48:45.980
 I still have the hope that when faced

2:48:45.980 --> 2:48:50.980
 with catastrophic events, the more dramatic,

2:48:51.980 --> 2:48:53.860
 the more damaging, the more painful they are,

2:48:53.860 --> 2:48:56.700
 the higher we will rise to meet those.

2:48:56.700 --> 2:48:58.900
 And that's where the infrastructure style projects

2:48:58.900 --> 2:48:59.740
 are really important.

2:48:59.740 --> 2:49:03.860
 But it's certainly a little bit challenging

2:49:03.860 --> 2:49:06.620
 to remain an optimist in the times of COVID

2:49:06.620 --> 2:49:10.420
 because the response of our leaders has not been as great

2:49:10.420 --> 2:49:14.300
 and as historic as I would have hoped.

2:49:14.300 --> 2:49:17.420
 I would hope that the actions of leaders

2:49:17.420 --> 2:49:19.740
 in the past few years in response to COVID

2:49:20.700 --> 2:49:23.180
 would be ones that are written in the history books.

2:49:23.180 --> 2:49:25.820
 And we talk about it as we talk about FDR,

2:49:25.820 --> 2:49:27.580
 but sadly, I don't know.

2:49:27.580 --> 2:49:29.380
 I think the history books will forget

2:49:30.780 --> 2:49:32.300
 the actions of our leaders.

2:49:32.300 --> 2:49:37.300
 So let me just, to wrap up autonomy,

2:49:42.020 --> 2:49:43.900
 when you look into the future,

2:49:45.780 --> 2:49:50.780
 are you excited about automation in the space of trucking?

2:49:52.020 --> 2:49:55.540
 Is it, when you go to bed at night,

2:49:57.580 --> 2:50:01.740
 do you see a beautiful world in your vision

2:50:01.740 --> 2:50:03.220
 that involves autonomous trucks?

2:50:03.220 --> 2:50:07.020
 Like all of the truckers you've become close with,

2:50:07.020 --> 2:50:10.340
 you've talked to, do you see a better world for them

2:50:10.340 --> 2:50:11.780
 because of autonomous trucks?

2:50:13.140 --> 2:50:14.100
 Damn you, Alex.

2:50:15.140 --> 2:50:15.980
 You know why?

2:50:15.980 --> 2:50:19.140
 Because I mean, I want to be an optimist,

2:50:19.140 --> 2:50:21.380
 and I want to think of myself, I guess,

2:50:21.380 --> 2:50:23.780
 as a half glass bowl kind of person.

2:50:23.780 --> 2:50:25.580
 But when you ask it like that,

2:50:25.580 --> 2:50:27.820
 and I think about like,

2:50:27.820 --> 2:50:32.820
 when I look at the challenges to harnessing that for,

2:50:36.820 --> 2:50:40.660
 just let's take just labor and climate, right?

2:50:40.660 --> 2:50:41.580
 There are other issues,

2:50:41.580 --> 2:50:43.420
 congestion, et cetera, infrastructure,

2:50:43.420 --> 2:50:45.500
 that are gonna be affected by this,

2:50:45.500 --> 2:50:48.660
 again, those big transformational issues.

2:50:50.100 --> 2:50:53.300
 I think it's gonna take the best of us.

2:50:53.300 --> 2:50:58.300
 Like it's gonna take the best of our policy approaches.

2:50:59.660 --> 2:51:03.660
 We need to start investing in building those,

2:51:03.660 --> 2:51:05.180
 rebuilding those institutions.

2:51:05.180 --> 2:51:07.700
 I mean, that's what we've seen in the last four years, right?

2:51:07.700 --> 2:51:11.420
 And the erosion of that was so clear

2:51:11.420 --> 2:51:12.460
 among these truck drivers.

2:51:12.460 --> 2:51:16.260
 Like when Trump came in and said like,

2:51:17.420 --> 2:51:20.060
 free trades, good for workers, like, yeah, right.

2:51:20.060 --> 2:51:23.420
 I grew up in the Rust Belt.

2:51:23.420 --> 2:51:25.540
 I watched factory after factory close.

2:51:25.540 --> 2:51:28.300
 All of my ancestors worked at the same factory.

2:51:28.300 --> 2:51:30.020
 It's still holding on by a thread.

2:51:30.020 --> 2:51:35.020
 Like, the Democratic Party told blue collar workers

2:51:35.780 --> 2:51:38.300
 for years, I don't worry about free trade.

2:51:38.300 --> 2:51:39.460
 It's not bad for you.

2:51:39.460 --> 2:51:40.860
 And I know the economists will probably

2:51:40.860 --> 2:51:42.220
 get in the comment box now.

2:51:44.020 --> 2:51:45.620
 We'll look forward to your comments.

2:51:45.620 --> 2:51:46.580
 Look forward to your comments

2:51:46.580 --> 2:51:48.580
 about how free trade benefits everybody.

2:51:48.580 --> 2:51:53.580
 But, you know, immigration, you know, you go,

2:51:54.020 --> 2:51:56.060
 and I think immigration is great.

2:51:56.060 --> 2:51:59.820
 The United States benefits from it tremendously, right?

2:51:59.820 --> 2:52:01.700
 But there are costs, right?

2:52:01.700 --> 2:52:05.860
 Go down to South Philadelphia and find a drywaller

2:52:05.860 --> 2:52:08.740
 and tell him that immigration hasn't hurt him, right?

2:52:08.740 --> 2:52:12.500
 You know, go to these places where there's competition,

2:52:12.500 --> 2:52:13.340
 right?

2:52:13.340 --> 2:52:15.540
 And yes, we benefit overall,

2:52:15.540 --> 2:52:19.300
 but we have a system that allows some people

2:52:19.300 --> 2:52:21.980
 to pay really high costs.

2:52:21.980 --> 2:52:24.180
 And Trump tapped into that, you know?

2:52:24.180 --> 2:52:26.540
 And there was no, you know,

2:52:26.540 --> 2:52:28.540
 there's more than that too, obviously.

2:52:28.540 --> 2:52:30.900
 And there's lots of really dark stuff

2:52:30.900 --> 2:52:32.820
 that goes along with it, you know,

2:52:32.820 --> 2:52:35.540
 the sort of racialization of others and things like that.

2:52:35.540 --> 2:52:40.220
 But he hit on those core, you know, issues that, you know,

2:52:40.220 --> 2:52:42.380
 if you were to go back over my trucking interviews

2:52:42.380 --> 2:52:44.740
 for 15 years, you would have heard those stories

2:52:44.740 --> 2:52:47.660
 over and over and over again, that sense of voicelessness,

2:52:47.660 --> 2:52:49.020
 that sense of powerlessness,

2:52:49.020 --> 2:52:50.780
 that sense that there's no difference

2:52:50.780 --> 2:52:52.300
 between the Democrats and the Republicans

2:52:52.300 --> 2:52:54.780
 because they're all gonna screw us over.

2:52:54.780 --> 2:52:56.380
 And that was there, you know?

2:52:56.380 --> 2:52:58.220
 And you just ignore it as long as you want

2:52:58.220 --> 2:53:00.220
 and tell people, don't worry, trade's good for you.

2:53:00.220 --> 2:53:01.860
 Don't worry, immigration's good for you.

2:53:01.860 --> 2:53:04.060
 As their communities lose factories.

2:53:04.060 --> 2:53:05.900
 And I mean, a lot of them were lost to the South

2:53:05.900 --> 2:53:07.940
 before they were lost to overseas, whatever,

2:53:07.940 --> 2:53:10.660
 but tapped into that, you know?

2:53:10.660 --> 2:53:13.580
 And there's a fundamental distrust of,

2:53:13.580 --> 2:53:16.300
 you know, you look at these like pupils on like,

2:53:16.300 --> 2:53:17.740
 you know, whether people trust the media, right?

2:53:17.740 --> 2:53:21.180
 But whether or not they trust higher education, you know,

2:53:21.180 --> 2:53:24.180
 these institutions that I find magical, right?

2:53:24.180 --> 2:53:27.940
 I mean, you look at the vaccine research and stuff,

2:53:27.940 --> 2:53:30.820
 that, you know, just, you know, brilliant, you know,

2:53:30.820 --> 2:53:33.740
 people doing incredible things for humanity.

2:53:33.740 --> 2:53:36.260
 Like, you know, the idea that like, you know,

2:53:36.260 --> 2:53:39.420
 we can take these viruses that, you know,

2:53:39.420 --> 2:53:42.100
 used to ravage through the human population

2:53:42.100 --> 2:53:44.180
 that we had to be terrified of.

2:53:44.180 --> 2:53:47.660
 And, you know, we've suffered, but, you know,

2:53:47.660 --> 2:53:52.500
 we have such power now to defend ourselves, right?

2:53:52.500 --> 2:53:54.580
 Behind these programs, right?

2:53:54.580 --> 2:53:56.740
 And to see those, people would be like,

2:53:56.740 --> 2:53:58.300
 eh, I'm not sure if higher education's good

2:53:58.300 --> 2:54:00.980
 for the country or not, you know, it's like,

2:54:00.980 --> 2:54:02.140
 where are we, you know?

2:54:02.140 --> 2:54:04.140
 So we need to rebuild the faith and trust

2:54:04.140 --> 2:54:05.580
 in those institutions and have these,

2:54:05.580 --> 2:54:07.340
 but we need to have honest conversations

2:54:07.340 --> 2:54:09.900
 before people are gonna buy it, you know?

2:54:09.900 --> 2:54:11.980
 Do you have ideas for rebuilding the trust

2:54:11.980 --> 2:54:13.460
 and giving a voice to the voices?

2:54:13.460 --> 2:54:18.060
 So is the, many of the things we've been talking about

2:54:18.060 --> 2:54:21.460
 is so sort of deeply integrated.

2:54:21.460 --> 2:54:24.380
 You think like, this is the trouble I have

2:54:24.380 --> 2:54:27.020
 with people that work on AI and autonomous vehicles

2:54:27.020 --> 2:54:30.980
 and so on, it's not just a technology problem.

2:54:30.980 --> 2:54:35.980
 It's this human pain problem.

2:54:36.100 --> 2:54:39.780
 It's the robot essentially silencing the voice

2:54:39.780 --> 2:54:43.100
 of a human being because it's lowering their wage,

2:54:43.100 --> 2:54:46.020
 making them suffer more and giving them no tools

2:54:46.020 --> 2:54:48.820
 of how to escape that suffering.

2:54:48.820 --> 2:54:53.460
 Is there something, I mean, it even gets

2:54:53.460 --> 2:54:55.540
 into the question of meaning, you know?

2:54:55.540 --> 2:54:59.800
 So if money is one thing, but it's also

2:54:59.800 --> 2:55:01.260
 what makes us happy in life.

2:55:01.260 --> 2:55:06.260
 You know, a lot of those truckers,

2:55:06.340 --> 2:55:08.300
 the set of jobs they've had in their life

2:55:08.300 --> 2:55:10.900
 were defining to them as human beings.

2:55:12.460 --> 2:55:14.740
 And so, and the question with automation

2:55:14.740 --> 2:55:19.740
 is not just how do we have a job that gives you money

2:55:21.020 --> 2:55:24.740
 to feed your family, but also a job that gives you meaning,

2:55:24.740 --> 2:55:26.020
 that gives you pride.

2:55:26.020 --> 2:55:26.860
 Yeah.

2:55:27.780 --> 2:55:32.780
 And for me, the hope is that AI and automation

2:55:32.780 --> 2:55:37.780
 will provide other jobs that will be a source of meaning.

2:55:43.980 --> 2:55:47.020
 But coupled with that hope is that there will not

2:55:47.020 --> 2:55:49.380
 be too much suffering in the transition.

2:55:49.380 --> 2:55:53.500
 And that's not obvious from the people you've spoken with.

2:55:53.500 --> 2:55:55.580
 I mean, I think we need to differentiate

2:55:55.580 --> 2:55:57.020
 between the effects of technology

2:55:57.020 --> 2:55:58.560
 and the effects of capitalism, right?

2:55:58.560 --> 2:56:02.740
 And they are, you know, the fact that workers

2:56:02.740 --> 2:56:06.740
 don't have a lot of power, right, in the system matters.

2:56:06.740 --> 2:56:08.140
 Now, we had a system, right?

2:56:08.140 --> 2:56:09.380
 And that's why I would say, you know,

2:56:09.380 --> 2:56:12.940
 go to that, you know, Harry Bridges report.

2:56:12.940 --> 2:56:16.740
 And, you know, those were workers who had a sense of power.

2:56:16.740 --> 2:56:18.560
 They said, you know what, we can demand

2:56:18.560 --> 2:56:21.180
 some of the benefits, like, yeah, automate our jobs away,

2:56:21.180 --> 2:56:24.300
 but, you know, kick a little down to us, right?

2:56:24.300 --> 2:56:28.860
 And we had, in the golden era of American industrialism

2:56:28.860 --> 2:56:32.340
 in post World War II, that was the contract.

2:56:32.340 --> 2:56:35.200
 The contract was employers can do what they want

2:56:35.200 --> 2:56:37.020
 in automation and all these things.

2:56:37.020 --> 2:56:38.440
 Yeah, sure, there's some union rules

2:56:38.440 --> 2:56:40.980
 that make things less efficient in places,

2:56:40.980 --> 2:56:45.460
 but the key compromise is tie wages to productivity.

2:56:45.460 --> 2:56:46.300
 That's what we did.

2:56:46.300 --> 2:56:47.780
 We tied, that's what unions did.

2:56:47.780 --> 2:56:50.700
 They tied wages to productivity, kept demand up, right?

2:56:50.700 --> 2:56:54.220
 It was good for the economy, some economists think, right?

2:56:54.220 --> 2:56:57.540
 And that's what, you know, we need to,

2:56:57.540 --> 2:56:59.820
 I think we need to acknowledge that.

2:56:59.820 --> 2:57:02.740
 We need to acknowledge the fact

2:57:02.740 --> 2:57:04.560
 that it's not just technology,

2:57:04.560 --> 2:57:08.900
 it's technology in a social context

2:57:08.900 --> 2:57:10.540
 in which some people have a lot of power

2:57:10.540 --> 2:57:12.620
 to determine what happens.

2:57:12.620 --> 2:57:14.420
 For me, I don't have all the answers,

2:57:14.420 --> 2:57:15.940
 but I know what my answer is.

2:57:15.940 --> 2:57:19.220
 And my answer is, and I think I started with this, you know,

2:57:19.220 --> 2:57:24.220
 I can learn from every single person, you know?

2:57:24.280 --> 2:57:26.580
 Did I have to talk to the 200th truck driver?

2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:31.680
 In my opinion, yes, because I was gonna learn something

2:57:31.680 --> 2:57:33.920
 from that 200th truck driver.

2:57:33.920 --> 2:57:38.920
 Now, people with more power might talk to none,

2:57:39.680 --> 2:57:41.720
 or they might talk to five and say, okay, I got it.

2:57:41.720 --> 2:57:46.720
 You know, people are amazing

2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:49.100
 and every one of them has a life experience

2:57:49.100 --> 2:57:53.920
 and concerns and, you know, can teach us something.

2:57:53.920 --> 2:57:57.180
 And they're not in the conversation, you know?

2:57:57.180 --> 2:58:00.720
 And I know this because I'm the expert, you know?

2:58:00.720 --> 2:58:02.720
 So I get pulled in to these conversations

2:58:02.720 --> 2:58:04.260
 and people wanna know, you know,

2:58:04.260 --> 2:58:06.040
 what's gonna happen to labor, you know?

2:58:06.040 --> 2:58:10.200
 It's like, well, so I try to be a sounding board

2:58:10.200 --> 2:58:14.000
 and I feel a tremendous weight of responsibility,

2:58:14.960 --> 2:58:16.240
 you know, for that.

2:58:16.240 --> 2:58:21.240
 So, but I'm not those workers, you know?

2:58:21.640 --> 2:58:24.920
 And they may listen to this or, you know,

2:58:24.920 --> 2:58:27.120
 walk in the door sometime, it's about to be like,

2:58:27.120 --> 2:58:29.600
 that guy's full of shit, that's not what I think at all.

2:58:29.600 --> 2:58:30.440
 You know?

2:58:31.440 --> 2:58:34.680
 And they don't get heard over and over and over.

2:58:34.680 --> 2:58:36.920
 But in a small way, you are providing a voice to them

2:58:36.920 --> 2:58:40.600
 and that's kind of the, if at scale,

2:58:40.600 --> 2:58:43.980
 we apply that empathy and listening,

2:58:43.980 --> 2:58:46.120
 that we could provide the voice to the voiceless

2:58:46.120 --> 2:58:47.980
 through our votes, through our money, through,

2:58:47.980 --> 2:58:50.920
 I mean, that's one way to make capitalism work

2:58:50.920 --> 2:58:55.920
 at not making the powerless more powerless,

2:58:56.000 --> 2:58:58.440
 is by all of us being a community

2:58:58.440 --> 2:58:59.880
 that listens to the pain of others

2:58:59.880 --> 2:59:01.160
 and tries to minimize that,

2:59:01.160 --> 2:59:03.320
 to try to give a voice to the voiceless,

2:59:03.320 --> 2:59:05.480
 to give power to the powerless.

2:59:05.480 --> 2:59:08.520
 I have to ask you on, by way of advice,

2:59:09.640 --> 2:59:12.080
 young people, high school students, college students,

2:59:12.080 --> 2:59:15.080
 entering this world full of automation,

2:59:17.400 --> 2:59:22.400
 full of these complex labor markets and markets period,

2:59:23.540 --> 2:59:25.600
 what would you, what kind of advice would you give

2:59:25.600 --> 2:59:28.960
 to that person about how to have a career?

2:59:28.960 --> 2:59:31.280
 How to have a life they can be proud of?

2:59:32.520 --> 2:59:35.280
 Yeah, I think, you know, this is such a great question.

2:59:35.280 --> 2:59:42.280
 I don't, it's okay to quote Steve Jobs, right?

2:59:42.280 --> 2:59:45.600
 Always.

2:59:45.600 --> 2:59:49.520
 Yeah, I mean, so, and I just heard this recently.

2:59:49.520 --> 2:59:51.600
 It was a commencement speech that he gave

2:59:51.600 --> 2:59:53.080
 and I can't remember where it was.

2:59:53.080 --> 2:59:55.240
 And he was talking about, you know,

2:59:55.240 --> 2:59:56.660
 he had famously dropped out of school,

2:59:56.660 --> 2:59:58.980
 but continued to take classes, right?

2:59:59.840 --> 3:00:02.100
 And he took a calligraphy class

3:00:02.100 --> 3:00:06.040
 that influenced the design of the Mac and sort of fonts.

3:00:06.040 --> 3:00:09.520
 And, you know, just was something that he had no,

3:00:09.520 --> 3:00:11.400
 you know, sense of what it was gonna be useful for.

3:00:11.400 --> 3:00:13.600
 And his lesson was, you know,

3:00:13.600 --> 3:00:16.760
 you can't connect the dots looking forward.

3:00:16.760 --> 3:00:19.920
 You know, looking back, you can see all the pieces

3:00:19.920 --> 3:00:22.500
 that sort of led you to where you ended up.

3:00:22.500 --> 3:00:24.900
 And for me, studying truck driving,

3:00:24.900 --> 3:00:27.120
 like, I mean, I literally went to graduate school

3:00:27.120 --> 3:00:28.880
 because I was worried about climate change.

3:00:28.880 --> 3:00:31.240
 And like, you know, I had a whole other dissertation plan

3:00:31.240 --> 3:00:32.520
 and then was like driving home.

3:00:32.520 --> 3:00:35.800
 And like, I had read about all this management literature

3:00:35.800 --> 3:00:37.680
 and sort of like how you get workers to work hard

3:00:37.680 --> 3:00:39.000
 for my qualifying exams.

3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:41.000
 And then read a popular article

3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:44.000
 on satellite linked computers.

3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:45.880
 And the story in the literature was,

3:00:45.880 --> 3:00:47.160
 you know, a sense of autonomy.

3:00:47.160 --> 3:00:48.640
 And I was like, well,

3:00:48.640 --> 3:00:51.300
 that monitoring must affect the sense of autonomy.

3:00:51.300 --> 3:00:54.160
 And it's just this question that I found interesting.

3:00:54.160 --> 3:00:55.480
 And it never in a million years

3:00:55.480 --> 3:00:57.160
 that I ever thought I was gonna like study, you know,

3:00:57.160 --> 3:01:01.580
 spend 15 years of my life studying truck driving.

3:01:02.640 --> 3:01:07.080
 And it was like, if you were to map out a career path

3:01:07.080 --> 3:01:10.440
 in academia or research, like, you know,

3:01:10.440 --> 3:01:14.160
 you would do none of the things that I did

3:01:14.160 --> 3:01:15.940
 that many people advise me against.

3:01:15.940 --> 3:01:17.720
 Where like, you can't like go spend a year

3:01:17.720 --> 3:01:20.880
 working as a truck driver, you know, like that's crazy.

3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:23.000
 Or, you know, you can't, you know, spend all this time

3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:26.160
 trying to write like one huge book and, you know.

3:01:26.160 --> 3:01:28.120
 But by the way, if I could just interrupt,

3:01:28.120 --> 3:01:32.600
 what was the fire that got you to take the leap

3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:34.560
 and go and work as a truck driver

3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:36.840
 and go interview truck drivers?

3:01:36.840 --> 3:01:39.720
 This is what a lot of people would be incapable of doing,

3:01:39.720 --> 3:01:41.320
 just took that leap.

3:01:41.320 --> 3:01:43.800
 What the heck is up with your mind

3:01:43.800 --> 3:01:46.080
 that allowed you to take that big leap?

3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:50.080
 So I think it's probably like Tolkien.

3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:51.320
 And Lord of the Rings, you know.

3:01:51.320 --> 3:01:54.120
 I mean, I think as a teenager, you know,

3:01:54.120 --> 3:01:58.400
 I sort of adopted some sense of needing to, you know,

3:01:58.400 --> 3:02:01.960
 heroically go out in the world and, you know,

3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:03.640
 which I've done at various points in my life

3:02:03.640 --> 3:02:07.200
 and like looking back in absolutely stupid ways

3:02:07.200 --> 3:02:08.880
 that, you know, where I could have completely,

3:02:08.880 --> 3:02:11.200
 I ended up dead and traumatized my family,

3:02:11.200 --> 3:02:14.720
 including like, I took a couple week trip in the Pacific,

3:02:14.720 --> 3:02:16.280
 like a solo trip on a kayak.

3:02:16.280 --> 3:02:19.280
 And basically my kayak experience up till that, you know,

3:02:19.280 --> 3:02:21.480
 point had been, you know, on a fairly calm lake

3:02:21.480 --> 3:02:22.320
 and like class one rapids on a river.

3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:24.560
 Solo trip on a kayak in the Pacific.

3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:25.400
 Yeah, yeah.

3:02:25.400 --> 3:02:28.560
 So I was working on forestry issues

3:02:28.560 --> 3:02:30.520
 and we were starting a campaign

3:02:30.520 --> 3:02:33.080
 up in really remote British Columbia.

3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:35.280
 And I was like, okay, if I'm gonna work on this,

3:02:35.280 --> 3:02:36.720
 I've got to actually go there myself

3:02:36.720 --> 3:02:38.120
 and see what this is all about

3:02:38.120 --> 3:02:40.720
 and see whether it's worth like devoting my sort of,

3:02:40.720 --> 3:02:42.480
 you know, life right now too.

3:02:42.480 --> 3:02:45.240
 And just drove up there with this kayak

3:02:45.240 --> 3:02:49.400
 and, you know, put into the Pacific and it was insane.

3:02:49.400 --> 3:02:52.080
 You know, like the tides are huge

3:02:52.080 --> 3:02:54.160
 and, you know, there was one point

3:02:54.160 --> 3:02:56.400
 in which I was going down a fjord

3:02:56.400 --> 3:03:00.480
 and two fjords kind of came up and there was a cross channel

3:03:00.480 --> 3:03:03.360
 and I had hit the timing completely wrong

3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:05.800
 and the tide was sort of rushing up like, you know,

3:03:05.800 --> 3:03:08.600
 rivers in these, you know, two fjords

3:03:08.600 --> 3:03:11.560
 and then coming through this cross channel and met

3:03:11.560 --> 3:03:14.320
 and created this giant standing wave

3:03:14.320 --> 3:03:16.320
 that I had to paddle through.

3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:18.440
 And now actually very recently,

3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:20.200
 I've gone out on whitewater with some people

3:03:20.200 --> 3:03:21.760
 who know what the hell they're doing

3:03:21.760 --> 3:03:26.240
 and I realized like just how absolutely stupid

3:03:26.240 --> 3:03:28.320
 and, you know, ill fit I was,

3:03:28.320 --> 3:03:31.120
 but that's just, I think I've always had that.

3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:33.480
 Were you afraid when you had that wave before you?

3:03:33.480 --> 3:03:35.120
 That wave scared the shit out of me, yeah.

3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:39.080
 Okay, what about taking a leap and becoming a trucker?

3:03:39.080 --> 3:03:41.040
 Yeah, there was some nervousness for sure.

3:03:41.040 --> 3:03:44.080
 I mean, and, you know, I guess my advantage

3:03:44.080 --> 3:03:48.920
 as an ethnographer is I grew up in a blue collar environment.

3:03:48.920 --> 3:03:52.840
 You know, again, all my ancestors were factory workers.

3:03:52.840 --> 3:03:56.600
 So I can move through spaces.

3:03:56.600 --> 3:04:01.480
 I'm really, I feel, I can become comfortable

3:04:01.480 --> 3:04:03.880
 in lots and lots of places, you know, not everywhere,

3:04:03.880 --> 3:04:07.080
 but, you know, along class lines for sort of white,

3:04:07.080 --> 3:04:09.200
 you know, even white ethnic workers,

3:04:09.200 --> 3:04:10.720
 like that's, you know,

3:04:10.720 --> 3:04:13.080
 I can move in those spaces fairly easily.

3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:16.200
 I mean, not entirely, there was one time

3:04:16.200 --> 3:04:17.440
 where I was like, okay, you know,

3:04:17.440 --> 3:04:19.360
 and I grew up around people who worked on cars.

3:04:19.360 --> 3:04:21.120
 I'd been to drag races in NASCAR

3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:24.520
 and I'd been to, you know, Colgate University.

3:04:24.520 --> 3:04:26.720
 And so I'd, and I think that was probably

3:04:26.720 --> 3:04:28.360
 my initial training was, you know,

3:04:28.360 --> 3:04:32.480
 being this just working class kid who ends up in this,

3:04:32.480 --> 3:04:36.160
 you know, sort of blue blood, small liberal arts college

3:04:36.160 --> 3:04:39.600
 and just feeling like, you know,

3:04:39.600 --> 3:04:41.960
 both having the entire world opened up to me,

3:04:41.960 --> 3:04:43.840
 like philosophy and Buddhism

3:04:43.840 --> 3:04:46.720
 and things that I had never heard of, you know,

3:04:46.720 --> 3:04:48.920
 and just became totally obsessed with

3:04:48.920 --> 3:04:52.400
 and just like, you know, just following my interests.

3:04:52.400 --> 3:04:55.400
 But also culturally perhaps didn't feel like you fit in.

3:04:55.400 --> 3:04:57.800
 Feeling like just a fish out of water.

3:04:57.800 --> 3:04:59.840
 I just, you know, but, and at the same time

3:04:59.840 --> 3:05:02.120
 that sort of drove me in the sense

3:05:02.120 --> 3:05:04.320
 that it drove an opening of my mind

3:05:04.320 --> 3:05:06.080
 because I couldn't understand it.

3:05:06.080 --> 3:05:09.800
 You know, I was like, I didn't know that this world existed.

3:05:09.800 --> 3:05:11.720
 I don't understand.

3:05:11.720 --> 3:05:14.640
 And I think maybe that's where my real first step

3:05:14.640 --> 3:05:17.120
 in trying to understand other people

3:05:17.120 --> 3:05:18.560
 because they were my friends, you know?

3:05:18.560 --> 3:05:19.880
 I mean, they were my teammates.

3:05:19.880 --> 3:05:21.240
 I played lacrosse in college.

3:05:21.240 --> 3:05:22.760
 So like, you know, I was close to people

3:05:22.760 --> 3:05:25.840
 who came from such different backgrounds than I did.

3:05:25.840 --> 3:05:29.320
 And I just, I was so confused, you know?

3:05:29.320 --> 3:05:31.960
 And so I think I learned to learn

3:05:31.960 --> 3:05:34.160
 and then, you know, sort of went from there.

3:05:34.160 --> 3:05:36.000
 And then develop your fascination with people.

3:05:36.000 --> 3:05:38.960
 And the funny thing is you went from trucking now

3:05:38.960 --> 3:05:40.240
 to autonomous trucks.

3:05:40.240 --> 3:05:41.720
 I mean, this is speaking of not being able

3:05:41.720 --> 3:05:44.000
 to connect the dots and, you know,

3:05:44.000 --> 3:05:46.560
 your life in the next 10 years

3:05:46.560 --> 3:05:48.920
 could take very interesting directions

3:05:48.920 --> 3:05:50.200
 that are very difficult to,

3:05:50.200 --> 3:05:53.320
 first of all, us meeting is a funny little thing

3:05:53.320 --> 3:05:57.280
 given the things I'm working on with robots currently.

3:05:57.280 --> 3:06:00.720
 But, you know, it may not relate to trucks at all.

3:06:00.720 --> 3:06:03.280
 There's a, at a certain point,

3:06:03.280 --> 3:06:06.600
 autonomous trucks are just robots.

3:06:06.600 --> 3:06:08.680
 And then it starts getting into a conversation

3:06:08.680 --> 3:06:11.600
 about the roles of robots in society.

3:06:11.600 --> 3:06:15.560
 Yeah, and the roles of humans and robots.

3:06:15.560 --> 3:06:18.360
 And that interplay is right up your alley.

3:06:19.240 --> 3:06:20.080
 Yeah.

3:06:20.080 --> 3:06:21.960
 As somebody who deeply cares about humans

3:06:21.960 --> 3:06:25.080
 and have somehow found themselves studying robots.

3:06:25.080 --> 3:06:26.160
 Yeah, no, it's crazy.

3:06:26.160 --> 3:06:28.680
 I mean, even four or five years ago,

3:06:28.680 --> 3:06:30.440
 I would, if you had asked me

3:06:30.440 --> 3:06:32.120
 if I was gonna be studying trucking still,

3:06:32.120 --> 3:06:33.560
 I would have said no.

3:06:33.560 --> 3:06:36.840
 And so my advice is, I think if I was gonna give advice,

3:06:36.840 --> 3:06:38.520
 you know, is, you know,

3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:40.560
 you can't connect the dots looking forward.

3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:43.440
 You just gotta follow what interests you, you know?

3:06:43.440 --> 3:06:47.480
 And I think we downplay, right,

3:06:47.480 --> 3:06:50.600
 that when we talk to, you know, kids,

3:06:50.600 --> 3:06:52.360
 especially, you know, if you have some bright gifted kid

3:06:52.360 --> 3:06:54.560
 that gets identified as like, oh, you could go somewhere.

3:06:54.560 --> 3:06:55.960
 Then we're like, we feed them stuff.

3:06:55.960 --> 3:06:57.080
 You're like, we'll learn the piano

3:06:57.080 --> 3:06:58.640
 and learn another language, right?

3:06:58.640 --> 3:06:59.560
 Or learn robotics.

3:07:00.880 --> 3:07:02.840
 And then we tell other kids like,

3:07:02.840 --> 3:07:04.080
 oh, learn a trade, you know,

3:07:04.080 --> 3:07:05.320
 like figure out what's gonna pay well.

3:07:05.320 --> 3:07:06.800
 And not that there's anything against trades.

3:07:06.800 --> 3:07:10.040
 I think everyone should learn like manual skills

3:07:10.040 --> 3:07:10.880
 to make things.

3:07:10.880 --> 3:07:13.720
 I think it's incredibly satisfying and wonderful,

3:07:13.720 --> 3:07:15.080
 and we need more of that.

3:07:15.080 --> 3:07:18.200
 But also, you know, tell, you know, all kids,

3:07:18.200 --> 3:07:20.720
 it's okay to like take a class in something random

3:07:20.720 --> 3:07:22.040
 that you don't think you're gonna get

3:07:22.040 --> 3:07:23.920
 any economic return on.

3:07:23.920 --> 3:07:26.440
 Well, because maybe you will end up going into a trade,

3:07:26.440 --> 3:07:30.040
 but that class that you took in studio art

3:07:30.040 --> 3:07:31.960
 is gonna mean that, you know,

3:07:31.960 --> 3:07:33.640
 you look at buildings differently, right?

3:07:33.640 --> 3:07:36.440
 Or you end up sort of putting your own stamp on,

3:07:36.440 --> 3:07:38.160
 you know, woodworking, you know?

3:07:38.160 --> 3:07:40.760
 It just, I think that's the key is like,

3:07:40.760 --> 3:07:43.040
 follow, you know, it's cheesy

3:07:43.040 --> 3:07:44.520
 because everybody says, follow your passion.

3:07:44.520 --> 3:07:48.680
 But you know, we say that, and then we just, you know,

3:07:48.680 --> 3:07:51.440
 the 90% of what people hear is, you know,

3:07:51.440 --> 3:07:54.160
 what's the return on investment for that, you know?

3:07:54.160 --> 3:07:55.880
 It's like, you're a human being.

3:07:55.880 --> 3:07:58.360
 Like things interest you, music interests you,

3:07:58.360 --> 3:08:00.800
 literature interests you, video games interests you,

3:08:00.800 --> 3:08:02.360
 like follow it, you know?

3:08:02.360 --> 3:08:04.680
 Go grab a kayak and go into the pool.

3:08:04.680 --> 3:08:07.240
 Go do something really, no, don't do that.

3:08:07.240 --> 3:08:10.960
 Go do something stupid and something you'll regret

3:08:10.960 --> 3:08:11.800
 a lot later.

3:08:11.800 --> 3:08:13.760
 My poor mother, thank God she didn't know.

3:08:13.760 --> 3:08:16.760
 Well, let me ask, because for a lot of people work,

3:08:16.760 --> 3:08:20.360
 for me it is, quote unquote, work is a source of meaning.

3:08:20.360 --> 3:08:23.520
 And at the core of something we've been talking about

3:08:24.400 --> 3:08:27.200
 with jobs is meaning.

3:08:27.200 --> 3:08:28.640
 So the big ridiculous question,

3:08:28.640 --> 3:08:31.400
 what do you think is the meaning of life?

3:08:31.400 --> 3:08:36.240
 Do you think work for us humans in modern society

3:08:36.240 --> 3:08:38.760
 is as core to that meaning?

3:08:38.760 --> 3:08:42.200
 Is that something you think about in your work?

3:08:42.200 --> 3:08:43.760
 So the deeper question of meaning,

3:08:43.760 --> 3:08:46.680
 not just financial wellbeing and the quality of life,

3:08:46.680 --> 3:08:49.120
 but the deeper search for meaning.

3:08:50.120 --> 3:08:53.680
 Yeah, the meaning of life is love

3:08:53.680 --> 3:08:56.800
 and you can find love in your work.

3:08:57.720 --> 3:09:00.280
 Now, and I don't think everybody can.

3:09:00.280 --> 3:09:02.880
 There are a lot of jobs out there that just, you know,

3:09:02.880 --> 3:09:04.120
 you do it for a paycheck.

3:09:04.120 --> 3:09:08.480
 And I think we do have to be honest about that.

3:09:08.480 --> 3:09:11.200
 There are a lot of people who don't love their jobs

3:09:11.200 --> 3:09:14.480
 and we don't have jobs that they're gonna love.

3:09:15.880 --> 3:09:18.440
 And maybe that's not a sort of realistic,

3:09:18.440 --> 3:09:20.520
 that's a utopia, right?

3:09:20.520 --> 3:09:23.600
 But for those of us that have the luxury,

3:09:23.600 --> 3:09:28.600
 I mean, I think you love what you do that people say that.

3:09:28.600 --> 3:09:33.600
 I think the key for real happiness

3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:36.920
 is to love what you're trying to achieve

3:09:36.920 --> 3:09:39.280
 and maybe love trying to build a company

3:09:39.280 --> 3:09:41.800
 and make a lot of money just for the sake of doing that.

3:09:41.800 --> 3:09:44.400
 But I think the people who are really happy

3:09:44.400 --> 3:09:47.600
 and have great impacts, they love what they do

3:09:47.600 --> 3:09:49.160
 because it has an impact on the world

3:09:49.160 --> 3:09:52.920
 that they think is, it expresses that love, right?

3:09:52.920 --> 3:09:56.600
 And that could be at a counseling center,

3:09:56.600 --> 3:09:59.480
 that could be in your community,

3:09:59.480 --> 3:10:03.160
 that could be sending people to Mars, you know.

3:10:03.160 --> 3:10:05.120
 Well, I also think it doesn't necessarily,

3:10:05.120 --> 3:10:06.960
 the expression of love isn't necessary

3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:09.400
 about helping other people directly.

3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:11.400
 There's something about craftsmanship and skill

3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:12.920
 as we've talked about,

3:10:12.920 --> 3:10:15.720
 that's almost like you're celebrating humanity

3:10:15.720 --> 3:10:20.720
 by like searching for mastery in the task,

3:10:21.400 --> 3:10:25.600
 in the simple, like, especially tasks that people outside me

3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:30.000
 see as menial, as not important.

3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:33.160
 Nevertheless, searching for mastery,

3:10:33.160 --> 3:10:34.760
 for excellence in that task.

3:10:34.760 --> 3:10:36.320
 There's something deeply human to that

3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:40.520
 and also fulfilling that just like driving a truck

3:10:40.520 --> 3:10:42.840
 and getting damn good at it.

3:10:42.840 --> 3:10:45.440
 Like, you know, the best who's ever lived

3:10:45.440 --> 3:10:48.400
 and driving the truck and taking pride in that,

3:10:48.400 --> 3:10:50.760
 that's deeply meaningful.

3:10:50.760 --> 3:10:55.320
 And also like a real celebration of humanity

3:10:55.320 --> 3:10:59.120
 and a real show of love, I think, for humanity.

3:10:59.120 --> 3:11:00.640
 Yeah.

3:11:00.640 --> 3:11:01.960
 Yeah, I just had my floors redone

3:11:01.960 --> 3:11:04.160
 and the guy who did it was an artist.

3:11:04.160 --> 3:11:06.120
 You know, he sanded these old 100 year old floors

3:11:06.120 --> 3:11:08.760
 and made them look gorgeous and this is craft.

3:11:08.760 --> 3:11:10.360
 That's love right there.

3:11:10.360 --> 3:11:12.560
 Yeah, I mean, he showed us some love.

3:11:12.560 --> 3:11:17.320
 The product was just like, is enriching our lives.

3:11:17.320 --> 3:11:19.440
 Steve, this was an amazing conversation.

3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:21.840
 We've covered a lot of ground, your work,

3:11:21.840 --> 3:11:24.760
 just like you said, impossible to connect the dots,

3:11:24.760 --> 3:11:28.240
 but I'm glad you did all the amazing work you did.

3:11:28.240 --> 3:11:31.240
 You're exploring human nature at the core

3:11:31.240 --> 3:11:35.000
 of what America is, the blue collar America.

3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:36.360
 So thank you for your work.

3:11:36.360 --> 3:11:38.720
 Thank you for the care and the love you put in your work.

3:11:38.720 --> 3:11:40.240
 And thank you so much for spending

3:11:40.240 --> 3:11:42.320
 your valuable time with me.

3:11:42.320 --> 3:11:43.440
 I appreciate it, Lex.

3:11:43.440 --> 3:11:45.960
 I'm a big fan, so it's just been great to be on.

3:11:47.120 --> 3:11:49.000

3:11:56.720 --> 3:11:58.440
 from Napoleon Hill.

3:11:58.440 --> 3:12:00.800
 If you cannot do great things,

3:12:00.800 --> 3:12:03.760
 do small things in a great way.

3:12:03.760 --> 3:12:21.280
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
