00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
 The following is a conversation with Ben Askren,

00:02.560 --> 00:06.480
 wrestler, MMA fighter, and a brilliant,

00:06.480 --> 00:08.800
 opinionated, and fun personality

00:08.800 --> 00:10.360
 in the world of martial arts.

00:10.360 --> 00:14.600
 And yes, he occasionally likes to talk a little trash.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.680
 Given his wild online antics

00:16.680 --> 00:20.800
 and his boxing match with Jake Paul,

00:20.800 --> 00:23.920
 some people may forget just how dominant he was

00:23.920 --> 00:28.920
 in the sport of wrestling and in MMA for most of his career.

00:28.920 --> 00:32.840
 In wrestling, he is a two time NCAA Division I

00:32.840 --> 00:36.280
 national champion and four time finalist.

00:36.280 --> 00:39.520
 In mixed martial arts, he went undefeated for 10 years

00:39.520 --> 00:44.480
 with a record of 19 and 0 before losing to Jorge Masvidal

00:44.480 --> 00:47.320
 with a flying knee that caught everyone by surprise.

00:47.320 --> 00:50.400
 He's also into cryptocurrency, disc golf,

00:50.400 --> 00:54.840
 and is the cohost of Flow Wrestling Radio Live.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.120
 This is a Lex Friedman podcast.

00:59.440 --> 01:00.720
 in the description.

01:00.720 --> 01:04.920
 And now, here's my conversation with Ben Askren.

01:06.440 --> 01:10.280
 Before we talk about your incredible wrestling career,

01:10.280 --> 01:13.880
 your MMA career, let me ask you, I have to ask you,

01:13.880 --> 01:15.600
 what did you think about the Jake Paul

01:15.600 --> 01:17.340
 versus Tyron Woodley fight?

01:19.080 --> 01:20.800
 Well, I thought, I mean, I'm obviously biased.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.040
 I thought Tyron won.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.280
 I had five rounds of three.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.940
 And again, maybe this is my bias in the way I was seeing it.

01:27.940 --> 01:29.800
 I thought he was more effective with the striking

01:29.800 --> 01:32.560
 and he was more aggressive and Jake had more volume.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.980
 But that was the only thing I would give him.

01:35.980 --> 01:38.080
 And I guess a lot of people just didn't see it that way.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.120
 They thought he landed more, significantly more punches.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.800
 I just didn't think he really did any damage.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.400
 It was a split decision.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.200
 Split decision, yeah.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.160
 Were you surprised?

01:49.720 --> 01:51.240
 Well, it's the thing, so the thing I said

01:51.240 --> 01:53.400
 when I went in to fight him, I said, we don't really,

01:53.400 --> 01:54.840
 maybe he's good, maybe he's not.

01:54.840 --> 01:57.800
 We really have no idea to this point, you know?

01:57.800 --> 02:02.040
 And so I knew Tyron was a lot better boxing than I was.

02:02.040 --> 02:05.360
 And so I thought, okay, I think it's a good likelihood

02:05.360 --> 02:08.800
 that Tyron beats him up, but there's a chance

02:08.800 --> 02:10.480
 that Jake's kind of good at this.

02:10.480 --> 02:12.800
 And I think that's kind of what played out is

02:12.800 --> 02:13.640
 he's kind of good at it.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.020
 Even if you saw it the way I saw it,

02:15.020 --> 02:16.960
 he still was impressive in his showing

02:16.960 --> 02:19.340
 and he's obviously put a lot of time into it.

02:19.340 --> 02:23.480
 So he's not bad, we'll say that much.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.280
 But isn't it surprising to you that like

02:25.280 --> 02:30.040
 an elite level athlete, combat athlete,

02:30.040 --> 02:33.040
 lost to somebody who just takes it really seriously

02:33.040 --> 02:35.340
 but is nevertheless not elite level?

02:36.760 --> 02:40.380
 Hmm, but I think boxing's a really specific rule set.

02:40.380 --> 02:41.920
 So I'll speak about Tyron, not myself.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.000
 Tyron had good striking, but obviously

02:45.000 --> 02:47.480
 it was his first boxing match ever.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.980
 And within mixed martial arts, you have the fear

02:50.980 --> 02:52.400
 of the takedown and the fear of the kick

02:52.400 --> 02:54.920
 and fear of other things to go along with the punching.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.600
 And so if you look at Tyron,

02:56.600 --> 02:58.000
 throughout his MMA career last times,

02:58.000 --> 03:02.360
 what set up his punches were like level change fakes

03:02.360 --> 03:04.040
 at a takedown, they dropped, boom,

03:04.040 --> 03:05.880
 and then something comes over the top, right?

03:05.880 --> 03:07.720
 So there's many more elements to worry about

03:07.720 --> 03:10.440
 in mixed martial arts, whereas boxing, there's only one.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.080
 It was his first fight.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.800
 Yes, I thought Tyron was gonna win.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.680
 I thought this was gonna happen.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.120
 But like I said, I mean, it's pretty evident

03:16.120 --> 03:19.320
 that Jake's, he's not bad at boxing.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.440
 He's pretty solid, you know?

03:20.440 --> 03:23.360
 He gets in there and works hard at it, I guess.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.480
 Out of 10 times, how many times do you think Jake wins?

03:26.480 --> 03:27.440
 Against Tyron?

03:27.440 --> 03:28.280
 Against Tyron.

03:29.480 --> 03:32.040
 They fight again and again and again, like iteratively.

03:32.040 --> 03:35.280
 Yeah, so I mean, part of the thing is,

03:35.280 --> 03:37.440
 okay, so Jake's corner said you need a knockout

03:37.440 --> 03:38.600
 going into the eighth round, right?

03:38.600 --> 03:41.400
 So I think they thought, maybe they were trying

03:41.400 --> 03:43.080
 to motivate him, but I don't see it that way.

03:43.080 --> 03:45.960
 Because if they actually thought that he was winning,

03:45.960 --> 03:47.960
 why would they encourage him to take a dumb risk

03:47.960 --> 03:49.760
 when Tyron clearly has knockout power, right?

03:49.760 --> 03:51.720
 It's a really stupid coaching philosophy

03:51.720 --> 03:53.040
 if that's what you're thinking.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.040
 So you obviously are thinking,

03:54.040 --> 03:57.280
 hey, this is actually in the balance, it's competitive.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.200
 And I feel like Tyron thought maybe he was winning

04:00.200 --> 04:02.640
 and didn't have the urgency necessary.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.880
 And so I think there's a chance he turns it up a lot.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.120
 Man, I would wanna watch him again before I,

04:10.120 --> 04:12.720
 so okay, I have this problem with my personality.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.640
 Here's my personality, Lex.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.120
 I have an issue with not being able

04:16.120 --> 04:17.640
 to give really exact answers.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.160
 So I hate giving you an answer that like,

04:20.160 --> 04:22.360
 I don't feel like is 100% calculated.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.840
 So I would like to see them go once more

04:24.840 --> 04:26.720
 because I would like to see, hey, can Tyron,

04:26.720 --> 04:27.960
 because if Tyron can turn up the pace

04:27.960 --> 04:29.320
 and Jake can't handle it,

04:29.320 --> 04:31.880
 then I think it's an eight, one or nine, two, right?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.480
 If it goes the exact same way

04:34.480 --> 04:36.120
 and maybe Tyron was a close split decision,

04:36.120 --> 04:37.640
 I'm saying, oh, it's probably gonna be close

04:37.640 --> 04:38.480
 every single time.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.120
 We're probably gonna get a five to five type of thing.

04:41.120 --> 04:45.000
 So it's like, I feel like out of one match,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
 it's not totally indicative of what the future

04:47.000 --> 04:47.840
 is gonna look like.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.320
 I feel like Tyron would get a knockout

04:49.320 --> 04:52.080
 and then you would still be in the same place,

04:52.080 --> 04:56.160
 like not knowing what to predict.

04:56.160 --> 05:00.080
 Okay, so your fight with Jake Paul,

05:00.080 --> 05:03.480
 looking back, you had a little bit of time now.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.080
 How would you analyze that fight?

05:06.960 --> 05:08.920
 Well, I mean, the fight specifically,

05:08.920 --> 05:10.760
 I got cracked with an overhand right,

05:10.760 --> 05:12.640
 so I mean, it kind of sucks.

05:12.640 --> 05:16.960
 I would say, and this is where everyone's like,

05:16.960 --> 05:20.120
 I really don't care and everyone's like,

05:20.120 --> 05:20.960
 why would you do that?

05:20.960 --> 05:21.880
 It turns your reputation.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.640
 It's like, well, I wanted to do it.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.360
 I had an enjoyable time training and in the buildup.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.720
 Obviously, I wasn't skillful enough to get the win,

05:29.720 --> 05:33.480
 but even despite the fact that I know what's gonna happen,

05:33.480 --> 05:34.640
 if someone asked me to do it again,

05:34.640 --> 05:36.800
 I probably would have done it again.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.600
 And so the way I was thinking about

05:38.600 --> 05:40.880
 when I was deciding whether to do it or not,

05:40.880 --> 05:42.000
 because I got the offer,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.160
 it's like, okay, is this money, it can change my life.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.000
 Yeah, it could, right?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.280
 It's not gonna double my net worth,

05:48.280 --> 05:50.880
 but it's gonna add significantly and make my life easier.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.280
 Number two is like, when I was in high school,

05:52.280 --> 05:54.120
 we used to do boxing matches for free,

05:54.120 --> 05:55.160
 just because we thought it was fun.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.040
 When we didn't have something going on Friday night,

05:57.040 --> 05:58.440
 me and my buddies would get together

05:58.440 --> 05:59.840
 and we had some boxing goes on, basically,

05:59.840 --> 06:01.720
 and we'd punch each other in the head.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.320
 So it's like, for something I think is enjoyable,

06:03.320 --> 06:05.240
 and now they're gonna pay me a whole bunch of money,

06:05.240 --> 06:07.320
 yeah, sure, I'll do it.

06:07.320 --> 06:10.480
 Would you, do you think if you got the rematch,

06:10.480 --> 06:12.360
 if you did the rematch, would you,

06:12.360 --> 06:13.680
 what are the odds you win?

06:13.680 --> 06:14.520
 Okay, let's see.

06:14.520 --> 06:15.360
 I'm probably not very good.

06:15.360 --> 06:16.320
 I think he's pretty good, actually,

06:16.320 --> 06:17.720
 and I'm not very good.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.040
 Now it's probably at a low point for me,

06:20.040 --> 06:22.040
 because, so when I started training for that,

06:22.040 --> 06:24.100
 I was like 215 pounds, which is the heaviest I've ever been.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.280
 I came off my hip surgery.

06:25.280 --> 06:30.240
 I literally, when I said, yes, I'll do it,

06:30.240 --> 06:32.000
 I had literally started working out the week before

06:32.000 --> 06:35.200
 for the first time in my, since the surgery,

06:35.200 --> 06:37.160
 because I wasn't able to do anything.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.800
 So could I perform better?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.920
 Yeah, but now after watching him box Tyron,

06:41.920 --> 06:44.640
 like if you ask me, Ben, can you beat Tyron?

06:44.640 --> 06:47.960
 Probably not, but I don't think I can beat Tyron.

06:47.960 --> 06:48.800
 So.

06:48.800 --> 06:49.640
 In boxing.

06:49.640 --> 06:50.520
 In boxing, correct, in boxing, yeah.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.280
 So my chances of beating him, you know,

06:52.280 --> 06:55.200
 and watching that card, it's like, damn,

06:55.200 --> 06:58.080
 like, it'd kind of be fun to box someone who I know sucks,

06:58.080 --> 07:00.780
 who I know can beat, that's what would be fun, you know?

07:00.780 --> 07:03.940
 Because like, the training, the preparation was fun,

07:03.940 --> 07:07.440
 but then obviously, I got my butt kicked, that sucked.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.820
 You know, can I swear on this podcast?

07:08.820 --> 07:09.660
 Yeah, of course.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.760
 Oh, I was gonna drop an F bomb, I wasn't quite sure, sorry.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.680
 I think that sucked, is a swear.

07:13.680 --> 07:14.520
 No, no, no.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.800
 You could drop all of the F bombs you want.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.480
 So, preparation wise, do you think you were more prepared

07:20.480 --> 07:25.340
 for that fight, or the Jordan Burrows exhibition?

07:27.800 --> 07:31.440
 I mean, like, how did you approach it mentally, you know?

07:31.440 --> 07:33.440
 Well, the Burrows thing, I obviously, it's okay.

07:33.440 --> 07:36.280
 So when I retired the first time in 2017,

07:36.280 --> 07:39.040
 Burrows was the only current, like,

07:39.040 --> 07:40.400
 we'll say really elite level wrestler

07:40.400 --> 07:42.160
 that I'd never trained with.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.960
 I was really good friends with in Nebraska,

07:43.960 --> 07:45.520
 head of the coaching team, still am.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.520
 And I said, hey, I just want, I'm gonna pay my own way.

07:47.520 --> 07:48.360
 I want to come down and train with Jordan,

07:48.360 --> 07:50.160
 because I want to see what it feels like.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.600
 You know, I want to get in there and mix it up.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.080
 I've mixed it up with David Taylor and Kyle Dake.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.280
 I mean, there's just something about wrestling that I love.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.460
 And so I flew myself down there in January of 2018,

08:00.460 --> 08:02.200
 and I spent four days training with Jordan.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.640
 It was a really good time.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.440
 It gave me some great insight into how he thinks,

08:06.440 --> 08:09.120
 and you know, what a great champion he is.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.360
 What was it like training with him?

08:10.360 --> 08:12.160
 Like what, can you give some insights?

08:12.160 --> 08:13.000
 Yeah, of course.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
 Like what the, like how hard is the live training?

08:18.560 --> 08:19.520
 Is it more drilling?

08:19.520 --> 08:20.360
 Is it technical?

08:20.360 --> 08:23.880
 Like how does, his, it seems like his style

08:23.880 --> 08:25.400
 is very different than yours.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.000
 So how does that match up in the room

08:27.000 --> 08:29.280
 in terms of like what you learn from each other,

08:29.280 --> 08:30.120
 that kind of thing?

08:30.120 --> 08:31.760
 We only went full live for one,

08:31.760 --> 08:33.560
 I think it was like 12 or 15 minutes ago

08:33.560 --> 08:35.520
 where it was just go, wrestle.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.720
 We did a bunch of simulated live,

08:38.720 --> 08:41.960
 but obviously he had, so I was a senior in college

08:41.960 --> 08:43.400
 and he was a freshman in Nebraska.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.040
 And so we, our teams had dueled each other.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.440
 He was obviously a lot smaller at that point in time,

08:47.440 --> 08:49.100
 but he had followed my career.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.000
 And so when I went in there, it was like,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.360
 hey, I know you're really good at this position.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.320
 What about this position?

08:55.320 --> 08:56.160
 What are you trying to do?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.720
 How exactly does it work?

08:57.720 --> 09:00.120
 And then let's wrestle there, you know?

09:00.120 --> 09:01.700
 And then, hey, what about this position?

09:01.700 --> 09:05.520
 And so we would spend 30 to 40 minutes

09:05.520 --> 09:07.560
 talking about that position.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.960
 On the ground or?

09:08.960 --> 09:10.840
 It was like, one was a chest wrap,

09:10.840 --> 09:13.320
 one was a headlock, one was, I don't remember,

09:13.320 --> 09:15.920
 it's called the, we call it the lightning dump, but it's a.

09:15.920 --> 09:16.960
 The lightning dump?

09:16.960 --> 09:19.280
 Yeah, my buddy's name was Lightning Luke Smith

09:19.280 --> 09:21.300
 in high school and he was the first person I saw do it.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.260
 So usually when I see someone do something,

09:23.260 --> 09:24.920
 then I name that move after them.

09:24.920 --> 09:25.760
 Got it.

09:26.920 --> 09:27.760
 I know, right?

09:27.760 --> 09:28.580
 Great name.

09:28.580 --> 09:29.420
 It's a good name.

09:29.420 --> 09:32.040
 Yeah, but so what I said with that is like,

09:32.040 --> 09:33.560
 he was still trying to be the best in the world.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.080
 I was just trying to go work out with Jordan Burrows

09:35.080 --> 09:36.320
 because I enjoy wrestling.

09:38.220 --> 09:40.240
 Is like someone who at that point,

09:40.240 --> 09:42.260
 when he has five world titles at that,

09:42.260 --> 09:44.400
 four or five at that point, a lot.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.780
 And so he said, my high school kids is like,

09:45.780 --> 09:48.020
 hey, this is a guy who's the best in the world,

09:48.020 --> 09:49.880
 who's bringing someone in and saying,

09:49.880 --> 09:50.760
 well, how do I do this?

09:50.760 --> 09:51.600
 How do I do that?

09:51.600 --> 09:52.420
 What about this?

09:52.420 --> 09:53.260
 What about that?

09:53.260 --> 09:58.260
 And so the level of inquisitiveness he has

09:58.260 --> 09:59.460
 is really impressive.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.660
 And then it's obvious why he got to the level he did

10:01.660 --> 10:04.180
 because he's figuring out all these little situations.

10:04.180 --> 10:05.840
 And that's honestly one of the biggest things

10:05.840 --> 10:08.780
 I think wrestlers, a lot of wrestlers fail to do

10:08.780 --> 10:09.900
 as they get older.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.720
 Even when they get to early college age,

10:11.720 --> 10:12.980
 they say, this is my style.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.140
 This is what I do.

10:14.140 --> 10:16.260
 I'm gonna lift and work out hard

10:16.260 --> 10:19.260
 and I'm not gonna add anything to my game.

10:19.260 --> 10:21.580
 Whereas you've seen many progressions

10:21.580 --> 10:22.420
 in Jordan Burrows game.

10:22.420 --> 10:24.460
 He just made his 10th world team.

10:24.460 --> 10:27.540
 And if you have a really keen eye,

10:27.540 --> 10:30.220
 you've been able to watch him change.

10:30.220 --> 10:32.260
 I've been watching him since 2007.

10:32.260 --> 10:34.180
 He's changed so much.

10:34.180 --> 10:36.640
 And obviously still maintained a world class level

10:36.640 --> 10:37.780
 almost the entire time.

10:38.780 --> 10:40.900
 When you say change, like what changed?

10:40.900 --> 10:42.580
 Because he's got that double leg.

10:42.580 --> 10:44.500
 Yeah, but there's no double leg anymore.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.340
 What's that?

10:45.340 --> 10:46.220
 He like his double leg for the first time

10:46.220 --> 10:48.780
 against Alex Deering, he hadn't hit it in years.

10:48.780 --> 10:51.220
 Yeah, so that's like when people think about Jordan Burrows,

10:51.220 --> 10:52.260
 they think about the double leg

10:52.260 --> 10:54.260
 because in his early years,

10:54.260 --> 10:55.740
 fire, he had a great double leg, right?

10:55.740 --> 10:57.940
 And even so in those years, I would say

10:58.960 --> 11:01.540
 the biggest thing with Jordan Burrows double leg

11:01.540 --> 11:04.120
 wasn't his level of explosiveness,

11:04.120 --> 11:05.820
 it was his level of persistence.

11:05.820 --> 11:08.280
 He would shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.020
 And it would last time to be from fun, creative angles

11:11.020 --> 11:13.360
 and on the screen, all of a sudden he's on you.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.500
 And he was just super persistent with it.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.460
 And I think that was probably the key.

11:17.460 --> 11:20.220
 And then you saw, when he came out

11:20.220 --> 11:22.060
 to the won the first world championship in 2011,

11:22.060 --> 11:24.140
 it was kind of that type of mentality.

11:24.140 --> 11:25.360
 And then shortly after then,

11:25.360 --> 11:26.620
 obviously everyone was starting to lower

11:26.620 --> 11:27.460
 their stance getting lower

11:27.460 --> 11:28.980
 and he developed a really good like

11:28.980 --> 11:30.460
 Mantis go behind series

11:30.460 --> 11:32.380
 where he would go one way the other way.

11:32.380 --> 11:33.520
 Then he started developing really good

11:33.520 --> 11:36.600
 like low single ankle pick type thing, you know?

11:36.600 --> 11:39.740
 And then his hand fighting got really tremendous,

11:39.740 --> 11:43.180
 like 15, 16, 17, his hand fighting was really good.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.140
 And now I just commented at the 21 trials,

11:45.140 --> 11:47.820
 like a few of the defensive sequences he got into,

11:47.820 --> 11:48.940
 it was like, holy shit,

11:48.940 --> 11:50.780
 like just not from an athletic standpoint,

11:50.780 --> 11:51.900
 from a technical standpoint,

11:51.900 --> 11:53.860
 the things he were doing was just tremendous.

11:53.860 --> 11:55.860
 So I've seen him as someone like

11:55.860 --> 11:57.980
 who's continued to reinvent themselves

11:57.980 --> 12:00.740
 over the course of the last 10, 12 years.

12:00.740 --> 12:04.540
 Especially as a junior and senior in college,

12:04.540 --> 12:06.620
 you're exceptionally dominant.

12:06.620 --> 12:08.780
 If you were to face him at the peak,

12:08.780 --> 12:11.300
 both of your peaks of NCAA wrestling,

12:11.300 --> 12:13.160
 could you beat him?

12:13.160 --> 12:15.060
 And if you can beat him,

12:15.060 --> 12:16.900
 well, of course you can beat him.

12:18.060 --> 12:20.660
 How do you solve the Jordan Boroughs problem?

12:20.660 --> 12:23.140
 Well, so from a folk style wrestling standpoint,

12:23.140 --> 12:23.980
 Folk style, yes.

12:23.980 --> 12:24.820
 Folk style.

12:24.820 --> 12:27.180
 So, you know, he had some competitive matches

12:27.180 --> 12:28.060
 his junior and senior year.

12:28.060 --> 12:29.740
 He had a two, one win over,

12:29.740 --> 12:31.500
 or maybe it's three, two over Michael Chandler,

12:31.500 --> 12:33.740
 who was my teammate who's fighting in the UFC now.

12:33.740 --> 12:36.740
 He had a two and win over Tyler Caldwell.

12:36.740 --> 12:39.420
 So I think you can glean some insight into that.

12:39.420 --> 12:40.800
 You know, he got ridden,

12:40.800 --> 12:42.620
 he got so mad about this up on a podcast.

12:42.620 --> 12:43.460
 So during Corona,

12:43.460 --> 12:45.900
 we had to make up all kinds of bullshit to talk about.

12:45.900 --> 12:49.300
 And we were doing like the last 10 years best 165s.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.020
 And I said, Kyle Dake would ride him for over a minute.

12:52.020 --> 12:54.100
 He got so mad he wanted to come on the podcast the next day.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.820
 So hopefully he doesn't listen to this and be like,

12:55.820 --> 12:58.060
 fuck you, man, you know?

12:58.060 --> 12:58.900
 But, you know.

12:58.900 --> 12:59.820
 When was this?

12:59.820 --> 13:00.780
 This is during Corona.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.940
 Corona, last year.

13:01.940 --> 13:02.780
 He got mad.

13:02.780 --> 13:03.600
 We were talking about, we were.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.440
 Before the trials.

13:04.440 --> 13:05.280
 Yeah, correct, yeah.

13:05.280 --> 13:09.220
 So, you know, Michael Chandler rode him for two minutes plus

13:09.220 --> 13:11.020
 and that was his junior year, not his senior year.

13:11.020 --> 13:11.860
 Sure, right?

13:11.860 --> 13:14.060
 But it's close.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.660
 So I think there's some things there.

13:15.660 --> 13:16.980
 I think the interesting thing would be

13:16.980 --> 13:19.220
 if I would have stuck around, right?

13:19.220 --> 13:20.700
 So I chose to go into mixed martial arts

13:20.700 --> 13:23.020
 after 2008, I would have been 74

13:23.020 --> 13:23.860
 and he would have been 74.

13:23.860 --> 13:24.740
 So we would have had to wrestle.

13:24.740 --> 13:27.260
 And then I think that the freestyle Jordan Burroughs puzzle

13:27.260 --> 13:29.180
 is a lot more difficult to solve

13:29.180 --> 13:31.020
 than the folk style Jordan Burroughs puzzle.

13:31.020 --> 13:32.660
 And I think, I don't think he would,

13:32.660 --> 13:35.100
 I think he would acknowledge that he's much better

13:35.100 --> 13:37.060
 at freestyle than he was at folk style.

13:37.060 --> 13:39.140
 You know, although he was very good, he's better.

13:39.140 --> 13:42.940
 This is like raw speed explosiveness.

13:42.940 --> 13:44.300
 Present a problem to you.

13:44.300 --> 13:47.840
 Well, so he was never, I mean, he didn't really excel

13:47.840 --> 13:49.740
 on the mat in kind of either style.

13:49.740 --> 13:53.100
 In freestyle, he has got some good lace transitions,

13:53.100 --> 13:54.340
 but in folk style, like his whole,

13:54.340 --> 13:55.740
 like in his entire college career,

13:55.740 --> 13:59.020
 I think he has like 10 pins, which is almost nothing,

13:59.020 --> 14:03.220
 you know, so he was gaining no value off the top position.

14:03.220 --> 14:05.460
 He was good enough on most people to get off bottom

14:05.460 --> 14:07.700
 without it being an issue, but it wasn't like,

14:07.700 --> 14:09.460
 oh my gosh, this is an area where we really have

14:09.460 --> 14:11.740
 to be careful, there's a lot of things here.

14:11.740 --> 14:13.880
 You know, it's just, he wasn't gaining value there.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.360
 Whereas in freestyle, he, I don't wanna say never,

14:17.360 --> 14:19.900
 but the amount of times he gets turned is incredibly rare,

14:19.900 --> 14:22.980
 very, very rare, and he does have like lace transitions,

14:22.980 --> 14:24.060
 so he gets a lot of points there.

14:24.060 --> 14:26.740
 So, and obviously freestyle is,

14:27.620 --> 14:30.200
 it can be geared way more in the neutral position, right?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.740
 Where we're only doing takedowns, so yeah.

14:32.740 --> 14:37.180
 Were you surprised that he lost to Dake in the trials,

14:37.180 --> 14:38.860
 to Kyle Dake?

14:38.860 --> 14:41.140
 Oh, Kyle's so, so, he's so good, right?

14:41.140 --> 14:43.860
 I mean, I think, I think his performance at the Olympics

14:43.860 --> 14:47.660
 was, his loss then was shocking to,

14:47.660 --> 14:50.100
 I mean, we understand it happened to Kyle Dake, you know?

14:50.100 --> 14:53.580
 He's been a guy who's competed with Jordan Burrows forever,

14:53.580 --> 14:55.300
 and obviously he was on the losing side for a while,

14:55.300 --> 14:56.900
 and now he's on the winning side.

14:58.020 --> 15:00.740
 But I think a lot of people thought it was a coin flip,

15:00.740 --> 15:03.740
 and I think actually Kyle Dake made it feel like

15:03.740 --> 15:05.100
 it's not a coin flip.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.740
 Now, to me, it feels like Kyle Dake isn't gonna win

15:07.740 --> 15:10.260
 that match significantly more times than he isn't,

15:10.260 --> 15:11.460
 is what it feels like.

15:11.460 --> 15:14.300
 Yeah, I forgot which trials it was.

15:14.300 --> 15:19.300
 Was it four years ago, where Kyle Dake threw him?

15:19.420 --> 15:23.580
 Like he, he, you saw inklings of like,

15:23.580 --> 15:27.020
 oh wow, there might be eventually a changing of the guard.

15:27.020 --> 15:31.860
 Yeah, so at 13, Kyle came out and he had the one throw,

15:31.860 --> 15:35.080
 but then he lost one of the matches decisively,

15:35.080 --> 15:39.180
 and then he was hurt in 14, and in 16,

15:39.180 --> 15:41.220
 Kyle Dake actually went up to 86 kilograms,

15:41.220 --> 15:45.100
 so actually in 16, at the trials we had,

15:45.100 --> 15:46.460
 so Jake Herbert was number one seed,

15:46.460 --> 15:47.980
 he was a former, as Guy Russell,

15:47.980 --> 15:50.180
 I was a former world silver medalist.

15:50.180 --> 15:52.640
 So you had David Taylor, who had not made a team yet,

15:52.640 --> 15:54.740
 who is now a world champion, Olympic champion.

15:54.740 --> 15:56.380
 You had Kyle Dake in the bracket,

15:56.380 --> 15:58.980
 who was a two time world champion now,

15:58.980 --> 16:00.440
 and you had Jaden Cox in the bracket,

16:00.440 --> 16:01.700
 who had not made any teams yet,

16:01.700 --> 16:03.860
 but is now, what, a four time world medalist,

16:03.860 --> 16:04.980
 two time world champion.

16:04.980 --> 16:07.440
 So, and then obviously Jaden came out on top of that,

16:07.440 --> 16:10.620
 won his first Olympic medal, Olympic bronze medal.

16:10.620 --> 16:13.980
 So Kyle didn't wrestle Jordan in 16,

16:13.980 --> 16:17.400
 and Kyle's contention the whole time,

16:18.340 --> 16:19.340
 and they argued about this,

16:19.340 --> 16:21.260
 so I actually did a little bit of backstabbing.

16:21.260 --> 16:22.460
 Well, it's not backstabbing.

16:22.460 --> 16:23.500
 And both of them, or just one of them?

16:23.500 --> 16:24.500
 I didn't tell any of them.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.620
 Okay, so Jordan got mad.

16:26.620 --> 16:28.900
 We talked about this fake match during Corona, right?

16:28.900 --> 16:30.460
 We had to make up something to talk about.

16:30.460 --> 16:31.300
 Yeah, of course.

16:31.300 --> 16:32.440
 There's obviously no matches.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.420
 So we talked about this fake match, and.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.140
 Do you stand behind that statement, by the way?

16:36.140 --> 16:37.620
 Listen, here's what I said.

16:37.620 --> 16:39.680
 Kyle Dake's a four time NCAA champion.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.300
 Yes, I said, you gotta pick a winner.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.020
 I said, Kyle Dake wins two, one

16:44.020 --> 16:45.580
 on a minute and six ride time,

16:45.580 --> 16:49.260
 which I mean, we're talking as close as it gets,

16:49.260 --> 16:50.820
 as close as it gets for Kyle Dake,

16:50.820 --> 16:52.560
 who's a four time NCAA champion.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.340
 I'm sorry, we're talking.

16:54.340 --> 16:55.340
 Over Jordan Burrows.

16:55.340 --> 16:56.420
 Over Jordan Burrows.

16:56.420 --> 16:57.260
 In a Folkestown match.

16:57.260 --> 16:58.300
 In a Folkestown match.

16:58.300 --> 16:59.140
 The hypothetical.

16:59.140 --> 16:59.960
 Back in college or now?

16:59.960 --> 17:00.800
 Completely hypothetical.

17:00.800 --> 17:01.640
 Now or in college?

17:01.640 --> 17:02.460
 In college.

17:02.460 --> 17:04.700
 Both of them at their peaks at 165 pounds.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.940
 So completely hypothetical.

17:06.940 --> 17:10.540
 And so Jordan called in, he was all pissed at me

17:10.540 --> 17:11.780
 for picking Kyle Dake.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.700
 He wants to come on the next day and argue his point.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.940
 So I said, F that, that's dumb.

17:16.940 --> 17:17.860
 Oh, we had to pick a winner.

17:17.860 --> 17:19.100
 We had to do something hypothetical.

17:19.100 --> 17:20.540
 So then I called Kyle Dake, and I said,

17:20.540 --> 17:22.260
 Kyle, Jordan's gonna come on and argue his case

17:22.260 --> 17:23.200
 in the morning.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.940
 If he's gonna do that, why don't you come in

17:24.940 --> 17:26.340
 and argue your case?

17:26.340 --> 17:29.700
 So no one else knew Kyle was coming on the podcast.

17:29.700 --> 17:32.480
 So they both show up, and they went at it.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.900
 But one of the contentions Kyle had for years,

17:34.900 --> 17:36.300
 and there's still this rule,

17:36.300 --> 17:40.900
 if you win a world level medal, the following year,

17:40.900 --> 17:44.700
 you sit out until the very end of the American trials.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.660
 And they do a best two or three.

17:46.660 --> 17:49.860
 So every time previously that Kyle had wrestled Jordan,

17:49.860 --> 17:52.820
 he had to come through a tournament on Saturday.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.580
 Okay, probably three matches.

17:54.580 --> 17:56.820
 And then on Sunday, he would wrestle Jordan

17:56.820 --> 17:58.180
 in the best two out of three, right?

17:58.180 --> 18:00.500
 So his contention was, I'm only wrestling Jordan

18:00.500 --> 18:02.740
 at a disadvantage because I have to compete on Saturday

18:02.740 --> 18:04.860
 and then competing on, which it's a fair argument.

18:04.860 --> 18:05.700
 It really is.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.140
 But I also see USA Wrestling's point.

18:08.140 --> 18:10.060
 It's like, if someone wins a world medal,

18:10.060 --> 18:11.020
 we are gonna reward them

18:11.020 --> 18:13.500
 because we want that person on the team again.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.900
 It's crazy though that Kyle Dake had to wrestle,

18:16.900 --> 18:19.260
 because he's not wrestling bums in that division.

18:19.260 --> 18:20.460
 Not bums, yeah.

18:20.460 --> 18:22.260
 And yeah, I don't know.

18:22.260 --> 18:23.620
 I don't know how wrestlers do it.

18:23.620 --> 18:28.340
 Because you have to go to war like three matches

18:28.340 --> 18:30.060
 and then face Jordan Burrows.

18:30.060 --> 18:33.660
 Yeah, especially a few of those years with Dakehead,

18:33.660 --> 18:34.660
 the name Andrew Howe.

18:34.660 --> 18:36.740
 But it was a really competitive matches.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.620
 David Taylor had really competitive matches with him.

18:38.620 --> 18:40.340
 Isaiah Martinez even got in there, Deeringer.

18:40.340 --> 18:42.140
 So he had some really competitive matches

18:42.140 --> 18:44.700
 before he ever got to Jordan Burrows.

18:44.700 --> 18:47.220
 So I never answered your initial question was,

18:47.220 --> 18:48.060
 how did I feel?

18:48.060 --> 18:50.020
 So the Jordan Burrows match,

18:50.020 --> 18:52.380
 I was not in wrestling shape at all,

18:52.380 --> 18:53.660
 meaning wrestling's heavily dependent,

18:53.660 --> 18:54.580
 especially in neutral positions,

18:54.580 --> 18:56.540
 heavily dependent on timing and other things.

18:56.540 --> 18:58.500
 I was wrestling very, very minimally

18:58.500 --> 19:00.700
 because I started fighting again.

19:00.700 --> 19:03.820
 So like my athletic shape was great,

19:03.820 --> 19:06.140
 but it was mainly for fighting, I wasn't wrestling.

19:06.140 --> 19:10.380
 So I think they were actually trying to do Burrows,

19:10.380 --> 19:12.140
 Dake at the Beat the Streets.

19:12.140 --> 19:14.060
 It's the biggest fundraiser in wrestling

19:14.060 --> 19:14.900
 every single year.

19:14.900 --> 19:15.740
 In New York?

19:15.740 --> 19:16.740
 In New York City.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.140
 They usually raise like a million dollars.

19:18.140 --> 19:20.660
 They started all these programs in New York City to get,

19:20.660 --> 19:22.620
 which I really wonder what they're doing with the money now

19:22.620 --> 19:24.060
 because they probably can't have the kids wrestling

19:24.060 --> 19:25.820
 because New York's crazy.

19:25.820 --> 19:26.660
 Anyways.

19:26.660 --> 19:27.660
 I think New York figures out a way

19:27.660 --> 19:28.740
 what to do with the money.

19:28.740 --> 19:31.460
 Hence Michael Malice complaining that they're corrupt

19:31.460 --> 19:32.300
 and all that.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.180
 But it goes to the Beat the Streets organization

19:34.180 --> 19:35.580
 who then starts the clubs in New York.

19:35.580 --> 19:36.660
 So I don't know what to do with the money.

19:36.660 --> 19:39.580
 Anyway, so I was called like, I don't know,

19:39.580 --> 19:41.780
 two weeks before the event and said,

19:41.780 --> 19:44.820
 hey, someone was supposed to wrestle Jordan Burrows.

19:44.820 --> 19:45.820
 It fell out.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.300
 Would you wrestle him?

19:48.300 --> 19:49.140
 I said, yeah, sure.

19:49.140 --> 19:49.980
 Why not?

19:49.980 --> 19:51.620
 And it's like, well, they said,

19:51.620 --> 19:55.500
 I trained with them for four days the year before.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.460
 I had a pretty good idea how the match was going to go.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.220
 It wasn't going to go so well for me,

19:59.220 --> 20:01.020
 but it's like, okay, you're missing a main event.

20:01.020 --> 20:03.700
 I can bring, because of where I'm at right now in my life,

20:03.700 --> 20:05.180
 I can bring a lot of attention to wrestling.

20:05.180 --> 20:06.860
 I can help you guys raise a bunch of money

20:06.860 --> 20:08.260
 for Beat the Streets.

20:08.260 --> 20:10.980
 My goal is I think I thought I could get one take down

20:10.980 --> 20:13.860
 or turn on him was kind of my goal for the match.

20:13.860 --> 20:15.500
 I didn't get there.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.620
 He went kind of hard.

20:16.620 --> 20:17.460
 He went hard?

20:17.460 --> 20:18.660
 Yeah, that asshole didn't give me a point.

20:18.660 --> 20:20.420
 Yeah, that.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.700
 I said, this is bullshit, Jordan.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.700
 I told him during the match, like, this is bullshit.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.460
 You're fucking going too hard right now.

20:25.460 --> 20:26.300
 I'm not a wrestler.

20:26.300 --> 20:27.140
 I'm not a wrestler anymore.

20:27.140 --> 20:27.980
 I'm a fighter.

20:27.980 --> 20:28.820
 I'm coming in here.

20:28.820 --> 20:30.180
 So yeah, so I had a really good idea.

20:30.180 --> 20:31.460
 I mean, we wrestled together.

20:31.460 --> 20:33.380
 I think he'll probably get mad

20:33.380 --> 20:35.500
 because I think in the live go,

20:35.500 --> 20:36.940
 we did like the 12 or 15 minutes.

20:36.940 --> 20:39.300
 I think I actually scored a take down in that, I believe.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.860
 Maybe, or maybe it was a turn.

20:40.860 --> 20:43.540
 He'll probably say, no, I didn't, but whatever.

20:43.540 --> 20:45.820
 Yeah, so I knew what was going to happen.

20:45.820 --> 20:47.900
 I knew what the outcome was going to be.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.940
 I knew I could probably, I was hoping I could stay competitive

20:49.940 --> 20:51.780
 and maybe, you know, lose like 10, two or something.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.700
 Like, yeah.

20:53.700 --> 20:54.780
 Well, let's walk back.

20:54.780 --> 20:57.580
 Cause I think I originally brought it up

20:57.580 --> 21:01.500
 in terms of how prepared were you against Jake Paul

21:01.500 --> 21:03.500
 versus Jordan Burrows.

21:03.500 --> 21:07.340
 So did you prepare for Jake, cardio wise?

21:07.340 --> 21:08.820
 Yeah, I worked hard.

21:08.820 --> 21:09.660
 Yeah, I did.

21:09.660 --> 21:13.340
 But it was, I told you, I started training for my,

21:13.340 --> 21:15.740
 I mean, once I had my hip surgery,

21:15.740 --> 21:17.980
 they said, you know, for the first six weeks,

21:17.980 --> 21:19.620
 you can't even walk.

21:19.620 --> 21:20.860
 And it was hard for me to listen to them

21:20.860 --> 21:23.540
 cause by week four and a half, five,

21:23.540 --> 21:24.380
 I was feeling pretty good.

21:24.380 --> 21:25.260
 I want to get rid of my crutches.

21:25.260 --> 21:26.500
 But I'm like, you know what?

21:26.500 --> 21:28.460
 This is for the rest of my life.

21:28.460 --> 21:29.300
 And if you get the,

21:29.300 --> 21:31.180
 so if you get the real hip replacement,

21:31.180 --> 21:33.180
 there's no wrestling, there's no nothing, right?

21:33.180 --> 21:34.180
 So that's the next step.

21:34.180 --> 21:35.020
 So, okay.

21:35.020 --> 21:35.900
 I'm going to take this serious.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.540
 So I do my crutches for six weeks.

21:37.540 --> 21:41.740
 The next six weeks, it's still like really low weight bearing.

21:41.740 --> 21:43.260
 Can't necessarily do anything, you know?

21:43.260 --> 21:45.380
 So then I get done with the three months,

21:45.380 --> 21:48.020
 which is like January and I'm like, okay,

21:48.020 --> 21:49.020
 I should start working out.

21:49.020 --> 21:51.700
 So I started riding a bike a little bit and then, okay,

21:51.700 --> 21:52.660
 I'm now I'm fat.

21:52.660 --> 21:53.500
 I'm fucking fat.

21:53.500 --> 21:54.340
 I'm going to get in better shape

21:54.340 --> 21:55.180
 cause I haven't been able to do anything.

21:55.180 --> 21:56.940
 So I'm actually start working out.

21:56.940 --> 21:59.420
 And, and then that happened, right?

21:59.420 --> 22:01.380
 So I'm like, okay, well now I got three months

22:01.380 --> 22:03.980
 and it gives me a good reason to get back in shape.

22:03.980 --> 22:08.820
 And, you know, I knew I wasn't going to be a full time boxer.

22:08.820 --> 22:11.420
 So it's like, how do I put a boxing camp together?

22:11.420 --> 22:14.420
 So I found, you know, I had my old teammate, Mike Rhodes.

22:14.420 --> 22:18.220
 He came up and kind of lived with me ish kind of thing

22:18.220 --> 22:19.940
 for three months.

22:19.940 --> 22:23.100
 I found a couple of his guy canine out of Michigan.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.580
 He came over three weeks.

22:24.580 --> 22:25.540
 He was great.

22:25.540 --> 22:26.980
 I went to Freddie Roach for a week.

22:26.980 --> 22:28.860
 So I kind of like, you know,

22:28.860 --> 22:31.020
 try to get as many good as ideas as I could.

22:31.020 --> 22:34.220
 And my thought was like, okay, well if this dude sucks,

22:34.220 --> 22:36.620
 I can just be tough and, you know, block a few punches,

22:36.620 --> 22:38.260
 get him tired and then beat him up.

22:38.260 --> 22:40.740
 If he's good, that's probably not much of my do about

22:40.740 --> 22:41.580
 in the next three months.

22:41.580 --> 22:44.220
 Cause I'm, I was never good at boxing in the first place.

22:44.220 --> 22:47.460
 All of my standup in mixed martial arts was predicated on

22:47.460 --> 22:49.340
 how do I get through the two or three punches

22:49.340 --> 22:51.020
 that are gonna come at me in the time I need

22:51.020 --> 22:52.380
 to get a hold of them.

22:52.380 --> 22:54.180
 You know, it's all, you only have to make two

22:54.180 --> 22:55.020
 or three of them miss.

22:55.020 --> 22:57.780
 And then boom, you're on top of them, at least for me.

22:57.780 --> 22:59.380
 That was all my striking was predicated on.

22:59.380 --> 23:01.540
 It wasn't about, hey, I'm gonna do damage on the feet

23:01.540 --> 23:02.660
 in order to make something else happen.

23:02.660 --> 23:05.660
 It was like, how do I clear this barrier,

23:05.660 --> 23:06.660
 get a hold of you.

23:06.660 --> 23:08.500
 And if you, I actually did the math one time.

23:08.500 --> 23:09.820
 I think I got a takedown.

23:10.860 --> 23:14.140
 If you include the knockout round against Masvidal,

23:14.140 --> 23:16.140
 I got a takedown in every round except two.

23:16.140 --> 23:18.780
 So it was like, it was like 53 out of 55 rounds in MMA,

23:18.780 --> 23:19.900
 I got a takedown.

23:19.900 --> 23:20.740
 Wow.

23:20.740 --> 23:21.580
 Somewhere, somewhere in there.

23:21.580 --> 23:24.340
 Okay, so you're hunting the takedown once you, once.

23:24.340 --> 23:25.180
 Right away.

23:25.180 --> 23:29.340
 Once you get your hands on them, you get the takedown.

23:29.340 --> 23:30.460
 Okay.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.940
 But the incredible thing about you,

23:32.940 --> 23:36.460
 I just recently talked, spent a couple of days

23:36.460 --> 23:37.940
 with Jimmy Pedro.

23:37.940 --> 23:42.940
 And he talked about his guys and just champions in general

23:43.220 --> 23:46.580
 hating to lose more than they love winning.

23:46.580 --> 23:49.060
 And the way you talked about losing,

23:49.060 --> 23:51.180
 you lost very few times in your career,

23:51.180 --> 23:56.180
 like later you were dominating both wrestling and MMA.

23:56.460 --> 23:58.780
 But the way you took these losses against people

23:58.780 --> 24:03.100
 that are, I don't know, below elite level.

24:03.100 --> 24:03.940
 It's fair.

24:03.940 --> 24:07.940
 I was gonna get pissy, but it's completely fair.

24:07.940 --> 24:09.140
 I thought he was a bum too.

24:09.140 --> 24:10.380
 No, that's not what I meant.

24:10.380 --> 24:11.500
 I was in trouble.

24:11.500 --> 24:12.740
 It's okay, no, it's good.

24:12.740 --> 24:15.100
 No, no, no, but like what,

24:15.100 --> 24:17.140
 can you explain the psychology behind that?

24:17.140 --> 24:21.140
 Like what, is there a system behind this?

24:21.140 --> 24:22.660
 Is there a philosophy behind this?

24:22.660 --> 24:26.260
 Well, I wasn't very good in the beginning.

24:26.260 --> 24:27.860
 I think that's where it all starts from.

24:27.860 --> 24:31.020
 So I didn't start getting good until the age of like 13.

24:31.020 --> 24:32.460
 I started at five.

24:32.460 --> 24:35.660
 I probably started competing more at age 10, 11.

24:35.660 --> 24:37.220
 Didn't really get good until 13.

24:37.220 --> 24:38.260
 It's still at 13.

24:38.260 --> 24:40.180
 I'm starting to get great.

24:40.180 --> 24:41.380
 I'm getting better, right?

24:41.380 --> 24:42.900
 I'm pretty good.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.180
 So I actually have,

24:44.180 --> 24:46.220
 I have written this book on sports psych,

24:46.220 --> 24:49.900
 but I got someone to write it for me kind of thing.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.540
 Cause I've had this philosophy for years

24:51.540 --> 24:54.260
 that there has to be this balance between two things, right?

24:54.260 --> 24:56.580
 So on the one hand, in this category,

24:56.580 --> 24:59.140
 on the one hand you have hating to lose.

24:59.140 --> 25:02.100
 A great champion has to hate to lose, like you said, right?

25:02.100 --> 25:03.020
 But on this other hand,

25:03.020 --> 25:07.940
 you have to have someone who seeks out challenges, right?

25:07.940 --> 25:08.860
 Cause if you don't have that,

25:08.860 --> 25:10.540
 you're never gonna reach your full potential either.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.940
 And so you have to balance these two balls

25:12.940 --> 25:14.460
 at the same time, right?

25:14.460 --> 25:16.780
 And so like for me, I always,

25:16.780 --> 25:18.340
 and this is maybe cause I wasn't good,

25:18.340 --> 25:19.380
 but I was always like,

25:19.380 --> 25:21.540
 let me go find the best people to wrestle all the time.

25:21.540 --> 25:24.140
 Let me go find, I would like literally,

25:24.140 --> 25:24.980
 like seventh, eighth grade

25:24.980 --> 25:26.300
 when I was starting to get better,

25:26.300 --> 25:28.020
 it was like, and there's no internet.

25:28.020 --> 25:30.060
 Well, there's no one was using the internet.

25:30.060 --> 25:31.180
 It was like a wrestling magazine.

25:31.180 --> 25:32.980
 And like, hey dad, there's a tournament here.

25:32.980 --> 25:34.260
 I think that, are the kids gonna be there?

25:34.260 --> 25:37.740
 Can you take me two hours across the state today, please?

25:37.740 --> 25:40.460
 You would wrestle like in competition against them.

25:40.460 --> 25:41.300
 In competition.

25:41.300 --> 25:42.140
 Yeah, yeah, in competition.

25:42.140 --> 25:43.540
 Hey, I heard there's this tournament.

25:43.540 --> 25:45.620
 Here's the magazine, this is this tournament.

25:45.620 --> 25:47.020
 Hey dad, will you take me over there tomorrow?

25:47.020 --> 25:48.620
 You weren't trying to win.

25:48.620 --> 25:50.260
 You were trying to get the experience.

25:50.260 --> 25:51.820
 I was trying to wrestle the best guys.

25:51.820 --> 25:52.980
 Maybe I win, maybe I lose.

25:52.980 --> 25:54.700
 There's no, when you do a competition,

25:54.700 --> 25:57.180
 there's no guarantee of a winner or a loss.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.780
 You're just doing competition, right?

25:58.780 --> 25:59.860
 So I wanted to go,

25:59.860 --> 26:02.660
 I wanted to challenge myself against the best guys

26:02.660 --> 26:05.100
 of which I thought maybe I could come out on top, right?

26:05.100 --> 26:07.860
 So like eighth grade year, I won way way,

26:07.860 --> 26:09.900
 I probably lost a handful of times

26:09.900 --> 26:11.300
 in the state of Wisconsin.

26:11.300 --> 26:12.460
 It was probably really, really minimal

26:12.460 --> 26:13.940
 the amount of times I lost, you know?

26:13.940 --> 26:15.540
 But it was just about getting the challenge.

26:15.540 --> 26:19.220
 And it's like, some kids, and not kids in my club,

26:19.220 --> 26:20.580
 because I'll push them very hard on this,

26:20.580 --> 26:22.780
 are scared of challenging themselves.

26:22.780 --> 26:25.340
 They like being the big fish in the small pond.

26:25.340 --> 26:26.580
 They're not willing to go say,

26:26.580 --> 26:29.060
 I want to go get that guy, and I want to get that guy,

26:29.060 --> 26:30.140
 and I want to get that guy.

26:30.140 --> 26:32.980
 And so that's like, so I think that's part of it for me

26:32.980 --> 26:34.540
 is like, I always just loved to challenge.

26:34.540 --> 26:36.940
 I enjoyed competing thoroughly, right?

26:36.940 --> 26:38.620
 And I understood from a young age,

26:38.620 --> 26:40.540
 because it wasn't a good, losing is a part of it.

26:40.540 --> 26:41.860
 You're not always going to win.

26:41.860 --> 26:43.020
 And that was kind of it.

26:43.020 --> 26:44.780
 It's like, hey, sometimes, you know,

26:44.780 --> 26:49.300
 and for my MMA career, I never planned it to go that way,

26:49.300 --> 26:51.180
 but yeah, I didn't lose for nine years.

26:51.180 --> 26:52.620
 And like, that's pretty rare.

26:52.620 --> 26:54.340
 I didn't plan for that to happen.

26:54.340 --> 26:55.660
 That was just what happened, you know?

26:55.660 --> 26:58.540
 Okay, but you also didn't lose

26:58.540 --> 27:00.660
 like the second part of your college career.

27:00.660 --> 27:03.340
 My 87, I lost, I won my last 87 matches.

27:03.340 --> 27:04.980
 Yeah.

27:04.980 --> 27:08.180
 So that didn't come along with the hatred of losing?

27:08.180 --> 27:09.020
 You just.

27:09.020 --> 27:10.580
 I don't like losing, I still don't like it.

27:10.580 --> 27:11.420
 Yeah.

27:11.420 --> 27:15.180
 But you seem to, okay, but you don't,

27:15.180 --> 27:17.500
 you don't seem, you seem to kind of shrug it off

27:17.500 --> 27:18.340
 a little bit.

27:18.340 --> 27:20.700
 Okay, so like with, specifically with these two instances

27:20.700 --> 27:21.540
 that you bring up.

27:21.540 --> 27:25.500
 With the Masvidal, it feels definitely, so, okay.

27:25.500 --> 27:26.340
 All right, let's.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.180
 Let's go, let's go deep, let's go deep.

27:27.180 --> 27:28.020
 All right.

27:28.020 --> 27:29.140
 So the Masvidal one, it feels different,

27:29.140 --> 27:30.660
 because I had.

27:30.660 --> 27:31.780
 So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.380
 Let's, for people who don't know.

27:33.380 --> 27:34.220
 Okay.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.340
 Masvidal loss was your first loss.

27:36.340 --> 27:37.180
 First loss.

27:37.180 --> 27:38.020
 In MMA.

27:38.020 --> 27:38.840
 Yes.

27:38.840 --> 27:39.680
 Yeah.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.540
 I mean, it was a dramatic loss.

27:41.540 --> 27:42.380
 Very dramatic.

27:42.380 --> 27:45.580
 And there was this kind of buildup as you were potentially

27:45.580 --> 27:49.840
 one of the greats of all time coming into this fight.

27:50.900 --> 27:53.780
 And so, this pressure, all of that.

27:53.780 --> 27:56.220
 So the, no, I mean, I was thoroughly enjoying it.

27:56.220 --> 27:58.220
 I didn't feel the pressure.

27:58.220 --> 28:03.060
 So the Masvidal fight is, he got one fucking move on me.

28:03.060 --> 28:04.460
 It's not like he beat me.

28:04.460 --> 28:06.440
 And if we do that again, I think I win.

28:06.440 --> 28:09.980
 At that point in my life, for sure, I think I win

28:09.980 --> 28:12.300
 way, way, way more times than I lose.

28:12.300 --> 28:13.300
 He knew that too.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.540
 That's why he didn't want to sound the bout agreement.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.100
 That's why I had to taunt him and why he got so mad,

28:17.100 --> 28:18.220
 because I had to continue to taunt him

28:18.220 --> 28:21.140
 in order to get him to sign, right?

28:21.140 --> 28:23.740
 So that one hurt because, as people don't know,

28:23.740 --> 28:24.980
 my MMA career, I'll just go through it fast.

28:24.980 --> 28:27.460
 I did three fights in like smaller leagues.

28:27.460 --> 28:28.580
 I got signed by Bellator.

28:28.580 --> 28:30.540
 I was undefeated for three and a half years.

28:30.540 --> 28:31.500
 I was nine and oh.

28:31.500 --> 28:36.500
 When I got done with that in 2012, 2013,

28:37.960 --> 28:39.520
 I, at that point in my head,

28:39.520 --> 28:41.360
 I was just going to transition to the UFC

28:41.360 --> 28:42.360
 because that's where you go.

28:42.360 --> 28:44.160
 I was ranked like sixth in the world.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.520
 I hadn't really had a competitive match

28:46.520 --> 28:48.560
 at the end of the Bellator thing.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.600
 And Dana White, for a reason still unknown to me,

28:51.600 --> 28:52.800
 we still haven't had this conversation.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.600
 I wish I could ask him, I should ask him sometime,

28:55.600 --> 28:58.520
 chose to refuse me any entry into the UFC.

28:58.520 --> 29:01.480
 He just said, I went to his office

29:01.480 --> 29:03.760
 and he literally said, we're not interested.

29:03.760 --> 29:05.400
 We're not going to make you an offer.

29:05.400 --> 29:08.360
 Did you, did you mention something too about him,

29:08.360 --> 29:09.200
 about the UFC?

29:09.200 --> 29:10.560
 That was a year before that.

29:10.560 --> 29:11.400
 That was a year before.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.920
 And that might play a role in it, I think.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.560
 So yes, what happened the year before that

29:16.560 --> 29:19.400
 was I called him a liar, which,

29:19.400 --> 29:20.480
 but listen, I'm writing this one

29:20.480 --> 29:22.960
 because he said you can't test for drugs

29:22.960 --> 29:26.020
 because I'm all natural, which you can tell by my physique.

29:26.020 --> 29:28.900
 And I was always put off by the fact

29:28.900 --> 29:30.620
 that so many people cheated.

29:30.620 --> 29:32.940
 And I was very vocal about that.

29:32.940 --> 29:35.020
 And so he had made some statement like,

29:35.020 --> 29:36.100
 oh, well, there's no way you could test.

29:36.100 --> 29:36.940
 I said, bullshit.

29:36.940 --> 29:39.360
 You, very specifically, I said USADA does it

29:39.360 --> 29:42.900
 for all other sports worldwide, you can do it.

29:42.900 --> 29:43.740
 And then it was funny

29:43.740 --> 29:45.340
 because I hired USADA a couple of years later.

29:45.340 --> 29:46.820
 So I think he took some offense to that,

29:46.820 --> 29:49.740
 but that was like a year and almost a year and a half,

29:49.740 --> 29:52.140
 I think, somewhere, years later.

29:52.140 --> 29:53.740
 It's not like he holds a grudge or anything.

29:53.740 --> 29:58.420
 Yeah, so I literally go to Vegas.

30:00.220 --> 30:01.060
 It's a long story.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.380
 You can read about it other places.

30:02.380 --> 30:03.660
 So I got released from a belt.

30:03.660 --> 30:04.980
 It's not like this is a negotiation.

30:04.980 --> 30:06.420
 I got released from my belt or contract.

30:06.420 --> 30:07.280
 I said, I'm out of here.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.380
 I'm going to go to the UFC.

30:09.380 --> 30:12.700
 I go to Vegas, and then I was told,

30:12.700 --> 30:14.340
 hey, there's no offer for you.

30:14.340 --> 30:15.760
 Tough shit, you know?

30:15.760 --> 30:19.420
 So then I ended up signing with one championship.

30:19.420 --> 30:21.700
 I spent, what, three and a half years there.

30:21.700 --> 30:23.020
 I won the belt in my second fight

30:23.020 --> 30:24.940
 and retained the title the entire time.

30:25.980 --> 30:26.820
 And then I just, I think.

30:26.820 --> 30:27.940
 Again, dominating people.

30:27.940 --> 30:29.820
 Yeah, I didn't have a competitive fight.

30:29.820 --> 30:32.420
 And so I retired 18 and 0.

30:32.420 --> 30:34.700
 Never, never, and for someone who loves a challenge,

30:34.700 --> 30:36.260
 never getting to really challenge myself

30:36.260 --> 30:37.940
 was incredibly frustrating.

30:37.940 --> 30:39.340
 And I left the door open.

30:39.340 --> 30:40.900
 I said, if I ever get the chance

30:40.900 --> 30:41.740
 to prove I'm the best in the world,

30:41.740 --> 30:42.900
 I'd love to come back.

30:42.900 --> 30:45.980
 So somehow, a year later, I get traded.

30:45.980 --> 30:46.900
 Trades have never happened,

30:46.900 --> 30:49.580
 and this is the one and only trade ever.

30:49.580 --> 30:50.840
 I've been retired for a year.

30:50.840 --> 30:51.860
 I got traded.

30:51.860 --> 30:52.700
 I get to come back.

30:52.700 --> 30:54.540
 I fight Robbie Lawler, the first fight.

30:54.540 --> 30:55.500
 I win.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.620
 And then essentially, they're saying,

30:56.620 --> 30:59.740
 okay, if you fight, if you beat George,

30:59.740 --> 31:01.700
 you're gonna get the title shot against Marty.

31:01.700 --> 31:05.780
 And it's like, this is what I've been working for

31:05.780 --> 31:06.740
 the entire, I've been trying to prove

31:06.740 --> 31:07.620
 I was the best fighter in the world

31:07.620 --> 31:08.460
 for the last 10 years,

31:08.460 --> 31:10.980
 and I've not been afforded this opportunity.

31:12.420 --> 31:14.320
 So when I lost to George, that was hard,

31:14.320 --> 31:18.260
 because it was something that I had waited for

31:18.260 --> 31:20.160
 for a really, really long time.

31:20.160 --> 31:22.220
 It was something that I thought I could compete for,

31:22.220 --> 31:23.260
 but I never got the opportunity to do,

31:23.260 --> 31:24.300
 so that one was hard.

31:25.260 --> 31:27.780
 At the same time, from just the competitive logistically,

31:27.780 --> 31:29.260
 it's like, he got me with one move.

31:29.260 --> 31:31.100
 It wasn't like he beat my ass for 15 minutes,

31:31.100 --> 31:33.420
 and I got beat a bunch of different ways.

31:33.420 --> 31:36.420
 So that was like, fuck, if I get it again,

31:36.420 --> 31:37.240
 I could have done it,

31:37.240 --> 31:38.740
 but they're not gonna let me have it again.

31:38.740 --> 31:40.020
 It's not like wrestling where you could go

31:40.020 --> 31:42.420
 the next year or the next week or whatever.

31:42.420 --> 31:43.260
 You lose at Big Ten,

31:43.260 --> 31:45.000
 you go to nationals two weeks later.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.540
 Does that loss change you in any way, your psychology?

31:48.540 --> 31:50.060
 I don't think so.

31:50.060 --> 31:51.540
 It's the first loss.

31:51.540 --> 31:56.340
 I mean, had I had a longer MMA career post that,

31:56.340 --> 31:58.900
 there definitely would have been a lot of time spent

31:58.900 --> 32:01.940
 getting better at the entry point to the takedown, right?

32:01.940 --> 32:03.900
 Which I already spent time there,

32:03.900 --> 32:06.840
 and I hate making excuses, but yeah, the hip,

32:06.840 --> 32:09.260
 the hinging of my hip, what I couldn't do,

32:09.260 --> 32:11.400
 was preventing me from doing some things,

32:11.400 --> 32:12.940
 and it's why, if you look at the fight,

32:12.940 --> 32:15.480
 I'm bent over as I go for the double leg.

32:15.480 --> 32:16.320
 Yeah, so.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.260
 So what happened for people who don't know,

32:17.260 --> 32:19.500
 you went in for a double leg, and he went.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.340
 Flying knee.

32:20.340 --> 32:22.900
 He did a flying knee, and it caught you well.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.580
 Specifically the way he did that knee

32:24.580 --> 32:25.900
 was kind of different than the way

32:25.900 --> 32:28.360
 anyone had thrown flying knees before.

32:28.360 --> 32:31.080
 Most people go more just from a stand straight vertical,

32:31.080 --> 32:33.180
 whereas he took a few like running steps

32:33.180 --> 32:34.340
 and went more, you know,

32:34.340 --> 32:37.620
 the trajectory of the angle was different.

32:37.620 --> 32:39.740
 So I think that's kind of probably why it caught,

32:39.740 --> 32:42.420
 you know, I think a lot of things in combat,

32:42.420 --> 32:43.260
 well, probably everything,

32:43.260 --> 32:44.820
 but I focus specifically on combat,

32:44.820 --> 32:45.880
 happen subconsciously.

32:45.880 --> 32:48.620
 Like our brain is reading what's coming at us,

32:48.620 --> 32:50.940
 and lots of times it's stuff we've seen before

32:50.940 --> 32:53.140
 so we can judge how to move correctly.

32:53.140 --> 32:54.740
 And you misread because it's something

32:54.740 --> 32:55.620
 you haven't seen before.

32:55.620 --> 32:58.360
 Had not seen him come at that specific angle, yeah.

32:58.360 --> 32:59.860
 So that loss was really hard.

32:59.860 --> 33:02.140
 With the Burroughs one, I told you,

33:02.140 --> 33:03.240
 I knew I was gonna lose.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.340
 So it was like, whatever, you know?

33:05.340 --> 33:07.800
 I'm taking this because I want to put

33:07.800 --> 33:09.580
 the sport of wrestling out there in a big way.

33:09.580 --> 33:10.980
 I wanna help them raise a lot of money.

33:10.980 --> 33:12.660
 We sold at Madison Square Garden,

33:12.660 --> 33:14.460
 Hulu Theater, and we raised a whole bunch of money.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.260
 So my goals were accomplished.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.180
 Jake Paul fight, I took it because

33:18.180 --> 33:19.020
 they paid me a whole bunch of money,

33:19.020 --> 33:20.020
 and I thought it was gonna be fun.

33:20.020 --> 33:21.940
 Did I have any illusion I was a great boxer?

33:21.940 --> 33:23.720
 No illusions whatsoever.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.180
 Would I have preferred to win?

33:25.180 --> 33:27.800
 Absolutely, but like I told everyone,

33:27.800 --> 33:29.300
 whether I win or lose on Saturday night,

33:29.300 --> 33:31.180
 I'm gonna be back coaching wrestling on Monday,

33:31.180 --> 33:32.380
 because that's what I enjoy doing,

33:32.380 --> 33:34.300
 and I was back coaching wrestling on Monday.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.900
 And once I'm out, these middle school kids

33:35.900 --> 33:38.060
 give me a little bit of shit about it.

33:38.060 --> 33:38.900
 That's it.

33:38.900 --> 33:41.920
 But where were you in terms of your shape

33:41.920 --> 33:44.940
 and how you felt in the Mazodal fight?

33:44.940 --> 33:46.400
 Would you say you're on the,

33:46.400 --> 33:48.300
 I mean, it's a difficult question to ask

33:48.300 --> 33:51.460
 of a world class athlete, but like,

33:51.460 --> 33:54.540
 were you past peak?

33:54.540 --> 33:58.020
 Oh yeah, I don't know why guys like to lie about that.

33:58.020 --> 34:00.460
 I mean, the peak for me was really evidently

34:00.460 --> 34:04.660
 in my late 20s, and maybe they are all fueled

34:04.660 --> 34:07.420
 by extra supplements, I don't know.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.100
 But for me, that was evident.

34:09.100 --> 34:11.580
 But you get this, so you get this crosshair

34:11.580 --> 34:16.020
 where if you're smart, like I mentioned John Burrows was,

34:16.020 --> 34:18.180
 you're still gaining wisdom, you're gaining strategy,

34:18.180 --> 34:19.820
 you're gaining a lot of things, right?

34:19.820 --> 34:22.140
 And so while your physicality may go down,

34:22.140 --> 34:24.540
 your overall skill level still may be rising,

34:24.540 --> 34:28.060
 especially in MMA because people usually start later

34:28.060 --> 34:29.860
 because they're gaining wisdom, strategy,

34:29.860 --> 34:32.060
 all of the, maybe more tools in their toolbox, right?

34:32.060 --> 34:32.980
 They're getting all these things.

34:32.980 --> 34:35.420
 So their actual competitive peak,

34:35.420 --> 34:37.080
 despite their athletic peak going down,

34:37.080 --> 34:39.820
 might still be a few years past that, right?

34:39.820 --> 34:41.740
 Because these things are crossing.

34:41.740 --> 34:43.360
 No, so I felt I was great.

34:43.360 --> 34:46.260
 Obviously the hip was an issue.

34:46.260 --> 34:51.260
 It's funny because I knew I had a lot of pain here,

34:51.460 --> 34:53.060
 and I knew it was because of this.

34:53.060 --> 34:54.220
 And it was like, okay, whenever I'm done,

34:54.220 --> 34:56.560
 I'll just get it taken care of, whatever.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.660
 But every time I train, I have pain kind of like

34:58.660 --> 35:02.220
 all up my back, and the day after the surgery,

35:02.220 --> 35:05.340
 I woke up and there was no pain on the right side of my,

35:05.340 --> 35:06.460
 the surgery was on the left side.

35:06.460 --> 35:07.740
 There was no pain on the right side of my back.

35:07.740 --> 35:08.980
 I'm like, that's fucking weird.

35:08.980 --> 35:10.260
 Like every morning I wake up,

35:10.260 --> 35:12.100
 there's a lot of pain there, you know?

35:12.100 --> 35:14.460
 I'm like, okay, well I'm on pain pills.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.140
 Maybe it'll come back tomorrow.

35:16.140 --> 35:19.160
 And that's because I'd never been back since my hip surgery.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.220
 So it was weird, because it was like this,

35:21.220 --> 35:23.120
 I thought this was affecting this,

35:23.120 --> 35:26.460
 but it was affecting all the way across my whole back.

35:26.460 --> 35:28.700
 So if I get to get a new hip, honestly,

35:28.700 --> 35:31.460
 if I, I don't know if this is gonna change

35:31.460 --> 35:33.660
 the competitive outcome whatsoever.

35:33.660 --> 35:36.620
 If I had known how good the hip replacement was gonna be,

35:36.620 --> 35:38.560
 I would have done it the second I retired

35:38.560 --> 35:41.520
 from one championship in November of 2017.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.780
 I would have had my hip surgery scheduled for December 1.

35:44.780 --> 35:46.300
 Just from a lifestyle standpoint,

35:46.300 --> 35:48.420
 I could only sleep in one position.

35:48.420 --> 35:49.620
 There was a lot of things I couldn't do.

35:49.620 --> 35:51.260
 I was in a lot of pain.

35:51.260 --> 35:52.740
 So I would have done that a lot earlier.

35:52.740 --> 35:55.780
 But no, from an athletic point, I was ready.

35:55.780 --> 35:57.340
 This shit goes wrong sometimes.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.440
 I don't know how to ask this, but you know,

36:00.440 --> 36:05.440
 Joe Rogan, me, had a sense about you similar to like Fedor,

36:08.180 --> 36:11.100
 that you are potentially one of the greatest ever.

36:11.100 --> 36:12.140
 Yeah.

36:12.140 --> 36:15.500
 Does it hurt that you're not in the discussion now

36:15.500 --> 36:19.500
 of being in the top 10 of all time?

36:19.500 --> 36:20.660
 I didn't prove it.

36:20.660 --> 36:21.980
 I don't deserve it.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.540
 Biera, I mean.

36:23.540 --> 36:24.600
 But I didn't prove it.

36:24.600 --> 36:29.100
 I mean, and so it's like, had I somehow gotten

36:29.100 --> 36:32.140
 to convince Dana White, we go and convince him in 2013

36:32.140 --> 36:35.060
 to make me an offer, and I didn't even need a good offer.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.160
 I just needed any offer.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.780
 Had I gotten the offer then,

36:37.780 --> 36:39.780
 maybe the outcome's different, right?

36:39.780 --> 36:42.020
 But given, I would never expect anyone

36:42.020 --> 36:43.180
 to think of me that way.

36:43.180 --> 36:44.060
 I didn't prove it.

36:44.060 --> 36:47.420
 I know what I was, and I'm good with that.

36:47.420 --> 36:49.140
 And yeah, other people never got to see that.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.980
 Do you think, well, you can't know fully, right?

36:51.980 --> 36:55.780
 Do you think if you went to the UFC at that time

36:55.780 --> 36:56.860
 instead of one championship?

36:56.860 --> 36:59.200
 I think I would have had a lot of success.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.040
 Yeah, I mean, there's obviously certain guys,

37:01.040 --> 37:02.340
 there's a lot of guys I've trained with

37:02.340 --> 37:05.580
 that I had a lot of really good results against.

37:05.580 --> 37:10.580
 And obviously, Tyron was a champion for a long time there.

37:12.220 --> 37:13.820
 So I was around, Tyron was a champion,

37:13.820 --> 37:15.140
 Anthony was a champion at lightweight.

37:15.140 --> 37:17.300
 I was, you know, same gym as him,

37:17.300 --> 37:19.300
 and we had a lot of people coming through.

37:19.300 --> 37:20.140
 Yeah, I.

37:20.140 --> 37:21.700
 Would you face Tyron?

37:21.700 --> 37:22.520
 Would I have fought him?

37:22.520 --> 37:23.500
 I don't think so.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.300
 I mean, so he was still the champion when I came into the UFC

37:26.300 --> 37:29.180
 and we said, no, we're not gonna fight.

37:29.180 --> 37:30.660
 All right.

37:30.660 --> 37:32.520
 Hey, so he can't change history, right?

37:32.520 --> 37:33.460
 So once something happens,

37:33.460 --> 37:35.060
 you gotta accept for what it is.

37:35.060 --> 37:38.300
 And move forward and obviously hope you can continue

37:38.300 --> 37:39.700
 to keep accomplishing great things,

37:39.700 --> 37:42.380
 which for me, obviously my athletic career is over.

37:42.380 --> 37:45.380
 So now it's gonna be through my wrestling academies

37:45.380 --> 37:48.140
 and you know, who knows what else I get into.

37:48.140 --> 37:51.300
 You might do exhibition matches

37:51.300 --> 37:52.620
 and all that kind of stuff, right?

37:52.620 --> 37:53.460
 Says who?

37:53.460 --> 37:55.540
 Wrestling and stuff, no?

37:55.540 --> 37:56.420
 I don't think so.

37:56.420 --> 37:59.540
 So here's my thing with the wrestling matches is like,

37:59.540 --> 38:01.740
 just for fun, if you said, hey Ben, just for fun.

38:01.740 --> 38:02.580
 Yeah.

38:02.580 --> 38:03.560
 Would you love to go wrestle someone?

38:03.560 --> 38:05.580
 Yeah, I would, I would, right?

38:05.580 --> 38:07.700
 I love wrestling, I get in there.

38:07.700 --> 38:09.000
 I love, you know, I love like,

38:09.000 --> 38:11.420
 so one of my guys has gotten to be pretty good.

38:11.420 --> 38:12.940
 He's in college, he got in Keegan O'Toole.

38:12.940 --> 38:16.140
 He just won a junior world title this year.

38:16.140 --> 38:19.220
 And so when I'm doing private lessons,

38:19.220 --> 38:21.060
 I have such think about the development of the athletes.

38:21.060 --> 38:22.740
 Sometimes I can wrestle hard, but most of the time

38:22.740 --> 38:24.700
 it's like, I'm just gonna help them

38:24.700 --> 38:25.840
 with whatever they need help with.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.520
 And it's still wrestling and it's fun, but it's helping them.

38:28.520 --> 38:30.260
 You know, for like, Keegan comes back this summer

38:30.260 --> 38:31.340
 and he's training for the junior world title.

38:31.340 --> 38:33.660
 So to be able to just shake hands sometimes and say like,

38:33.660 --> 38:35.300
 I'm gonna try to kick your ass.

38:35.300 --> 38:36.320
 Should you try to kick my ass?

38:36.320 --> 38:37.640
 You know, like just to go, like.

38:37.640 --> 38:38.480
 Yeah, it's a good feeling.

38:38.480 --> 38:39.520
 It's so much fun.

38:39.520 --> 38:40.780
 And I don't get to do that very much.

38:40.780 --> 38:42.660
 So if you said, Ben, would you love to do some matches?

38:42.660 --> 38:44.300
 And the answer is yeah.

38:44.300 --> 38:46.520
 The problem, unfortunately for me,

38:46.520 --> 38:48.540
 and maybe you could talk me off a ledge here,

38:48.540 --> 38:50.740
 is like, because of where I've gotten to in my career,

38:50.740 --> 38:52.220
 if I choose to do a wrestling match,

38:52.220 --> 38:53.780
 it's gonna, people are gonna be really excited about it.

38:53.780 --> 38:56.020
 It's gonna blow up and it's just like,

38:56.020 --> 38:57.380
 I just want to wrestle just to wrestle.

38:57.380 --> 38:59.140
 I'd rather just like go in a room

38:59.140 --> 39:00.580
 where no one can watch and just wrestle.

39:00.580 --> 39:01.980
 I just enjoy it.

39:01.980 --> 39:03.540
 Well, you could also wrestle.

39:03.540 --> 39:05.380
 So there's different kinds of wrestling.

39:05.380 --> 39:07.900
 There's wrestling where there's an event

39:07.900 --> 39:11.540
 and like, you know, there's a buildup and then an announcement.

39:11.540 --> 39:14.580
 And you can also do like a Khabib style,

39:14.580 --> 39:16.940
 like in the room, there's cameras

39:16.940 --> 39:18.860
 and you're kind of going, it's like the.

39:18.860 --> 39:20.240
 Wait, Khabib does that?

39:20.240 --> 39:21.660
 No, in.

39:21.660 --> 39:22.480
 Marcelo does that.

39:22.480 --> 39:23.320
 He whooped my ass a few times.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.180
 Yeah, exactly.

39:24.180 --> 39:26.340
 I mean, I've seen Khabib in some videos.

39:26.340 --> 39:28.780
 It's not like set up, it's just people going hard

39:28.780 --> 39:30.380
 and then it's more fun.

39:30.380 --> 39:31.220
 Yeah.

39:31.220 --> 39:34.380
 You know, and it's also more like

39:35.380 --> 39:38.380
 presenting the beauty of the sport, you know?

39:38.380 --> 39:39.220
 For sure.

39:39.220 --> 39:41.780
 And like, and there's no winning or losing really

39:41.780 --> 39:42.940
 in that context.

39:42.940 --> 39:43.780
 Yeah, yeah.

39:43.780 --> 39:45.940
 Like you're just, you're always joking around a little bit,

39:45.940 --> 39:47.140
 even when you're going super hard.

39:47.140 --> 39:49.340
 So I feel like, especially in the modern day

39:49.340 --> 39:52.420
 with the internet, that's a compelling way to do.

39:52.420 --> 39:53.660
 So I've thought about,

39:53.660 --> 39:55.820
 this is the one thing I've thought about doing.

39:55.820 --> 39:58.940
 Cause I told you about my buddy was the content thing.

39:58.940 --> 40:00.340
 It's called Rockfin.

40:00.340 --> 40:01.180
 Thought about doing, you know,

40:01.180 --> 40:03.140
 the old really famous Gracie challenge.

40:03.140 --> 40:03.980
 Yeah.

40:03.980 --> 40:05.220
 Okay, so I've thought about doing the aspirin challenge.

40:05.220 --> 40:06.140
 You wanna hear my rule set?

40:06.140 --> 40:06.980
 Yeah, let's go.

40:06.980 --> 40:07.980
 I'm not sure I'm gonna do this.

40:07.980 --> 40:10.740
 People are gonna show up to your, like in Wisconsin.

40:10.740 --> 40:11.660
 I have to select you.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.220
 I'll start with a thousand bucks, right?

40:13.220 --> 40:14.060
 Right.

40:14.060 --> 40:14.980
 Okay, 30 minutes.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.460
 You pin me or I pin you.

40:16.460 --> 40:17.300
 That's it.

40:17.300 --> 40:18.220
 No points, no nothing.

40:18.220 --> 40:19.180
 We just wrestle.

40:19.180 --> 40:20.500
 Camera, that's it, right?

40:20.500 --> 40:21.340
 It's camera in the room.

40:21.340 --> 40:22.460
 Maybe there's a referee

40:22.460 --> 40:24.380
 cause we don't want there to be contention over the pin.

40:24.380 --> 40:25.220
 So.

40:25.220 --> 40:26.040
 Just one pin.

40:26.040 --> 40:26.880
 Just one pin.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.380
 30 minutes, 30 minutes, okay?

40:28.380 --> 40:31.560
 If I pin you, you don't get shit, you go home, right?

40:31.560 --> 40:33.460
 Every person I pin, it goes up by a thousand dollars.

40:33.460 --> 40:35.340
 Two thousand, three thousand, four thousand, five thousand

40:35.340 --> 40:36.580
 and so on.

40:36.580 --> 40:37.820
 If you make it the distance

40:37.820 --> 40:39.300
 and I don't pin you and you don't pin me,

40:39.300 --> 40:42.100
 I'll pay for your travel and give you 500 bucks, right?

40:42.100 --> 40:44.620
 Just a consolation prize for showing up.

40:44.620 --> 40:47.220
 If you pin me, you get whatever the jackpot is.

40:47.220 --> 40:50.740
 Wait, who's adding to the jackpot?

40:50.740 --> 40:52.740
 I am, it's my money.

40:52.740 --> 40:53.580
 My money.

40:53.580 --> 40:55.620
 But then what's the incentive to keep winning for you?

40:55.620 --> 40:56.460
 Cause the jackpot.

40:56.460 --> 40:58.260
 Well, cause obviously I would put the content somewhere

40:58.260 --> 40:59.100
 where people would watch it, right?

40:59.100 --> 41:00.140
 Oh, so you're gonna make money.

41:00.140 --> 41:01.260
 Yeah, so you'd make money that way.

41:01.260 --> 41:02.700
 But it's not exponentially growing, right?

41:02.700 --> 41:04.380
 It's just going up by like.

41:04.380 --> 41:06.060
 Yeah, I really think there's probably only a couple people

41:06.060 --> 41:06.900
 that could pin me.

41:06.900 --> 41:09.260
 So I would either just not choose those people

41:09.260 --> 41:11.620
 or wait till I get a really large audience

41:11.620 --> 41:12.700
 and people get really excited

41:12.700 --> 41:14.180
 and in that case, I'm making a lot of money.

41:14.180 --> 41:15.020
 So.

41:15.020 --> 41:17.700
 What do you think, how many matches would go with you,

41:17.700 --> 41:19.500
 like Khaldech shows up?

41:19.500 --> 41:20.860
 I don't think he could pin me.

41:20.860 --> 41:21.680
 Yeah.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.300
 I mean like, so Jordan Burrows could beat me,

41:24.300 --> 41:25.140
 but he can't pin me.

41:25.140 --> 41:26.340
 He was never a pinner.

41:26.340 --> 41:27.180
 Yeah.

41:27.180 --> 41:28.000
 He ain't gonna pin me.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.100
 There's only a few people who have the skill level

41:30.100 --> 41:31.260
 to do so, right?

41:31.260 --> 41:32.100
 It takes a lot.

41:32.100 --> 41:33.500
 Cause that was, so pinning was one of my specialties.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.420
 I had the fourth most of all time

41:35.420 --> 41:38.500
 and I won the pinning award the last two years.

41:38.500 --> 41:41.220
 So you think you can be done on points and just pin them?

41:41.220 --> 41:43.980
 This is actually one of the issues I have with

41:43.980 --> 41:46.980
 Jiu Jitsu and the point system and the Eddie Bravo thing.

41:46.980 --> 41:48.260
 I actually think Eddie Bravo thing is kind of,

41:48.260 --> 41:49.260
 people get so mad at me.

41:49.260 --> 41:50.260
 Sorry, Jiu Jitsu.

41:50.260 --> 41:51.700
 I think it's bullshit.

41:51.700 --> 41:52.820
 And you want me to tell you why it's bullshit?

41:52.820 --> 41:53.640
 Yeah.

41:53.640 --> 41:55.120
 So like, if Jordan Burrows whoops my ass

41:55.120 --> 41:58.460
 and the score is 16 to two, but he can't pin me.

41:58.460 --> 42:00.860
 Then I get to go to overtime and get a cradle on him.

42:00.860 --> 42:02.780
 I'm probably going to pin him.

42:02.780 --> 42:04.700
 So I'm better than Jordan Burrows.

42:04.700 --> 42:05.980
 Nah, that ain't right.

42:05.980 --> 42:07.420
 He just whooped my ass.

42:07.420 --> 42:08.260
 Do you know what I'm saying?

42:08.260 --> 42:11.620
 Like if we can go the whole, cause they do submission only.

42:11.620 --> 42:14.100
 So if Jordan Burrows beats me up for,

42:14.100 --> 42:15.340
 what is it, eight minutes, 10 minutes?

42:15.340 --> 42:16.180
 I don't know.

42:16.180 --> 42:18.300
 What's the length of an Eddie Bravo match?

42:18.300 --> 42:19.140
 Yeah, I don't know.

42:19.140 --> 42:21.100
 Something like that, yeah, yeah.

42:21.100 --> 42:22.540
 So we go 10, me and Jordan Burrows go 10 minutes.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.180
 He's gonna outscore me significantly.

42:24.180 --> 42:26.300
 He will not pin me, I promise you that.

42:26.300 --> 42:27.220
 Okay?

42:27.220 --> 42:29.180
 So now we go to the overtime.

42:29.180 --> 42:30.420
 Strong words, but yeah.

42:30.420 --> 42:32.060
 He won't, Jordan Burrows is not gonna,

42:32.060 --> 42:32.900
 he's gonna beat me.

42:32.900 --> 42:33.860
 I will give you that.

42:33.860 --> 42:35.080
 Kyle Dake won't pin you either.

42:35.080 --> 42:35.920
 No.

42:35.920 --> 42:36.740
 Okay.

42:36.740 --> 42:38.860
 Okay, they will both beat me on points very badly.

42:38.860 --> 42:40.380
 Now David Taylor, he might pin me

42:40.380 --> 42:42.660
 cause he's a very good pinner also.

42:42.660 --> 42:45.120
 They'll beat me very badly, they will not pin me.

42:45.120 --> 42:47.340
 But now we get to the overtime and we get to pick like,

42:47.340 --> 42:50.140
 right, so in Eddie Bravo you get a rear naked choke

42:50.140 --> 42:51.460
 or an armbar.

42:51.460 --> 42:53.540
 Okay, give me a cradle, I'll probably pin him.

42:53.540 --> 42:54.900
 Okay, a good cradle.

42:54.900 --> 42:56.900
 You can say cradle or maybe give them,

42:56.900 --> 42:58.180
 then they're probably not gonna pin me, right?

42:58.180 --> 43:00.140
 Maybe, maybe there's a chance, but probably not.

43:00.140 --> 43:01.220
 Cause that's just not their specialty.

43:01.220 --> 43:04.180
 So for people who don't know, the Eddie Bravo thing

43:04.180 --> 43:07.300
 is when it goes into overtime,

43:07.300 --> 43:09.980
 you get a dominance position on a person

43:09.980 --> 43:12.180
 and you get to, yeah, basically put them in a cradle.

43:12.180 --> 43:13.140
 This is the wrestling equivalent.

43:13.140 --> 43:13.980
 Yeah.

43:13.980 --> 43:14.820
 But you take their back or mount.

43:14.820 --> 43:17.340
 Maybe an armbar, yeah, like a wrestling armbar.

43:17.340 --> 43:18.620
 So, and I don't think that's very fair.

43:18.620 --> 43:20.620
 Cause if someone whoops your ass, they whoops your ass.

43:20.620 --> 43:22.900
 And then, you know, and so I think the reason why

43:22.900 --> 43:25.500
 Jiu Jitsu people accept that rule set is that

43:25.500 --> 43:27.940
 I don't think, I think they know this, but would admit it.

43:27.940 --> 43:32.380
 I don't think their point scoring system adequately rewards

43:32.380 --> 43:33.820
 what people value.

43:33.820 --> 43:36.460
 So like in wrestling, we value takedowns

43:36.460 --> 43:38.020
 cause it gets us closer to the pin.

43:38.020 --> 43:41.180
 And the most valuable scoring is a near fall,

43:41.180 --> 43:44.620
 near to the pin, because that's the ultimate goal to sport.

43:44.620 --> 43:46.220
 Whereas in Jiu Jitsu, for example,

43:46.220 --> 43:48.740
 like if I were to get a takedown,

43:48.740 --> 43:52.300
 so like if I went to Gordon Ryan and he just didn't pull guard

43:52.300 --> 43:54.060
 I would probably get the takedown.

43:54.060 --> 43:56.100
 Now, if somehow he didn't submit me,

43:56.100 --> 43:57.140
 which he probably would, right?

43:57.140 --> 43:59.260
 But say he got, got close to like 12 submissions,

43:59.260 --> 44:01.660
 but somehow I slipped out of all of them.

44:01.660 --> 44:03.940
 Now I went to zero, like that's ridiculous.

44:03.940 --> 44:05.180
 Like he should very clearly win

44:05.180 --> 44:06.700
 cause he almost submitted, you know what I'm saying?

44:06.700 --> 44:09.820
 Like there, and I, and I realized the difficulty.

44:09.820 --> 44:12.860
 I realized the difficulty in rewarding near submissions,

44:12.860 --> 44:15.780
 but that is the most valuable thing is getting close

44:15.780 --> 44:17.020
 to finishing the match.

44:17.020 --> 44:20.180
 And in most competitions, they don't actually reward that.

44:20.180 --> 44:22.460
 But okay, so this, this isn't about the sport.

44:22.460 --> 44:24.780
 This is about the Ben Askren challenge

44:24.780 --> 44:25.620
 that we're talking about.

44:25.620 --> 44:26.580
 Okay.

44:26.580 --> 44:28.260
 What, why 30 minutes?

44:28.260 --> 44:29.640
 Why not unlimited time?

44:31.060 --> 44:33.540
 Why, why go until whenever?

44:33.540 --> 44:34.860
 Cause then it's just a cardio thing.

44:34.860 --> 44:38.340
 Cause at some point then someone would just have to fall

44:38.340 --> 44:39.340
 over dead, right?

44:39.340 --> 44:40.780
 There's no more skill level involved.

44:40.780 --> 44:42.820
 It's just who can stand up the longest.

44:42.820 --> 44:47.580
 You honestly don't think 30 minutes is a cardio thing too.

44:47.580 --> 44:49.300
 How do you think that's actually going to look?

44:49.300 --> 44:51.380
 How are they going against you for 30 minutes?

44:51.380 --> 44:52.220
 What is that?

44:52.220 --> 44:55.240
 So it's going to be kind of boring for the most part.

44:56.380 --> 44:57.820
 What position are you going to be stuck in?

44:57.820 --> 44:59.500
 Because you, well, you can't, but you can't,

44:59.500 --> 45:01.480
 you just can't have a gigantic amount of action

45:01.480 --> 45:02.320
 for 30 minutes.

45:02.320 --> 45:04.260
 So I relate to this because some of my kids,

45:04.260 --> 45:07.900
 when I'm teaching them wrestling, they're like, well,

45:07.900 --> 45:10.580
 but I can't do that for seven minutes.

45:10.580 --> 45:13.940
 And I'm like, well, you know, like say, say if I had you do

45:13.940 --> 45:16.060
 hang cleans at a relatively heavy weight,

45:16.060 --> 45:18.380
 as hard as you could, you're not going to last seven minutes.

45:18.380 --> 45:20.620
 You're going to, your pace will slow down, right?

45:20.620 --> 45:22.820
 So my thing is like, well, your pace doesn't have to step

45:22.820 --> 45:24.900
 here because in wrestling, you're competing against someone.

45:24.900 --> 45:27.380
 So if you're here at a hundred and you go to 80,

45:27.380 --> 45:29.100
 but they go to 70, that's great.

45:29.100 --> 45:31.340
 And then you go to 60, but they go to 40,

45:31.340 --> 45:32.880
 this is even better, right?

45:32.880 --> 45:34.460
 Because the gap is growing.

45:34.460 --> 45:36.860
 So we don't necessarily, if we get tired, that's fine.

45:36.860 --> 45:38.740
 If they get more tired, that's better.

45:38.740 --> 45:40.440
 So I think most people would know that.

45:40.440 --> 45:43.160
 So they would kind of slow it down.

45:45.020 --> 45:47.820
 But yeah, I think at 30, I mean, I've wrestled 30 minute

45:47.820 --> 45:51.380
 goes, I've wrestled hour long goes.

45:51.380 --> 45:52.580
 You're not going to get so tired,

45:52.580 --> 45:54.020
 you're going to fall over in that time period.

45:54.020 --> 45:56.180
 But at some point, if it's unlimited,

45:56.180 --> 45:58.420
 someone will get so tired or dehydrated

45:58.420 --> 46:00.620
 that they're just going to freaking fall over.

46:00.620 --> 46:01.460
 Yeah.

46:01.460 --> 46:05.240
 But you think, what about making it exciting and dynamic?

46:06.220 --> 46:08.760
 You think the other person is always going to be going

46:08.760 --> 46:11.660
 for the pin and thereby make it dynamic.

46:11.660 --> 46:12.880
 Well, if they're working that hard,

46:12.880 --> 46:15.020
 then they might exhaust themselves, right?

46:15.020 --> 46:17.980
 And obviously then if you're being that dynamic,

46:17.980 --> 46:20.220
 then you're adding risk to yourself too,

46:20.220 --> 46:22.660
 because you are doing that.

46:22.660 --> 46:23.500
 Well, I love this.

46:23.500 --> 46:24.460
 This is a great idea.

46:24.460 --> 46:29.100
 Well, I figured I'd rack up like 20 pins against bums,

46:29.100 --> 46:30.860
 or not as great people in the beginning.

46:30.860 --> 46:32.900
 And then I would start bringing in better people

46:32.900 --> 46:35.860
 because they would be enticed by $20,000,

46:35.860 --> 46:36.700
 the possibility to win.

46:36.700 --> 46:40.020
 And not much fanfare, just a camera and just local.

46:40.020 --> 46:41.180
 That's it, in my wrestling room.

46:41.180 --> 46:42.820
 Yeah, yeah, like the Gracie Challenge.

46:42.820 --> 46:43.820
 Yes.

46:43.820 --> 46:44.660
 Yeah.

46:44.660 --> 46:48.100
 And so then maybe you have like, you know,

46:48.100 --> 46:51.100
 for most people, you have someone edit like the 90 seconds

46:51.100 --> 46:52.780
 of the most fun things that happen.

46:52.780 --> 46:54.620
 And then you can watch the entire 30 minutes

46:54.620 --> 46:55.460
 if you want to.

46:55.460 --> 46:56.300
 Yeah.

46:56.300 --> 46:57.120
 I mean, I think most people,

46:57.120 --> 46:59.020
 if they're not really, really elite,

46:59.020 --> 47:00.580
 I'm probably going to pin them.

47:01.460 --> 47:02.860
 If they're not really elite.

47:04.620 --> 47:05.580
 So, yeah.

47:05.580 --> 47:06.660
 But I don't know.

47:06.660 --> 47:07.640
 That's something I've been thinking about.

47:07.640 --> 47:09.940
 This has been like fun for me to think about.

47:11.020 --> 47:12.400
 And obviously it plays in my skill sets

47:12.400 --> 47:15.980
 because my cardio is good and my pinning is good also.

47:15.980 --> 47:17.140
 So, yeah.

47:17.140 --> 47:21.860
 So, like you said, you weren't very good in your early days

47:21.860 --> 47:23.380
 until 13, 14.

47:23.380 --> 47:24.540
 What was the switch?

47:24.540 --> 47:28.060
 You started to dominate people in your college career.

47:28.060 --> 47:28.900
 You dominated.

47:28.900 --> 47:30.140
 Yeah.

47:30.140 --> 47:33.580
 And obviously you stopped losing at some point.

47:33.580 --> 47:34.420
 Yeah.

47:34.420 --> 47:36.460
 So, well, I would say,

47:36.460 --> 47:38.060
 so even when I didn't lose in collegiate competition,

47:38.060 --> 47:40.340
 I would go in the summers and try to make the world team.

47:40.340 --> 47:42.980
 So, I would lose some, not a lot, right?

47:42.980 --> 47:43.820
 Minimally.

47:44.820 --> 47:45.660
 Okay.

47:45.660 --> 47:47.540
 So, when I'm five, I start playing all sports.

47:47.540 --> 47:51.500
 Like I know you moved to America at what age?

47:51.500 --> 47:52.340
 13.

47:52.340 --> 47:53.160
 Okay.

47:53.160 --> 47:55.100
 So, at least I don't know what it was for you,

47:55.100 --> 47:57.600
 but in America at my age,

47:57.600 --> 48:00.180
 you usually play like a sport every season, right?

48:00.180 --> 48:02.600
 So, that's what I did in the beginning.

48:02.600 --> 48:04.620
 I had minimal success in wrestling.

48:04.620 --> 48:06.180
 I was kind of chunky.

48:06.180 --> 48:09.020
 And then in fifth grade, I don't know.

48:09.020 --> 48:11.380
 And I can't tell you, I wanted to be better.

48:11.380 --> 48:12.980
 And I told my parents, and this is funny,

48:12.980 --> 48:14.260
 because now I look at other 11 year olds

48:14.260 --> 48:15.900
 and very few of them are this mature.

48:15.900 --> 48:17.300
 And I actually think emotional maturity

48:17.300 --> 48:18.540
 is kind of one of the key indicators

48:18.540 --> 48:21.020
 of how longterm successful someone's gonna be.

48:21.020 --> 48:23.100
 And at age 11, I said, I don't wanna play baseball.

48:23.100 --> 48:24.580
 I like baseball, but I don't wanna play baseball

48:24.580 --> 48:25.420
 because I wanna wrestle more

48:25.420 --> 48:26.860
 because I wanna get better at wrestling.

48:26.860 --> 48:28.460
 So, at age 11, I quit baseball

48:28.460 --> 48:30.940
 so I could wrestle in a club for March, April, and May.

48:30.940 --> 48:33.300
 Because that was all that existed at that point in time.

48:33.300 --> 48:34.540
 You couldn't wrestle in June, July,

48:34.540 --> 48:36.100
 or any of those other months.

48:37.260 --> 48:38.780
 What was that desire to get better?

48:38.780 --> 48:39.620
 What is that?

48:39.620 --> 48:40.460
 So, it's not about winning.

48:40.460 --> 48:41.380
 I don't know where it came from.

48:41.380 --> 48:43.220
 I just wanted to get better.

48:43.220 --> 48:44.060
 I wanna get better.

48:44.060 --> 48:44.900
 I wanna be good at this.

48:44.900 --> 48:45.740
 I wanna be really good at this.

48:45.740 --> 48:47.940
 So, when you're looking at kids now as a coach,

48:47.940 --> 48:49.100
 you're looking for that.

48:49.100 --> 48:51.140
 Somebody who says, you know what, I kinda suck.

48:51.140 --> 48:51.980
 I wanna get better.

48:51.980 --> 48:54.340
 And I wanna try to also inspire that.

48:54.340 --> 48:58.340
 I mean, honestly, I think as a coach,

48:58.340 --> 49:01.800
 that's probably my biggest job is to get a kid

49:01.800 --> 49:03.940
 and get them to believe I can do this.

49:03.940 --> 49:07.340
 Because if I can do this, well, I can do that.

49:07.340 --> 49:08.980
 I can do that too, right?

49:08.980 --> 49:10.700
 And there's so many kids who, unfortunately,

49:10.700 --> 49:14.140
 have shitty parents or bad teachers

49:14.140 --> 49:16.740
 that tell them, you suck, you can't be anything, right?

49:16.740 --> 49:18.740
 So, I think my biggest goal as a coach

49:18.740 --> 49:20.260
 is to get someone to believe they can do it.

49:20.260 --> 49:22.340
 So, actually, some of the ones that believe they can do it,

49:22.340 --> 49:23.220
 they're the most fun,

49:23.220 --> 49:25.420
 but they're not the ones who need it the most, right?

49:25.420 --> 49:26.380
 The ones who think they can

49:26.380 --> 49:28.420
 are the ones that need me the most.

49:28.420 --> 49:30.460
 Because they need someone to, let's go.

49:31.340 --> 49:33.400
 So, I don't know what inspired me.

49:33.400 --> 49:34.240
 I'm not sure.

49:34.240 --> 49:37.900
 At age 11, fifth grade, I quit.

49:37.900 --> 49:40.620
 So, then I started having more success

49:40.620 --> 49:43.820
 where I'm like, say, placing at the state tournament.

49:43.820 --> 49:44.860
 In high school.

49:44.860 --> 49:46.020
 So, you're right.

49:46.020 --> 49:48.140
 So, sixth grade, I placed at the state,

49:48.140 --> 49:49.620
 the local youth state tournament, you know?

49:49.620 --> 49:51.940
 So, I'm having more success.

49:51.940 --> 49:52.860
 Seventh grade was the first year

49:52.860 --> 49:55.120
 I won the youth state tournament.

49:55.120 --> 49:56.100
 So, I'm getting better.

49:56.100 --> 49:58.140
 Eighth grade, I actually feel like I got pretty good,

49:58.140 --> 50:00.100
 but when I went to the national tournaments,

50:00.100 --> 50:02.200
 I was still having really minimal success.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.880
 My freshman year, I decided to quit football.

50:04.880 --> 50:05.720
 Same reason.

50:05.720 --> 50:06.920
 It's like, well, I need to put more time into this.

50:06.920 --> 50:10.040
 My parents, my dad luckily got a mat in my basement.

50:10.040 --> 50:12.720
 So, we have a year round club,

50:12.720 --> 50:15.080
 and our impetus was that we didn't have this opportunity

50:15.080 --> 50:16.860
 to go to a club year round.

50:16.860 --> 50:18.040
 So, we had a mat in my basement.

50:18.040 --> 50:21.520
 I had to go find, hey, you wanna come wrestle?

50:21.520 --> 50:22.840
 Yeah, to find partners for myself.

50:22.840 --> 50:23.680
 What'd you do?

50:23.680 --> 50:24.500
 Did you drill?

50:24.500 --> 50:25.400
 Did you live wrestle?

50:25.400 --> 50:26.720
 What'd you do in that basement?

50:26.720 --> 50:28.600
 So, actually, I think, you'll enjoy this.

50:28.600 --> 50:33.160
 I think the start of my scrambling was

50:33.160 --> 50:34.440
 kind of based around that.

50:34.440 --> 50:36.320
 So, I got kind of,

50:36.320 --> 50:37.680
 I think it's probably my freshman sophomore.

50:37.680 --> 50:39.920
 I'm kind of, the years are a little fuzzy, right?

50:39.920 --> 50:41.360
 It's been a while.

50:41.360 --> 50:45.160
 But probably my freshman, sophomore, junior year,

50:45.160 --> 50:47.580
 I found two kids who were really consistent

50:47.580 --> 50:49.080
 who would come out, like you would come out on,

50:49.080 --> 50:50.000
 he would come out on Tuesday,

50:50.000 --> 50:51.640
 and this dude would come out on a Wednesday, right?

50:51.640 --> 50:52.640
 And they would come every week,

50:52.640 --> 50:55.040
 and they were really consistent partners for me

50:55.040 --> 50:56.340
 to have in the summer.

50:56.340 --> 50:57.960
 But they weren't nearly as good as me.

50:57.960 --> 50:58.880
 They were way worse.

50:58.880 --> 51:02.320
 So, it's like, okay, how do I,

51:02.320 --> 51:04.940
 how do I make this kind of like fun and compelling

51:04.940 --> 51:05.780
 for them to come back?

51:05.780 --> 51:07.040
 Because if I just whoop their ass,

51:07.040 --> 51:08.920
 they're not gonna come back, you know?

51:08.920 --> 51:11.320
 So, it was like, I would let them get as close as they could,

51:11.320 --> 51:13.480
 and I thought they could do a takedown

51:13.480 --> 51:14.640
 before not getting it,

51:14.640 --> 51:16.960
 and then try to like escape or get out.

51:16.960 --> 51:18.380
 So, obviously, if I let them get really close,

51:18.380 --> 51:19.640
 sometimes they get it, you know?

51:19.640 --> 51:21.480
 So, they're enjoying it.

51:21.480 --> 51:23.560
 I don't know if they ever knew I was doing this, right?

51:23.560 --> 51:24.460
 I have no idea.

51:25.320 --> 51:26.640
 And that was kind of like the start,

51:26.640 --> 51:28.920
 because I had to figure my way out of bad positions,

51:28.920 --> 51:32.280
 because I had to try to make it entertaining for them,

51:32.280 --> 51:33.480
 where they still got something out of it,

51:33.480 --> 51:34.920
 and they wanted to come back the next week.

51:34.920 --> 51:36.440
 And I also got something out of it.

51:36.440 --> 51:37.720
 Yeah, I love this, yeah.

51:37.720 --> 51:39.800
 Because that relationship is so important,

51:39.800 --> 51:42.360
 with that, like, that,

51:42.360 --> 51:44.480
 I've had a few drilling partners,

51:44.480 --> 51:47.920
 training partners that were really important to my life,

51:47.920 --> 51:50.680
 and I always wonder why it's difficult,

51:50.680 --> 51:52.520
 why it's so difficult to find them.

51:52.520 --> 51:53.360
 Yeah.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.720
 Like I, if anyone's listening to this,

51:55.720 --> 51:58.840
 I'm looking for a judo person in the Austin area, actually.

51:58.840 --> 52:01.000
 Getting the reps with people is hard.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.480
 Even in jiu jitsu, that,

52:04.480 --> 52:06.520
 it's just like, people want to do the fun stuff.

52:06.520 --> 52:08.440
 They don't want to really put in the work,

52:08.440 --> 52:10.400
 and it takes a certain kind of personality.

52:10.400 --> 52:13.920
 And then you also have to make it fun for the other person,

52:13.920 --> 52:14.760
 just like you said.

52:14.760 --> 52:16.000
 If there's a skill mismatch,

52:16.000 --> 52:19.620
 but also if you have an interest mismatch,

52:19.620 --> 52:22.360
 in terms of the amount of drilling you want to do,

52:22.360 --> 52:23.180
 all that kind of stuff,

52:23.180 --> 52:24.960
 you have to figure out ways to make it fun.

52:24.960 --> 52:25.860
 It's tricky.

52:25.860 --> 52:26.700
 So you did.

52:26.700 --> 52:28.160
 So, yeah, I think I did that,

52:28.160 --> 52:29.920
 and no one told me.

52:29.920 --> 52:31.400
 As I get some, I get frustrated,

52:31.400 --> 52:33.280
 because now we have, just in my academy,

52:33.280 --> 52:36.440
 we probably have 50, 60 high school kids only

52:36.440 --> 52:37.260
 that are year round.

52:37.260 --> 52:38.200
 They're year round.

52:38.200 --> 52:39.880
 Maybe they're not consistent in the summer or whatever,

52:39.880 --> 52:40.720
 but they're there.

52:40.720 --> 52:42.160
 So when they don't have a great partner,

52:42.160 --> 52:43.000
 they start whining,

52:43.000 --> 52:45.840
 and it's like, you little bitches, like, you know.

52:45.840 --> 52:47.040
 Some days they get really mad about it,

52:47.040 --> 52:48.240
 because it's like, I had no partners.

52:48.240 --> 52:50.680
 I had to find freaking two partners to come twice a week.

52:50.680 --> 52:53.040
 You guys, there's still 22 people in the room.

52:53.040 --> 52:55.240
 I'm sorry there's not the perfect partner for you,

52:55.240 --> 52:56.720
 but like, go work out with that dude.

52:56.720 --> 52:57.560
 Yeah.

52:57.560 --> 52:58.380
 You know?

52:58.380 --> 52:59.220
 Yeah.

52:59.220 --> 53:00.160
 So what was the switch, the change?

53:00.160 --> 53:01.680
 Was it gradual, or?

53:01.680 --> 53:02.520
 Gradual.

53:02.520 --> 53:03.340
 Okay.

53:03.340 --> 53:04.280
 Yeah, so I was in ninth grade.

53:04.280 --> 53:07.360
 I quit football, because I wanted to get really serious.

53:07.360 --> 53:08.200
 What position in football were you in?

53:08.200 --> 53:10.440
 I was actually a nose tackle.

53:10.440 --> 53:11.500
 But at that point, so, okay,

53:11.500 --> 53:13.460
 so I was also, the other thing I kind of left out here,

53:13.460 --> 53:15.680
 I was really fat growing up.

53:15.680 --> 53:19.320
 In sixth grade, I also decided, okay, I'm really fat,

53:19.320 --> 53:20.400
 and if I want to be a competitive wrestler,

53:20.400 --> 53:21.940
 I shouldn't be fat, because weight matters.

53:21.940 --> 53:25.280
 I went from 130 pounds to 100 pounds in sixth grade.

53:25.280 --> 53:26.120
 Nice.

53:26.120 --> 53:28.440
 So by the time I was a freshman, I was 119.

53:28.440 --> 53:30.820
 So I still wasn't as heavy as I was in sixth grade.

53:30.820 --> 53:31.760
 So I was pretty small, too,

53:31.760 --> 53:33.800
 but I was also slow, unfortunately.

53:33.800 --> 53:35.640
 So they put me a nose tackle.

53:35.640 --> 53:38.340
 I liked the competitiveness, so I was decent at it.

53:39.440 --> 53:41.160
 So that's where you wrestled, 119?

53:41.160 --> 53:42.540
 My freshman year, yeah.

53:42.540 --> 53:43.720
 Mm hmm.

53:43.720 --> 53:46.020
 So yeah, so then I started having a lot of success

53:46.020 --> 53:48.920
 state wise, but not nationally.

53:48.920 --> 53:50.200
 It's my national success,

53:50.200 --> 53:52.920
 didn't come to my junior year in high school.

53:52.920 --> 53:55.080
 But yeah, I was grinding and getting better the whole time.

53:55.080 --> 53:57.000
 And then senior year, I started having a lot of success

53:57.000 --> 53:59.360
 nationally, and I got recruited.

53:59.360 --> 54:01.760
 But then even when my freshman year of college,

54:01.760 --> 54:04.200
 this is where I loved competing, I would go every weekend.

54:04.200 --> 54:07.800
 Because I knew, if you take the emotions out of competition,

54:08.940 --> 54:12.120
 all it is is seeing your failures, acknowledging them,

54:12.120 --> 54:14.360
 and then figuring out what you need to work on.

54:14.360 --> 54:16.720
 If we take all the emotion out of it, that's what it is.

54:16.720 --> 54:19.040
 So I wrestled 50 matches as a redshirt freshman,

54:19.040 --> 54:20.360
 which is incredibly rare.

54:20.360 --> 54:21.720
 I had 10 losses.

54:21.720 --> 54:24.920
 So it's not, and like to not so great guys, you know?

54:24.920 --> 54:27.320
 So like my skill level still at that point

54:27.320 --> 54:28.160
 was not that great.

54:28.160 --> 54:29.200
 And then the next year I came out

54:29.200 --> 54:30.200
 and I made it into the finals.

54:30.200 --> 54:33.960
 So my, I made a gigantic jump in that redshirt year

54:33.960 --> 54:35.920
 to the real freshman year.

54:35.920 --> 54:37.840
 So a few questions.

54:37.840 --> 54:40.880
 Where did the funk style of wrestling,

54:40.880 --> 54:44.440
 the creative stuff get developed, at which stage?

54:44.440 --> 54:47.040
 So I think like looking retroactively,

54:47.040 --> 54:49.480
 there was no intention to start when I was in high school

54:49.480 --> 54:51.940
 with those kids, but I think that's kind of like,

54:51.940 --> 54:54.680
 well, what was happening, right?

54:54.680 --> 54:56.380
 So what I would really say is,

54:56.380 --> 54:59.200
 I had one influential coach my redshirt year of college

54:59.200 --> 55:01.800
 named Mike Ironman, great guy.

55:01.800 --> 55:04.260
 But then the second thing was, it was just out of necessity.

55:04.260 --> 55:06.440
 I had this burning desire to be the best.

55:06.440 --> 55:09.160
 And when I was getting my ass kicked every day in the room,

55:09.160 --> 55:10.560
 cause we had, you know, Tyron was there,

55:10.560 --> 55:13.360
 we had All American 157, we had All American 184.

55:13.360 --> 55:15.980
 So I wasn't having a ton of success.

55:15.980 --> 55:18.080
 And very quickly I realized

55:18.080 --> 55:21.440
 from like a more traditional athletic perspective,

55:21.440 --> 55:23.440
 strength and speed, I couldn't keep up with anyone.

55:23.440 --> 55:25.060
 I was way worse.

55:25.060 --> 55:27.220
 So it's like, okay, fuck, how do I, how do I do this?

55:27.220 --> 55:28.240
 You know, I want to do this.

55:28.240 --> 55:29.640
 How do I do this?

55:29.640 --> 55:31.340
 There's gotta be a way, you know?

55:31.340 --> 55:33.420
 So Mike Ironman showed me a couple of things,

55:33.420 --> 55:36.480
 but then it was just like this creative expansion

55:36.480 --> 55:39.800
 for the next, you know, say three to five years.

55:39.800 --> 55:42.600
 And then even now it's like, I don't know,

55:42.600 --> 55:44.640
 there's something, and maybe you feel this way about judo,

55:44.640 --> 55:47.440
 or there's something that's like fun

55:47.440 --> 55:49.720
 about the way the body moves and works

55:49.720 --> 55:52.680
 and exploring something new and thinking about,

55:52.680 --> 55:55.280
 hey, wrestling's been happening at a relatively high level

55:55.280 --> 55:57.780
 for we'll say 80 to 90 years in America.

55:59.120 --> 56:01.360
 And there's still new things being developed.

56:01.360 --> 56:02.480
 And so when you see something new,

56:02.480 --> 56:03.880
 you're like, oh damn, like, that's great.

56:03.880 --> 56:05.720
 Or like Jason Knowles may have to win Dixie.

56:05.720 --> 56:07.400
 I'm like, how did I not think of that shit?

56:07.400 --> 56:08.320
 Like, why did I think of that?

56:08.320 --> 56:11.240
 So easy, I should have thought of that, you know?

56:11.240 --> 56:14.880
 So there's this like obsession with the sport of wrestling

56:14.880 --> 56:19.640
 and positions where I actually think sometimes,

56:19.640 --> 56:20.760
 thank God we didn't have smartphones

56:20.760 --> 56:23.360
 because I may have been distracted by my smartphone.

56:23.360 --> 56:24.800
 Maybe I wouldn't have been because I was so obsessed,

56:24.800 --> 56:27.360
 but maybe, but you know, some days I had,

56:27.360 --> 56:29.620
 couldn't finish the single leg on a specific person

56:29.620 --> 56:32.680
 or maybe they were finishing on me and it was like,

56:32.680 --> 56:34.340
 go home and I was just fucking obsessed

56:34.340 --> 56:35.880
 about that one position.

56:35.880 --> 56:38.760
 Like, okay, what am I missing here?

56:38.760 --> 56:41.560
 And not just accepting like that whatever the coach says

56:41.560 --> 56:43.880
 is the answer, but like, what am I missing?

56:43.880 --> 56:45.640
 What ways can my body move

56:45.640 --> 56:48.440
 that no one's told me it can move yet?

56:48.440 --> 56:50.280
 Where can my arms go, right?

56:50.280 --> 56:51.360
 Where can I do all these things?

56:51.360 --> 56:53.800
 And so I would just obsess about these things.

56:53.800 --> 56:55.480
 And then, you know, sometimes you come in the next day

56:55.480 --> 56:57.700
 and you say, oh, well maybe this, you know,

56:57.700 --> 56:59.360
 and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't,

56:59.360 --> 57:01.040
 maybe it works twice and it doesn't work the next time.

57:01.040 --> 57:03.160
 And so you kind of like have this creative process

57:03.160 --> 57:05.000
 and it's like, you know, there's a lot of things

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
 that are on the cutting room floor

57:06.000 --> 57:07.660
 that never made it to the light

57:07.660 --> 57:08.920
 because you thought they'd be good

57:08.920 --> 57:10.360
 and they failed and they sucked.

57:10.360 --> 57:11.720
 And then, you know, to the point where,

57:11.720 --> 57:12.940
 like my senior year,

57:14.920 --> 57:16.760
 I got to this point where the people,

57:16.760 --> 57:18.260
 then they were just figures.

57:18.260 --> 57:19.860
 Figures would wrestle in my head

57:19.860 --> 57:21.280
 about positions I was thinking about.

57:21.280 --> 57:22.460
 I wouldn't tell them what to do.

57:22.460 --> 57:24.460
 They would just, they'd just go in my head.

57:24.460 --> 57:27.600
 And then like, oh fuck, wait, that's it.

57:27.600 --> 57:29.040
 That's it, like that just happened.

57:29.040 --> 57:30.640
 That's the move and then I'd go try to practice

57:30.640 --> 57:32.680
 and sure enough, boom, that's the move.

57:32.680 --> 57:34.700
 That's exactly what you have Alpha Zero playing,

57:34.700 --> 57:35.540
 learning chess.

57:35.540 --> 57:38.880
 You have, it's called Self Plays.

57:38.880 --> 57:43.400
 You have, did the figures have like a clear?

57:43.400 --> 57:45.140
 No faces, they were just like.

57:45.140 --> 57:46.600
 Did they have a human form

57:46.600 --> 57:48.720
 or is it just like stick figures essentially?

57:48.720 --> 57:50.920
 Yeah, it was not like humans.

57:50.920 --> 57:51.880
 It was more like stick figures.

57:51.880 --> 57:55.000
 They weren't stick figures exactly like they were.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.200
 They had some volume?

57:56.200 --> 57:58.040
 Yeah, it was like a gray person

57:58.040 --> 58:00.560
 and they had, you know, three dimensions essentially

58:00.560 --> 58:05.560
 so I had to see how the things moved and yeah.

58:05.880 --> 58:09.720
 I mean, this is exactly what OpenAI and DeepMind at Google

58:09.720 --> 58:12.540
 are, I don't know if you've seen,

58:12.540 --> 58:14.440
 but there's something called reinforcement learning

58:14.440 --> 58:17.200
 in artificial intelligence where you have like,

58:17.200 --> 58:19.180
 they've done it for like sumo wrestling.

58:19.180 --> 58:23.080
 You have like, you have these two stick figures

58:23.080 --> 58:26.200
 that don't even know how to get up at first

58:26.200 --> 58:28.680
 and they figure out how to stand on their two feet

58:28.680 --> 58:31.160
 and then they figure out how to push the other person

58:31.160 --> 58:33.440
 off of the pedestal.

58:33.440 --> 58:36.040
 Wait, so, but what about like when you look

58:36.040 --> 58:38.840
 at the Boston Dynamics, sometimes they have trouble

58:38.840 --> 58:41.560
 with like jumping and balancing and the other stuff.

58:41.560 --> 58:43.720
 So are they doing that same program or no?

58:43.720 --> 58:44.560
 No, no, no, no.

58:44.560 --> 58:49.560
 This, everything Boston Dynamics is doing is hard coded

58:50.420 --> 58:53.900
 so it's not learning the,

58:55.160 --> 58:57.440
 all of the sophisticated movements and strategies

58:57.440 --> 58:58.960
 like high level strategies and movement,

58:58.960 --> 59:02.040
 that's all something that Boston Dynamics does not do

59:02.040 --> 59:03.880
 and if it does it, like the parkour stuff,

59:03.880 --> 59:05.040
 that's all hard coded in.

59:05.040 --> 59:06.440
 Oh, interesting.

59:06.440 --> 59:10.240
 People like project and think like these robots

59:10.240 --> 59:13.020
 have like discovered like how to move

59:13.020 --> 59:14.720
 in sophisticated ways they haven't.

59:14.720 --> 59:17.200
 Well, that's what, when you and John were talking

59:17.200 --> 59:19.720
 about the grappling robot.

59:19.720 --> 59:20.540
 Yeah.

59:20.540 --> 59:24.060
 I mean, the one thing I was obsessing about in my head

59:24.060 --> 59:26.960
 is that with the chess, right?

59:26.960 --> 59:28.660
 If a chess piece moves, right?

59:28.660 --> 59:31.420
 The horse can move like an L, right?

59:31.420 --> 59:32.600
 It can only move like an L.

59:32.600 --> 59:35.120
 It doesn't matter if it moves at two meters per second

59:35.120 --> 59:36.720
 or seven meters per second.

59:36.720 --> 59:38.720
 It can only move there, right?

59:38.720 --> 59:41.520
 Whereas like a single leg, I can shoot a single leg

59:41.520 --> 59:43.680
 with many different velocities.

59:43.680 --> 59:45.260
 I can shoot at different angles.

59:45.260 --> 59:48.160
 I can shoot with different amounts of force, right?

59:48.160 --> 59:50.200
 I can shoot with my head up versus my head,

59:50.200 --> 59:51.020
 I mean, right?

59:51.020 --> 59:52.200
 All these things are gonna matter.

59:52.200 --> 59:55.400
 We're talking about a human being defending the single leg.

59:55.400 --> 59:56.900
 All of those things are gonna matter

59:56.900 --> 1:00:00.120
 and that's where human beings who wrestle

1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:01.880
 are calculating those things subconsciously.

1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:04.700
 They're obviously not consciously calculating in their head,

1:00:04.700 --> 1:00:06.600
 oh, the force is coming at me at this,

1:00:06.600 --> 1:00:07.640
 so I need to do that, right?

1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:09.360
 They're just doing it because.

1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:12.160
 But see, the thing is, so you would absolutely,

1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:14.120
 if you're doing a robot that you're wrestling,

1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:16.680
 you're going to have to constrain the speed at which it moves

1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:19.160
 and the power that it's able to deliver.

1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:22.400
 So that presumably, that'll be the limitation.

1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:24.920
 So then it'll be just the same exactly as a human.

1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:28.440
 But then, so if we go human, max force,

1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:30.480
 we're Jordan Burrows double, max force, right?

1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:31.840
 That's the highest, that's the highest we get

1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:33.400
 and then we go down from there.

1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:38.120
 Even within that, it's like sometimes,

1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:40.200
 I can shoot a single leg with a maximum force of,

1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:43.240
 I don't know, we'll just say 20 is the number, right?

1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:44.800
 I don't know, I'll shoot it at 20

1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:46.640
 because I feel sometimes I shoot it at 15,

1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:48.600
 sometimes I shoot it at 12, right?

1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:50.880
 Because you feel something in your opponent

1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:52.320
 that makes you do it differently.

1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:53.800
 So they would have to learn how,

1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:55.640
 and then all of these different things

1:00:55.640 --> 1:00:57.920
 and sometimes maybe I clamp a little harder.

1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:00.520
 So the robot would have to learn

1:01:00.520 --> 1:01:03.400
 all of these different incoming inputs to the system

1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:04.880
 and then create this reaction.

1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:06.160
 Oh no, no, no, 100%.

1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:08.360
 So this would be all continuous.

1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:09.600
 So unlike chess, it would not be,

1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:11.800
 it's just chess is discrete, there's, it's.

1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:12.760
 One and then.

1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:16.340
 You move, it's a very specific set of moves.

1:01:16.340 --> 1:01:19.160
 Now here you would, those are all variables you control

1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:20.440
 and they're continuous variables.

1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:23.480
 So the speed, the force, there's actuators,

1:01:23.480 --> 1:01:24.960
 so there's all these joints, right?

1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:25.800
 Yeah.

1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:26.640
 But you can move.

1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:28.600
 I mean, it's just an optimization problem.

1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:30.240
 It's kind of, and it's fascinating.

1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:31.600
 So I've been fascinated thinking about it

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:33.440
 since you guys talked about it.

1:01:33.440 --> 1:01:34.280
 It was a long time ago,

1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:36.160
 I listened to it probably three to four weeks ago

1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:39.560
 and I've kind of been like obsessing about it ever since.

1:01:39.560 --> 1:01:42.220
 Yeah, it just changes when,

1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:45.800
 so unlike boxing, for example, or striking,

1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.480
 once you grab a hold of somebody,

1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:52.320
 it changes, you're now one body, right?

1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:53.720
 So it's very complicated.

1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:56.600
 It's not just shooting a double leg without,

1:01:56.600 --> 1:02:00.140
 like maybe doing like faking a double leg

1:02:00.140 --> 1:02:01.760
 and then shooting the double leg,

1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:03.640
 that's very doable with robotics,

1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:07.600
 but then like doing a clinch and from there,

1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:09.920
 doing like a Russian tie, like that,

1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:14.400
 that's, I think that's way harder than people realize

1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:17.240
 in terms of how many things are involved,

1:02:17.240 --> 1:02:20.440
 like the force of the grip, the leverage you're providing

1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:22.120
 with all the different parts of the shoulder

1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:24.760
 and the arm and the torso, the twist,

1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:26.760
 how much of your weight are you allocating,

1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:28.800
 like leaning on the other person,

1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:30.520
 like taking weight off of one of your legs

1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:32.400
 and the other leg, all of that.

1:02:32.400 --> 1:02:35.400
 I think that's the really interesting thing about humans

1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:38.120
 is we're able to do all of this calculation.

1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:40.400
 Subconsciously. Yeah, subconsciously.

1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:41.960
 Yeah, and that's what I've been thinking about since we,

1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:45.680
 it's like how many things even these high school athletes

1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:47.960
 who are like getting medium good

1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:50.520
 are subconsciously thinking about all the time

1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:53.120
 or not even thinking about, sorry, reacting to,

1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.320
 but then even like for me, I'm a few orders of magnitude

1:02:57.320 --> 1:02:58.520
 better than some of these kids that play,

1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:00.320
 and so when I go like super hard,

1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:02.480
 it's like I can feel their weight

1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:03.640
 moving the wrong direction,

1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:05.920
 and so for me to off balance them or trip them or whatever

1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:07.680
 is kind of easy sometimes, you know,

1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:11.520
 because they're not feeling it the right way, right,

1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:13.600
 or their timing's just a little bit off

1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:15.160
 or the way they're grabbing the hip,

1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:16.720
 maybe they should be up a little higher, right,

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:18.560
 these really small things.

1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:22.080
 Yeah, I think that's all easy to take advantage of

1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:24.720
 for a robot, it's just there's so many things.

1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:28.000
 The big problem is ethically,

1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:30.640
 I don't know how many people are willing to train

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:33.800
 with a robot because you're gonna get hurt.

1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:36.080
 Well, couldn't you make a robot train as a robot or no?

1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:37.960
 Yes, but then it's expensive.

1:03:38.840 --> 1:03:40.520
 So, because they're gonna get.

1:03:40.520 --> 1:03:42.040
 Put the padding on that thing.

1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:45.680
 I know, but then it's not, you know,

1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:50.680
 it's, then you're not capturing the full.

1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:53.160
 Why can't you put like some rubber coating on them,

1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:54.880
 you know, something for that effect?

1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:58.320
 You could, I mean, you could, you could.

1:03:58.320 --> 1:04:01.200
 I mean, you're talking about robots that are,

1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:02.680
 these are humanoid robots,

1:04:02.680 --> 1:04:07.320
 so we're talking about $500,000 million robots.

1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:12.320
 So, you would have to be motivated to spend a lot of money

1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:17.320
 because you have to have them wrestle for like a lot.

1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:20.200
 To get better.

1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:21.200
 Yeah, to get better.

1:04:21.200 --> 1:04:26.200
 And then, the open question is how long does it take

1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:29.300
 to get good enough to be a human?

1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:34.520
 I don't think we understand, I don't know,

1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:37.680
 I don't think you understand how hard wrestling is.

1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:38.520
 Yeah.

1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:39.840
 Like, is it a really hard problem?

1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:41.440
 Like, what's harder, chess or wrestling?

1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:42.640
 Wrestling, by far.

1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:43.480
 Not even close.

1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:45.600
 That's, yeah, that's the sense I have.

1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:48.560
 So, because there's an infinite amount of moves, right?

1:04:48.560 --> 1:04:50.720
 And possibilities, so once I shoot the same leg,

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:52.960
 now you have X amount of choices.

1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:54.840
 Once you make your choice, now I have a choice,

1:04:54.840 --> 1:04:56.040
 X amount of choices.

1:04:56.040 --> 1:04:58.180
 Now you have X amount of choices on the defense,

1:04:58.180 --> 1:04:59.760
 and we can just keep going back and forth, right?

1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:01.300
 And this number becomes.

1:05:01.300 --> 1:05:02.760
 Yeah, but the same happens with chess.

1:05:02.760 --> 1:05:04.160
 Correct, but then in wrestling,

1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:08.100
 you have to make these movements very instantaneously,

1:05:08.100 --> 1:05:09.040
 right, because if I shoot a single leg,

1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:11.000
 I'm not gonna wait and say, what's your defense?

1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:11.840
 Yeah.

1:05:11.840 --> 1:05:12.660
 Right, you have to be instantaneously.

1:05:12.660 --> 1:05:15.320
 And then, also, again, based on the force and the vectors

1:05:15.320 --> 1:05:19.160
 and the angles, you have to calculate that and adjust.

1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:20.880
 So really, you know, if you're saying,

1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:21.900
 well, I can shoot a single leg,

1:05:21.900 --> 1:05:24.800
 it's not like moving the chess, it's not one move, right?

1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:27.120
 If you want to talk about different forces and stuff,

1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:29.140
 it could be hundreds or thousands of different moves

1:05:29.140 --> 1:05:30.600
 based on how hard I shoot it,

1:05:30.600 --> 1:05:32.440
 the angle, the direction, all of those things.

1:05:32.440 --> 1:05:33.360
 Yeah, but wait a minute.

1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:35.880
 So, robots can do this kind of stuff really fast.

1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:38.880
 People probably know the physiology of this,

1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:41.720
 but the reaction speed for a human

1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:44.160
 is maybe 100 milliseconds, something like that, I don't know,

1:05:44.160 --> 1:05:49.160
 from sensation to, like, from the signal traveling

1:05:49.340 --> 1:05:52.160
 up to your brain and down, I don't know what that number is,

1:05:52.160 --> 1:05:56.340
 but robots certainly could do it way faster.

1:05:56.340 --> 1:06:00.000
 You would actually have to, like, constrain the speed.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.720
 Well, so the robots are already killing the chess people,

1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:04.840
 right, so, yeah, theoretically,

1:06:04.840 --> 1:06:06.280
 they could eventually beat wrestlers,

1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:08.680
 but you asked what was harder, wrestling or chess.

1:06:08.680 --> 1:06:10.200
 Yeah, and I think wrestling is,

1:06:10.200 --> 1:06:12.240
 because of the time component in it

1:06:12.240 --> 1:06:15.880
 and the physicality of, you know,

1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:18.120
 is it this force or that force, you know?

1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:20.800
 Because if I'm gonna say we're in a seatbelt side by side,

1:06:20.800 --> 1:06:23.000
 right, a wrestling seatbelt, not in Jiu Jitsu,

1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:25.960
 based on the pressure you're giving me,

1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:27.520
 I might do a bunch of different things, right?

1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:29.580
 And so, like, to an untrained eye,

1:06:30.440 --> 1:06:32.980
 they might both look like the same thing from you.

1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:35.720
 To a trained feel, it's like, well, in one case,

1:06:35.720 --> 1:06:37.080
 it's really evident I should go this way,

1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:39.240
 in another case, it's really evident I should go that way.

1:06:39.240 --> 1:06:43.080
 So the other thing to consider, just like with chess,

1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:47.360
 the AI systems, so human versus human

1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:49.000
 play a certain way together.

1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:50.240
 They actually haven't considered

1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:52.940
 a really large number of strategies

1:06:52.940 --> 1:06:54.400
 that AI systems discover.

1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:55.960
 So one possibility with a robot,

1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:58.680
 they'll discover certain ties and certain takedowns.

1:06:58.680 --> 1:07:00.000
 That's what I'm saying.

1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:03.120
 That, like, will dominate no matter what the human does.

1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:04.580
 You think that, so you think there's that,

1:07:04.580 --> 1:07:06.280
 so this, I mean, this is what I'm talking about

1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:07.920
 with the wrestling, so fun is there's,

1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:11.720
 even after 80, 90 years, there's this continuous evolution.

1:07:11.720 --> 1:07:12.560
 So you think.

1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:13.800
 There'll be some, like, low single type thing,

1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:15.840
 like John Smith type of situation.

1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:17.520
 Well, like a down block go behind is something

1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:20.560
 that has really, I would say really in the last fiveish years

1:07:20.560 --> 1:07:21.720
 has really been evolved.

1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:22.620
 What's a go behind?

1:07:22.620 --> 1:07:24.600
 Down block go behind, so when you shoot,

1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:27.040
 well, they just, head inside or head outside matters,

1:07:27.040 --> 1:07:28.400
 but there's one for both.

1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:31.160
 You shoot at me, essentially, I take my leg, boom.

1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:33.320
 And then, so that was kind of in existence

1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:34.320
 when I was in college, right?

1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:35.600
 You down block them and you stop,

1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:38.120
 but usually you hit on this side of their head, right?

1:07:38.120 --> 1:07:40.480
 And now, immediately, you shoot and I attack that shoulder

1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:43.160
 and then I start hitting a go behind on you, right?

1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:47.080
 And so, like, that in its current incarnation,

1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:49.080
 it absolutely wasn't around when I was in college.

1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:51.840
 I would say it probably became popular

1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:53.060
 five to seven years ago.

1:07:53.060 --> 1:07:56.320
 So yeah, there's these big things that are happening.

1:07:56.320 --> 1:07:57.400
 Now I really wanna roll back

1:07:57.400 --> 1:07:58.560
 because I wanna be ahead of the game.

1:07:58.560 --> 1:08:00.360
 I wanna know what I'm missing.

1:08:00.360 --> 1:08:02.760
 I mean, one interesting thing you have with Alpha Zero

1:08:02.760 --> 1:08:07.760
 that plays chess is it sacrifices pieces

1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:09.480
 much more than humans do.

1:08:09.480 --> 1:08:11.080
 So it'll give you a piece.

1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:12.800
 And not only does it give you a piece,

1:08:12.800 --> 1:08:17.800
 it will wait a bunch of moves before it makes you pay.

1:08:18.320 --> 1:08:19.160
 So.

1:08:19.160 --> 1:08:21.120
 Because it knows that that's better for the long term.

1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:21.960
 Long term.

1:08:21.960 --> 1:08:23.680
 So like humans rarely sacrifice

1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:25.880
 without getting the piece back,

1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:28.560
 like two or three moves after.

1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:31.280
 Alpha Zero can wait like five moves.

1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:35.520
 So basically you'll have, potentially with wrestling,

1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:38.440
 you might have a robot that like puts itself

1:08:38.440 --> 1:08:40.840
 in bad positions, but in a certain kind of way

1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:42.680
 then that will actually turn out.

1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:45.080
 Lures the opponent in to trap.

1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:45.920
 Exactly.

1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:46.760
 That's what my style is based on.

1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:47.580
 Exactly.

1:08:47.580 --> 1:08:50.880
 You basically narrow, one thing to do

1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:52.460
 is you narrow the set of choices.

1:08:52.460 --> 1:08:53.880
 You put yourself in a bad position,

1:08:53.880 --> 1:08:55.200
 but it narrows the set of choices.

1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:56.400
 For them, because they're not used to it.

1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:58.120
 Yeah, they're not used to it.

1:08:58.120 --> 1:09:02.320
 And then you drag them into your, yeah.

1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:05.280
 So, but there's also, the problem is

1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:06.880
 there's mechanical issues.

1:09:06.880 --> 1:09:09.040
 Like it's actually just difficult to build robots

1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:11.320
 that are able to sense,

1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:14.360
 because we have sensation throughout our body, yeah.

1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:16.020
 It's just difficult to build that kind of robot.

1:09:16.020 --> 1:09:16.860
 It's expensive.

1:09:16.860 --> 1:09:19.600
 You start talking about multimillion dollars,

1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:21.820
 and then people start asking you questions.

1:09:21.820 --> 1:09:23.560
 Why did you invest all of this money?

1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:26.920
 They wanna see what moves they do, duh, hello.

1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:28.360
 It could be a better investment.

1:09:28.360 --> 1:09:29.680
 Okay.

1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:31.100
 So I mentioned John Smith.

1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:33.360
 He is, if people don't know,

1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:36.320
 one of the great wrestlers, wrestling coaches ever.

1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:37.920
 He's also creative like you.

1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:39.680
 He spoke really highly of you.

1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:40.720
 What do you think about that guy?

1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:42.200
 Did you guys ever work together?

1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:43.160
 Not really.

1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:45.000
 So you know what, when I was a senior,

1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000
 and I had the people wrestling in my head,

1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.840
 I was lucky enough to be doing,

1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:51.720
 I was pretty much a graduate,

1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:53.760
 so I did an independent study with the sports psychology.

1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:55.680
 I was potentially going to go to grad school

1:09:55.680 --> 1:09:56.520
 for sports psychology.

1:09:56.520 --> 1:09:57.680
 Well, I actually did nine credits,

1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:00.440
 and then I just decided I didn't want to do it anymore.

1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:02.880
 I continued learning on my own.

1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:05.200
 But I had an independent study with the guy

1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:07.800
 who's the head of USA Track and Field Sports Psych.

1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:09.480
 So here was the class was,

1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:11.520
 I got to go sit down and talk with him for an hour,

1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:13.320
 and he was like fascinated by me.

1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:14.900
 So he didn't let me do homework.

1:10:14.900 --> 1:10:16.480
 It was like the greatest three credits ever.

1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:17.340
 We just talked.

1:10:17.340 --> 1:10:18.180
 I learned so much.

1:10:18.180 --> 1:10:19.200
 It was so awesome.

1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:22.480
 But so I started, so one time it came up,

1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:24.920
 I had these robot, or people wrestling in my head,

1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:26.800
 and he said, well, who else do you think,

1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:27.820
 but John Smith happened.

1:10:27.820 --> 1:10:29.080
 So I went and got John Smith's number,

1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:29.920
 and I called him and said,

1:10:29.920 --> 1:10:32.520
 hey, you ever had these people wrestling in your head?

1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:34.680
 And he said, yeah, but as soon as I stopped coaching,

1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:35.640
 they went away.

1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:36.920
 Same thing happened to me.

1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:38.680
 As soon as I started coaching, they went away.

1:10:38.680 --> 1:10:40.540
 So if I really force myself now,

1:10:40.540 --> 1:10:43.160
 and I'm like, I see something in practice,

1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:44.200
 and it's really higher level,

1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:45.240
 because high school wrestling,

1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:46.560
 I don't want to, maybe I feel bad,

1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:48.400
 but it's a little bit lower level, right?

1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:50.560
 So if Keegan, for example, who won the tournament,

1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:54.040
 if he's struggling with a problem or asks me a question,

1:10:54.040 --> 1:10:57.640
 and I can force myself to see the bodies moving

1:10:57.640 --> 1:10:58.960
 and think about it again,

1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:00.380
 kind of like I was in early age,

1:11:00.380 --> 1:11:02.840
 but it won't just flow there anymore.

1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:05.560
 So he said it went away, and for me, it went away also.

1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:11.440
 By the way, if we can pause on the bodies in your head,

1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:16.620
 how are they generating new ideas?

1:11:16.620 --> 1:11:18.000
 Are they just kind of?

1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.160
 I don't know.

1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:20.240
 You tell me.

1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:24.000
 So it's just, they're just scrambling in your head?

1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:27.000
 It would be specifically based on a problem

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.280
 I was struggling with, or a specific position, you know?

1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:32.800
 It goes in for a single, and then go from there.

1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:34.940
 Yeah, so I'm sitting in geography class,

1:11:34.940 --> 1:11:38.240
 and I don't have to work that hard, because it's easy, right?

1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:40.720
 And yeah, I'm just sitting there acting

1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:41.760
 like I'm looking at the board,

1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:42.760
 and these guys are wrestling,

1:11:42.760 --> 1:11:43.960
 and I'm watching them wrestle,

1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:47.980
 and yeah, sometimes they come up with a really good solution.

1:11:47.980 --> 1:11:52.360
 Is there somebody you look up to style wise?

1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:57.200
 Like Gable, John Smith, all these legend status people.

1:11:57.200 --> 1:11:59.560
 Probably Gable, or it's a Gable.

1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:01.040
 John Smith, but after the fact.

1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:03.380
 So the problem with wrestling in my era

1:12:03.380 --> 1:12:04.760
 was you couldn't watch it.

1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:06.240
 There was no access, right?

1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:07.560
 It wasn't really available.

1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:10.560
 Even if you want to say, go find a bunch of John Smith,

1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:11.740
 man, they're kind of hard to find, right?

1:12:11.740 --> 1:12:13.080
 There's a couple of them on YouTube,

1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:15.040
 but I've obviously seen all of those,

1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:18.080
 but in my era, there really wasn't any of it.

1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:19.560
 So it was hard to be a fan of something,

1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:23.200
 and that's why wrestling has, the fans are going like this,

1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:25.740
 because now you can flip on the Flow app,

1:12:25.740 --> 1:12:29.340
 and you can watch something that's happening in Europe, right?

1:12:29.340 --> 1:12:32.640
 We can do this easily, so we can be a fan of people.

1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:35.420
 So now I'm more a fan of wrestling than I was then,

1:12:35.420 --> 1:12:37.560
 because there just was no access.

1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:39.040
 So now I can watch someone I like,

1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:41.080
 and say, oh shit, that guy's wrestling.

1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:43.600
 Oh, boom, I flip my phone on, I watch them wrestle.

1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:44.440
 That type of thing.

1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:47.000
 You know, and a quick rant.

1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:50.600
 It's really frustrating that you can't watch the Olympics.

1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:52.680
 Oh my god, it's so frustrating.

1:12:52.680 --> 1:12:55.920
 I've been, I think I'm gonna go to war on this point.

1:12:55.920 --> 1:12:57.760
 Go to NBC's headquarters, I'll go with you.

1:12:57.760 --> 1:12:59.720
 You got a soldier here.

1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:02.480
 I was talking to Jimmy, Jimmy Pedro,

1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:04.000
 he was surprised by this, too.

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.680
 Most matches, you can't see, even,

1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:10.640
 you talk about like a comeback, Gable Steelers,

1:13:10.640 --> 1:13:13.760
 and you can't see the full match.

1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:15.840
 You get like a crappy highlight.

1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:19.600
 So the two biggest things, and really the three,

1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:21.280
 the NCAA championships on ESPN,

1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:25.080
 the Olympic trials are on NBC, and the Olympics are on NBC.

1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:27.400
 And these companies are so big,

1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:28.880
 they don't have a department dedicated

1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:31.960
 to selling the rights to that footage, right?

1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:34.120
 So the rights to wrestling footage,

1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:35.560
 which no one really cares all that much about,

1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:38.600
 except a niche, are the exact same as track and field,

1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:40.860
 or basketball in the Olympics.

1:13:40.860 --> 1:13:44.600
 So yes, all of this stuff is completely inaccessible to us.

1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:47.200
 The NCAAs, the Olympic trials, and the Olympics,

1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:49.520
 you can't go watch old film on it, it sucks.

1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:50.360
 So yeah.

1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:51.200
 Yeah, old, the current film.

1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:52.640
 Yeah.

1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:54.600
 So you can't even watch the Gable match?

1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:55.680
 The Gable Steelers, no.

1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:57.440
 They did a, you know, they do something

1:13:57.440 --> 1:13:58.960
 that annoys the fuck out of me.

1:13:58.960 --> 1:13:59.800
 What?

1:13:59.800 --> 1:14:04.480
 Okay, they do like a three or two minute highlight.

1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:09.000
 So it's like they capture the most important thing,

1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.840
 but it's all about the buildup.

1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:12.680
 Yeah, yeah.

1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:15.800
 It's like that very beginning when you step on the mat,

1:14:15.800 --> 1:14:19.280
 and the nerves, and you walk out, and like that,

1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:22.720
 I mean, I don't know, you miss,

1:14:22.720 --> 1:14:26.720
 then when the triumph happens, or the heartbreak happens,

1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:28.600
 it has that much more power.

1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:30.800
 Yeah, if you want to go to war with NBC or ESPN,

1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:32.120
 I'm happy to join that.

1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:34.960
 I think I'm fortunate it's the IOC.

1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:37.600
 Well, I mean, is the IOC on that?

1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:40.240
 IOC is selling, for the Olympics,

1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:41.920
 is the one that's making.

1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:43.560
 Well, so NBC broadcasts,

1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:45.600
 so they obviously have the live rights.

1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:47.400
 You would think they would have recorded,

1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:48.880
 if they, I mean, they're the ones recording it,

1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:50.640
 you would think they keep the rights when you think.

1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:53.680
 No, no, no, they're getting a license of it.

1:14:53.680 --> 1:14:55.440
 They're getting exclusive like license,

1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:57.640
 but like the, you know, for example,

1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:02.520
 I've had this, I talked to Travis Stevens, the Judo player,

1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:06.720
 and there's a really sort of famous match,

1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:11.600
 just a heartbreak in his career from 2012 Olympics,

1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:14.360
 where he goes against a German, Oli Bischoff, whatever.

1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:16.600
 It's a 20 minute match to go to war,

1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:18.320
 and that's not available anywhere,

1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:22.800
 but it's uploaded on YouTube and set to private.

1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:26.200
 The reason I know this is on the IOC channel.

1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:28.400
 So they've uploaded all of these matches.

1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:29.800
 They have it and put it up.

1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:33.200
 So actually, so my Olympic match, the one I won,

1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:37.040
 got put public, and so I don't know if it was private,

1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:39.120
 it got put up on YouTube.

1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:42.040
 I was allergic to it the week of my Jake Paul fight.

1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:42.880
 It was so dumb.

1:15:42.880 --> 1:15:46.400
 I'm like, why, this is 13 years later, this is bullshit.

1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:47.800
 Like this should have been up.

1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:51.600
 So, I mean, okay, so what about Olympic trials footage?

1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:54.080
 That has to be the USOC then or NBC?

1:15:55.720 --> 1:15:57.280
 So I know like, okay, so I know Flow, right?

1:15:57.280 --> 1:15:58.280
 Cause I worked with them.

1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:01.880
 I know if Flow buys your event or whatever, right?

1:16:01.880 --> 1:16:04.520
 They buy the rights, generally in the contract,

1:16:04.520 --> 1:16:06.400
 they'll have rights to both live stream it

1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:09.400
 and then use that footage at any point moving forward.

1:16:09.400 --> 1:16:12.760
 So those matches live on Flow's website.

1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:13.920
 That's why I would be surprised

1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:16.880
 if NBC didn't have something similar.

1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:19.000
 Flow does a pretty good job of providing

1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:22.080
 like a place where you can watch all these matches.

1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:23.000
 NBC does not.

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:23.840
 Does not, yeah.

1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:27.120
 And also there's an argument with Flow as well,

1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:28.680
 but certainly with Olympics.

1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:30.920
 There's a difference between what Flow does

1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:32.640
 and what the Olympics represent.

1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:33.800
 What do you mean by that?

1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:35.840
 Like it feels like the Olympics,

1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:38.080
 which is what the charter says,

1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:41.320
 should be as accessible as possible.

1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:42.160
 Yes, that's true.

1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:44.120
 Like you should really lower the barrier

1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:45.800
 for entry for the Olympics.

1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:47.040
 You know that's what the charter says,

1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:48.160
 but those people in the IOC,

1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:50.400
 these are the worst people ever.

1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:51.240
 They're very bad.

1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:52.640
 Well, they're not bad.

1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:55.720
 They just lost touch of the dream they once had

1:16:55.720 --> 1:16:56.880
 when they joined the IOC.

1:16:56.880 --> 1:16:58.920
 Well, I would argue all the way back

1:16:58.920 --> 1:17:01.160
 that these are rich fat cats who,

1:17:01.160 --> 1:17:02.760
 like I get so mad about the NCAA,

1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:07.080
 which finally now got rid of this bullshit term amateurism.

1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:08.720
 It's like, well, there's some holy grail

1:17:08.720 --> 1:17:11.120
 where you can't make money to be an amateur athlete,

1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:12.800
 but the people who own the IOC

1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:15.320
 or the people who own the institutions,

1:17:15.320 --> 1:17:17.040
 college institutions are making boatloads of money

1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:18.320
 off of you, that's crap.

1:17:19.160 --> 1:17:24.160
 So you competed, like you said, at the 2008 Olympics.

1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:26.280
 Did you believe you can win gold?

1:17:26.280 --> 1:17:27.840
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:30.480
 So your mental game was on point.

1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:31.400
 Yeah, I was ready.

1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:33.400
 So what went wrong?

1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:34.800
 This wasn't good enough.

1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:35.760
 That was what I said.

1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:36.600
 Yeah.

1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:38.320
 Yeah, I mean, so at that point in time,

1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:41.760
 it was my first year of international competition.

1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:43.320
 So when I came out in 2007,

1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:45.280
 it was my first time making 74 kilograms,

1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:47.520
 which is pretty small for me.

1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:50.840
 I had some failures, but then quickly I turned that around

1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:53.440
 and I was having success in America.

1:17:53.440 --> 1:17:54.800
 I was beating everyone.

1:17:54.800 --> 1:17:57.080
 I don't wanna say easy, but yeah,

1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.400
 I was doing really well.

1:18:00.400 --> 1:18:02.360
 I went international one time,

1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:05.680
 and there was one match I got cheated on.

1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:07.840
 The Russians, they're cheaters.

1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:09.600
 Excuse you, Ukraine, not Russia.

1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:13.560
 I lost one real match where I actually lost,

1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:15.520
 and it was to Denis Sarguch,

1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:17.080
 who would go on to win three world titles,

1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:18.920
 but he was behind the T of that year,

1:18:18.920 --> 1:18:20.160
 and it was competitive.

1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:23.800
 So I knew, okay, I'm going with the best guys in the world.

1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:27.640
 I beat a bunch of other guys who were good

1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:29.600
 and had passed decent results.

1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:31.960
 So I knew I was right there.

1:18:31.960 --> 1:18:35.040
 Unfortunately, I ran into this guy, Ivan Fundora,

1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:38.120
 and I had someone do scouting reports for him,

1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:38.960
 actually my high school coach,

1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:41.520
 who now coaches for our academy, John Messimerich,

1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:43.520
 and Fundora was the worst stylistic matchup.

1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:46.880
 I got him, and I lost him second round.

1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:49.000
 So I wasn't good enough.

1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:50.960
 Had I decided to keep wrestling,

1:18:50.960 --> 1:18:52.040
 I probably would have gotten better,

1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:53.840
 but at that point, I just wasn't in the cards.

1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:56.440
 So in your division was, like you said, it's the T of,

1:18:56.440 --> 1:19:01.120
 if I said it's the T of, that guy's special.

1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:02.240
 He's very special.

1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:04.120
 So that would be my other guy that you asked earlier

1:19:04.120 --> 1:19:06.880
 who I enjoyed watching, and that was a guy I,

1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:08.200
 again, it was kind of after the fact

1:19:08.200 --> 1:19:10.400
 because it was hard to access footage,

1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:12.280
 but he was a lot of fun to watch.

1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:14.040
 What do you think made him great?

1:19:15.520 --> 1:19:17.280
 A lot of people talk about him

1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:20.280
 as potentially one of the greatest ever.

1:19:20.280 --> 1:19:21.120
 Absolutely.

1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:22.920
 I mean, so he won six and three,

1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:26.720
 six Worlds, three Olympics, nine total,

1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:29.120
 which there's only one or two people above that.

1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:32.960
 So again, it was hard to watch any live footage of him,

1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:35.360
 but from what I've seen, his feel is different.

1:19:35.360 --> 1:19:36.960
 He was just ahead of his time,

1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:38.480
 and the feel and the touch he had

1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:40.400
 for certain moves and different things,

1:19:40.400 --> 1:19:43.200
 because obviously physically he's kind of unimposing.

1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:45.720
 He's taller than skinnier,

1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:47.760
 which it can work in wrestling,

1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:50.560
 but it is by less represented.

1:19:50.560 --> 1:19:54.520
 So yeah, he was special, so good.

1:19:54.520 --> 1:19:57.560
 Do you take any inspiration from,

1:19:58.520 --> 1:20:00.200
 let's talk about Dagestan in general.

1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:02.680
 What do you think makes those wrestlers great?

1:20:02.680 --> 1:20:04.120
 Yeah, it's fascinating.

1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:06.280
 Have you read the book, The Talent Code?

1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:07.200
 Yeah. It's great.

1:20:07.200 --> 1:20:09.120
 And that kind of talks about these talent hotspots

1:20:09.120 --> 1:20:09.960
 all around the world.

1:20:09.960 --> 1:20:12.040
 So now obviously with our wrestling academies,

1:20:12.040 --> 1:20:15.480
 we try to take some lessons from that and apply it.

1:20:15.480 --> 1:20:17.320
 I got to assume, they didn't cover Dagestan

1:20:17.320 --> 1:20:19.200
 in that book specifically,

1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:22.120
 but I got to assume a lot of the same principles

1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:26.400
 that are in that book apply to Dagestan in wrestling.

1:20:26.400 --> 1:20:29.720
 They did South Korea and women's golf.

1:20:29.720 --> 1:20:31.440
 They did Curacao in baseball.

1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:32.560
 They picked a lot of these other places

1:20:32.560 --> 1:20:33.960
 that were really elite.

1:20:33.960 --> 1:20:36.760
 I think it was maybe Moscow in women's tennis also.

1:20:37.840 --> 1:20:39.600
 So I think all of these things

1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:43.280
 that make any group great organization

1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:45.400
 is probably the same things that's happening there.

1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:47.640
 Well, the hardship, I mean,

1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:49.440
 is there something specific about wrestling

1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:53.400
 that can create so many great champions?

1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:55.400
 From that area?

1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:58.960
 So obviously they all love the big deal.

1:20:58.960 --> 1:21:01.200
 Wrestling specifically is a big deal there.

1:21:01.200 --> 1:21:03.720
 They do Sambo also, obviously.

1:21:03.720 --> 1:21:05.920
 So that's part of it is a lot of the kids are doing it.

1:21:05.920 --> 1:21:08.640
 They obviously are rough tumble, tough life.

1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:09.840
 Getting a lot of fights.

1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:12.520
 And then I think that also that a lot of them,

1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:14.320
 it is a way out right there.

1:21:14.320 --> 1:21:16.800
 The elite level athletes in that part of the world,

1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:18.680
 from my understanding, are really well compensated

1:21:18.680 --> 1:21:21.280
 compared to what the average person makes

1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:22.200
 and they're treated really well.

1:21:22.200 --> 1:21:23.960
 So people see it as a way out.

1:21:23.960 --> 1:21:25.800
 Whereas like, and then honestly,

1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:27.800
 if America is getting better,

1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:29.520
 but in 2008, the reason I went to MMA

1:21:29.520 --> 1:21:32.440
 was because I didn't want to be poor my whole life.

1:21:32.440 --> 1:21:33.280
 You know what I'm saying?

1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:34.120
 It sucked.

1:21:34.120 --> 1:21:35.040
 It's like, well, I don't want to make $20,000

1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:37.120
 for the next 48 years.

1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:39.040
 So I'm going to go do something else.

1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:41.080
 If I could have made, even I didn't need to be rich, right?

1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:43.560
 If I could have made $100,000 or $70,000 wrestling,

1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:46.200
 I probably would have kept wrestling.

1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:48.200
 So I think there's factors

1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:51.000
 and obviously now they have a really like,

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.880
 a bunch of really good people in one area.

1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:55.400
 So there's probably, and it's been going on for a long time.

1:21:55.400 --> 1:21:57.120
 So there's probably been a bunch of like adults

1:21:57.120 --> 1:21:59.640
 and coaches that are coming back and helping that progress.

1:21:59.640 --> 1:22:01.640
 So yeah, a lot of those things that happen.

1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:04.240
 So I'm definitely going to travel there to talk to them

1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:05.280
 because I can speak Russian.

1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:06.600
 It makes it very,

1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:11.640
 makes me uniquely qualified to.

1:22:13.720 --> 1:22:15.240
 My brother can speak a little bit of Russian.

1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:16.960
 Your brother can? Yeah.

1:22:16.960 --> 1:22:19.680
 Okay, like a little bit like he swears and.

1:22:19.680 --> 1:22:20.520
 No, no, no, no.

1:22:20.520 --> 1:22:23.920
 Like he would, oh man, don't, don't make me oversell.

1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:25.720
 I think he would be able to have a conversation with you.

1:22:25.720 --> 1:22:26.560
 I think.

1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:27.600
 Okay.

1:22:27.600 --> 1:22:28.480
 Probably not like you.

1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:31.160
 What's the, what's the reason he knows Russian?

1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:33.040
 I don't know why he got obsessed with languages.

1:22:33.040 --> 1:22:35.000
 And so his college degree is actually,

1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:37.200
 what are they called?

1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:38.680
 Interdis, where you have three minors.

1:22:38.680 --> 1:22:43.120
 So he had a minor in Russian, a minor in Spanish

1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:46.200
 and maybe Japanese, I'm messing up.

1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:48.320
 It's definitely, it's Russian and Spanish for sure.

1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:49.720
 I don't know what the third one is.

1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:52.840
 No, but yeah, Dagestan, it's really fascinating.

1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:57.000
 But the emphasis on technique, the lighter drilling,

1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.040
 like they don't really go super hard.

1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:01.320
 Yeah, and I only spent a couple, so I was there,

1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:03.280
 I was in Vladikavkaz in 2008.

1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:04.920
 That was where the World Cup was.

1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:06.960
 We had to train there for like two days afterwards.

1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:10.480
 So I didn't get to dig deep,

1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:14.160
 dig deep into what was going on or anything.

1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:19.160
 But yeah, I mean, I think sparring is very beneficial

1:23:19.280 --> 1:23:24.280
 for wrestling, not like sparring MMA is we fight, right?

1:23:24.440 --> 1:23:27.440
 Sparring in wrestling is, so I always just describe it

1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:29.360
 to be really simple.

1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:31.880
 If we're drilling, it's relatively 0% resistance.

1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:33.840
 If we're going as hard as we can, that's 100%.

1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:36.400
 There's all this gray area in the middle that's sparring,

1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:37.240
 right?

1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:40.760
 So if you have a good relationship,

1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:43.360
 like college me and my brother, we could just go

1:23:43.360 --> 1:23:45.280
 and we know where each other's at.

1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:46.520
 We don't even have to talk about it, right?

1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:47.960
 But like in my wrestling club, I'll say,

1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:51.500
 okay, hey, I want you guys to go 50% in this position.

1:23:51.500 --> 1:23:54.240
 Or I want the high crotch guy, I want him to shoot

1:23:54.240 --> 1:23:56.600
 and this is for him, so I want him to go 70.

1:23:56.600 --> 1:23:58.240
 And the defensive guy, I want you to go 40.

1:23:58.240 --> 1:23:59.960
 So you're not supposed to be trying to win here.

1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:00.800
 You're gonna go a little later.

1:24:00.800 --> 1:24:03.480
 I want you to give him some looks, you know?

1:24:03.480 --> 1:24:05.280
 So I think it has really taken hold in America.

1:24:05.280 --> 1:24:06.960
 I think it's really beneficial for success.

1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:09.480
 And I think that's, I mean, America's doing better

1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:11.000
 than we've ever done historically.

1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:13.200
 Well, that 70 and 40, that's like an art form

1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:14.360
 to find that right place,

1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:17.800
 because the really good people I've trained with,

1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:22.040
 they go much closer to 100% speed wise,

1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:27.360
 but without forcing things the way you would

1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:28.200
 when you're going.

1:24:28.200 --> 1:24:30.720
 It's some weird combination of things that,

1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:33.320
 like if you truly earn a technique,

1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:36.520
 then you're given that technique.

1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:38.360
 But if you don't, you don't.

1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:42.280
 And then it becomes much less injury prone.

1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:44.600
 It becomes somehow more fun, more dynamic.

1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:46.480
 You don't get stuck in positions.

1:24:46.480 --> 1:24:48.560
 It's just a lot of movement.

1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:51.600
 Yeah, the one thing, so you and John talked about,

1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:54.080
 like different ways to learn and get better.

1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:55.640
 And so I think John obviously innovated

1:24:55.640 --> 1:24:57.360
 within the sport of jiu jitsu.

1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:03.560
 And so for us, and maybe there's a differentiator for us.

1:25:03.560 --> 1:25:04.400
 I think about it like.

1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:05.280
 Sorry to interrupt.

1:25:05.280 --> 1:25:07.160
 You have this academy and you sent me this plan.

1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:10.040
 They have like a really well thought through plan

1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:12.280
 for how to develop a good wrestler.

1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:16.960
 So I think it's, for me there's four categories, right?

1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:20.240
 There's the teaching, which is like, you don't know shit.

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:22.400
 You're coming in and I'm showing you the move

1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:24.680
 and you're literally going out there and you're trying.

1:25:24.680 --> 1:25:26.240
 To me, that's not even drilling.

1:25:26.240 --> 1:25:29.480
 That's like teaching, like you're trying to learn something.

1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:32.360
 So obviously in someone's earlier periods,

1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:34.920
 they're spending a lot of time in that phase

1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:36.400
 because they literally don't even know

1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:38.680
 how to move their bodies the right way.

1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:40.920
 Once you learn the skill, then there's the drilling

1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:43.200
 because you absolutely have to get those reps

1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:46.160
 to become really proficient in that movement

1:25:46.160 --> 1:25:48.240
 and then the sparring and then the live, right?

1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:51.400
 And so like, I think obviously by the time you get

1:25:51.400 --> 1:25:53.800
 to the kind of, I don't wanna say end point, right?

1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:58.320
 But further on, the time you spend teaching is so,

1:25:58.320 --> 1:25:59.560
 I don't wanna say, I'm sorry,

1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:02.520
 in the learning teaching phase is not insignificant,

1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:04.040
 but it's so much smaller because to someone

1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:06.080
 who's really good, who I've coached for 10 years,

1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:08.640
 I don't have to give this big long drawn out explanation.

1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:11.600
 I just have to say, hey, move your hand a little differently

1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:13.000
 or just do this, right?

1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:14.400
 We don't have to spend any time there.

1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:16.400
 So I think that's like something that consumes

1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:19.920
 for the younger kids, say five through 12 or 13,

1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:22.600
 we're consuming a massive amount of time there

1:26:22.600 --> 1:26:24.760
 on that teaching learning phase.

1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:28.560
 And then as we get older, that time wanes a lot.

1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:30.080
 But that makes total sense, right?

1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:31.120
 Yeah.

1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:34.480
 It's funny because when you look at like jiu jitsu schools,

1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:36.920
 they spend a lot of time in the teaching learning

1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:40.160
 and then the live, like there's not enough drilling.

1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:42.240
 I like how you draw a distinction there

1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:45.680
 because it feels like you're always starting from scratch.

1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:48.840
 Like people have like very crappy short term memory.

1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:52.900
 Like they're not, like the way teaching is done

1:26:52.900 --> 1:26:55.080
 is you show a technique from scratch

1:26:55.080 --> 1:26:57.080
 and it seems disjoint.

1:26:57.080 --> 1:26:58.840
 It is for sure, especially if you have a class

1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:00.280
 that's been with you for a while,

1:27:00.280 --> 1:27:01.400
 you don't have to start from scratch.

1:27:01.400 --> 1:27:04.200
 You can say, hey, let's focus on this one little thing here

1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:07.160
 or let's, after we do this, let's do that,

1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:09.280
 and you kind of put, start putting it all together.

1:27:09.280 --> 1:27:12.720
 And then with jiu jitsu, the thing that I really struggled

1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:14.020
 with was a couple of things.

1:27:14.020 --> 1:27:17.600
 It was, and this is not speaking for all the jiu jitians,

1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:19.880
 my personal experience through the sport.

1:27:19.880 --> 1:27:21.880
 And I actually found my, so when I unretired,

1:27:21.880 --> 1:27:23.680
 I found someone really great that I loved

1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:25.120
 and I really wish it was Mark Lehman.

1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:26.200
 I don't know if you know him at all.

1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:28.480
 I wish I would have found him earlier

1:27:28.480 --> 1:27:30.480
 because he was just tremendous.

1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:32.540
 But number one, there's no drilling.

1:27:32.540 --> 1:27:35.800
 So it's like, in wrestling, I can boil down to,

1:27:37.500 --> 1:27:40.640
 I can probably name you the best six moves, right?

1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:43.580
 So we need, as younger people, single leg, right?

1:27:43.580 --> 1:27:45.280
 Single leg's gonna be the most proficient takedown.

1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:47.040
 It always has been, I don't know,

1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:47.880
 probably always will be,

1:27:47.880 --> 1:27:49.820
 unless they figure out something different.

1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:52.320
 The robot.

1:27:52.320 --> 1:27:53.440
 The robot figures out something different.

1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:54.760
 We're gonna shoot a lot of single legs.

1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:55.600
 Why?

1:27:55.600 --> 1:27:56.760
 Because everyone's gonna do that, right?

1:27:56.760 --> 1:27:58.400
 We're gonna shoot a lot of single legs.

1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:02.080
 So just like, say, an armbar or some type of sweep, right?

1:28:02.080 --> 1:28:03.920
 Why can't we go get 50 reps there?

1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:06.540
 Hey, by the time I've been in your jiu jitsu school

1:28:06.540 --> 1:28:08.360
 for two years, I better know a fucking armbar.

1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:09.480
 I better know it.

1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:11.320
 So don't spend 10 minutes teaching me.

1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:12.920
 Just tell me to go hit 50 reps.

1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:14.660
 And then if, when I'm hitting my reps,

1:28:14.660 --> 1:28:16.440
 if there's something I'm doing wrong,

1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:17.960
 then just say, hey, Ben,

1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:19.280
 move your leg a little bit that way

1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:21.080
 or raise your hips up a little more, right?

1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:23.280
 Like, correct as you're drilling

1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:24.680
 so you're getting all these reps at it

1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:26.360
 so you're becoming more proficient.

1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:27.880
 And then the other thing I really struggled with was,

1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:30.160
 to your point during live,

1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:33.160
 so many times it's just this five minute go, go, go.

1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:35.240
 And that's not the most efficient way to learn

1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:37.240
 because when you have two people,

1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:39.240
 especially when they're focused on winning,

1:28:39.240 --> 1:28:41.960
 and you say go, they're gonna go to wherever they do best.

1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:43.640
 Well, if I'm trying to make you good at something,

1:28:43.640 --> 1:28:45.880
 I don't want you doing what you do best all the time.

1:28:45.880 --> 1:28:47.800
 I need you doing some other things, right?

1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:48.920
 If you have a great single leg

1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:51.020
 but you can't shoot to the other side of the body,

1:28:51.020 --> 1:28:52.780
 we need to work on that, right?

1:28:52.780 --> 1:28:54.640
 You need to start shooting the other side.

1:28:54.640 --> 1:28:56.480
 There's some sense that you,

1:28:56.480 --> 1:28:58.720
 it's not like you should be told what to work on

1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:00.920
 but you should be told to work on the thing

1:29:00.920 --> 1:29:02.320
 that you wanna work on.

1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:05.140
 Meaning, I don't know, maybe you can comment on this,

1:29:05.140 --> 1:29:07.740
 but everybody develops a different game

1:29:07.740 --> 1:29:08.780
 as you get better and better.

1:29:08.780 --> 1:29:11.600
 There's a set of things you need to be working on.

1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:14.160
 So I actually have, like when I,

1:29:14.160 --> 1:29:17.100
 especially when I'm training very seriously,

1:29:17.100 --> 1:29:21.080
 I'll have a specific technique that I have in mind

1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:24.880
 and I have a sheet of paper on the side

1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:26.800
 where I literally, my head keep counting off

1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:29.280
 how many times I put myself in that position

1:29:29.280 --> 1:29:30.320
 and pulled off the technique.

1:29:30.320 --> 1:29:32.880
 And that's all I care about in like training.

1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:35.320
 So I'll just, whatever it is,

1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:37.120
 if it's a guillotine, it's a guillotine,

1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:41.280
 arm drag, arm drag, but I wanna make sure I don't,

1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:44.140
 I love numbers, so I'll say like,

1:29:44.140 --> 1:29:47.320
 I'll make sure I get 50 arm drags

1:29:47.320 --> 1:29:49.560
 and I'm not getting off the mat until I do.

1:29:49.560 --> 1:29:50.800
 And that, you know, if it takes.

1:29:50.800 --> 1:29:53.040
 Any thrilling or live contest?

1:29:53.040 --> 1:29:55.320
 So in this, in the thing I'm describing right now

1:29:55.320 --> 1:29:56.160
 is the live contest.

1:29:56.160 --> 1:29:56.980
 Okay, got it.

1:29:56.980 --> 1:29:59.840
 But drilling, obviously, drilling.

1:29:59.840 --> 1:30:01.880
 So I feel like I can't find a drilling part,

1:30:01.880 --> 1:30:04.400
 like it's so hard to find drilling partners, even.

1:30:04.400 --> 1:30:05.540
 So boring.

1:30:05.540 --> 1:30:07.880
 It's annoying to me that this is boring.

1:30:07.880 --> 1:30:09.840
 And there's nothing more annoying to me

1:30:09.840 --> 1:30:12.160
 than the look of boredom on another person's face

1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:13.040
 when we're drilling.

1:30:13.040 --> 1:30:13.880
 Yeah.

1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:14.720
 It's like, don't you.

1:30:14.720 --> 1:30:15.560
 Do you really think drilling's that beneficial to you?

1:30:15.560 --> 1:30:16.640
 Cause you said it's a job.

1:30:16.640 --> 1:30:17.480
 Yes, yes.

1:30:17.480 --> 1:30:18.300
 Really?

1:30:18.300 --> 1:30:19.140
 And he thinks I'm an idiot, but yes.

1:30:19.140 --> 1:30:20.460
 Why?

1:30:20.460 --> 1:30:21.720
 Why am I, am I an idiot?

1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:23.520
 Or why is this drilling beneficial?

1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:26.000
 Well, let's go with two trick questions.

1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:28.200
 Why is it so beneficial?

1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:33.200
 I think for me, it's, there's a meditative aspect to it

1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:36.880
 where the more you drill,

1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:40.960
 the more you start noticing the details.

1:30:40.960 --> 1:30:43.720
 Let me push back a little bit here.

1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:44.800
 I'm not going to push back all the way.

1:30:44.800 --> 1:30:47.200
 Cause every time, if I was wrestling,

1:30:47.200 --> 1:30:49.680
 I'll warm up my head, crotch, shin, leg, whatever, right?

1:30:49.680 --> 1:30:51.760
 But even, so say like at a high level

1:30:51.760 --> 1:30:53.960
 when I'm really wrestling, say 10 years ago,

1:30:55.060 --> 1:30:56.760
 even during that drill portion,

1:30:56.760 --> 1:30:58.480
 if we talk about the resistance of our opponent

1:30:58.480 --> 1:31:00.040
 from zero to 100,

1:31:01.760 --> 1:31:04.000
 it's very likely that my partner at that point,

1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:05.480
 and this is people I'm really comfortable with,

1:31:05.480 --> 1:31:07.360
 they're probably at least going 20 or 30, right?

1:31:07.360 --> 1:31:09.800
 They're probably giving me a certain look with the sprawl

1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:11.640
 or, you know, I got to get through their hands.

1:31:11.640 --> 1:31:13.040
 If I don't set it up right,

1:31:13.040 --> 1:31:14.880
 they might put their arm down, right?

1:31:14.880 --> 1:31:16.960
 So it's like, we are drilling

1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:19.480
 cause we're wrestling at a really low resistance level,

1:31:19.480 --> 1:31:20.680
 but there's a little bit of sparring.

1:31:20.680 --> 1:31:21.520
 Oh yeah, yeah.

1:31:21.520 --> 1:31:22.760
 The 20%, the 20, yeah, yeah.

1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:24.600
 Yeah, so that's not really drilling.

1:31:24.600 --> 1:31:25.640
 Cause I think it's drilling.

1:31:25.640 --> 1:31:27.200
 I think literally you're shooting

1:31:27.200 --> 1:31:28.360
 and I'm just going boom, I'm like,

1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:31.120
 show me your dummy, boom, boom, boom, boom type of thing.

1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:32.800
 No, but it's very hard to be a dummy

1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:35.400
 that doesn't do 20%, so you're going to do 20%.

1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:37.440
 Yeah, that's so, so yes, that's 20%.

1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:38.260
 But.

1:31:38.260 --> 1:31:40.080
 So that's like sparring a little bit then.

1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:41.800
 No, but they're not really resisting.

1:31:41.800 --> 1:31:43.600
 They're just giving you the right frame.

1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:46.280
 They're giving you the right like movement

1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:49.900
 and they're being an intelligent dummy, essentially.

1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:53.120
 I mean, but also like the really important component

1:31:53.120 --> 1:31:56.320
 of this is you pick the techniques for which is beneficial.

1:31:56.320 --> 1:31:59.600
 If the technique is, has dynamic elements to it,

1:31:59.600 --> 1:32:02.160
 you don't want to be doing that with,

1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.520
 I'm saying like there's certain moves

1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:08.140
 and I like those moves and I select the game base

1:32:08.140 --> 1:32:08.980
 in those moves.

1:32:08.980 --> 1:32:10.600
 So are you drilling to get better

1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:12.300
 or are you drilling just to work out?

1:32:12.300 --> 1:32:13.700
 No, to get better.

1:32:13.700 --> 1:32:14.600
 That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1:32:14.600 --> 1:32:17.800
 I believe you can become like exceptionally good

1:32:17.800 --> 1:32:19.180
 very fast by drilling.

1:32:19.180 --> 1:32:20.020
 But how?

1:32:22.280 --> 1:32:24.600
 First of all, let me ask you an empirical question.

1:32:24.600 --> 1:32:28.720
 Let me, have you actually drilled 10,000 times

1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:29.560
 a particular move?

1:32:29.560 --> 1:32:30.400
 Millions.

1:32:31.800 --> 1:32:32.640
 You haven't drilled millions.

1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:34.640
 Hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands likely.

1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:36.760
 I think you're just saying numbers.

1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:37.600
 I don't think you know what 100,000.

1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:39.040
 The numbers are freaking astronomical.

1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:39.960
 It's way more than 10,000.

1:32:39.960 --> 1:32:41.920
 I don't think you know what 100,000 feels like.

1:32:41.920 --> 1:32:42.940
 Dude, there was a 10 year period

1:32:42.940 --> 1:32:44.080
 where I wrestled every single day.

1:32:44.080 --> 1:32:47.720
 That's 3,000 days, so you're telling me 10,000,

1:32:47.720 --> 1:32:48.760
 that's only three of them a day.

1:32:48.760 --> 1:32:50.720
 I do way more than that.

1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:51.560
 Three of them.

1:32:51.560 --> 1:32:52.380
 Probably 30 of them a day.

1:32:52.380 --> 1:32:53.560
 That's 100,000.

1:32:53.560 --> 1:32:54.400
 Yeah.

1:32:54.400 --> 1:32:56.080
 Yeah, hundreds of thousands.

1:32:56.080 --> 1:32:57.560
 I doubt you did 30 a day for a particular technique.

1:32:57.560 --> 1:33:00.480
 I did, for sure, 100%.

1:33:00.480 --> 1:33:01.320
 There's no doubt.

1:33:01.320 --> 1:33:02.160
 All right.

1:33:02.160 --> 1:33:04.120
 Because some days I might do 100, right?

1:33:04.120 --> 1:33:05.840
 So 30 of 30 is not very many.

1:33:05.840 --> 1:33:07.200
 Especially if we count all reps,

1:33:07.200 --> 1:33:09.280
 if we're counting drilling and live.

1:33:09.280 --> 1:33:11.920
 So like our college coaches would make us just drill a lot

1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:12.960
 and I just hated it.

1:33:12.960 --> 1:33:15.520
 So I would rebel and just kind of give a little spar.

1:33:15.520 --> 1:33:17.100
 You shoot a high crotch, we'll start.

1:33:17.100 --> 1:33:18.120
 Coach wants to drill a high crotch.

1:33:18.120 --> 1:33:18.960
 Okay, we'll start.

1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:20.120
 You shoot the high crotch, that's great.

1:33:20.120 --> 1:33:22.400
 Then I'm gonna sit the corner or I'm gonna give you my hip

1:33:22.400 --> 1:33:24.240
 or I'm gonna try something.

1:33:24.240 --> 1:33:25.240
 So then you have to react.

1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:29.400
 And I would argue that all skill level

1:33:29.400 --> 1:33:34.000
 past the beginner stuff is some necessity of that, right?

1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.200
 I'm gonna do this, then what are you gonna do?

1:33:36.200 --> 1:33:37.200
 It's back and forth.

1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:38.640
 I shoot a single leg, what are you gonna do?

1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:39.880
 I shoot a high crotch, what are you gonna do?

1:33:39.880 --> 1:33:42.380
 And you have to start unconsciously programming

1:33:42.380 --> 1:33:43.220
 these things in your head.

1:33:43.220 --> 1:33:44.280
 Because if you're too conscious to think about it,

1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:45.720
 it's gonna be too slow to actually hit it at math.

1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:48.120
 But the drilling is the unconscious programming.

1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:51.240
 But the simple movement, the first simple movement,

1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:53.280
 the first simple movement, that single leg

1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:55.920
 or the high crotch or arm drag, whatever.

1:33:55.920 --> 1:34:00.000
 Like I feel like the amount you're gonna get better at it

1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.620
 is so minuscule compared to the amount you're gonna gain

1:34:02.620 --> 1:34:05.680
 at doing other things around it.

1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:08.280
 No, but that's the key word, you feel.

1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:09.960
 That's your opinion.

1:34:09.960 --> 1:34:13.560
 If we did a study on it, then I would be proven correct.

1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:15.240
 No, perhaps.

1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:16.920
 So first of all, your brain,

1:34:16.920 --> 1:34:20.860
 as an exceptionally creative combat athlete,

1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:24.560
 it's clear that you don't like the boredom of drilling.

1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:26.920
 Like it's obvious that you have like,

1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:28.680
 you're such a creative energy

1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:31.360
 that you're just not going to be somebody

1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:32.400
 who's going to enjoy that.

1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:35.720
 So enjoyment is probably having an active mind

1:34:35.720 --> 1:34:36.840
 is really important.

1:34:36.840 --> 1:34:39.840
 So the question is, do you have the kind of makeup

1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:44.680
 that has an active mind during a drilling on a dummy?

1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:47.060
 And I have that mind.

1:34:47.060 --> 1:34:47.900
 Like I can.

1:34:47.900 --> 1:34:48.960
 But do you really think, okay,

1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:51.200
 so if you're, let's pick a technique.

1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:53.280
 What technique do you want to drill on?

1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:54.800
 Are we doing jiu jitsu or wrestling?

1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:55.760
 Whatever you want.

1:34:56.800 --> 1:35:00.380
 It's hard to describe with words, but certain guard passes.

1:35:00.380 --> 1:35:03.000
 Let me think, just guard pass.

1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:04.940
 Okay, so you have a guard pass

1:35:04.940 --> 1:35:07.160
 and you get it to be, I'd say nine and a half out of 10,

1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:09.960
 right, just from a technical standpoint.

1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:12.680
 Don't you think you need some resistance to feel?

1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:15.180
 Because essentially all benefit after that

1:35:15.180 --> 1:35:18.160
 is going to be, what are they going to try to do to me?

1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:19.360
 And if they shift that way,

1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:21.600
 do I need to sink here or move there?

1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:25.080
 So it's like, I actually think we're agreeing,

1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:27.160
 but maybe terminology wise.

1:35:27.160 --> 1:35:28.920
 Well, the split is the important thing.

1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:30.600
 Like how much of each?

1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:32.040
 So I think it is spar.

1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:34.580
 Like I think it's a very light touch spar

1:35:34.580 --> 1:35:36.000
 is what you're talking about,

1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.440
 which is in my opinion, really isn't drilling.

1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:41.520
 And it's because drilling past the basic proficiency,

1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:43.120
 I don't think brings much value.

1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:45.840
 But that's what I'm trying to tell you is I think it does.

1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:50.840
 I think doing that same movement,

1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:54.880
 I think you begin to learn more over time.

1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:57.700
 Like you're saying like once you get the basic proficiency,

1:35:57.700 --> 1:36:00.000
 then there's a diminishing returns.

1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:01.520
 I don't think so.

1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:02.360
 I don't think so.

1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:04.720
 I think everything has diminishing returns

1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:06.240
 when you're learning a technique.

1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:09.040
 But with something as complex as wrestling or grappling,

1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:13.000
 if you can have way more gains over here,

1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:16.660
 why focus on going from a 9.7 to a 9.8?

1:36:16.660 --> 1:36:19.800
 If this other area, if you're spending so much time here

1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:21.800
 that this other area is left unexplored,

1:36:21.800 --> 1:36:23.600
 you can make gigantic gains over there.

1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:25.200
 No, but you're gonna lose.

1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:28.000
 I think a lot depends on your style.

1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:31.520
 I think a lot is determined by how good you are

1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:33.220
 at one thing.

1:36:33.220 --> 1:36:36.520
 And so if you wanna become a master of a particular thing

1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:37.680
 and then make your whole game

1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:41.080
 where it's all pulled into that system, then I don't know.

1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:42.920
 I think one is too small of a number.

1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:44.360
 Yeah, it's small.

1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:47.880
 I feel like you can't be easily this, like I've.

1:36:47.880 --> 1:36:50.040
 Yeah, you wanna funnel, you wanna create funnels.

1:36:50.040 --> 1:36:51.280
 Funnels. Funnels, right?

1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:52.680
 Where everything goes into a few positions.

1:36:52.680 --> 1:36:53.520
 And then it's all field.

1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:54.520
 Where I feel you win 100%.

1:36:54.520 --> 1:36:55.500
 Yeah. Yeah.

1:36:55.500 --> 1:37:00.500
 But I feel you can get like drilling on a dummy 80%

1:37:00.500 --> 1:37:05.500
 of the time and 20% of the time live rolling

1:37:06.020 --> 1:37:07.600
 with people worse than you.

1:37:08.540 --> 1:37:10.420
 Like a little bit worse than you.

1:37:10.420 --> 1:37:11.260
 Or a lot worse than you.

1:37:11.260 --> 1:37:13.240
 Yeah, so I think, I definitely think.

1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:17.820
 So my buildup would be teach.

1:37:17.820 --> 1:37:19.460
 So we're talking a complex technique, right?

1:37:19.460 --> 1:37:21.380
 So by the time we're talking about,

1:37:21.380 --> 1:37:24.820
 we'll say a late high school kid who's pretty proficient,

1:37:24.820 --> 1:37:26.700
 he's probably done the drilling part.

1:37:26.700 --> 1:37:28.460
 So then now it's like, okay,

1:37:28.460 --> 1:37:30.300
 if I wanna get something new to you,

1:37:30.300 --> 1:37:31.460
 I'll probably tell you,

1:37:31.460 --> 1:37:32.860
 you'll probably be able to do the basic premise

1:37:32.860 --> 1:37:35.380
 within five to 10 minutes if they're good, right?

1:37:35.380 --> 1:37:36.820
 Do this, okay, they do it.

1:37:36.820 --> 1:37:38.980
 Then it's like, okay, so now here from here,

1:37:38.980 --> 1:37:40.820
 what we're gonna do, we're gonna go light sparring.

1:37:40.820 --> 1:37:42.060
 So I know you have success.

1:37:42.060 --> 1:37:43.500
 Cause I need you to complete the task

1:37:43.500 --> 1:37:44.500
 in order to get better at it.

1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:46.540
 That's something a lot of people in wrestling mess up,

1:37:46.540 --> 1:37:47.940
 is they just wanna go with the toughest person.

1:37:47.940 --> 1:37:49.380
 But if you go with the toughest person,

1:37:49.380 --> 1:37:51.940
 you're not gonna actually execute on any skills.

1:37:51.940 --> 1:37:54.100
 You're gonna get a workout and I need you to execute

1:37:54.100 --> 1:37:55.020
 cause I need you to get good at this.

1:37:55.020 --> 1:37:56.100
 In order to get good at it,

1:37:56.100 --> 1:37:57.500
 you have to get all the way through the technique.

1:37:57.500 --> 1:37:58.980
 Why do you need them to complete?

1:37:58.980 --> 1:38:00.780
 Just so they gain confidence in the technique

1:38:00.780 --> 1:38:01.620
 or they go through all this stuff?

1:38:01.620 --> 1:38:03.660
 They have to feel all the way through.

1:38:03.660 --> 1:38:07.100
 Like if I said, learn a high crotch when you're drilling

1:38:07.100 --> 1:38:08.660
 but stop halfway every time.

1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:10.620
 But you're not actually gonna be able to do it

1:38:10.620 --> 1:38:12.660
 cause you're gonna stop, you're not gonna feel.

1:38:12.660 --> 1:38:16.220
 So, you know, try it on someone, spar lightly, get it.

1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:18.300
 Do it on someone who's not as good as you, get it.

1:38:18.300 --> 1:38:20.220
 Then kind of work your way up the ladder

1:38:20.220 --> 1:38:21.860
 so you can get it on someone your own skill level

1:38:21.860 --> 1:38:24.940
 or maybe better than you, right, in a live competition.

1:38:24.940 --> 1:38:26.300
 So it's like, I don't know,

1:38:26.300 --> 1:38:28.140
 I feel like that basic drilling,

1:38:28.140 --> 1:38:31.260
 so a kid like Keegan who I've brought up a few times,

1:38:31.260 --> 1:38:32.580
 I feel like if there's something new,

1:38:32.580 --> 1:38:33.900
 I could literally tell him,

1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:34.860
 this is what I want you to do

1:38:34.860 --> 1:38:36.420
 and he's such a great feeler,

1:38:36.420 --> 1:38:37.900
 he could go drill it proficiently

1:38:37.900 --> 1:38:40.140
 within probably a minute or two.

1:38:40.140 --> 1:38:41.780
 But then to hit it on someone high level,

1:38:41.780 --> 1:38:44.300
 that's gonna take quite a while longer.

1:38:44.300 --> 1:38:48.060
 And that's a mix of drilling and sparring

1:38:48.060 --> 1:38:49.860
 on people a little bit worse than you.

1:38:49.860 --> 1:38:52.860
 Yeah, and then equal and then better, yeah.

1:38:52.860 --> 1:38:53.700
 Okay.

1:38:53.700 --> 1:38:56.300
 Yeah, because there's this, with grappling,

1:38:56.300 --> 1:38:58.860
 there's such like a feel component to the pressure,

1:38:58.860 --> 1:39:00.340
 the movement, all these things.

1:39:00.340 --> 1:39:01.580
 And there's still, like I said,

1:39:01.580 --> 1:39:03.220
 there's so many things you can throw at someone

1:39:03.220 --> 1:39:05.900
 out of one position, not just moves,

1:39:05.900 --> 1:39:08.580
 but moves at a different level of force or whatever.

1:39:10.020 --> 1:39:11.580
 Are you and these kids developing

1:39:11.580 --> 1:39:14.700
 like a big picture strategy of like,

1:39:14.700 --> 1:39:18.740
 what are the main setups and take downs

1:39:18.740 --> 1:39:20.460
 and just like a whole system?

1:39:21.700 --> 1:39:24.300
 So I kind of sent you our technique book, right,

1:39:24.300 --> 1:39:26.740
 how we kind of go at approach it.

1:39:26.740 --> 1:39:29.500
 So I think in wrestling, you're going to need,

1:39:31.020 --> 1:39:32.780
 you're gonna need a handful of things

1:39:32.780 --> 1:39:34.940
 just off the word go, right?

1:39:34.940 --> 1:39:37.140
 You're going to, so I think on our feet,

1:39:37.140 --> 1:39:38.740
 I need to be able to take this out of the body.

1:39:38.740 --> 1:39:40.820
 I need to be able to take that out of the body.

1:39:40.820 --> 1:39:42.820
 I need to be able to bring you underneath me.

1:39:42.820 --> 1:39:44.860
 I need to be able to go around you, right?

1:39:44.860 --> 1:39:46.700
 Now we can accomplish those different ways,

1:39:46.700 --> 1:39:48.340
 but we should have all of those weapons

1:39:48.340 --> 1:39:51.100
 if we wanna be really good some way, right?

1:39:51.100 --> 1:39:52.380
 So if I neglect one of those,

1:39:52.380 --> 1:39:54.460
 so if I neglect the ability to say, pull you down, right?

1:39:54.460 --> 1:39:55.380
 Front lock you.

1:39:56.340 --> 1:39:58.460
 Now, if I have a good shot and you're smart,

1:39:58.460 --> 1:39:59.540
 you're just gonna lower your stance.

1:39:59.540 --> 1:40:01.980
 So my shot is not gonna be as successful

1:40:01.980 --> 1:40:03.940
 and I have the inability to pull you down, right?

1:40:03.940 --> 1:40:06.140
 So I kind of need all of those so I can,

1:40:06.140 --> 1:40:09.180
 as they get better, I can point those things out.

1:40:09.180 --> 1:40:11.140
 On bottom, my folks at bottom,

1:40:11.140 --> 1:40:13.620
 there's certain things like you have to be good

1:40:13.620 --> 1:40:15.540
 at leg right defense, right?

1:40:15.540 --> 1:40:18.340
 You have to, I mean, at a high level or you're just gonna,

1:40:18.340 --> 1:40:20.220
 when you get it in, you're just getting stuck there.

1:40:20.220 --> 1:40:22.420
 Not gonna be able to escape.

1:40:22.420 --> 1:40:24.940
 But besides that, yeah, there's a multitude of things

1:40:24.940 --> 1:40:26.140
 that you can choose from and I'm gonna,

1:40:26.140 --> 1:40:30.340
 depending on your body style and what you're good and bad

1:40:30.340 --> 1:40:32.380
 at, I'm gonna probably develop something a little different.

1:40:32.380 --> 1:40:34.440
 I might give you, hey, you do the quad pod,

1:40:34.440 --> 1:40:37.100
 you'd be better at the knee slide, whatever.

1:40:38.300 --> 1:40:40.580
 Yeah, top, kind of same thing.

1:40:40.580 --> 1:40:42.420
 I have to ask you about Khabib.

1:40:42.420 --> 1:40:44.820
 So I remember a while ago Rogan said

1:40:44.820 --> 1:40:49.820
 that that's the perfect fight for Khabib, you are.

1:40:50.340 --> 1:40:52.020
 So let me ask two questions.

1:40:52.020 --> 1:40:55.580
 The first, do you think you can beat him in an MMA match

1:40:55.580 --> 1:40:56.660
 when you're at your peak?

1:40:56.660 --> 1:40:59.100
 Yeah, I don't like, yeah, I mean,

1:40:59.100 --> 1:41:01.100
 it's one of those people where people will get really mad

1:41:01.100 --> 1:41:02.580
 at me if I say yes, but yeah, I mean, I think.

1:41:02.580 --> 1:41:03.600
 But how would you do it?

1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:05.260
 How would you solve that puzzle?

1:41:05.260 --> 1:41:08.900
 Yeah, I mean, we would grapple

1:41:08.900 --> 1:41:10.140
 and I think I would be better than him.

1:41:10.140 --> 1:41:12.340
 But you know, sometimes I feel weird saying this,

1:41:12.340 --> 1:41:14.660
 people are like, yeah, right, you're full of shit.

1:41:14.660 --> 1:41:18.020
 And, but that's no one out grappled him, right?

1:41:18.020 --> 1:41:18.980
 I mean, nobody did.

1:41:18.980 --> 1:41:20.700
 And maybe I'm wrong on this,

1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:23.940
 but if we look at the best possible candidates,

1:41:23.940 --> 1:41:25.140
 I'm definitely one of them.

1:41:25.140 --> 1:41:28.560
 And then obviously I have a small size advantage too.

1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:30.020
 So in a wrestling match,

1:41:30.020 --> 1:41:33.060
 so we can just reduce that MMA match to a wrestling match.

1:41:33.060 --> 1:41:35.280
 What do you think is the right strategy on him?

1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:37.260
 Like, do you understand his style,

1:41:39.180 --> 1:41:41.060
 his wrestling style, the pressure he applies?

1:41:41.060 --> 1:41:44.060
 Do you understand how the hell he makes it happen?

1:41:44.060 --> 1:41:46.940
 Yeah, I mean, he never, unfortunately,

1:41:46.940 --> 1:41:48.820
 fought any real, who I would say,

1:41:48.820 --> 1:41:50.540
 really, really high level wrestlers.

1:41:50.540 --> 1:41:51.420
 I was actually really disappointed

1:41:51.420 --> 1:41:52.920
 how bad Justin Gaethje's wrestling was,

1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:55.700
 because Justin Gaethje had some solid success,

1:41:55.700 --> 1:41:58.140
 but his wrestling was really bad in that fight.

1:41:58.140 --> 1:42:00.460
 Gaethje had success in the NCAA?

1:42:00.460 --> 1:42:03.940
 Yeah, I think he was seventh place, maybe, or somewhere.

1:42:03.940 --> 1:42:05.580
 He was definitely all American.

1:42:05.580 --> 1:42:06.860
 It was lower though.

1:42:09.020 --> 1:42:11.220
 So yeah, I would like to see how he dealt with someone

1:42:11.220 --> 1:42:12.640
 who was like, who I think, oh man,

1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:14.460
 this guy's a really high level wrestler.

1:42:14.460 --> 1:42:16.580
 Because we saw, and this is early in his career,

1:42:16.580 --> 1:42:18.820
 but Gleason Tebow did give him some issues

1:42:18.820 --> 1:42:19.980
 earlier in his career.

1:42:21.220 --> 1:42:22.860
 So I would like to see him in that situation

1:42:22.860 --> 1:42:23.700
 and see how he does.

1:42:23.700 --> 1:42:26.820
 I would love to, I just love wrestling and grappling.

1:42:26.820 --> 1:42:27.660
 Yeah, I'd love this.

1:42:27.660 --> 1:42:30.940
 Someone said, hey, Ben, Khabib wants to roll with you.

1:42:30.940 --> 1:42:32.100
 Okay, I'm there tomorrow.

1:42:32.100 --> 1:42:33.020
 It sounds like a blast.

1:42:33.020 --> 1:42:34.060
 Let's go.

1:42:34.060 --> 1:42:35.980
 He's probably competitive as hell.

1:42:35.980 --> 1:42:36.820
 Yeah.

1:42:36.820 --> 1:42:37.940
 You're still competitive?

1:42:37.940 --> 1:42:40.100
 I know when to be and when not to be.

1:42:40.100 --> 1:42:41.260
 Say if I'm going to high school kids,

1:42:41.260 --> 1:42:43.140
 or I'm not going to be competitive

1:42:43.140 --> 1:42:45.700
 because then I'm just being a dick.

1:42:45.700 --> 1:42:47.100
 How would you take him down?

1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:49.040
 What?

1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:49.860
 What are we talking about, real wrestling?

1:42:49.860 --> 1:42:50.700
 Like wrestling, wrestling?

1:42:50.700 --> 1:42:51.540
 Wrestling, wrestling.

1:42:51.540 --> 1:42:53.740
 I would probably try to take single legs and stuff.

1:42:53.740 --> 1:42:54.560
 Single legs?

1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:55.780
 Yeah.

1:42:55.780 --> 1:42:56.900
 I haven't, okay.

1:42:57.740 --> 1:42:58.580
 None, none.

1:42:58.580 --> 1:43:01.080
 No, honestly, I don't have the slightest clue.

1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:03.080
 I'd have to feel, I'd feel him out.

1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:03.920
 But single legs is my best take on it.

1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:06.900
 People talk about his wrestling being really good.

1:43:06.900 --> 1:43:07.860
 People that train with him.

1:43:07.860 --> 1:43:12.100
 So, okay, so I grilled someone, I will not say who,

1:43:12.100 --> 1:43:13.180
 on the Ed Ruth thing,

1:43:13.180 --> 1:43:15.580
 because Ed Ruth is very elite at folk style wrestling.

1:43:15.580 --> 1:43:17.740
 He never became that great at fighting, unfortunately.

1:43:17.740 --> 1:43:19.780
 Wait, Ed Ruth wrestled Khabib?

1:43:19.780 --> 1:43:20.980
 They were on the same team for a while, yeah.

1:43:20.980 --> 1:43:21.820
 Okay.

1:43:21.820 --> 1:43:23.860
 And there was rumors that Khabib beat him up.

1:43:23.860 --> 1:43:27.100
 And I said, I sure can't believe that.

1:43:27.100 --> 1:43:29.500
 And I've heard that that was,

1:43:29.500 --> 1:43:30.820
 if they were just straight wrestling,

1:43:30.820 --> 1:43:33.060
 Ed would get slightly the better of it.

1:43:33.060 --> 1:43:35.180
 Well, Ed Ruth is like one of the greats.

1:43:35.180 --> 1:43:36.020
 He's great.

1:43:36.020 --> 1:43:36.840
 He's really good.

1:43:36.840 --> 1:43:37.840
 Yeah.

1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:39.460
 So that was what I heard.

1:43:39.460 --> 1:43:41.320
 But in an MMA setting,

1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:43.980
 because of all the tools that Khabib would get him.

1:43:45.540 --> 1:43:46.380
 I don't know.

1:43:47.620 --> 1:43:48.460
 But I agree.

1:43:48.460 --> 1:43:49.740
 I agree with Rogan on this one.

1:43:49.740 --> 1:43:50.740
 That would have been good to see.

1:43:50.740 --> 1:43:51.580
 Yeah, I'm fine.

1:43:51.580 --> 1:43:54.220
 So yeah, if Khabib wants to work out, I'd love it.

1:43:54.220 --> 1:43:56.220
 I love wrestling and grappling.

1:43:56.220 --> 1:43:57.060
 I don't do much Jiu Jitsu

1:43:57.060 --> 1:43:58.620
 because I just don't have time for it anymore.

1:43:58.620 --> 1:44:01.260
 I'm at the Wrestling Academy like every single day.

1:44:01.260 --> 1:44:03.540
 But yeah, I loved Jiu Jitsu while I did it.

1:44:03.540 --> 1:44:05.500
 And if I didn't have Wrestling Academies,

1:44:05.500 --> 1:44:06.980
 I probably would still be doing Jiu Jitsu.

1:44:06.980 --> 1:44:09.060
 Yeah, you do well in Jiu Jitsu as well.

1:44:09.060 --> 1:44:12.180
 But let me ask you a ridiculous question.

1:44:12.180 --> 1:44:15.060
 Who's the greatest of all time, freestyle or folk style?

1:44:15.060 --> 1:44:15.900
 Oh, wrestling.

1:44:15.900 --> 1:44:16.740
 Wrestling.

1:44:16.740 --> 1:44:17.580
 Hmm.

1:44:17.580 --> 1:44:22.140
 Well, I will say my knowledge past like the year 2000

1:44:22.140 --> 1:44:25.260
 is really not that great.

1:44:25.260 --> 1:44:26.100
 Because you can't be.

1:44:26.100 --> 1:44:26.920
 In which direction?

1:44:26.920 --> 1:44:27.760
 Sorry, after 2000?

1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:28.600
 No, no, before.

1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:30.100
 Because you can't find any film or anything, you know?

1:44:30.100 --> 1:44:31.300
 And so you hear of all these.

1:44:31.300 --> 1:44:32.300
 So you need evidence?

1:44:32.300 --> 1:44:33.380
 You need direct evidence?

1:44:33.380 --> 1:44:35.020
 I want to be able to watch them and see them

1:44:35.020 --> 1:44:36.740
 and feel the times and feel their opponents

1:44:36.740 --> 1:44:38.980
 and all those things to really like,

1:44:38.980 --> 1:44:40.820
 I hate giving bad answers, you know?

1:44:40.820 --> 1:44:44.820
 So there's just not enough footage of any of those people.

1:44:44.820 --> 1:44:47.740
 You know, we go back to someone like Alexander Medved.

1:44:47.740 --> 1:44:48.980
 Like, you can't find footage.

1:44:48.980 --> 1:44:50.340
 You can't find anything on him, you know?

1:44:50.340 --> 1:44:52.140
 It's like, who is the wrestler?

1:44:52.140 --> 1:44:53.220
 I'm not sure.

1:44:53.220 --> 1:44:57.840
 So post 2000, I think, and obviously just freestyle.

1:44:57.840 --> 1:44:58.680
 So.

1:45:00.460 --> 1:45:01.300
 Americans, Russians?

1:45:01.300 --> 1:45:04.140
 Oh, it's just that T.F. has probably the best argument

1:45:04.140 --> 1:45:04.980
 post 2000.

1:45:04.980 --> 1:45:08.940
 Yeah, the Russian tank, that guy is, yeah.

1:45:08.940 --> 1:45:11.380
 So who's better, Snyder or Sajilov?

1:45:11.380 --> 1:45:12.780
 So Sajilov just won at the Olympics.

1:45:12.780 --> 1:45:13.620
 Now, I understand this.

1:45:13.620 --> 1:45:14.660
 I don't understand how that works,

1:45:14.660 --> 1:45:16.940
 but it's pretty close, right?

1:45:16.940 --> 1:45:17.940
 Not really.

1:45:17.940 --> 1:45:19.860
 Not that match, but in general, the matchup.

1:45:19.860 --> 1:45:22.820
 So, well, so Kyle won the first one in 17.

1:45:22.820 --> 1:45:24.820
 Sajilov pinned him the following year.

1:45:24.820 --> 1:45:28.520
 But then Kyle lost and took bronze in 19.

1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:30.500
 And then just lost.

1:45:30.500 --> 1:45:32.120
 I don't want to say fairly decisively,

1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:35.180
 but it was six to three and it was a late take down.

1:45:35.180 --> 1:45:38.200
 He kind of gave it up and maybe if it was really competitive,

1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:39.460
 maybe he wouldn't have.

1:45:40.980 --> 1:45:43.220
 They're gonna wrestle again in like two weeks here.

1:45:43.220 --> 1:45:45.780
 So that, you know, yeah, I mean,

1:45:45.780 --> 1:45:47.140
 you have to say Sajilov at this point.

1:45:47.140 --> 1:45:48.460
 There's nothing else to say

1:45:48.460 --> 1:45:50.780
 unless Kyle proves us otherwise.

1:45:50.780 --> 1:45:53.700
 Yeah, not enough people talk about Sajilov.

1:45:53.700 --> 1:45:57.540
 Okay, well, you think that guy should go to MMA?

1:45:57.540 --> 1:45:59.100
 You think Kyle should go to MMA?

1:45:59.100 --> 1:45:59.940
 Some of these guys.

1:45:59.940 --> 1:46:01.620
 Yeah, they're making enough money in wrestling

1:46:01.620 --> 1:46:03.160
 where they don't really feel the need to.

1:46:03.160 --> 1:46:04.300
 It's great. It's terrifying though.

1:46:04.300 --> 1:46:06.900
 It's a heavyweight, Sajilov would probably,

1:46:06.900 --> 1:46:09.300
 it's like Khabib, but heavyweight.

1:46:09.300 --> 1:46:10.140
 Well, I don't know if you remember,

1:46:10.140 --> 1:46:12.400
 do you remember Bilal Makov?

1:46:12.400 --> 1:46:14.920
 So Bilal Makov actually was the Russian representative

1:46:14.920 --> 1:46:17.760
 in both styles in 2016, Greco and freestyle.

1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:20.900
 And he was, to my knowledge,

1:46:20.900 --> 1:46:22.680
 the only person the UFC has ever signed

1:46:22.680 --> 1:46:24.700
 that was zero and zero, in modern era,

1:46:24.700 --> 1:46:25.920
 signed that was zero and zero.

1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:28.280
 And then he actually never ended up fighting.

1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:29.680
 But weird, right?

1:46:29.680 --> 1:46:31.060
 So yeah. No motivation.

1:46:31.060 --> 1:46:32.780
 I don't know what the story is.

1:46:32.780 --> 1:46:34.060
 Cause sometimes out of Russia,

1:46:34.060 --> 1:46:35.940
 I mean, maybe you have better sources than I do.

1:46:35.940 --> 1:46:37.840
 Sometimes it feels like dudes just disappear.

1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:39.660
 Like they're a world champ or a little big champ

1:46:39.660 --> 1:46:42.740
 and then all of a sudden you're like, wait, where'd he go?

1:46:42.740 --> 1:46:45.300
 You talked shit about Russia earlier in the conversation.

1:46:45.300 --> 1:46:46.440
 So. Oh, what'd I say?

1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:48.380
 I forgot, but I think.

1:46:48.380 --> 1:46:49.220
 Steroids.

1:46:49.220 --> 1:46:50.780
 I think somebody's gonna show up to your door.

1:46:50.780 --> 1:46:51.600
 I'm worried.

1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:53.060
 I honestly, I've said enough bad things

1:46:53.060 --> 1:46:56.060
 where I would be a kind of looking over my shoulder

1:46:56.060 --> 1:46:57.060
 if I wanted to do something.

1:46:57.060 --> 1:47:01.260
 I, for one, love the Russians.

1:47:01.260 --> 1:47:02.980
 What about Icarus?

1:47:02.980 --> 1:47:03.820
 How does that make you feel?

1:47:03.820 --> 1:47:04.660
 What about it?

1:47:04.660 --> 1:47:05.480
 It's fake news.

1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:06.320
 Oh, really?

1:47:06.320 --> 1:47:07.160
 I'm just kidding.

1:47:07.160 --> 1:47:07.980
 It's propaganda?

1:47:07.980 --> 1:47:08.820
 Maybe it is.

1:47:08.820 --> 1:47:09.660
 I don't know.

1:47:09.660 --> 1:47:10.480
 I don't know what it is anymore.

1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:11.320
 Maybe it is.

1:47:11.320 --> 1:47:12.160
 Yeah.

1:47:12.160 --> 1:47:13.060
 You know, it's troublesome, man.

1:47:13.060 --> 1:47:15.080
 I hate cheating in all of its forms.

1:47:16.460 --> 1:47:20.220
 Any other like recaps from the Olympics of 2020 Tokyo

1:47:20.220 --> 1:47:21.140
 that stood out to you?

1:47:21.140 --> 1:47:21.960
 Gable Stephenson?

1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:22.800
 Like anything like that?

1:47:22.800 --> 1:47:23.620
 Gable's great.

1:47:23.620 --> 1:47:24.460
 Yeah.

1:47:24.460 --> 1:47:26.780
 No, I think America's coming to the point

1:47:26.780 --> 1:47:28.020
 where we're gonna compete with Russia

1:47:28.020 --> 1:47:29.020
 every single year in wrestling,

1:47:29.020 --> 1:47:30.900
 which obviously, you know,

1:47:32.500 --> 1:47:36.260
 long, long time ago, many, many years ago we were great.

1:47:36.260 --> 1:47:39.540
 And then kind of after that Soviet Union period,

1:47:39.540 --> 1:47:41.820
 I think there was a lot of poverty in that area.

1:47:41.820 --> 1:47:43.540
 And that kind of led the wrestling team

1:47:43.540 --> 1:47:44.820
 going down a little bit.

1:47:44.820 --> 1:47:47.620
 And then obviously a lot of those regions,

1:47:47.620 --> 1:47:51.060
 the way they found oil and gas in the Caspian Sea, I believe.

1:47:51.060 --> 1:47:54.020
 And they've been really kind of on the upswing

1:47:54.020 --> 1:47:54.860
 for the last 20 years.

1:47:54.860 --> 1:47:58.020
 And now America really, since 2012,

1:47:58.020 --> 1:47:59.340
 has been on the upswing in wrestling.

1:47:59.340 --> 1:48:02.780
 And we're kind of really competing with them.

1:48:02.780 --> 1:48:04.900
 And they're not sending a couple of their best guys.

1:48:04.900 --> 1:48:06.860
 So for those who don't know,

1:48:06.860 --> 1:48:08.580
 the Olympics moved back a year.

1:48:08.580 --> 1:48:11.300
 So they are hosting the 2021 World Championships,

1:48:11.300 --> 1:48:12.780
 despite the fact that we just had the Olympics

1:48:12.780 --> 1:48:13.620
 two months ago.

1:48:13.620 --> 1:48:15.620
 So it's happening next week in Oslo, Norway.

1:48:15.620 --> 1:48:18.300
 So like Russia's not sending their number one at 57

1:48:18.300 --> 1:48:19.700
 and their number one at 65.

1:48:19.700 --> 1:48:23.540
 So it's like, America's probably gonna win, I think.

1:48:23.540 --> 1:48:24.980
 I don't wanna guarantee anything,

1:48:24.980 --> 1:48:26.300
 but there's a really good chance of it.

1:48:26.300 --> 1:48:28.980
 Is Dave Taylor, all of those guys, competing?

1:48:28.980 --> 1:48:31.620
 America gave any of the Olympians that medaled

1:48:31.620 --> 1:48:33.460
 the opportunity to not even have to wrestle off.

1:48:33.460 --> 1:48:34.460
 They just got to keep the spot

1:48:34.460 --> 1:48:36.660
 since it was two months later if they medaled.

1:48:36.660 --> 1:48:38.860
 So the only one who's not is Gable.

1:48:38.860 --> 1:48:40.020
 Gable's moving on.

1:48:40.020 --> 1:48:41.740
 We have a pretty good guy behind him.

1:48:41.740 --> 1:48:44.180
 Nick Wisniewski is a world medalist.

1:48:44.180 --> 1:48:47.180
 But then he's, so Burrell's filled in the 79 spot.

1:48:47.180 --> 1:48:49.140
 Jayden Cox filled in the 92 spot,

1:48:49.140 --> 1:48:50.780
 who's a world champion also.

1:48:50.780 --> 1:48:52.100
 So we have a pretty good squad.

1:48:52.100 --> 1:48:54.340
 A hell of a team. Pretty good squad, yeah.

1:48:54.340 --> 1:48:56.420
 Pretty good squad. Pretty happy.

1:48:56.420 --> 1:48:59.380
 So given your run in Bellator in one championship,

1:48:59.380 --> 1:49:03.060
 that was like one of the most dominant runs in MMA.

1:49:03.060 --> 1:49:06.300
 What would you say was like key to your dominance

1:49:06.300 --> 1:49:08.860
 in that long undefeated streak?

1:49:08.860 --> 1:49:12.180
 Huh, probably consistency would be one.

1:49:12.180 --> 1:49:16.580
 The fact that I just, I lived and trained the same way

1:49:16.580 --> 1:49:17.900
 no matter where my life was,

1:49:17.900 --> 1:49:18.900
 whereas a lot of fighters,

1:49:18.900 --> 1:49:20.900
 once they start making money for the first time,

1:49:20.900 --> 1:49:22.860
 they have all these obligations and they travel

1:49:22.860 --> 1:49:24.740
 and they really enjoy making money.

1:49:24.740 --> 1:49:27.940
 And that's kind of why some of them fall off.

1:49:27.940 --> 1:49:29.340
 So you had like the same process,

1:49:29.340 --> 1:49:31.380
 like the same camp. Yeah, I stayed at my house.

1:49:31.380 --> 1:49:33.620
 I didn't vacation, yeah, everything.

1:49:33.620 --> 1:49:37.500
 Just, you know, and so that was a big part of it.

1:49:37.500 --> 1:49:40.220
 Obviously the style thing is like, no one could,

1:49:40.220 --> 1:49:43.260
 there was only a few people who could stop my style.

1:49:44.940 --> 1:49:46.780
 And I think I continue to get better

1:49:46.780 --> 1:49:48.060
 as a mixed martial artist.

1:49:48.060 --> 1:49:53.060
 And I wasn't as innovative in mixed martial arts,

1:49:53.260 --> 1:49:56.100
 but there was a handful of things that I innovated,

1:49:56.100 --> 1:49:58.260
 you know, specifically in the top position

1:49:58.260 --> 1:50:00.860
 where I spent a lot of time where it was just like,

1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:02.780
 there was just, once I got on top of you,

1:50:02.780 --> 1:50:03.860
 it was like in a spider web

1:50:03.860 --> 1:50:05.700
 and there was just kind of no way out.

1:50:05.700 --> 1:50:08.500
 You know, you never felt the certain things I was doing.

1:50:08.500 --> 1:50:11.900
 And so people just, they gave up eventually.

1:50:11.900 --> 1:50:14.820
 How's the level of wrestling in MMA would you say?

1:50:14.820 --> 1:50:19.540
 So I saw somewhere like champions,

1:50:19.540 --> 1:50:22.780
 the most popular martial art for current UFC champions

1:50:22.780 --> 1:50:24.380
 are all wrestling.

1:50:24.380 --> 1:50:27.140
 So we just lost a bunch of the belts.

1:50:27.140 --> 1:50:29.380
 Wrestling is a sport, right?

1:50:29.380 --> 1:50:30.540
 But yeah, at one point we had,

1:50:30.540 --> 1:50:32.740
 I think it was eight of nine maybe

1:50:32.740 --> 1:50:34.660
 or something to that effect.

1:50:34.660 --> 1:50:36.860
 And I think it's not just wrestling,

1:50:36.860 --> 1:50:39.700
 not just the actual martial art of wrestling

1:50:39.700 --> 1:50:44.180
 that contributes to our success in mixed martial arts,

1:50:44.180 --> 1:50:46.580
 but other things like the way we're systemized.

1:50:46.580 --> 1:50:49.100
 So most kids who have all this have went through

1:50:49.100 --> 1:50:50.700
 the high school program and the college program

1:50:50.700 --> 1:50:51.900
 and they know how to show up on time

1:50:51.900 --> 1:50:53.200
 and they know how to work hard.

1:50:53.200 --> 1:50:56.900
 So when they go to ATT or AKA or wherever,

1:50:56.900 --> 1:50:58.060
 they know how to show up on time

1:50:58.060 --> 1:50:58.900
 and they know how to work hard

1:50:58.900 --> 1:51:00.720
 and that's gonna get you a really long way.

1:51:00.720 --> 1:51:01.940
 Just those two things, right?

1:51:01.940 --> 1:51:03.900
 Not even the techniques, it's just the discipline.

1:51:03.900 --> 1:51:04.740
 Those things.

1:51:04.740 --> 1:51:06.100
 Then I think you throw on top of that the fact

1:51:06.100 --> 1:51:10.140
 that most of us have competed 1500 to 2000 times,

1:51:10.140 --> 1:51:12.300
 probably by the time we get to 20 something,

1:51:12.300 --> 1:51:13.500
 like that's a huge advantage too.

1:51:13.500 --> 1:51:15.460
 Most of these other people from other disciplines

1:51:15.460 --> 1:51:18.220
 maybe have competed 100, if that, right?

1:51:18.220 --> 1:51:20.300
 So we have this competitive process down

1:51:20.300 --> 1:51:23.140
 really, really, really, really well.

1:51:23.140 --> 1:51:24.100
 Plus the weight cut.

1:51:24.100 --> 1:51:24.940
 The weight cut.

1:51:24.940 --> 1:51:27.380
 There's all these things that factor into it.

1:51:27.380 --> 1:51:29.400
 I think the fact that we're really open minded,

1:51:29.400 --> 1:51:32.300
 I think if you would, I don't wanna pick on jiu jitsu again,

1:51:32.300 --> 1:51:35.000
 but how many jiu jitsu guys have became

1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:36.440
 highly proficient in wrestling

1:51:36.440 --> 1:51:37.740
 versus how many wrestling guys

1:51:37.740 --> 1:51:39.900
 have became highly proficient in jiu jitsu?

1:51:39.900 --> 1:51:41.980
 I think that number swings one way

1:51:41.980 --> 1:51:44.540
 and not that much the other way, you know?

1:51:44.540 --> 1:51:48.260
 So we're open to adapting and learning

1:51:48.260 --> 1:51:52.020
 and for some reason, like jiu jitsu people,

1:51:52.020 --> 1:51:54.020
 how many of them have got high level wrestling?

1:51:54.020 --> 1:51:57.460
 Or even mediocre wrestling, the number's really small.

1:51:57.460 --> 1:52:00.020
 They refuse to, it's really frustrating.

1:52:00.020 --> 1:52:01.020
 Why won't they do this?

1:52:01.020 --> 1:52:03.140
 This is obviously a part of it.

1:52:03.140 --> 1:52:04.580
 I don't wanna pick on specific guys,

1:52:04.580 --> 1:52:06.180
 but there's certain guys in the history of MMA

1:52:06.180 --> 1:52:08.620
 where you're like, listen, man.

1:52:08.620 --> 1:52:10.740
 I mean, Damian Maia, who was my last fight,

1:52:10.740 --> 1:52:12.380
 is a great example of somebody who actually

1:52:12.380 --> 1:52:15.040
 did get proficient in wrestling, right?

1:52:15.040 --> 1:52:16.720
 But there's some of these jiu jitsu guys who's like,

1:52:16.720 --> 1:52:18.620
 if you just got on top, you would submit him.

1:52:18.620 --> 1:52:20.460
 Why can't you learn a freaking takedown?

1:52:20.460 --> 1:52:23.700
 Like, holy moly, just learn how to take someone down.

1:52:23.700 --> 1:52:26.040
 Once you get them down, they will not get up

1:52:26.040 --> 1:52:26.940
 and you win the fight.

1:52:26.940 --> 1:52:28.380
 Like, it's so easy, you know?

1:52:28.380 --> 1:52:29.300
 But they refuse.

1:52:29.300 --> 1:52:30.520
 How complicated is that journey?

1:52:30.520 --> 1:52:33.460
 So like Donaher that you mentioned, Craig Jones,

1:52:33.460 --> 1:52:36.820
 they're big on wrestling as part of jiu jitsu now.

1:52:36.820 --> 1:52:38.840
 Like wrestling, not just on the feet,

1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:41.220
 but wrestling from the bottom coming up

1:52:41.220 --> 1:52:42.940
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:52:42.940 --> 1:52:46.420
 So how difficult is that whole skill set, would you say,

1:52:46.420 --> 1:52:48.680
 for a jiu jitsu person to learn?

1:52:48.680 --> 1:52:49.520
 Not that hard.

1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:50.780
 If they really put their mind to it.

1:52:50.780 --> 1:52:52.660
 Cause they already like, when you grapple,

1:52:52.660 --> 1:52:54.140
 and this is any grappling art,

1:52:54.140 --> 1:52:56.820
 like there's a certain part of it that you kind of get

1:52:56.820 --> 1:52:59.340
 and it can, it might not be the exact same thing,

1:52:59.340 --> 1:53:00.740
 but you understand how your body moves

1:53:00.740 --> 1:53:02.100
 and how to feel certain pressures

1:53:02.100 --> 1:53:04.980
 and you can adapt yourself pretty quickly, you know?

1:53:04.980 --> 1:53:07.420
 So I don't think, I think there's a certain level

1:53:07.420 --> 1:53:09.620
 of stubbornness where they didn't want to,

1:53:09.620 --> 1:53:12.700
 certain people didn't want to do it for whatever reason.

1:53:12.700 --> 1:53:16.140
 I think a lot of times in MMA, it's the I'm so macho,

1:53:16.140 --> 1:53:17.780
 I can stand and bang thing, you know,

1:53:17.780 --> 1:53:21.060
 where they want to show how macho they are.

1:53:21.060 --> 1:53:24.060
 But yeah, that was a frustrating one that they,

1:53:24.060 --> 1:53:26.220
 there's a lot of wrestlers who became highly proficient

1:53:26.220 --> 1:53:28.500
 in jiu jitsu and really adapted

1:53:28.500 --> 1:53:29.620
 and it doesn't go the other way.

1:53:29.620 --> 1:53:31.820
 And then I guess the other thing there too is

1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:35.140
 they can both steal from each other, right?

1:53:35.140 --> 1:53:38.780
 As any martial art can steal from another.

1:53:38.780 --> 1:53:40.460
 And like, I feel like jiu jitsu

1:53:40.460 --> 1:53:42.260
 didn't do enough stealing from wrestling.

1:53:42.260 --> 1:53:44.020
 Like they should have looked at all the wrestling possible

1:53:44.020 --> 1:53:47.460
 and said, well, why don't we steal that and that and that?

1:53:47.460 --> 1:53:48.980
 You know, and like, hey, let's take that over.

1:53:48.980 --> 1:53:52.280
 And maybe we'd make a little tweak because it's different,

1:53:52.280 --> 1:53:53.900
 but there's something we can definitely use there.

1:53:53.900 --> 1:53:57.220
 So like in wrestling, for example,

1:53:57.220 --> 1:53:59.660
 you know there's a one arm guillotine in jiu jitsu, right?

1:53:59.660 --> 1:54:01.700
 Okay, so there's a move called, well, it's got a hundred,

1:54:01.700 --> 1:54:03.060
 I mean, it's like the oldest move in wrestling

1:54:03.060 --> 1:54:04.120
 because it's what they did, the cows,

1:54:04.120 --> 1:54:05.300
 where they go around the chin and they throw them

1:54:05.300 --> 1:54:07.420
 on the back, how do we call that one?

1:54:07.420 --> 1:54:08.260
 I don't know.

1:54:08.260 --> 1:54:11.220
 Okay, sorry, did you just ask me what I call that one?

1:54:11.220 --> 1:54:12.060
 Yeah.

1:54:12.060 --> 1:54:14.780
 Would you take a cow and grab it by the neck,

1:54:14.780 --> 1:54:15.620
 throw it to the side?

1:54:15.620 --> 1:54:17.340
 No, but in wrestling, in wrestling.

1:54:17.340 --> 1:54:18.380
 I don't know.

1:54:18.380 --> 1:54:19.220
 Okay, we call it that.

1:54:19.220 --> 1:54:20.260
 Are you putting it under?

1:54:20.260 --> 1:54:21.660
 Yeah, so you can grab their chin

1:54:21.660 --> 1:54:22.820
 and then you go under their arm

1:54:22.820 --> 1:54:23.660
 and then throw them on their back.

1:54:23.660 --> 1:54:24.700
 Oh, okay, gotcha, yeah.

1:54:24.700 --> 1:54:26.460
 Yeah, so we call that the honey badger,

1:54:26.460 --> 1:54:28.380
 but it's got different names,

1:54:28.380 --> 1:54:30.380
 wherever you go, it's got different names.

1:54:30.380 --> 1:54:34.720
 So I would always, I would say like pre Jiu Jitsu,

1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:37.360
 I was average at it, like I could do it,

1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:39.760
 but against good people, you'd never get it for,

1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:42.520
 because they would get the back of their head up

1:54:42.520 --> 1:54:44.140
 and they were too strong where you couldn't collapse them

1:54:44.140 --> 1:54:45.200
 by going over their neck, right?

1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:46.680
 Because the forces weren't right.

1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:48.680
 So then in Jiu Jitsu, you learn the one arm gi team

1:54:48.680 --> 1:54:51.280
 where you grab their chin and this is more of running along

1:54:51.280 --> 1:54:53.620
 the side of their head and then you go here

1:54:53.620 --> 1:54:55.760
 and you choke them, right?

1:54:55.760 --> 1:54:58.060
 Much more efficient way to move their head

1:54:58.060 --> 1:55:00.240
 because the fulcrum is way down here

1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:02.960
 and their head can move into that, right?

1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:06.320
 So once I learned that in Jiu Jitsu, I'm like, wait,

1:55:06.320 --> 1:55:07.880
 I can do this in wrestling.

1:55:07.880 --> 1:55:10.100
 So now once I learn how to grab their chin the right way

1:55:10.100 --> 1:55:12.560
 and I do the honey badger, no one ever gets out.

1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:14.720
 I just had to steal that Jiu Jitsu,

1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:16.520
 put it in wrestling and boom, there we go.

1:55:16.520 --> 1:55:18.740
 But very few people steal any direction,

1:55:18.740 --> 1:55:19.880
 that takes creativity.

1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:20.720
 Really?

1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:21.540
 And open mindedness.

1:55:21.540 --> 1:55:22.380
 It's so easy because it's already done,

1:55:22.380 --> 1:55:23.720
 you just gotta steal it.

1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:27.160
 I mean, same with Judo, if you're a gi Jiu Jitsu person,

1:55:27.160 --> 1:55:32.160
 there's so much stuff in Judo that's ripe for the stealing

1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:37.680
 because Judo is much more emphasizes explosive moves

1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:42.240
 on the transition, which is something Jiu Jitsu does not do.

1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:43.080
 Because you have some.

1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:44.120
 You mean from the take down to.

1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:45.880
 From the take down, but also just in general,

1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:49.040
 just in the transition, the concept of transition,

1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:53.680
 the Jiu Jitsu is very much about we're in this position,

1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:56.680
 then we're in this position, then we're in this position.

1:55:56.680 --> 1:56:01.680
 The Judo is much more in when there's chaos of any kind.

1:56:02.160 --> 1:56:04.440
 That's when you need to strike.

1:56:04.440 --> 1:56:06.840
 And to learn that, I mean, that's why people like

1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:09.680
 Travis Stevens and Judoka, when they go to Jiu Jitsu,

1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:10.520
 they can dominate.

1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:13.680
 But Jiu Jitsu people should steal that.

1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:14.880
 They're too stubborn.

1:56:14.880 --> 1:56:17.480
 Yeah, but so is every, wrestlers are stubborn too.

1:56:17.480 --> 1:56:21.160
 No way, there would never be any stubborn wrestlers.

1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:23.980
 Well, I mean, I was surprised, all these coaches,

1:56:23.980 --> 1:56:27.760
 John Smith, Dan Gabel, they don't really have interest

1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:29.740
 in MMA or Jiu Jitsu and so on.

1:56:31.400 --> 1:56:33.120
 But you would think somebody like a John Smith

1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:36.720
 would like put on a white belt and roll around.

1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:39.400
 Yeah, I think he's just too focused on, you know.

1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:40.240
 Well, he's a coach.

1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:41.720
 Well, he's a coach and what he's doing.

1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:45.240
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think if you take him when he's younger,

1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:46.080
 he would have a lot of fun.

1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:47.140
 We actually have a really good wrestler

1:56:47.140 --> 1:56:48.920
 making his MMA debut tomorrow.

1:56:48.920 --> 1:56:49.920
 I don't know if you, Bo Nickel,

1:56:49.920 --> 1:56:51.900
 I'm sure you've heard of him, very high level.

1:56:51.900 --> 1:56:54.520
 I think he's gonna have a lot of success.

1:56:54.520 --> 1:56:57.520
 I mean, some people might say that like Jiu Jitsu

1:56:57.520 --> 1:57:01.440
 makes you a little comfortable being in your back

1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:03.920
 and for a wrestler, that could be like really bad.

1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:05.080
 I hate that take.

1:57:05.080 --> 1:57:07.320
 Yeah, but that's the Dan Gabel take.

1:57:07.320 --> 1:57:09.800
 It's so stupid, it's so stupid.

1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:12.160
 For God's sakes, we know the fucking rules.

1:57:12.160 --> 1:57:13.800
 Just, in wrestling, you don't go to your back.

1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:16.240
 In Jiu Jitsu, you can, it's like, whatever.

1:57:16.240 --> 1:57:17.080
 Yeah, yeah.

1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:19.760
 But like, so Jiu Jitsu, for example,

1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:22.320
 so I coached, when I was at Rufus, I coached the wrestling

1:57:22.320 --> 1:57:25.840
 for a long, I don't know, three, four, five years.

1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:28.080
 So I've been taking a Jiu Jitsu guy

1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:29.820
 and teaching them a wrestling technique

1:57:29.820 --> 1:57:32.480
 where you needed to use your feet.

1:57:33.360 --> 1:57:35.480
 To teach a Jiu Jitsu guy, so easy, so simple,

1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:37.120
 because they already understand the concept,

1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:39.440
 butterfly guard, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, right?

1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:42.540
 To take a wrestler who's never done any of it

1:57:42.540 --> 1:57:43.880
 and teach him how to use his feet,

1:57:43.880 --> 1:57:46.280
 oh my God, it's such a beast, it's so hard,

1:57:46.280 --> 1:57:49.060
 because that's not a weapon they're thinking about using.

1:57:49.060 --> 1:57:51.600
 So it's like, we understand the rules.

1:57:51.600 --> 1:57:52.960
 It's like freestyle folks are wrestling.

1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:55.140
 Freestyle, if I'm on the mat, I can lock my hands.

1:57:55.140 --> 1:57:56.400
 You don't see people locking their hands

1:57:56.400 --> 1:57:58.160
 all the time in folk style just because they did freestyle.

1:57:58.160 --> 1:57:59.400
 It's like, they get it.

1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:00.800
 There's a rule, they understand it.

1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:04.040
 So the notion that somehow you come from on your back.

1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:08.660
 But pinning, that's like a, it has a special meaning.

1:58:08.660 --> 1:58:11.280
 Yeah, but I actually think, so Jiu Jitsu,

1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:16.280
 you don't actually wanna be flat, flat very often, right?

1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:17.760
 You don't wanna be.

1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:18.760
 I always wondered this,

1:58:18.760 --> 1:58:21.920
 because I did a couple of catch wrestling tournaments,

1:58:21.920 --> 1:58:26.240
 and I did, I would put myself in butterfly guard,

1:58:26.240 --> 1:58:28.440
 and I wasn't going against good people,

1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:30.360
 so which is why I was doing all these things.

1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:34.400
 But I wondered if you could create a system of wrestling

1:58:34.400 --> 1:58:37.180
 where you're butterfly guard.

1:58:37.180 --> 1:58:40.220
 So I think that there's a few places where I use it.

1:58:40.220 --> 1:58:41.880
 But so specifically the Elevator Series,

1:58:41.880 --> 1:58:43.040
 which my main series up bottom,

1:58:43.040 --> 1:58:45.380
 it is, it's not butterfly guard.

1:58:45.380 --> 1:58:47.240
 It's a butterfly guard grip with your foot.

1:58:47.240 --> 1:58:50.820
 So I boom, I go here, I catch your leg with my foot,

1:58:50.820 --> 1:58:53.000
 boom, and I elevate you over, right?

1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:54.800
 And then also sometimes,

1:58:56.320 --> 1:58:57.720
 I think Keegan does this too from watching me,

1:58:57.720 --> 1:58:59.400
 but if I get double leg,

1:58:59.400 --> 1:59:02.600
 sometimes if I'm accepting, so freestyle,

1:59:02.600 --> 1:59:03.440
 obviously you're gonna give him points,

1:59:03.440 --> 1:59:05.600
 you're gonna focus on accepting that you've already got me,

1:59:05.600 --> 1:59:09.520
 and as I go down, I'm just gonna butterfly guard you up,

1:59:09.520 --> 1:59:11.620
 and then I'm gonna try to flip my hip back to the mat,

1:59:11.620 --> 1:59:13.820
 and end up in a wizard position.

1:59:13.820 --> 1:59:15.360
 I've used that quite a few times,

1:59:15.360 --> 1:59:17.720
 where it's kind of like a bailout mechanism

1:59:17.720 --> 1:59:20.520
 that gets me back to maybe not a great position,

1:59:20.520 --> 1:59:23.520
 but obviously much better than being taken down.

1:59:23.520 --> 1:59:24.860
 Beautiful. Yeah.

1:59:24.860 --> 1:59:26.920
 Let me ask you quickly about crypto,

1:59:26.920 --> 1:59:30.320
 because you're also, you have a show.

1:59:30.320 --> 1:59:33.760
 You have a lot of interest in cryptocurrency.

1:59:33.760 --> 1:59:36.400
 Why are you interested in cryptocurrency?

1:59:36.400 --> 1:59:38.060
 Is it just a financial investment,

1:59:38.060 --> 1:59:40.880
 or is there a philosophy that attracts you to it?

1:59:40.880 --> 1:59:44.240
 So I, my friend told me about it in 2017.

1:59:44.240 --> 1:59:46.240
 I was actually, I went to, I was,

1:59:46.240 --> 1:59:47.560
 my friend met me in Shanghai.

1:59:47.560 --> 1:59:50.800
 I fought in one championship, and he told me,

1:59:50.800 --> 1:59:54.040
 and the second he told me, I'm like, oh, I'm so in,

1:59:54.040 --> 1:59:56.520
 because I had read Ron Paul and the Fed.

1:59:56.520 --> 1:59:58.720
 I had read, I kind of had an understanding

1:59:58.720 --> 2:00:01.500
 how the Fed is unfair,

2:00:02.400 --> 2:00:03.400
 and so when he told me about crypto,

2:00:03.400 --> 2:00:07.460
 this decentralized system that no one has control over,

2:00:07.460 --> 2:00:09.920
 it just made sense, and so we've had the podcast,

2:00:09.920 --> 2:00:11.920
 to say Michael Saylor on it, and I love the way he says it.

2:00:11.920 --> 2:00:13.600
 It's like, who do you trust more with your money?

2:00:13.600 --> 2:00:16.800
 Do you trust the politicians, or do you trust engineers?

2:00:16.800 --> 2:00:18.240
 I think that's an easy choice.

2:00:18.240 --> 2:00:19.640
 I don't even think, I don't even think

2:00:19.640 --> 2:00:20.480
 I have to think about that.

2:00:20.480 --> 2:00:22.840
 I don't trust politicians, no matter what country they come

2:00:22.840 --> 2:00:26.320
 from, China, America, wherever, I don't trust them.

2:00:26.320 --> 2:00:31.320
 So. So what about in 2017, what was it, Bitcoin?

2:00:33.240 --> 2:00:38.240
 Are you, what do you find, which ones do you find interesting?

2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:39.720
 Yeah. There's all kinds of ideas,

2:00:39.720 --> 2:00:44.640
 there's the more sort of primal mechanism

2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:46.640
 of proof of work and Bitcoin,

2:00:46.640 --> 2:00:48.720
 and then there's smart contracts, ideas,

2:00:48.720 --> 2:00:50.960
 and there's all kinds of innovations

2:00:50.960 --> 2:00:53.240
 across the different points.

2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:55.160
 So I can't say I'm in super deep

2:00:55.160 --> 2:00:57.040
 where I understand the technical components

2:00:57.040 --> 2:00:57.880
 of a lot of them.

2:00:57.880 --> 2:00:59.400
 I understand what Bitcoin can do for people,

2:00:59.400 --> 2:01:02.200
 and so that's probably the one I've focused the most on.

2:01:03.240 --> 2:01:05.560
 And I actually, I think I was talking about,

2:01:05.560 --> 2:01:07.680
 I was trying to convince Michael to talk about Bitcoin

2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:09.960
 because he hates it also, what he did last night.

2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:13.920
 And I think most of the main problems Bitcoin solves,

2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:15.760
 people in America are so American centric,

2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:16.600
 they don't understand it.

2:01:16.600 --> 2:01:18.320
 So like high levels of inflation,

2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:20.280
 that hasn't happened in, it's starting to happen,

2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:21.760
 it hasn't happened in America in a long time, right?

2:01:21.760 --> 2:01:25.600
 But someone in Venezuela is like, oh, I get that, you know,

2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:27.920
 or remittance payments, right?

2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:30.400
 Remittance payments to, you see it.

2:01:30.400 --> 2:01:32.960
 So I saw this in, when I was spending all the time

2:01:32.960 --> 2:01:34.840
 in Singapore, Singapore is obviously

2:01:34.840 --> 2:01:36.560
 a really wealthy country,

2:01:36.560 --> 2:01:39.040
 and so you'd have Indonesian workers or Filipino,

2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:40.920
 and they would all go on Sundays,

2:01:40.920 --> 2:01:42.640
 they would go to these places to ship stuff

2:01:42.640 --> 2:01:44.960
 back to their families and through Western Union,

2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:46.840
 Western Union gouges the shit out of these people.

2:01:46.840 --> 2:01:49.080
 I mean, they're taking eight, 10, 12%

2:01:49.080 --> 2:01:50.560
 of whatever they're sending,

2:01:50.560 --> 2:01:52.920
 then it takes five days and the person's gonna go pick it up,

2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:55.640
 whereas Bitcoin, I could send you Bitcoin

2:01:55.640 --> 2:01:56.720
 person to person, right?

2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:59.080
 So like American people don't understand that.

2:01:59.080 --> 2:02:01.480
 American people don't really understand the unbanked, right?

2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:03.240
 A decent portion of the world is unbanked,

2:02:03.240 --> 2:02:04.560
 they don't have access to it.

2:02:04.560 --> 2:02:07.560
 And a much, much, much smaller portion of the world

2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:08.720
 doesn't have access to internet.

2:02:08.720 --> 2:02:11.720
 So if I can put a mobile wallet on your phone,

2:02:11.720 --> 2:02:13.960
 and we can send money person to person.

2:02:13.960 --> 2:02:15.000
 So there's a whole bunch of those problems

2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:16.720
 where Americans don't really think about

2:02:16.720 --> 2:02:19.080
 that are really obvious that this solves.

2:02:20.120 --> 2:02:21.440
 So I think that's a key one,

2:02:21.440 --> 2:02:24.400
 obviously the fact that the value goes up

2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:25.840
 is really outstanding also,

2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:29.800
 but if you look at it, I got in in 2017,

2:02:29.800 --> 2:02:31.840
 so I got to watch it go up.

2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:34.160
 I didn't sell shit at the top, really stupid.

2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:35.720
 And then the majority of my time

2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:37.480
 was spent through the bear market.

2:02:37.480 --> 2:02:39.880
 And so I had to love it for the principles that it provided,

2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:42.680
 not the fact that I actually lost money in the beginning

2:02:42.680 --> 2:02:45.680
 and now I'm way up, but yeah.

2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:46.520
 So I think that.

2:02:46.520 --> 2:02:47.360
 And you're just holding.

2:02:47.360 --> 2:02:48.280
 Just holding.

2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:50.200
 I think at the top of this bull market,

2:02:50.200 --> 2:02:53.840
 I'll probably sell a very small portion, just to.

2:02:53.840 --> 2:02:56.000
 So you mean like right now there's a bull market?

2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:59.000
 Yeah, most people think say in the next three to six months

2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:00.720
 we'll be at the top of the market.

2:03:00.720 --> 2:03:02.560
 And so probably when that happens,

2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:04.760
 I'll probably sell a little bit.

2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:06.280
 You gotta hodl it, Ben.

2:03:06.280 --> 2:03:07.120
 You gotta hodl.

2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:07.960
 Well, yeah.

2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:08.920
 So here's what I am.

2:03:08.920 --> 2:03:12.640
 So one of my podcast cohosts, he's like super rich,

2:03:12.640 --> 2:03:13.800
 like super rich.

2:03:13.800 --> 2:03:16.120
 So he has lost touch with the every man.

2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:19.080
 So here's my argument to him, it's really simple.

2:03:19.080 --> 2:03:20.960
 And listen, I'm doing well for myself in life,

2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:24.440
 but if say someone buys a Bitcoin, right?

2:03:24.440 --> 2:03:27.080
 One Bitcoin at $5,000, which it was last year.

2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:31.880
 And this Bitcoin goes from $5,000 to $200,000,

2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:34.200
 which is right around what a lot of people think

2:03:34.200 --> 2:03:35.600
 the peak is going to be.

2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:36.840
 They bought one Bitcoin.

2:03:36.840 --> 2:03:39.600
 And they're living in a $200,000 house.

2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:42.360
 So to take half of that, right?

2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:44.160
 You started with $5,000 of the Bitcoin,

2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:47.400
 to sell half a Bitcoin for $100,000

2:03:47.400 --> 2:03:49.720
 and pay off your house, your remaining house payment,

2:03:49.720 --> 2:03:51.080
 that's life changing to someone.

2:03:51.080 --> 2:03:52.040
 It really is.

2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:53.720
 And so you still have a Bitcoin,

2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:54.880
 so if Bitcoin goes to a million,

2:03:54.880 --> 2:03:56.520
 you're still gonna have half a million,

2:03:56.520 --> 2:03:58.120
 and you're gonna feel really, really rich

2:03:58.120 --> 2:03:59.120
 with that half a million dollars

2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:02.600
 because you bought it for effing $2,500, you know?

2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:06.120
 So yeah, so I would encourage anyone who's not uber rich

2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:08.920
 to, if you have huge profits, take a little bit of them

2:04:08.920 --> 2:04:10.560
 because it could change your life.

2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:14.760
 And if you hold it and it goes down,

2:04:14.760 --> 2:04:16.280
 you're going to feel the pain of that.

2:04:16.280 --> 2:04:19.800
 Like sometimes if you're more constrained financially,

2:04:19.800 --> 2:04:21.440
 it's much more psychologically difficult

2:04:21.440 --> 2:04:22.920
 to ride the ups and downs.

2:04:22.920 --> 2:04:23.760
 Yeah, it is for sure.

2:04:23.760 --> 2:04:26.480
 So they have these really fascinating things in Bitcoin.

2:04:26.480 --> 2:04:29.960
 Actually, one of the main guys on our podcast,

2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:31.560
 it's called Onchain Metrics.

2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:34.880
 So all wallet transactions are visible, you know?

2:04:34.880 --> 2:04:37.360
 And so they have all these fun categories.

2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:39.800
 So I think you said you don't like numbers, but.

2:04:39.800 --> 2:04:40.640
 I like numbers.

2:04:40.640 --> 2:04:41.480
 Oh, you love numbers.

2:04:41.480 --> 2:04:42.760
 So I love numbers also.

2:04:42.760 --> 2:04:44.160
 So they have all these different categories.

2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:49.160
 Like you can see how long a wallet has held a Bitcoin,

2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:51.640
 or how many Bitcoins are in a certain wallet.

2:04:51.640 --> 2:04:54.120
 And so what they've seen during the downturn,

2:04:54.120 --> 2:04:55.680
 so April it kind of peaked and went down,

2:04:55.680 --> 2:04:58.960
 is that the whales are still buying.

2:04:58.960 --> 2:05:01.840
 So whales, people of a thousand or more are still buying.

2:05:01.840 --> 2:05:04.000
 They've said the main group of sellers

2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:06.280
 is the ones who held it from zero to three months.

2:05:06.280 --> 2:05:07.720
 So like they don't have money.

2:05:07.720 --> 2:05:09.280
 They bought it because they thought it was going up.

2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:11.600
 And I was like, oh shit, I got to sell it, right?

2:05:11.600 --> 2:05:13.280
 Whereas anyone who's held it for a long time

2:05:13.280 --> 2:05:15.360
 is generally still holding on to it.

2:05:15.360 --> 2:05:16.200
 That's interesting.

2:05:16.200 --> 2:05:19.160
 That's a good indicator, right, for the whole space.

2:05:19.160 --> 2:05:20.000
 Yeah.

2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:21.720
 Well, let me ask you for some advice.

2:05:21.720 --> 2:05:24.120
 You've been through one heck of a career,

2:05:24.120 --> 2:05:25.520
 one heck of a life.

2:05:25.520 --> 2:05:28.520
 What advice would you give to a young person today?

2:05:28.520 --> 2:05:32.520
 Well, in wrestling, I think wrestling's really a microcosm

2:05:32.520 --> 2:05:33.800
 of what your life's going to be.

2:05:33.800 --> 2:05:36.520
 And that's why one of the things I stress to kids is like,

2:05:36.520 --> 2:05:38.080
 if we can go through this now and figure,

2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:39.520
 I have a couple of kids who are struggling

2:05:39.520 --> 2:05:40.360
 with certain things right now.

2:05:40.360 --> 2:05:42.800
 If you can figure it out this now in wrestling,

2:05:42.800 --> 2:05:44.200
 it's going to be a lot better to figure it out now

2:05:44.200 --> 2:05:46.120
 and get over this mental hump

2:05:46.120 --> 2:05:49.280
 than when you're 32 and you have two kids, right,

2:05:49.280 --> 2:05:50.920
 and your job's not going well.

2:05:50.920 --> 2:05:51.760
 It's going to be a lot worse.

2:05:51.760 --> 2:05:52.840
 It's going to be a lot more painful then.

2:05:52.840 --> 2:05:54.720
 Let's fucking figure it out now.

2:05:54.720 --> 2:05:56.280
 So a lot of these things, a lot of these lessons

2:05:56.280 --> 2:05:57.360
 we can learn from wrestling,

2:05:57.360 --> 2:06:00.680
 whether it's persistence or perseverance or work ethic,

2:06:00.680 --> 2:06:01.520
 or, you know what I said,

2:06:01.520 --> 2:06:03.640
 wrestlers show up on time and they work hard, right?

2:06:03.640 --> 2:06:05.920
 These things, if we can learn these things at an early age,

2:06:05.920 --> 2:06:08.280
 those are general, those characteristics

2:06:08.280 --> 2:06:10.720
 will generally carry on throughout our life.

2:06:10.720 --> 2:06:11.560
 And those are the things

2:06:11.560 --> 2:06:12.600
 that are going to make us really successful.

2:06:12.600 --> 2:06:15.840
 So, you know, I would say find a great coach,

2:06:15.840 --> 2:06:17.080
 someone who's going to spend a lot of time

2:06:17.080 --> 2:06:18.080
 and put a lot of time into you

2:06:18.080 --> 2:06:19.440
 and make sure they have a lot of wisdom

2:06:19.440 --> 2:06:22.440
 and steal all the wisdom that you can from them.

2:06:22.440 --> 2:06:25.680
 And then if you can be successful at one thing,

2:06:25.680 --> 2:06:27.520
 generally whatever that recipe was

2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:29.840
 that took you to be successful at that,

2:06:29.840 --> 2:06:31.760
 apply it to everything else, right?

2:06:31.760 --> 2:06:32.720
 Apply it to the rest of your life.

2:06:32.720 --> 2:06:36.040
 Apply it to getting a wife that you enjoy.

2:06:36.040 --> 2:06:38.640
 Apply it to living in a place you want to live,

2:06:38.640 --> 2:06:40.400
 doing a job you want to do, right?

2:06:40.400 --> 2:06:42.440
 There's so many possibilities

2:06:42.440 --> 2:06:44.280
 and you just have to be bold enough

2:06:44.280 --> 2:06:45.400
 to go take those chances.

2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:47.560
 It's interesting because early on in life

2:06:47.560 --> 2:06:49.960
 is when you have much more time.

2:06:49.960 --> 2:06:53.040
 People don't realize it's time to learn the lessons.

2:06:53.040 --> 2:06:55.640
 Like somehow later in life,

2:06:55.640 --> 2:06:57.440
 you get busier, responsibilities

2:06:57.440 --> 2:06:58.560
 and all that kind of stuff.

2:06:58.560 --> 2:07:00.200
 Like high school is a magical time.

2:07:00.200 --> 2:07:01.040
 You're in college.

2:07:01.040 --> 2:07:01.880
 You're in college, yeah, for sure.

2:07:01.880 --> 2:07:05.800
 Yeah, there's so much time to learn.

2:07:05.800 --> 2:07:07.120
 Well, you don't even have kids yet.

2:07:07.120 --> 2:07:09.480
 Yeah, I don't have kids, but that still fills up.

2:07:09.480 --> 2:07:10.840
 Well, no, I'm purpose.

2:07:10.840 --> 2:07:12.800
 And I did something that many people

2:07:12.800 --> 2:07:13.800
 don't seem to be able to do.

2:07:13.800 --> 2:07:15.840
 I walked away from a lot of responsibilities.

2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:17.240
 How?

2:07:17.240 --> 2:07:18.760
 By saying goodbye.

2:07:18.760 --> 2:07:19.640
 Oh, okay.

2:07:19.640 --> 2:07:23.280
 But meetings, everybody around me at MIT

2:07:23.280 --> 2:07:25.760
 was like meetings fill the day.

2:07:25.760 --> 2:07:27.480
 And then you have more projects

2:07:27.480 --> 2:07:30.400
 and you do a great job and you become successful.

2:07:30.400 --> 2:07:32.040
 And then the more meetings fill the day

2:07:32.040 --> 2:07:35.360
 and more responsibilities as opposed to like,

2:07:35.360 --> 2:07:38.920
 wait a minute, do I want to be involved in all these things?

2:07:38.920 --> 2:07:42.480
 And instead, do I want to find one or two things

2:07:42.480 --> 2:07:43.960
 to really focus on?

2:07:43.960 --> 2:07:46.000
 And that's what I choose.

2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:49.000
 But that becomes harder and harder

2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:50.360
 and harder as you get older.

2:07:50.360 --> 2:07:53.560
 No, I mean, I'm sure, and also the more success you have,

2:07:53.560 --> 2:07:56.240
 you become sought after other places too.

2:07:56.240 --> 2:07:57.440
 I'm sure that's happening with you.

2:07:57.440 --> 2:08:00.400
 And it's hard to keep saying no, no, no.

2:08:00.400 --> 2:08:01.280
 Saying no is hard.

2:08:01.280 --> 2:08:03.000
 Yeah.

2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:04.760
 You're known for roasting people

2:08:04.760 --> 2:08:08.680
 with a single boom roasted line.

2:08:08.680 --> 2:08:11.400
 So any ideas, maybe you want to mention malice,

2:08:11.400 --> 2:08:14.920
 but any ideas come to mind when you look at me?

2:08:14.920 --> 2:08:17.320
 Man, you know what?

2:08:17.320 --> 2:08:19.040
 If I was going to boom roast someone,

2:08:19.040 --> 2:08:21.240
 I would want to kind of like research their career

2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:23.280
 and dissect them and figure out their biggest negatives.

2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:24.120
 Get to the core.

2:08:24.120 --> 2:08:25.920
 And I didn't have that notion with you.

2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:28.320
 I figured, you know, I got a general sense of,

2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:30.680
 okay, he's really successful, he's super sharp.

2:08:30.680 --> 2:08:32.800
 He's really interested in some really interesting things.

2:08:32.800 --> 2:08:34.160
 I bet we'll have a great conversation,

2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:36.840
 but I had no intention to roast you.

2:08:36.840 --> 2:08:37.680
 Yeah, there you go.

2:08:37.680 --> 2:08:38.520
 What about malice?

2:08:38.520 --> 2:08:39.720
 You had dinner with him last night.

2:08:39.720 --> 2:08:40.880
 Hmm, for him.

2:08:42.200 --> 2:08:43.280
 Oh man.

2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:46.320
 How'd you get to know him, by the way?

2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:47.600
 Just Twitter.

2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:49.600
 Where's the most magical place in the world, right?

2:08:49.600 --> 2:08:51.360
 I always tell people it's the greatest source of information

2:08:51.360 --> 2:08:52.600
 if you know how to use it.

2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:54.840
 Hmm.

2:08:54.840 --> 2:08:56.520
 He's insane on Twitter, actually.

2:08:56.520 --> 2:08:57.360
 He's quite a lot.

2:08:57.360 --> 2:08:58.600
 So I had to unfollow him on Twitter,

2:08:58.600 --> 2:08:59.440
 because he was too much.

2:08:59.440 --> 2:09:00.280
 It was too intense?

2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:01.760
 No, it was too much, it fills up.

2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:03.600
 Like, I want to be able to consume the content.

2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:04.760
 So if I want to see something he says,

2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:06.880
 I can go to his page, right?

2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:08.600
 But it's just too much for my timeline.

2:09:08.600 --> 2:09:10.840
 I want to be able to consume who I follow.

2:09:10.840 --> 2:09:12.160
 So I try to not follow a lot of people,

2:09:12.160 --> 2:09:13.800
 because I want to be able to consume them.

2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:16.000
 And he was too much.

2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:18.640
 He fights the trolls, which,

2:09:18.640 --> 2:09:20.320
 I don't know why you'd ever fight the trolls.

2:09:20.320 --> 2:09:21.640
 There's just too many of them.

2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:22.760
 Well, he's a troll himself.

2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:25.560
 He's like the big troll fighting the little trolls.

2:09:25.560 --> 2:09:27.120
 He's the king troll.

2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:27.960
 There's a million of them.

2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:30.080
 So even if you kill 100,000,

2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:31.400
 there's still not 100,000 left.

2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:33.120
 You just gotta ignore them.

2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:35.120
 It's like the Nightwalker or whatever.

2:09:35.120 --> 2:09:36.440
 Yeah.

2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:39.240
 Well, I'll take it, because you had nothing,

2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:41.920
 you couldn't rose GSP out of respect, too.

2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:43.760
 So I'm just going to take that as a sign of respect.

2:09:43.760 --> 2:09:45.400
 What do you say bad about GSP?

2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:46.960
 Now I try to rose his hair.

2:09:46.960 --> 2:09:48.720
 Like, why are you trying to grow hair now

2:09:48.720 --> 2:09:49.880
 after all these years?

2:09:49.880 --> 2:09:50.920
 He looked good, bald.

2:09:50.920 --> 2:09:53.040
 Everyone loved him with his head shaved.

2:09:53.040 --> 2:09:53.960
 Now it looks kind of strange.

2:09:53.960 --> 2:09:55.080
 Like, why you got hair now?

2:09:55.080 --> 2:09:57.960
 Well, it was one of the more surreal moments of my life.

2:09:57.960 --> 2:10:01.440
 So he was here and he wore a black suit and tie.

2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:03.280
 Oh, really?

2:10:03.280 --> 2:10:04.120
 Yeah, we did the podcast with him,

2:10:04.120 --> 2:10:06.440
 just mirror image of me.

2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:08.600
 And then we also did, I haven't released it yet,

2:10:08.600 --> 2:10:09.880
 but just the video together.

2:10:09.880 --> 2:10:13.160
 And I was doing a martial arts stuff in a suit and tie.

2:10:13.160 --> 2:10:14.240
 That was quite,

2:10:14.240 --> 2:10:18.080
 that was quite, that's like,

2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:21.040
 like certain moments in your life are just like,

2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:22.680
 I can't believe I was part of that.

2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:24.800
 Yeah, with GSP, so yeah,

2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:27.160
 I don't think I have anything to rose him about.

2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:29.680
 I mean, maybe the Matt Serra thing

2:10:29.680 --> 2:10:32.520
 would be the one that you could get him with, you know?

2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:34.200
 I would be really fascinated,

2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:37.920
 like really dig deep from a sports psychology standpoint,

2:10:37.920 --> 2:10:39.640
 because he always talks about how much fear he had

2:10:39.640 --> 2:10:40.920
 when he was competing.

2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:43.960
 And I find that to be interesting because obviously,

2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:46.120
 so it's almost like, to me, it's almost like,

2:10:46.120 --> 2:10:48.880
 was he successful despite that?

2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:50.640
 Not because of that, right?

2:10:50.640 --> 2:10:53.120
 And because anxiety usually leads

2:10:53.120 --> 2:10:55.440
 to really negative performance for the majority of people.

2:10:55.440 --> 2:10:57.400
 And what was it about him

2:10:57.400 --> 2:10:59.800
 that the anxiety wasn't super negative?

2:10:59.800 --> 2:11:00.640
 You know what I'm saying?

2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:02.320
 Like, it's very interesting.

2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:03.160
 I wonder that too.

2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:05.360
 So I have, I wondered that about him,

2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:07.960
 but I have a huge amount of anxiety interacting,

2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:10.960
 especially with people, just about everything, yeah.

2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:13.480
 I wonder if that's helpful or not.

2:11:13.480 --> 2:11:15.200
 It feels like it's very helpful.

2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:17.800
 Well, I think, so okay, I think in two different ways.

2:11:17.800 --> 2:11:20.840
 So I think probably your everyday life, okay,

2:11:20.840 --> 2:11:25.200
 is different than like in a performance or a competition.

2:11:25.200 --> 2:11:27.600
 You have to be like super in the moment

2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:28.800
 of what you're doing.

2:11:28.800 --> 2:11:30.600
 So anything that's pulling you away,

2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:31.920
 like, oh my gosh, you know,

2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:33.760
 for high school kids, right, that coach.

2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:35.960
 Oh my gosh, that girl's in the stands,

2:11:35.960 --> 2:11:37.720
 and if I get beat, then,

2:11:37.720 --> 2:11:40.560
 and they're actively thinking about this other thing

2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:41.960
 when this is going on.

2:11:41.960 --> 2:11:44.440
 And I need 100% of your focus right here.

2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:47.040
 He's never, I don't think he has anxiety in the ring.

2:11:47.040 --> 2:11:47.880
 That's the point.

2:11:47.880 --> 2:11:50.160
 I think, like, I have the same thing.

2:11:50.160 --> 2:11:53.840
 Like if I have a really high performance thing

2:11:53.840 --> 2:11:55.800
 that I have to do, I don't know,

2:11:55.800 --> 2:11:57.080
 a lecture in front of a lot of people.

2:11:57.080 --> 2:11:58.720
 Yeah, that'd be a great example.

2:11:58.720 --> 2:12:02.040
 That, there's huge amount of anxiety weeks ahead,

2:12:02.040 --> 2:12:03.800
 days ahead, hours ahead.

2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:05.960
 So you have a system to get rid of it then?

2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:07.560
 As you perform. No, maybe,

2:12:07.560 --> 2:12:10.280
 but it's just the body gets rid of it somehow.

2:12:10.280 --> 2:12:11.560
 Yeah, there's not a system.

2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:12.920
 Subconscious system.

2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:14.760
 Yeah, it's self preservation.

2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:15.760
 So you don't actually have anxiety

2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:17.280
 while you're performing.

2:12:17.280 --> 2:12:19.880
 So that's like, so then that problem,

2:12:19.880 --> 2:12:21.920
 somehow that problem has solved itself, right?

2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:24.280
 The problem is when the anxiety is actually happening

2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:26.000
 while the wrestling match is happening,

2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:27.520
 that's the real issue.

2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:30.560
 Yeah, but it like sneaks in there too.

2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:33.000
 That's the difference, you know, MMA and wrestling

2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:37.080
 is there's no breaks in wrestling, right?

2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:39.960
 I guess there is, you can look at the crowd a little bit,

2:12:39.960 --> 2:12:42.400
 like you can look, so maybe,

2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:46.480
 but like the, there's other things we have to perform.

2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:48.360
 Well, there's more breaks, like a lecture,

2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:49.520
 you can catch yourself thinking,

2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:51.640
 like in this conversation, you know,

2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:54.400
 like I've said a bunch of stuff where I think,

2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:55.680
 why the hell did you say that?

2:12:55.680 --> 2:12:57.040
 That's dumb, right?

2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:00.200
 That's the anxiety because there's a pause

2:13:00.200 --> 2:13:02.560
 and that could be, I don't know,

2:13:02.560 --> 2:13:05.240
 I think it just pushes me to be better,

2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:08.160
 but maybe I could be way better if I let go of that.

2:13:08.160 --> 2:13:10.160
 It's scary to think that GSB, if you let go of that,

2:13:10.160 --> 2:13:11.000
 but he didn't.

2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:12.280
 Could he have been better?

2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:14.240
 Or did he ever, did he have a,

2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:17.160
 like you're saying like, you don't necessarily feel those.

2:13:17.160 --> 2:13:19.200
 So I think certain people that I've coached,

2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:21.560
 like they would describe how they would feel

2:13:21.560 --> 2:13:24.160
 literally during the wrestling match, right?

2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:27.080
 And you're saying like during the speech performance,

2:13:27.080 --> 2:13:28.600
 it's mostly gone.

2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:31.520
 And that's interesting to see if like,

2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:32.680
 he talked a lot about that,

2:13:32.680 --> 2:13:35.160
 but if it was all the way somehow gone,

2:13:35.160 --> 2:13:36.960
 and it means he would have a mechanism for it.

2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:38.200
 So like I had a really bad performance

2:13:38.200 --> 2:13:41.120
 my freshman year of high school at nationals,

2:13:41.120 --> 2:13:43.400
 cause I had the ability to be anxious.

2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:44.880
 And one of my coaches talked about like,

2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:48.160
 and a lot of A type personalities are kind of that way,

2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:49.720
 you know, because they're trying to consider

2:13:49.720 --> 2:13:52.000
 all possibilities at the same time.

2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.880
 And while we're actually performing or competing,

2:13:54.880 --> 2:13:57.520
 it's negative to performance, right?

2:13:57.520 --> 2:14:00.640
 So he said he would always leading up to the match

2:14:00.640 --> 2:14:03.520
 within say an hour, his name was talking about fishing.

2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:04.680
 He would get someone to talk about fishing with him

2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:06.280
 because it would stop him thinking about the match

2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:08.000
 and being uber anxious.

2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.360
 So I kind of took it to heart and it really helped me

2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:12.480
 as I would always like have someone to talk to

2:14:12.480 --> 2:14:14.760
 and just goof around about whatever.

2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:16.520
 So I'm not thinking about this thing.

2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:18.320
 And then once I step in, it's time to go.

2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:20.880
 So I didn't have this like anxious buildup.

2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:22.880
 Now it's how for me, I took it away, but like me,

2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:25.520
 you know, like you said, you have a way to get it away,

2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:26.360
 obviously, cause it's there and then it's not.

2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:28.200
 Yeah, I guess so, I guess there's a little tricks

2:14:28.200 --> 2:14:29.040
 you come up with.

2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:30.520
 Yeah, you start thinking about it's not fishing,

2:14:30.520 --> 2:14:32.520
 maybe I should try the fishing thing.

2:14:32.520 --> 2:14:34.320
 I hate fishing, so boring.

2:14:34.320 --> 2:14:37.120
 But maybe it's good to think about that.

2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:40.360
 All right, Ben, this is, like I told you, I'm a big fan.

2:14:40.360 --> 2:14:42.240
 I'm a big fan of your wrestling, your fighting,

2:14:42.240 --> 2:14:44.240
 your personality.

2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:45.200
 Thank you for coming down.

2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:46.160
 Thank you for talking today.

2:14:46.160 --> 2:14:47.000
 Appreciate it.

2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:48.120
 It's a huge honor.

2:14:48.120 --> 2:14:49.880
 Bam, let's go wrestle.

2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:53.480

 And now let me leave you with some words

2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:01.480
 from Muhammad Ali.

2:15:01.480 --> 2:15:05.520
 Only a man who knows what it is like to be defeated

2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:08.720
 can reach down to the bottom of his soul

2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:12.000
 and come up with the extra ounce of power it takes

2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:14.600
 to win when the match is even.

2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:34.600
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
