00:00.000 --> 00:04.120
 when you imagine a song, is it the opening you imagine?

00:04.120 --> 00:08.440
 No, it's kind of a, I never think opening,

00:08.440 --> 00:12.120
 I never think final, I think soundscape

00:12.120 --> 00:14.160
 of how I'm feeling right now.

00:14.160 --> 00:15.760
 So it could be the middle of the song

00:15.760 --> 00:18.240
 for all I know when I'm doing that.

00:18.240 --> 00:22.640
 But my process for me is very much lyrics and melody

00:22.640 --> 00:25.440
 and music really come at the same time.

00:25.440 --> 00:30.440
 Like by same time, I mean, as I'm expressing maybe,

00:32.920 --> 00:33.760
 I'm feeling like.

00:33.760 --> 00:38.760
 Puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.280
 Like it's not that simple, but it's like,

00:42.280 --> 00:45.480
 I'll hear it like, it's like, here's all the orchestra

00:45.480 --> 00:47.480
 and you're kind of just pressing all the buttons at once.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.700
 And melody and my voice is just one of those instruments.

00:51.700 --> 00:56.340
 The following is a conversation with Dan Reynolds,

00:56.340 --> 00:58.660
 the lead singer of Imagine Dragons,

00:58.660 --> 01:00.920
 one of the most popular bands in the world

01:00.920 --> 01:04.980
 with over 75 million records sold and with four songs

01:04.980 --> 01:08.460
 being streamed over a billion times on Spotify.

01:08.460 --> 01:11.520
 Given all that, Dan is one of the most down to earth,

01:11.520 --> 01:14.260
 kind, thoughtful and fascinating human beings

01:14.260 --> 01:17.020
 I've ever met, grounded in part

01:17.020 --> 01:20.500
 by his lifelong struggle with mental health.

01:20.500 --> 01:24.200
 The darkness, the love and the creative brilliance

01:24.200 --> 01:26.900
 are all there in this one humble mind.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.340
 For this reason and many others, we became fast friends.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.740
 Plus, he recently started his journey in programming,

01:33.740 --> 01:37.340
 which funny enough is where we start this wide ranging,

01:37.340 --> 01:40.280
 deeply personal and fun conversation.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.100
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.260
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:44.260 --> 01:45.460
 in the description.

01:45.460 --> 01:48.700
 And now, dear friends, here's Dan Reynolds.

01:48.700 --> 01:51.060
 So, we were talking offline

01:51.060 --> 01:53.300
 that you're not just getting into programming.

01:53.300 --> 01:57.440
 What's the most beautiful program you've ever written?

01:57.440 --> 01:58.940
 Something that brought you joy?

02:01.100 --> 02:04.540
 There's something, I really love completion.

02:04.540 --> 02:07.180
 It's the reason that I'm addicted to songwriting.

02:07.180 --> 02:11.140
 I like there being nothing and then having some blocks

02:11.140 --> 02:14.620
 or tools and building them into what you want it

02:14.620 --> 02:18.540
 to look like and then I find it incredibly rewarding

02:18.540 --> 02:23.260
 to stand back and look at what you did at the end.

02:23.260 --> 02:24.140
 It could be anything.

02:24.140 --> 02:27.500
 For me, it was as simple to begin with

02:27.500 --> 02:30.860
 as just because it's object oriented,

02:30.860 --> 02:33.940
 like making a cube move.

02:33.940 --> 02:36.040
 As simple as that, understanding that

02:36.040 --> 02:38.540
 and knowing that I built that and made it do that

02:39.420 --> 02:43.020
 is really rewarding and I think it's the thing

02:43.020 --> 02:46.580
 that drew me into wanting to learn more.

02:46.580 --> 02:51.580
 But as far as what is some big piece of code

02:52.020 --> 02:54.220
 that I've done, absolutely not.

02:54.220 --> 02:55.540
 I'm still at a level where it's more like

02:55.540 --> 02:59.580
 what is a tutorial that I followed and got,

02:59.580 --> 03:03.700
 and then, yeah, so I couldn't say I'm at a level

03:03.700 --> 03:06.060
 where I've done anything beautiful at all in code.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.740
 But you're also interested in potentially,

03:08.740 --> 03:11.240
 like your heart is drawn to creating games.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.360
 Creating anything.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.460
 And completing it.

03:15.460 --> 03:16.300
 Yeah.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.660
 To feel good as it's done.

03:18.660 --> 03:21.860
 Yeah, I mean, I've been working over the last two years

03:23.140 --> 03:27.020
 with actually a team out of Kiev on,

03:27.020 --> 03:28.900
 and we can get into that, it's a whole other story,

03:28.900 --> 03:30.620
 but on a computer game.

03:30.620 --> 03:34.020
 And really, I've kept that kind of under wraps,

03:34.020 --> 03:37.320
 but yeah, we're kind of getting to a point now

03:37.320 --> 03:39.460
 where we have a prototype that we can play

03:39.460 --> 03:42.380
 and it's a lot of fun and thankfully,

03:42.380 --> 03:45.340
 all the team members are in safe places now.

03:45.340 --> 03:47.020
 Things have obviously been on hold for a little bit,

03:47.020 --> 03:50.500
 but when that started is when I really decided,

03:50.500 --> 03:53.980
 okay, I need to understand base level coding in C Sharp,

03:53.980 --> 03:56.780
 so I'm not an idiot talking to these people.

03:56.780 --> 03:58.540
 And so it's, yeah, we've been doing that

03:58.540 --> 03:59.380
 for a couple of years.

03:59.380 --> 04:02.780
 Is there any parallels between the final completion

04:02.780 --> 04:05.020
 that you feel with programming?

04:05.020 --> 04:07.100
 Which I think is a little bit more definitive.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.940
 Like there's debugging, the code doesn't work,

04:08.940 --> 04:09.980
 it's messy and so on.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.460
 There's the early design stages,

04:11.460 --> 04:14.340
 you're not sure how to have functions and classes,

04:14.340 --> 04:15.180
 how it's all gonna work.

04:15.180 --> 04:17.820
 And then it comes together and it's really done

04:17.820 --> 04:21.180
 because it works and there's a cube moving on the screen.

04:21.180 --> 04:23.940
 Is there any parallels between that and music?

04:23.940 --> 04:27.980
 Because are you really ever done done with a song?

04:27.980 --> 04:30.940
 It's exactly the same thing for me,

04:30.940 --> 04:33.460
 just in that it's art.

04:33.460 --> 04:38.460
 I really believe that we have not fully encapsulated artists.

04:39.660 --> 04:42.940
 Like when we say art, I think most people think,

04:42.940 --> 04:46.700
 okay, the medium must be painting or drawing

04:46.700 --> 04:50.300
 or music or writing.

04:50.300 --> 04:53.580
 But I really believe anytime you're creating some things,

04:53.580 --> 04:58.140
 engineers, for instance, you're creating something

04:58.140 --> 05:01.820
 with tools that you have and it can be incredibly beautiful.

05:03.340 --> 05:07.780
 And so yeah, I think, and it's never done.

05:07.780 --> 05:09.700
 I feel like I look at songs that I've done

05:09.700 --> 05:14.700
 and I never felt you have to let go or I have to let go.

05:15.620 --> 05:16.460
 And that's all I've,

05:16.460 --> 05:18.940
 I'm just continually making myself let go.

05:18.940 --> 05:20.220
 But I look at songs that I've done

05:20.220 --> 05:25.220
 and wish I had done more or kept going down that road

05:25.500 --> 05:26.660
 and what would have happened.

05:26.660 --> 05:30.500
 And I'm really contained to, because of what our band is

05:30.500 --> 05:34.140
 and what our fans expect and there's so much more to it

05:34.140 --> 05:38.300
 that it's like I'm fitting in a box always.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.100
 And it's like, this song shouldn't be longer

05:41.100 --> 05:42.500
 than three minutes and 30 seconds.

05:42.500 --> 05:46.100
 And I don't know if I remember the chorus after I heard it.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.980
 Maybe I need to hear the chorus three times

05:47.980 --> 05:49.140
 instead of those two times.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.820
 It's like, there's certain, especially in pop music,

05:52.820 --> 05:54.680
 it's really hard to,

05:59.660 --> 06:02.340
 yeah, it feels like there's confines,

06:02.340 --> 06:03.940
 even though people are like, well, there's no confines,

06:03.940 --> 06:05.620
 but still everybody's writing a pop song

06:05.620 --> 06:06.940
 that's a few minutes.

06:06.940 --> 06:08.740
 And are those explicit in your mind

06:08.740 --> 06:12.820
 or are they just kinda, the gut is, like you said, chorus.

06:12.820 --> 06:15.380
 Should you have chorus once, twice or three times?

06:15.380 --> 06:17.500
 Is that a gut thing or is that a rule thing?

06:17.500 --> 06:18.940
 You know, I think it's a rule.

06:18.940 --> 06:20.900
 I mean, it's obviously a rule I impose on myself.

06:20.900 --> 06:24.800
 Nobody's in my house saying, hey, Dan,

06:24.800 --> 06:26.780
 if you don't do this, I'm gonna punish you.

06:26.780 --> 06:29.780
 There's no major label president that's like,

06:29.780 --> 06:32.480
 Imagine Dragons needs to make pop music, Dan.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.320
 You know what I mean?

06:33.320 --> 06:35.180
 My manager doesn't even tell me that.

06:35.180 --> 06:40.180
 I do it because it's what I perceive to be enjoyable.

06:40.660 --> 06:43.620
 I grew up listening to a ton of pop music,

06:43.620 --> 06:46.660
 and then I ended up being in what is quote, unquote,

06:46.660 --> 06:49.580
 a rock band, which I've never perceived it as that,

06:49.580 --> 06:53.340
 but that's kinda what the world has called it,

06:53.340 --> 06:54.820
 and that's fine, but.

06:56.060 --> 06:58.660
 So you're a prisoner of a prison

06:58.660 --> 07:00.660
 that you yourself constructed.

07:00.660 --> 07:01.500
 There you go.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.580
 Well, I'm a happy, I guess what I'm trying to say

07:04.580 --> 07:06.780
 is I'm a happy prisoner of the prison

07:06.780 --> 07:08.460
 that I have created for myself,

07:08.460 --> 07:11.260
 and I made that prison thinking that it was a mansion.

07:11.260 --> 07:12.540
 So you worked with Rick Rubin.

07:12.540 --> 07:14.900
 What does Rick think about your prison?

07:16.260 --> 07:21.260
 Rick was, you know, it was interesting to hear

07:22.420 --> 07:25.220
 his outside opinion when we first met,

07:25.220 --> 07:30.220
 because my biggest focus for so much of my life,

07:30.220 --> 07:34.820
 my biggest fear was, and this stems from, I think,

07:34.820 --> 07:36.060
 middle schools when it started,

07:36.060 --> 07:40.740
 but everyone being in on a joke except for yourself.

07:40.740 --> 07:44.340
 I really, like, the thought of thinking

07:44.340 --> 07:47.840
 you're good at something, and really, you're terrible at it,

07:47.840 --> 07:49.340
 and you're surrounded by people who are saying,

07:49.340 --> 07:50.940
 yeah, you're good at it, and then by themselves,

07:50.940 --> 07:53.100
 they're like, he's terrible at this.

07:53.100 --> 07:56.580
 Just kind of, and not just in regards to music or art,

07:56.580 --> 07:59.020
 but anything in life, and I think maybe

07:59.020 --> 08:02.180
 from having six older brothers, it stems from that too,

08:02.180 --> 08:05.420
 like, always feeling inadequate,

08:05.420 --> 08:08.320
 and like, the annoying younger brother, you know?

08:10.060 --> 08:12.800
 But anyway, so Rick's, and that's something

08:12.800 --> 08:14.460
 I've learned to let go of as I've gotten older

08:14.460 --> 08:18.780
 and had life experiences, but one of the things

08:18.780 --> 08:21.840
 that Rick said really early on that has stuck with me

08:21.840 --> 08:25.000
 was he said, yeah, you know, we're resuming

08:25.000 --> 08:26.340
 the first time we met.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.860
 He said, I'd really like to work with you

08:27.860 --> 08:32.860
 because I feel like you're not confined to a sound.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.060
 You've done a lot of different sounds,

08:36.060 --> 08:38.100
 and so it's exciting because I feel like your fans

08:38.100 --> 08:41.380
 are forgiving more than other rock bands or bands,

08:41.380 --> 08:45.620
 because most people, when they hear a band,

08:45.620 --> 08:47.780
 it's like, there's a very specific sound with it.

08:47.780 --> 08:50.700
 It's like, they do folk music, or they do, like,

08:50.700 --> 08:55.580
 California rock, or they do surf, or they do, you know,

08:55.580 --> 08:59.500
 like, there's, and your fans kind of want that.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.580
 Like, they want them to do that thing,

09:01.580 --> 09:04.300
 and then they don't do it, and sometimes that goes well,

09:04.300 --> 09:07.180
 but a lot of times it doesn't, and people, you know,

09:07.180 --> 09:09.300
 critics and everybody is like, go back to the thing

09:09.300 --> 09:11.440
 that you did good and do that.

09:12.680 --> 09:17.260
 Rick was, felt, whether he was right or wrong,

09:17.260 --> 09:22.260
 that we could do, we hopped genres so much,

09:22.260 --> 09:26.180
 and that's been to our benefit and detriment, I think.

09:27.380 --> 09:28.300
 Why detriment?

09:29.420 --> 09:32.660
 Because people want you to be something.

09:32.660 --> 09:35.500
 It's more, you can believe it more.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.840
 I, you know, it's like.

09:38.380 --> 09:40.540
 It's more authentic if you never change.

09:40.540 --> 09:42.100
 I guess, I don't know.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.900
 I mean, certainly it's not something I subscribe to

09:44.900 --> 09:47.980
 because I create music, but I also grew up listening

09:47.980 --> 09:50.820
 to a lot of different genres, like, cats,

09:50.820 --> 09:53.460
 I would listen to, like, Cat Stevens,

09:53.460 --> 09:55.540
 and the next song would be, like, Biggie,

09:55.540 --> 09:58.140
 and then the next song would be Nirvana,

09:58.140 --> 10:00.740
 and it was like, I like a lot of,

10:00.740 --> 10:03.460
 and then Billy Joel, and then Enya.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.420
 It was like, you know what I mean?

10:04.420 --> 10:07.180
 I was a product, and I was a product of the 90s,

10:07.180 --> 10:09.900
 which, if you listen to 90s music, it really was all,

10:09.900 --> 10:12.580
 a lot of reason that people say, well, 90s were terrible.

10:12.580 --> 10:14.140
 Like, a lot of people say that.

10:14.140 --> 10:16.780
 I love the 90s, they were my favorite decade of music.

10:16.780 --> 10:21.780
 It was, there was a lot of genre hopping,

10:22.020 --> 10:24.940
 and I don't know, I love that.

10:24.940 --> 10:27.740
 She had the, 90s had the boy bands,

10:27.740 --> 10:30.780
 and it had Pearl Jam, and Nirvana.

10:30.780 --> 10:34.020
 And it had a lot of, like, women of the 90s

10:34.020 --> 10:36.660
 was probably, is probably my biggest influence,

10:36.660 --> 10:41.060
 like, kind of that, like, angry rock women of the 90s,

10:41.060 --> 10:43.220
 like, Lannis Morissette, Jagged Little Pills,

10:43.220 --> 10:45.420
 one of my favorite records of all time.

10:45.420 --> 10:48.180
 The lyrics were so intimate,

10:48.180 --> 10:52.260
 and I don't know if she was angry or not.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.140
 Sorry, if she wasn't.

10:54.140 --> 10:55.540
 Yeah, but there was an anger to it.

10:55.540 --> 10:57.700
 There was angst, yeah, it was like angstiness.

10:57.700 --> 11:01.820
 And that in hip hop of the 90s influences me,

11:01.820 --> 11:02.820
 and then my dad.

11:02.820 --> 11:04.140
 So, anything my dad listened to,

11:04.140 --> 11:05.540
 which my dad didn't listen to any of that.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.420
 My dad listened to, like, Harry Nelson and the Beatles,

11:08.420 --> 11:13.420
 Cat Stevens, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Billy Joel.

11:13.420 --> 11:15.900
 It was very much like singer, songwriter.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.460
 Do you mind if we, throughout this,

11:17.460 --> 11:18.300
 listen to a few songs?

11:18.300 --> 11:19.380
 Because you mentioned Harry Nelson,

11:19.380 --> 11:23.660
 and I was actually, yesterday and the day before,

11:23.660 --> 11:24.820
 listening to a lot of his stuff,

11:24.820 --> 11:28.560
 and it's just like, damn, he's good.

11:28.560 --> 11:33.140
 And not as known as he should be.

11:33.140 --> 11:35.980
 Like, I was getting, do you mind if I play?

11:35.980 --> 11:37.140
 No, please, yeah.

11:37.140 --> 11:41.420
 I don't know, not to open this conversation

11:41.420 --> 11:43.460
 to the love song.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.060
 I would like that, actually, Lex.

11:46.780 --> 11:49.740
 But Without You is an incredible song.

11:49.740 --> 11:51.400
 Oh, man, that's, yeah.

11:52.820 --> 11:56.020
 And the heartbreak and the longing.

11:57.940 --> 12:02.740
 No, I can't forget the feeling of your face.

12:02.740 --> 12:04.940
 He's the best to do it, in my opinion.

12:04.940 --> 12:06.260
 In my opinion, he's the best to do it.

12:06.260 --> 12:10.900
 But I guess that's just the way the story goes.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.260
 And just the sadness of, like,

12:17.780 --> 12:21.300
 there's something, I don't even wanna talk over him,

12:21.300 --> 12:23.100
 because this is one of my favorite songs, too,

12:23.100 --> 12:28.100
 but I think people have a really good bullshit indicator.

12:30.020 --> 12:34.940
 And music, in my opinion,

12:34.940 --> 12:36.540
 whenever I meet a young artist and say,

12:36.540 --> 12:38.380
 well, I'm trying to make a new band,

12:38.380 --> 12:40.900
 and I wanna do something like how to be successful,

12:40.900 --> 12:44.340
 I really think understanding

12:44.340 --> 12:47.460
 that people have a really good bullshit indicator

12:47.460 --> 12:50.920
 is the most important part of being an artist.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.980
 And I'll explain what that means, at least to me.

12:55.340 --> 13:00.340
 I think that in order to have success

13:01.420 --> 13:05.860
 or be a leader or whether it's an art or anything,

13:05.860 --> 13:08.700
 people need to believe that you believe what you're doing.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.780
 I think the best actors,

13:13.780 --> 13:15.540
 really, when they're doing their thing,

13:15.540 --> 13:18.420
 it's like they, it's not acting.

13:18.420 --> 13:22.100
 They're in it, and it's how they feel,

13:22.100 --> 13:25.820
 and they're expressing that sorrow or joy or whatever it is.

13:25.820 --> 13:30.820
 Harry, for me, Harry Nilsen, I just believe it.

13:30.900 --> 13:33.660
 He sings that, and I feel it.

13:33.660 --> 13:36.860
 And whether he's the greatest bullshitter of all time,

13:36.860 --> 13:37.960
 I don't think that's the case.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.580
 I think he probably was singing that song,

13:39.580 --> 13:43.400
 and he just could transport himself to wherever he was.

13:44.620 --> 13:46.880
 It's what makes a great live act.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.260
 It's what makes a great song.

13:49.260 --> 13:51.660
 And someone could be the best actor

13:51.660 --> 13:56.380
 and sing that in the same timbre, same EQ,

13:56.380 --> 13:59.140
 same compression, same everything.

13:59.140 --> 14:02.160
 And there's some unknown there that I,

14:02.160 --> 14:06.080
 I think, hopefully, it will be known at some point,

14:06.080 --> 14:07.040
 and it's some scientific thing,

14:07.040 --> 14:10.480
 but there's something there, the energy or something,

14:10.480 --> 14:14.640
 that people can perceive it and say true or false.

14:14.640 --> 14:18.080
 And if it resonates as true, it's so much more meaningful,

14:18.080 --> 14:19.360
 and it lives on.

14:19.360 --> 14:24.600
 And if it doesn't, that, for me, is what is good art or bad.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.960
 For people to dispute over,

14:25.960 --> 14:28.000
 well, sonics should sound like that, silly to me.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.180
 It's like a song or even a painting, like,

14:33.280 --> 14:36.000
 it's just the truthfulness of it.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.480
 Yeah, the truly great art goes,

14:40.480 --> 14:44.280
 has to go to that place where you really are feeling it.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.160
 Like, you forget that you're being recorded.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.560
 You forget there's an audience.

14:47.560 --> 14:48.880
 You really are feeling it.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.160
 Yeah, which I totally agree with you.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.060
 One of the things that I love about the internet

14:56.060 --> 15:01.060
 is it's brought the bullshit detector of the masses

15:02.960 --> 15:04.960
 to power, which is beautiful,

15:04.960 --> 15:09.040
 because then the masses uplift the really authentic.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.840
 And even if you didn't write the song,

15:11.840 --> 15:15.160
 I think it helps a lot, probably, if you wrote the song.

15:15.160 --> 15:19.000
 But I was a little bit, maybe a lot,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
 since we're in Vegas, a little heartbroken

15:21.000 --> 15:24.480
 that to find out that Elvis didn't write his songs.

15:24.480 --> 15:29.480
 But I like, for example, Rocketman, Elton John,

15:30.620 --> 15:33.900
 like, to find out that Elton John didn't really know

15:33.900 --> 15:36.500
 where the words of Rocketman came from,

15:36.500 --> 15:39.260
 meaning, like, the depths of it, it's interesting.

15:39.260 --> 15:42.060
 But nevertheless, he's super authentic,

15:42.060 --> 15:44.740
 because for Elton John and for Elvis,

15:44.740 --> 15:48.320
 there's something in the fun and the darkness

15:48.320 --> 15:49.620
 and the entertainment of it.

15:49.620 --> 15:51.740
 Like, he goes to someplace in his mind

15:51.740 --> 15:53.500
 that might not be deeply connected

15:53.500 --> 15:55.700
 from where the lyrics came from.

15:55.700 --> 15:56.780
 But he relates it.

15:56.780 --> 15:59.540
 He relates it to whatever is in his mind

15:59.540 --> 16:01.420
 and goes to that place emotionally.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.220
 Yeah, and that's what I think it is.

16:03.220 --> 16:04.740
 And that's why an actor, like I said,

16:04.740 --> 16:07.260
 can be completely honest to me.

16:07.260 --> 16:08.980
 Maybe they didn't write the script.

16:08.980 --> 16:12.480
 But I write, like, I've always written all my own lyrics.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.960
 It's a really personal thing to me.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.440
 But I will say, I see people all the time

16:18.440 --> 16:22.140
 who are performers like Elton John, for instance,

16:22.140 --> 16:26.140
 who didn't write the lyrics that I believe

16:26.140 --> 16:29.500
 that it means just as much to them as what I wrote,

16:29.500 --> 16:33.220
 because they find the meaning in it for themself.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.500
 At least the greats do.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.580
 And I think that's the difference maker.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.160
 And I think you can perceive,

16:39.160 --> 16:43.080
 and I'm sure you've seen art that doesn't move you,

16:43.080 --> 16:44.260
 and maybe it moves someone else.

16:44.260 --> 16:45.660
 But for you, for some reason,

16:45.660 --> 16:50.100
 you perceive it to be uninteresting to you.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.060
 And I feel like a lot of the time,

16:52.060 --> 16:53.780
 I'm saying that it's, of course, sonically,

16:53.780 --> 16:54.900
 maybe it's uninteresting to you.

16:54.900 --> 16:58.020
 But I think the majority of the time, for myself,

16:58.020 --> 17:02.420
 I can find inspiration in any sonic value or painting

17:02.420 --> 17:04.780
 as long as I see it and I feel truth

17:04.780 --> 17:06.900
 from the person that created it.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.420
 Yeah, and for me, the lyrics,

17:10.420 --> 17:12.040
 maybe not the entirety of the lyrics,

17:12.040 --> 17:16.180
 but a few words can do wonders to take you to a place.

17:16.180 --> 17:18.260
 And sometimes those words don't need to be connected

17:18.260 --> 17:19.600
 with the other words.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.260
 That's the beauty of music.

17:21.260 --> 17:25.500
 They're allowed to float in the space of mixed metaphors.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.100
 They're allowed to just jump around,

17:27.100 --> 17:29.540
 and somehow it paints a picture without actually,

17:31.040 --> 17:33.180
 what is it, glycerine by Bush?

17:33.180 --> 17:35.820
 Right, but it's also how the person says it, right?

17:35.820 --> 17:39.940
 It's like, it's the feeling of exactly,

17:39.940 --> 17:42.420
 and the same person could say that word 10 other ways

17:42.420 --> 17:43.660
 and you don't care.

17:43.660 --> 17:46.120
 But someone says glycerine or whatever it is,

17:46.120 --> 17:48.620
 and it's like, oh, you know what?

17:48.620 --> 17:51.060
 I feel that for some reason.

17:51.060 --> 17:53.420
 The way he said that, he meant it to me.

17:53.420 --> 17:54.420
 You know what I mean?

17:56.700 --> 17:59.220
 No, I can't forget this evening

17:59.220 --> 18:00.980
 or your face as you were leaving,

18:00.980 --> 18:03.480
 but I guess that's just the way the story goes.

18:04.580 --> 18:07.700
 You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows.

18:07.700 --> 18:08.800
 Yes, it shows.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.280
 Let me ask you to analyze this song.

18:13.500 --> 18:18.500
 Do you, so there's a lady possibly who's leaving him.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.440
 Do you think he's leaving her or she's leaving him?

18:22.580 --> 18:23.420
 She went to.

18:24.380 --> 18:29.380
 When I think of all my sorrow, and I had you there,

18:29.820 --> 18:32.280
 but then I let you go.

18:34.640 --> 18:39.640
 And now it's only fair that I should let you know

18:41.980 --> 18:43.380
 what you should know.

18:43.380 --> 18:45.260
 And then the chorus says, I can't live

18:45.260 --> 18:46.860
 if living is without you.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.020
 I can't live, I can't give anymore.

18:52.060 --> 18:53.620
 He's got a voice on him.

18:53.620 --> 18:54.580
 Yeah, he does.

18:54.580 --> 18:57.740
 And if you really, there's been some incredible

18:57.740 --> 19:00.520
 documentation on his life and the end of his life.

19:00.520 --> 19:04.800
 And so my answer to this is probably skewed

19:04.800 --> 19:06.920
 based on what I've seen about his life too,

19:06.920 --> 19:10.600
 but he was a real alcoholic at the end of his life

19:10.600 --> 19:15.600
 and it destroyed his voice and ended up killing him as well.

19:18.700 --> 19:22.540
 And so when I hear that, I perceive it as

19:25.300 --> 19:28.340
 someone who is destructive and in a destructive place

19:28.340 --> 19:30.860
 in life and can't love someone properly.

19:30.860 --> 19:32.140
 And so they can't live with them,

19:32.140 --> 19:34.100
 but they can't live without them type thing,

19:34.100 --> 19:36.720
 which is really something that I really identify with

19:36.720 --> 19:41.720
 and I think is one of the struggles of life

19:42.220 --> 19:47.220
 is loving yourself enough, forgiving yourself for things

19:50.060 --> 19:52.100
 and letting yourself love someone else.

19:52.100 --> 19:56.260
 And at least when I listened out, I hear Harry being like,

19:56.260 --> 19:58.460
 and maybe I'm wrong, but this is how I perceive it at least

19:58.460 --> 20:03.460
 is not loving himself and feeling like he's deserving

20:04.500 --> 20:06.260
 of this person, like I have to let you go.

20:06.260 --> 20:07.660
 I hear that, of course, and people always say,

20:07.660 --> 20:09.380
 oh, well, he's breaking up with her,

20:09.380 --> 20:11.460
 but there's so much more complexity and nuance

20:11.460 --> 20:15.340
 to relationships than that and my wife and I

20:15.340 --> 20:17.860
 went through really difficult separation

20:19.620 --> 20:22.460
 and that's a story for another day

20:22.460 --> 20:24.100
 or different question or something,

20:24.100 --> 20:27.860
 but the nuance of it makes me think of this

20:27.860 --> 20:32.260
 when I hear this, which is there's just more

20:32.260 --> 20:34.540
 to being with someone or not being with someone

20:34.540 --> 20:37.900
 than hey, I think that person's really attractive

20:37.900 --> 20:40.020
 or hey, that person makes me laugh or not

20:40.020 --> 20:42.420
 or I love them and now I don't love them.

20:42.420 --> 20:44.700
 Love is such a complex, nuanced thing

20:44.700 --> 20:47.620
 that a lot of times, there's just more going on

20:47.620 --> 20:49.540
 behind the scenes, I think.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.500
 Yeah, and a small tangent on that,

20:52.500 --> 20:56.180
 just as a curious question, have you paid any attention

20:56.180 --> 20:58.820
 to the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trials?

20:58.820 --> 21:00.940
 I have watched quite a bit of it

21:00.940 --> 21:02.500
 because my wife really loves it

21:02.500 --> 21:04.660
 and she watches it in bed at night.

21:04.660 --> 21:06.620
 So it's raw, to me it's really,

21:06.620 --> 21:10.380
 because you've mentioned how complicated love can be

21:10.380 --> 21:12.700
 and it's, I've never seen, I don't care

21:12.700 --> 21:14.300
 about the celebrity nature of it.

21:14.300 --> 21:17.900
 I don't care if it was, I don't care who it is,

21:17.900 --> 21:21.180
 but it's just laid out in such raw form.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.980
 For the world to see it.

21:22.980 --> 21:24.860
 For the world to see the toxicity,

21:24.860 --> 21:29.860
 but also the passion and clearly the drugs

21:29.860 --> 21:33.900
 and the drinking, but also like the longing

21:33.900 --> 21:36.700
 and the dreams and I will always be with you,

21:36.700 --> 21:41.220
 I will die for you, the places, the rollercoaster of love

21:41.220 --> 21:46.220
 and it's all there at the end, past the end.

21:47.020 --> 21:49.900
 So it's like, I've also recently reread

21:49.900 --> 21:51.660
 The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich

21:51.660 --> 21:53.780
 about Hitler and Nazi Germany.

21:53.780 --> 21:56.520
 It's the rise and the fall and it's interesting

21:56.520 --> 21:58.820
 to look at the entirety of that process

21:58.820 --> 22:02.420
 after it's all over, many, many decades after it's all over.

22:02.420 --> 22:04.220
 That book in particular written by the person

22:04.220 --> 22:07.460
 that was actually there and so here we're seeing

22:07.460 --> 22:11.100
 two people in the context of the courtroom

22:11.100 --> 22:14.100
 analyzing this rise and fall of a love affair.

22:15.180 --> 22:16.020
 It's fascinating.

22:16.020 --> 22:18.440
 You know the truth is, I was telling my wife this actually

22:18.440 --> 22:20.420
 just the other day because she was asking me

22:20.420 --> 22:22.300
 what I thought about it.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.840
 It makes me really sad.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.780
 It's humorous, don't get me wrong.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.980
 There's a lot of parts in it that are just really funny.

22:30.900 --> 22:34.620
 But I look at it and I also see the internet

22:34.620 --> 22:38.260
 and someone's always the villain and someone's the hero

22:38.260 --> 22:40.780
 which is such a funny thing and we talked a little

22:40.780 --> 22:42.160
 about this offline before we got on this

22:42.160 --> 22:44.420
 but I have a real firm belief in life

22:44.420 --> 22:49.420
 that it's just more complex than you think, always, always.

22:50.860 --> 22:54.100
 Johnny for instance is very charismatic

22:54.100 --> 22:58.460
 and you love him and he's funny and the way he does things

22:58.460 --> 23:00.660
 and he looks certain ways and he says things.

23:02.580 --> 23:04.380
 You really love him and I feel like,

23:04.380 --> 23:05.660
 and maybe I'm wrong on this but it looks like

23:05.660 --> 23:09.260
 the internet is really, Johnny is the winner,

23:09.260 --> 23:13.260
 Amber is the villain and I kind of look at it

23:13.260 --> 23:16.980
 and I feel like, were any of you in their bedroom?

23:16.980 --> 23:19.500
 Were any of you there for these things?

23:19.500 --> 23:22.540
 And I'm not saying one way or the other.

23:22.540 --> 23:26.160
 All I see when I look at that is two people

23:26.160 --> 23:30.140
 with a lot of deep seeded hurt, anger

23:30.140 --> 23:32.940
 and that anger is so poisonous to both of them

23:32.940 --> 23:34.720
 and they're getting through it in the way

23:34.720 --> 23:38.100
 that they only know how and I'm not saying

23:38.100 --> 23:40.660
 we shouldn't be able to look at parts of it

23:40.660 --> 23:43.620
 and laugh about it and stuff and be virtuous or something

23:43.620 --> 23:46.740
 but just that there's not a hero.

23:46.740 --> 23:47.860
 It's more complicated.

23:47.860 --> 23:52.020
 Yeah, I think unless you've been living with Amber

23:52.020 --> 23:53.700
 and Johnny, you don't know and just because

23:53.700 --> 23:55.580
 one seems more charismatic in the moment

23:55.580 --> 23:58.340
 or funnier or more believable even,

23:58.340 --> 24:01.740
 doesn't mean that their truth is the truth.

24:04.180 --> 24:06.820
 And I feel like there's still love there too,

24:06.820 --> 24:07.660
 which makes the whole thing.

24:07.660 --> 24:08.480
 Oh, that's the hardest part.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.740
 He won't even look at her.

24:09.740 --> 24:12.660
 He looks down the whole time and maybe people say,

24:12.660 --> 24:17.020
 well, it's because anger or hurt or whatever

24:17.020 --> 24:18.840
 but the way that she looks and stuff,

24:18.840 --> 24:22.180
 it just feels like there's so much hurt there

24:23.060 --> 24:25.180
 that it hurts me to watch it.

24:25.180 --> 24:28.140
 I just feel like, oh, my heart just aches for them

24:28.140 --> 24:30.660
 and for both of them and I don't know either of them

24:30.660 --> 24:35.100
 personally and I don't know, just hurts.

24:35.100 --> 24:38.860
 I've never seen love laid out in this raw kind of way.

24:38.860 --> 24:42.260
 It makes me feel better about,

24:44.060 --> 24:47.580
 it almost gives you, seeing people have gone through

24:47.580 --> 24:51.340
 a struggle in this sort of mundane kind of way,

24:51.340 --> 24:54.180
 gives you room to struggle yourself

24:54.180 --> 24:56.020
 about the messiness of love.

24:56.020 --> 24:57.540
 Like you're supposed to,

24:57.540 --> 25:00.460
 like relationship is supposed to be simple and whatever

25:00.460 --> 25:02.260
 but this like, oh, man, this.

25:02.260 --> 25:03.680
 It's like art.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.060
 Yeah.

25:05.060 --> 25:09.260
 And for the record, I don't feel like it shouldn't be shown.

25:09.260 --> 25:11.680
 I think it's actually really beautiful art

25:11.680 --> 25:13.060
 and I agree there's gonna be a lot of people

25:13.060 --> 25:15.480
 who walk away from it and are changed in certain ways

25:15.480 --> 25:16.820
 or look at things different.

25:16.820 --> 25:18.020
 I'm not saying it's changed in the whole world,

25:18.020 --> 25:19.620
 the Johnny Depp trial, but it's art.

25:19.620 --> 25:20.980
 It's just like you would look at a painting

25:20.980 --> 25:22.180
 and it might affect you.

25:23.480 --> 25:27.160
 My only commentary is more that there's not,

25:27.160 --> 25:29.220
 I think it's silly when people say who's right

25:29.220 --> 25:31.940
 and who's wrong and who's the clear villain and who's the,

25:31.940 --> 25:34.700
 like we love as human, we have to have an answer for every,

25:34.700 --> 25:36.020
 we have to put everything in a box.

25:36.020 --> 25:37.620
 And it's like, well, we're looking at this

25:37.620 --> 25:41.020
 and we're deciding you're right and you're wrong.

25:41.020 --> 25:44.420
 And I just think it's silly unless it's your life.

25:44.420 --> 25:47.060
 So speaking of heroes and villains and highs and lows,

25:47.060 --> 25:49.820
 you grew up in Las Vegas.

25:49.820 --> 25:52.060
 And you said that Vegas is a performing town,

25:52.060 --> 25:55.040
 a town of high stakes, drama and eccentricity.

25:55.900 --> 25:58.320
 It's a town of high highs and low lows.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.460
 And I'll be damned if my therapist didn't point out

26:00.460 --> 26:03.100
 that correlation out to me personally a long time ago.

26:04.780 --> 26:09.140
 So to me, Vegas from the outside is romanticized

26:09.140 --> 26:09.980
 by certain movies.

26:09.980 --> 26:14.200
 The lows define the beauty of this town.

26:14.200 --> 26:19.200
 And certain movies, so to me, Casino with Robert De Niro,

26:21.180 --> 26:25.260
 Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone, leaving Las Vegas

26:25.260 --> 26:29.260
 with Nicolas Cage, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

26:29.260 --> 26:34.260
 with the Johnny Depp play, Hunter S. Thompson.

26:35.620 --> 26:38.700
 First of all, what's your favorite representation

26:38.700 --> 26:41.740
 of Vegas from a darker side?

26:41.740 --> 26:46.740
 And do you draw any wisdom insight from the darkness,

26:47.660 --> 26:49.940
 the lows and the highs in those movies?

26:49.940 --> 26:51.500
 Or is it over romanticized?

26:52.540 --> 26:56.460
 So I grew up in a really conservative Mormon family.

26:56.460 --> 27:00.920
 And Vegas was established by the Mormons and the mob.

27:00.920 --> 27:05.020
 Those were like the two very different worlds

27:05.020 --> 27:06.680
 that created what Vegas is.

27:06.680 --> 27:09.760
 And if you live in Vegas, it really shows in a lot of ways

27:09.760 --> 27:13.680
 because Vegas has the strip and the parties

27:13.680 --> 27:14.520
 and the craziness.

27:14.520 --> 27:18.980
 But it also has very neighborhoods and big families

27:18.980 --> 27:23.980
 and conservative people and liberal people living together

27:24.620 --> 27:26.180
 in a really interesting way.

27:27.060 --> 27:32.060
 And for me, growing up here, for instance,

27:32.400 --> 27:34.060
 was a lot of driving on the freeway,

27:34.060 --> 27:36.200
 my mom being like, children, close your eyes.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.540
 There's a naked woman on that billboard and everything.

27:38.540 --> 27:40.420
 Okay, mom, on our way to church.

27:40.420 --> 27:41.260
 You know what I mean?

27:41.260 --> 27:44.140
 It was like, but also being like, whoa, this is crazy.

27:44.140 --> 27:44.980
 You know what I mean?

27:44.980 --> 27:47.500
 Like taking in whatever I could when I could.

27:49.500 --> 27:53.060
 So I saw, and I'm grateful for that.

27:53.060 --> 27:55.180
 Like, I really love that I didn't grow up as a Mormon

27:55.180 --> 27:57.060
 in for instance, like Utah or something,

27:57.060 --> 28:00.420
 like the typical place, because I saw both sides

28:00.420 --> 28:03.100
 and I appreciated something from both sides.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.580
 And now as a person now who's not religious,

28:05.580 --> 28:06.940
 but just spiritually minded,

28:06.940 --> 28:11.940
 you know, I'm grateful for that divergent character,

28:13.340 --> 28:17.380
 that juxtaposition, dual edged sword that Vegas is.

28:17.380 --> 28:19.880
 And I try to apply that to everything in life,

28:19.880 --> 28:23.140
 which is like Johnny Depp and Amber.

28:23.140 --> 28:25.020
 It's like, there's two sides to every story.

28:25.020 --> 28:26.680
 There's always two sides to every coin.

28:26.680 --> 28:29.440
 There's always, and there's something to be said for both.

28:29.440 --> 28:33.860
 Like I try to see people and even if, you know,

28:33.860 --> 28:36.340
 it's just, yeah, I try to apply that to life.

28:36.340 --> 28:39.580
 As far as a movie that personifies Vegas

28:39.580 --> 28:42.740
 or something in that medium that personifies Vegas

28:42.740 --> 28:46.140
 in a way that resonates with me.

28:46.140 --> 28:47.560
 Don't say Hangover.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.460
 No, no, yeah.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.960
 I also like, I wasn't even allowed to watch

28:51.960 --> 28:53.900
 PG 13 movies growing up.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.220
 So a lot of the movies that you're saying,

28:56.220 --> 28:59.740
 like I either didn't see, I didn't have cable television.

28:59.740 --> 29:00.940
 You know, I wasn't like a pilgrim,

29:00.940 --> 29:03.540
 but I had a really, really conservative upbringing.

29:03.540 --> 29:08.100
 So it didn't define your intellectual like development.

29:08.100 --> 29:11.140
 No, no, I just, I can't think of any movie

29:11.140 --> 29:13.740
 that comes to mind where I'm like, that's my Vegas movie.

29:13.740 --> 29:14.580
 You know what I mean?

29:14.580 --> 29:16.500
 Like, I'm sure I've seen some of the movies you've said now,

29:16.500 --> 29:19.340
 but I don't, I can't think of one that I'm like,

29:20.180 --> 29:25.100
 actually personifies Vegas in a way that feels honest to me.

29:25.100 --> 29:27.860
 Like, or like, wasn't there a Chevy,

29:27.860 --> 29:29.020
 was there a Chevy Chase?

29:29.020 --> 29:30.340
 Yeah, yeah.

29:30.340 --> 29:31.860
 I think that's maybe the only one I thought of

29:31.860 --> 29:33.740
 that came to mind where I was like,

29:33.740 --> 29:34.700
 cause I love Chevy Chase so much

29:34.700 --> 29:38.180
 that maybe it's one of his Vegas vacation or something.

29:38.180 --> 29:41.660
 Yeah, so, but that's more like lighthearted surge,

29:41.660 --> 29:42.500
 that kind of stuff.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.380
 Right, it's not like, I guess what I would say

29:44.380 --> 29:48.100
 is there's no truth that has been, that I've seen of Vegas.

29:48.100 --> 29:49.860
 Cause what I see of Vegas is,

29:52.420 --> 29:54.020
 there's obviously like the parties and stuff

29:54.020 --> 29:56.440
 and the nightlife, which I'm not big party person.

29:56.440 --> 29:58.840
 So it's, I haven't really experienced much of that,

29:58.840 --> 30:03.700
 but there's also drugs and I have a strange relationship

30:03.700 --> 30:05.180
 with drugs because I've lost a few friends

30:05.180 --> 30:06.300
 to drug overdoses.

30:06.300 --> 30:09.500
 And so I don't, that's not romantic to me,

30:09.500 --> 30:12.620
 but there's also like, yeah, I mean,

30:12.620 --> 30:14.500
 you asked for a dark reflection of it.

30:14.500 --> 30:17.940
 I guess I certainly see a dark reflection to Vegas.

30:17.940 --> 30:20.540
 And I don't, I feel like Vegas is typically personified

30:20.540 --> 30:22.780
 as like at the tables and everything.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.180
 But it's also like, I have like friends

30:25.180 --> 30:27.660
 who've lost all their money to gambling addiction.

30:27.660 --> 30:31.100
 And so it's like, what I guess the whole thing.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.860
 Yeah, somebody maybe needs to make,

30:32.860 --> 30:33.920
 maybe that's an open spot.

30:33.920 --> 30:36.820
 There needs to be a dark side to Vegas.

30:36.820 --> 30:39.100
 Well, it's about Mormons in Vegas,

30:39.100 --> 30:42.560
 dying to drug overdose or getting shot by the mob.

30:42.560 --> 30:43.400
 Yeah.

30:45.620 --> 30:48.300
 So you mentioned your spirituality.

30:48.300 --> 30:51.820
 You've, you said that having a crisis of faith

30:51.820 --> 30:56.820
 or just the philosophical question of asking who is God,

30:56.820 --> 30:58.460
 does God exist?

30:59.340 --> 31:01.860
 Or in thinking of the flip side of that,

31:01.860 --> 31:04.460
 of mortality, what happens when we die?

31:04.460 --> 31:07.580
 Those kinds of things were extremely difficult,

31:07.580 --> 31:12.580
 deep things for you in terms of your development,

31:12.900 --> 31:14.900
 the whole process of figuring that out.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.500
 Why does it hurt so much to lose faith in God?

31:20.260 --> 31:22.940
 Yeah, I would say that the seeking of God,

31:22.940 --> 31:25.460
 let's say that, is an obsession for me

31:25.460 --> 31:27.660
 and has been since I was young.

31:27.660 --> 31:31.440
 I really feel that I'm a deep, deep,

31:31.440 --> 31:36.440
 deeply committed to finding answers in life.

31:37.340 --> 31:38.900
 And there's some answers that I don't think

31:38.900 --> 31:39.740
 there's an answer to.

31:39.740 --> 31:42.100
 And I'm also very OCD by nature,

31:42.100 --> 31:43.940
 so I just don't give up to that.

31:43.940 --> 31:46.980
 I'm like, well, there must be somewhere in Tibet,

31:46.980 --> 31:49.980
 there's some teacher or there's somebody out there

31:49.980 --> 31:51.700
 that has the answer,

31:51.700 --> 31:55.460
 or maybe it's yet to be found, I'm gonna find it.

31:55.460 --> 31:59.660
 I'm really, my life has been to date

31:59.660 --> 32:03.620
 probably unhealthily committed to finding answers

32:03.620 --> 32:08.620
 about God or the lack thereof and mortality.

32:10.420 --> 32:11.500
 It's all I sing about.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.860
 It's all our records have been about.

32:13.860 --> 32:15.540
 Who do you think is God?

32:15.540 --> 32:17.660
 Have you ever gotten a glimpse?

32:17.660 --> 32:20.260
 You know, I will say the closest I feel like

32:20.260 --> 32:23.820
 I have been to experiencing God is,

32:24.860 --> 32:29.860
 and this sounds so, maybe, I don't know.

32:29.980 --> 32:30.820
 I don't know how it sounds,

32:30.820 --> 32:33.580
 but it's through ayahuasca for me.

32:33.580 --> 32:34.580
 That's my honest answer for you.

32:34.580 --> 32:38.100
 I feel like I had pretty much given up all hope

32:38.100 --> 32:42.020
 of there being anything greater than, you know,

32:42.940 --> 32:47.700
 us being, you know, evolving and being here and then dying

32:47.700 --> 32:50.140
 and you're gone and that's it and nothingness

32:50.140 --> 32:53.180
 and from nothingness we came and nothingness we go.

32:53.180 --> 32:57.660
 To where I am now, which is there are answers to be found.

32:57.660 --> 32:58.900
 I don't know them.

32:58.900 --> 33:00.300
 Like, I don't know what God looks like

33:00.300 --> 33:03.020
 or if God has anything to do with the word God

33:03.020 --> 33:04.780
 and the way that we say it,

33:04.780 --> 33:07.260
 but I do believe pretty fervently

33:07.260 --> 33:11.420
 that there is more to be found.

33:11.420 --> 33:13.100
 Is it motion sensor or no?

33:13.100 --> 33:14.140
 I don't know what that was.

33:14.140 --> 33:16.100
 Looked like they've all died, actually.

33:17.500 --> 33:18.340
 Do you know which one of it?

33:18.340 --> 33:19.620
 Is it this one right here?

33:19.620 --> 33:21.940
 Why don't I just take it out, but then it'd be too dark.

33:21.940 --> 33:22.780
 That's fine.

33:24.180 --> 33:25.020
 Take it out.

33:27.420 --> 33:29.620
 Do you want to hold this chair?

33:29.620 --> 33:31.060
 See if I can get it like this.

33:31.060 --> 33:31.900
 Yeah.

33:35.660 --> 33:37.300
 Almost there.

33:37.300 --> 33:39.860
 I really don't know how I'm gonna catch this though.

33:39.860 --> 33:44.620
 It's gotta be like something saying about this.

33:44.620 --> 33:45.620
 There we go.

33:47.020 --> 33:47.980
 It's my Chinese proverb.

33:47.980 --> 33:49.820
 Yeah, yeah.

33:49.820 --> 33:51.820
 How many people does it take to,

33:51.820 --> 33:53.420
 what is it, unscrew a light bulb?

33:53.420 --> 33:54.260
 A light bulb.

33:54.260 --> 33:55.100
 It was hot too.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.860
 It was like I was doing the two finger technique.

33:57.860 --> 33:58.700
 Yeah.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.060
 Well, I'm glad you survived that.

34:00.060 --> 34:01.060
 Thanks.

34:01.060 --> 34:03.340
 That'd be pretty ironic if we're talking about mortality

34:03.340 --> 34:05.300
 and then this would be it for you.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.140
 In that moment.

34:07.900 --> 34:11.260
 I've never done ayahuasca, so it's a mixture of two plants.

34:11.260 --> 34:14.940
 One of them is DMT, but a lot of people I really respect.

34:14.940 --> 34:19.940
 Very, very intelligent people had profound experiences

34:20.180 --> 34:21.500
 with ayahuasca.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.540
 What is that?

34:22.540 --> 34:23.380
 Where do you go?

34:23.380 --> 34:24.220
 Where does the mind go?

34:24.220 --> 34:26.340
 What the heck is up with that?

34:26.340 --> 34:29.940
 I'll first say that I can't even smoke weed.

34:29.940 --> 34:34.940
 I really do not enjoy it because I hate to let go of control.

34:37.180 --> 34:39.820
 If I feel out of control in life,

34:39.820 --> 34:41.900
 it's like one of my biggest weaknesses.

34:41.900 --> 34:43.700
 It's like very scary for me.

34:43.700 --> 34:48.420
 And some people really enjoy letting go in that way.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.020
 I really don't.

34:50.020 --> 34:53.980
 So I was pretty terrified to make the jump then to ayahuasca.

34:53.980 --> 34:57.060
 But my wife who I deeply respect

34:59.580 --> 35:02.380
 made a profound change through ayahuasca.

35:03.260 --> 35:04.100
 And I saw it.

35:04.100 --> 35:05.060
 She led the way.

35:05.060 --> 35:05.900
 Yeah.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.420
 And it wasn't a strange, like I think most,

35:08.420 --> 35:11.980
 we have a thing in America that's like a misconception,

35:11.980 --> 35:16.980
 a stigma on psychedelics where it's like,

35:17.340 --> 35:20.940
 it's a drug and it makes some people crazy.

35:20.940 --> 35:22.140
 And then you're gonna be on the street

35:22.140 --> 35:23.100
 and you're gonna be out of your mind

35:23.100 --> 35:28.100
 or you're gonna become like a crazy person basically.

35:28.980 --> 35:32.020
 And I think I really bought into that notion

35:32.020 --> 35:33.340
 because again, I was raised,

35:33.340 --> 35:34.700
 I wasn't even raised with cable TV.

35:34.700 --> 35:35.540
 You know what I mean?

35:35.540 --> 35:38.780
 Like ayahuasca is very, I didn't, you know.

35:38.780 --> 35:40.740
 You can imagine what that was like for a Mormon kid.

35:40.740 --> 35:41.620
 I didn't know anything about it

35:41.620 --> 35:42.780
 and I never touched drugs at all

35:42.780 --> 35:44.980
 and never even touched a cigarette, you know.

35:47.180 --> 35:50.060
 Anyway, so I think we have this misconception about it

35:50.060 --> 35:52.860
 where Americans are quick to go to their doctor

35:52.860 --> 35:57.860
 and take any medication or drug,

35:57.860 --> 36:02.860
 but you know, whoa, when it comes to like psychedelics.

36:05.900 --> 36:08.500
 Anyway, that being said,

36:08.500 --> 36:10.140
 so I had that trepidation going into it,

36:10.140 --> 36:11.820
 but I really love and respect my wife

36:11.820 --> 36:13.900
 and I saw it make a profound impact in her life

36:13.900 --> 36:18.500
 where she suddenly was able to heal

36:18.500 --> 36:19.780
 from a lot of trauma that she had.

36:19.780 --> 36:22.740
 She had a really, she went through a lot in her life

36:22.740 --> 36:24.460
 and it really helped her heal,

36:24.460 --> 36:27.140
 but it also set her in a new path spiritually

36:27.140 --> 36:32.140
 that seemed really like a place that I wanted to be.

36:32.340 --> 36:35.580
 So I did it and I did it twice.

36:35.580 --> 36:37.580
 The first time it didn't really have an effect on me,

36:37.580 --> 36:40.700
 which happens to a lot of people, I guess.

36:40.700 --> 36:42.460
 I drank this little thing

36:42.460 --> 36:45.180
 and there was like this shaman who came over from overseas

36:45.180 --> 36:50.180
 that was really, had been in the plant world for decades

36:51.100 --> 36:53.220
 and was a really incredible,

36:54.420 --> 36:57.420
 I don't even know if he likes to be called shaman, but.

36:57.420 --> 37:00.300
 So it's supposed to be like 30, 60 minute to take effect

37:00.300 --> 37:05.300
 and a few hours, the journey lasts.

37:05.340 --> 37:07.540
 About four hours. Four hours.

37:07.540 --> 37:08.740
 Yeah, so the second time I took it,

37:08.740 --> 37:12.460
 I took it in, I would say 20, 30 minutes in exactly.

37:12.460 --> 37:17.460
 I started to feel like I was like the dimension

37:19.580 --> 37:23.900
 of what is reality, the curtain was pulled open

37:23.900 --> 37:28.900
 and there was a lot more to discover

37:29.980 --> 37:31.620
 and it really blew my mind in a way

37:31.620 --> 37:34.540
 that I think it would probably blow anybody's mind

37:34.540 --> 37:37.740
 if for instance, God descended or some Christian God

37:37.740 --> 37:38.860
 or whatever it is.

37:38.860 --> 37:40.220
 We all think it'd be this beautiful thing,

37:40.220 --> 37:42.780
 but in reality, it would probably make people super fearful

37:42.780 --> 37:45.220
 and think that they've lost their mind.

37:45.220 --> 37:48.180
 Like I've always, yeah, I've always like joked

37:48.180 --> 37:51.980
 that if the Mormon God came down and told my mom like,

37:51.980 --> 37:53.940
 if God himself came down and told my mom,

37:53.940 --> 37:57.140
 Mormonism is incorrect, she would say, Satan.

37:57.140 --> 37:57.980
 Yeah.

37:57.980 --> 37:59.380
 You know, it's like, we're never,

37:59.380 --> 38:01.180
 I think our minds are just not prepared

38:01.180 --> 38:05.860
 for a lot of anything that's really extreme

38:05.860 --> 38:07.460
 and it was very extreme.

38:07.460 --> 38:10.620
 It was like the curtain of life was cut open,

38:10.620 --> 38:13.460
 which scared me, but then I felt very much

38:13.460 --> 38:15.700
 and a lot of people that I've talked to

38:15.700 --> 38:17.660
 have a similar thing where I felt very much

38:17.660 --> 38:20.900
 like I was either communicating with something

38:20.900 --> 38:23.660
 that was perceived as God to me

38:23.660 --> 38:28.260
 or highest sense of self or mind or mother earth

38:28.260 --> 38:29.860
 or you know, it's called so many different names,

38:29.860 --> 38:33.580
 but it's really, it's very, a lot of people

38:33.580 --> 38:37.660
 have a very spiritual, similar experience with ayahuasca.

38:37.660 --> 38:40.260
 And just in that, it's like this kind of profoundness.

38:40.260 --> 38:43.580
 It wasn't like, there was nothing at least for me

38:43.580 --> 38:48.180
 that was, that felt like just like psychedelic,

38:48.180 --> 38:49.780
 funny cartoons or something.

38:49.780 --> 38:52.580
 It was like, I'm about to go on a journey

38:52.580 --> 38:54.500
 and I'm gonna communicate,

38:54.500 --> 38:58.260
 I'm communicating with something that feels incredibly wise,

38:58.260 --> 39:00.820
 showed me a lot of things in my life,

39:00.820 --> 39:02.300
 kind of almost like from a bird's eye,

39:02.300 --> 39:03.940
 almost like I was looking through a video camera

39:03.940 --> 39:05.940
 at a younger me.

39:05.940 --> 39:08.700
 There was a particular thing that it communicated to me.

39:11.820 --> 39:15.740
 I really have a hard time with accepting success

39:15.740 --> 39:20.740
 and not feeling like feeling undeserving or something.

39:21.380 --> 39:22.900
 I can't quite put it into words,

39:22.900 --> 39:25.820
 but of my position and what I've been given,

39:25.820 --> 39:28.420
 I've been given so much.

39:30.620 --> 39:32.980
 And it showed me this thing from when I was young

39:32.980 --> 39:35.060
 and explained to me why I am where I am now.

39:35.060 --> 39:40.060
 And I, to this day, it did not feel like myself

39:40.220 --> 39:41.220
 telling myself that.

39:41.220 --> 39:42.980
 That's the only way I can explain it.

39:42.980 --> 39:45.140
 And there was a lot more that it showed me

39:45.140 --> 39:47.620
 and that was incredibly healing for me.

39:47.620 --> 39:52.620
 But just to be like, to put it into a short thing

39:52.620 --> 39:54.420
 because there's so much to this.

39:55.940 --> 39:58.940
 It felt, I walked away feeling very convinced

39:58.940 --> 40:03.940
 that there is more to be known, for sure.

40:04.180 --> 40:09.180
 And a lot of my deep things that were traumatic for me

40:10.420 --> 40:12.620
 didn't feel traumatic anymore,

40:12.620 --> 40:14.420
 specifically crisis of faith.

40:14.420 --> 40:19.140
 I was very angry at my parents and my community

40:19.140 --> 40:24.140
 for raising me in what I perceived to be falsehoods.

40:25.780 --> 40:30.780
 And that, I felt like the bedrock of everything I believed

40:30.820 --> 40:32.540
 was ripped out for me in my 20s.

40:32.540 --> 40:35.420
 And then it was like, good luck in life.

40:35.420 --> 40:37.380
 But really my parents had given me everything

40:37.380 --> 40:38.220
 that they could.

40:38.220 --> 40:41.740
 And they believed that very much so, still.

40:41.740 --> 40:44.500
 But a naive young me was angry

40:44.500 --> 40:46.860
 and felt like they had been duped

40:46.860 --> 40:49.340
 and thus I had been duped.

40:49.340 --> 40:53.860
 But Ayahuasca really showed me this roadmap of like,

40:53.860 --> 40:56.260
 this is truth and you're concerning yourself

40:56.260 --> 40:59.780
 about a grain of sand, which is Mormonism or whatever it is.

40:59.780 --> 41:02.740
 And there may be some truths in that tiny grain of sand

41:02.740 --> 41:04.540
 and there may be falsities.

41:04.540 --> 41:06.140
 But so is all these other grains of sand,

41:06.140 --> 41:07.820
 like focus on the truth.

41:07.820 --> 41:10.580
 Stop focusing on these little details that are meaningless

41:10.580 --> 41:13.460
 and forgive and let go of people believing

41:13.460 --> 41:15.540
 in those things to begin with.

41:15.540 --> 41:17.300
 I don't know if that makes sense,

41:17.300 --> 41:20.260
 but that was like the core thing I was taught

41:20.260 --> 41:24.260
 and to let go of control, stop needing to control everything.

41:24.260 --> 41:26.660
 And it felt like the wisdom was coming from elsewhere.

41:26.660 --> 41:30.180
 Like it's really, I do not believe,

41:30.180 --> 41:33.020
 at least in my current self, I don't have that,

41:33.020 --> 41:37.020
 the mindfulness that I believe that exists in me

41:37.020 --> 41:39.140
 to reach a lot of the conclusions that I did.

41:39.140 --> 41:41.020
 And there was a lot more to it

41:41.020 --> 41:43.340
 that would be for like a late night conversation with you.

41:43.340 --> 41:46.180
 But it's so hard to put it into,

41:47.540 --> 41:48.820
 you feel like a crazy person.

41:48.820 --> 41:50.860
 Any, at least anytime I talk about ayahuasca

41:50.860 --> 41:51.780
 to someone who hasn't done it,

41:51.780 --> 41:53.300
 I'm like, I don't even know where to begin.

41:53.300 --> 41:55.580
 Like, how do you explain to someone

41:55.580 --> 41:59.740
 that you felt like that a multiple dimension type thing

41:59.740 --> 42:03.180
 happened in a way that like putting it into words is,

42:03.180 --> 42:04.580
 and none of it was words, by the way,

42:04.580 --> 42:05.860
 that was communicated to me.

42:05.860 --> 42:09.900
 It was like, you know how people talk about telepathy.

42:09.900 --> 42:12.140
 And if it existed, it would be like,

42:12.140 --> 42:14.140
 I could communicate to you in such a deeper way.

42:14.140 --> 42:16.980
 I'm so confined by me having to articulate these words

42:16.980 --> 42:18.540
 and put them in a sentence to you, Lex,

42:18.540 --> 42:21.460
 and then tell you like, if only I could just be like,

42:23.060 --> 42:24.540
 and emotions do that sometimes, right?

42:24.540 --> 42:26.540
 You could see my emotions and be like,

42:26.540 --> 42:28.380
 oh, that communicates a lot.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.780
 So that's what it felt like to me with ayahuasca

42:30.780 --> 42:34.380
 is it felt like it was communicating to me very clear things,

42:34.380 --> 42:38.540
 but it wasn't like, Daniel, it's me, Mother Earth.

42:38.540 --> 42:41.300
 Let me relax, sit back, let me show you.

42:41.300 --> 42:44.500
 But it was very clear to me what was being said.

42:44.500 --> 42:46.660
 And no, it did not feel like me,

42:46.660 --> 42:50.060
 but maybe smarter people than me who've done it would say,

42:50.060 --> 42:51.620
 well, it was you and blah, blah, blah.

42:51.620 --> 42:53.500
 I don't know, but it was very convincing.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.660
 There's a lot of stuff in that subconscious

42:55.660 --> 42:59.300
 that we haven't explored.

42:59.300 --> 43:01.580
 Like we haven't explored the depths of the ocean.

43:01.580 --> 43:03.580
 We haven't really figured out what's that,

43:03.580 --> 43:06.300
 the younging shadow, what's going on underneath

43:06.300 --> 43:08.620
 the surface of our conscious mind.

43:08.620 --> 43:10.380
 And what is that connecting to?

43:10.380 --> 43:13.500
 Is that just inside our mind or is it some kind of,

43:13.500 --> 43:15.820
 is there some kind of collective intelligence going on

43:15.820 --> 43:16.940
 where all humans are connected

43:16.940 --> 43:20.900
 to one kind of greater organism?

43:20.900 --> 43:22.500
 Like what is consciousness?

43:22.500 --> 43:25.620
 We have a lot of hubris in thinking we understand

43:25.620 --> 43:28.620
 any of it, like how the mind works at all.

43:28.620 --> 43:32.140
 Like what is it, like where,

43:32.140 --> 43:34.900
 what is the origin of consciousness?

43:34.900 --> 43:37.460
 What is the origin of intelligence?

43:37.460 --> 43:39.100
 There's a lot of hubris about this.

43:39.100 --> 43:43.180
 We give each other PhDs and Nobel prizes

43:43.180 --> 43:46.820
 and congratulate ourselves as if we figured it all out.

43:46.820 --> 43:48.740
 But humility is helpful here.

43:48.740 --> 43:50.300
 Nevertheless, that is the question

43:50.300 --> 43:51.980
 that humans have been asking for

43:53.740 --> 43:56.700
 ever since humans were humans,

43:56.700 --> 43:59.900
 which is the question of mortality, the question of God.

44:02.460 --> 44:05.980
 So whether it's Hamlet to be or not to be,

44:05.980 --> 44:08.660
 I think that's the hardest, the most important question.

44:08.660 --> 44:12.980
 Albert Camus asked, why live?

44:17.020 --> 44:18.740
 So in terms of crisis of faith,

44:18.740 --> 44:20.060
 in terms of your search for truth,

44:20.060 --> 44:21.580
 in terms of some of the dark places

44:21.580 --> 44:23.220
 you've gone in your mind,

44:23.220 --> 44:25.180
 what's a good answer to this question?

44:27.020 --> 44:29.580
 So for Camus with Mithos Sisyphus,

44:29.580 --> 44:32.780
 it was the question of suicide.

44:33.780 --> 44:36.540
 Is, what's the purpose?

44:36.540 --> 44:40.780
 Like, what's a good answer to why keep going,

44:40.780 --> 44:42.500
 especially when you're struggling,

44:42.500 --> 44:44.020
 especially when you're not,

44:47.180 --> 44:48.940
 when you're feeling hopeless,

44:50.060 --> 44:54.900
 when you're feeling like a burden in this search for truth,

44:54.900 --> 44:57.340
 where you feel like you're surrounded by lies,

44:57.340 --> 44:58.980
 what's a good answer to why live?

45:00.580 --> 45:02.540
 You ever found one?

45:02.540 --> 45:06.340
 Well, the simple answer right now is to say for,

45:06.340 --> 45:09.140
 it's very easy once you have kids to say,

45:09.140 --> 45:10.540
 the right answer is you just,

45:10.540 --> 45:13.460
 of course you brought these kids into the world,

45:13.460 --> 45:17.220
 so you have a responsibility that I feel deeply as a father

45:17.220 --> 45:21.540
 to them to always be there for as long as I humanly can

45:21.540 --> 45:23.140
 and to take care of them and protect them.

45:23.140 --> 45:26.380
 It's the most innate sense in me,

45:26.380 --> 45:31.380
 just, it's wired in my animal existence.

45:31.380 --> 45:33.740
 So if I take that away, right,

45:33.740 --> 45:35.100
 because that's kind of cheating.

45:35.100 --> 45:37.220
 Let's put that aside because it is cheating.

45:37.220 --> 45:38.060
 It's cheating.

45:38.060 --> 45:41.780
 There's still some fundamental way in which you're alone.

45:41.780 --> 45:42.740
 Yeah.

45:42.740 --> 45:47.740
 And to that, that actually has been a real struggle for me

45:48.020 --> 45:49.060
 for many years.

45:49.060 --> 45:52.020
 I had a real turning point early in my career

45:52.020 --> 45:57.020
 where we were flying somewhere overseas

45:57.020 --> 46:02.020
 and we were in a really small plane

46:02.020 --> 46:04.340
 and the lights went out

46:04.340 --> 46:06.460
 and like all these red lights were flashing

46:06.460 --> 46:08.980
 and the plane just started to dive.

46:08.980 --> 46:13.420
 Completely like scariest plane experience I've ever been in.

46:13.420 --> 46:16.060
 My manager was next to me, who's my brother.

46:16.060 --> 46:20.540
 He was crying and texting his wife a goodbye.

46:20.540 --> 46:23.260
 That's how like crazy this moment was.

46:23.260 --> 46:24.700
 Was it real like genuine?

46:24.700 --> 46:29.700
 Like genuine engine went out, plane is going down,

46:30.140 --> 46:33.700
 pilots looking like crazy in the front

46:33.700 --> 46:35.300
 and it was a really tiny jet.

46:36.420 --> 46:39.460
 And like I said, my brother next to me crying,

46:39.460 --> 46:40.780
 typing a text to his wife.

46:40.780 --> 46:41.980
 Really, really scary.

46:42.860 --> 46:45.660
 And I felt nothing.

46:45.660 --> 46:48.620
 I genuinely sat there and I was like,

46:50.740 --> 46:52.620
 this might actually be nice.

46:52.620 --> 46:56.740
 Like I really felt like this goes down

46:56.740 --> 47:00.820
 and like, ah man, life sucks and it's hard.

47:00.820 --> 47:02.900
 And that sounds so ridiculous I know to say

47:02.900 --> 47:05.580
 because again, I'm in a different place now

47:05.580 --> 47:07.260
 and I see my life for what it is.

47:07.260 --> 47:09.300
 But at that moment I did not.

47:09.300 --> 47:11.620
 So life was primarily defined by suffering,

47:11.620 --> 47:12.460
 it was a burden.

47:12.460 --> 47:16.180
 It was, I felt I was incredibly depressed.

47:16.180 --> 47:20.740
 I had been trying different medications since I was young

47:20.740 --> 47:24.460
 and I just had not found anything that was working for me.

47:24.460 --> 47:27.660
 And then I was in a faith crisis, lost all my faith,

47:29.020 --> 47:31.420
 started a band that's just became,

47:31.420 --> 47:33.620
 I wasn't ever thinking that this band.

47:33.620 --> 47:35.940
 I was like, when you call your band Imagine Dragons,

47:35.940 --> 47:38.500
 you're not thinking that band's gonna be big, okay?

47:38.500 --> 47:41.180
 It was like, I was like,

47:41.180 --> 47:43.780
 this was like a side project that was fun for me.

47:43.780 --> 47:45.780
 It was like art in college.

47:45.780 --> 47:47.500
 I was in school and I was like,

47:47.500 --> 47:49.020
 man, I hate this biology class.

47:49.020 --> 47:50.340
 I'm gonna write down band names.

47:50.340 --> 47:51.180
 Like, you know what I mean?

47:51.180 --> 47:55.100
 Like it was not, hey, put everything aside,

47:55.100 --> 47:56.900
 this is my career, let's go.

47:56.900 --> 48:00.260
 Like it just, it happened.

48:00.260 --> 48:03.100
 And I'm an introvert by nature.

48:03.100 --> 48:05.060
 I'm really not an extroverted person

48:05.060 --> 48:06.780
 who likes to go out and like,

48:07.780 --> 48:09.780
 I like to be at home with a couple of friends

48:09.780 --> 48:12.420
 and have a late night conversation over good food.

48:12.420 --> 48:14.220
 Like that to me is a perfect night.

48:14.220 --> 48:17.480
 Read a good book, listen to a podcast, go on a walk.

48:17.480 --> 48:21.520
 You know, those are things that I really, really enjoy.

48:21.520 --> 48:23.080
 And suddenly I'm in this life where I'm like

48:23.080 --> 48:26.840
 supposed to be something that I really don't wanna be.

48:26.840 --> 48:29.280
 Except for on stage, which is a really fast,

48:29.280 --> 48:31.040
 like strange thing to me, which is on stage,

48:31.040 --> 48:35.840
 I feel so free and exuberant and like an extrovert.

48:35.840 --> 48:37.480
 And then I come off and I just feel like

48:37.480 --> 48:38.800
 shrivel back into a shell.

48:38.800 --> 48:41.680
 Like it's, music does that for me

48:41.680 --> 48:43.480
 and performing on a stage does that for me.

48:43.480 --> 48:44.840
 Can we take a small tangent on that?

48:44.840 --> 48:45.680
 Yeah, yeah, of course.

48:45.680 --> 48:47.000
 What's the high,

48:47.000 --> 48:49.480
 can we go through that the introvert

48:49.480 --> 48:52.440
 that wants to cuddle up and read a book?

48:52.440 --> 48:54.400
 You're the front man of one of the,

48:54.400 --> 48:59.160
 if not the biggest rock bands today,

48:59.160 --> 49:01.180
 playing in front of huge crowds.

49:02.960 --> 49:06.920
 What's the high of that and how can you land back on Earth?

49:10.140 --> 49:11.360
 The high of it,

49:11.360 --> 49:15.880
 it's incredibly beautiful

49:15.880 --> 49:19.120
 to walk on a stage,

49:19.120 --> 49:21.800
 sing these songs that you wrote

49:22.740 --> 49:25.580
 and see it resonate with people around you

49:25.580 --> 49:27.320
 and sing with them.

49:27.320 --> 49:29.600
 Different cultures, different places,

49:29.600 --> 49:30.720
 celebrate life.

49:30.720 --> 49:34.120
 It's suddenly the world seems like a fantastic place.

49:34.120 --> 49:37.400
 It feels like we're all on the same team.

49:37.400 --> 49:38.660
 It's like one big hug.

49:38.660 --> 49:40.820
 Yeah, it's like everybody in that room gets it

49:40.820 --> 49:43.720
 and they all, like it just,

49:45.760 --> 49:47.840
 it feels like what you want the world to be,

49:47.840 --> 49:50.640
 which is just like this coexisting unit of people

49:50.640 --> 49:52.100
 and it's not even about like,

49:54.280 --> 49:56.600
 it's incredible, for sure, it's incredible

49:56.600 --> 49:59.760
 and I love it and I wouldn't do it unless I loved it.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.600
 And then you walk off stage and you turn on the news

50:01.600 --> 50:04.480
 and it's like, you see, we're all against each other,

50:04.480 --> 50:05.520
 everybody hates each other

50:05.520 --> 50:07.340
 and it feels that way in the world.

50:07.340 --> 50:11.160
 So music really, that's why live music is so important

50:11.160 --> 50:13.880
 to people, that's why music is so important to people.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.520
 Because even if it's just you and that person

50:15.520 --> 50:16.960
 that wrote the song, you're listening to it

50:16.960 --> 50:18.740
 and the two of you feel connected.

50:19.640 --> 50:23.060
 You know, it's like you're hearing Tracy Chapman

50:23.060 --> 50:24.800
 sing like Fast Car or something,

50:24.800 --> 50:27.900
 you're just like, oh my gosh, like yes, I get it.

50:27.900 --> 50:31.360
 And you feel connected to that person, you don't feel alone.

50:31.360 --> 50:33.080
 So that's the high of it, for sure.

50:33.080 --> 50:36.280
 And then you get off stage and then, you know,

50:36.280 --> 50:39.320
 as my, like my uncle is a heart surgeon,

50:39.320 --> 50:42.720
 incredible heart surgeon who like writes the book.

50:42.720 --> 50:45.200
 Like he's like the guy that the heart surgeons talk to,

50:45.200 --> 50:46.360
 he's out of Nashville, Tennessee,

50:46.360 --> 50:48.600
 he's just an incredible genius man.

50:48.600 --> 50:53.600
 He always worries and always reached out to me.

50:53.840 --> 50:55.800
 He's like, musicians die all the time

50:55.800 --> 50:58.120
 and the reason they die, you know,

50:58.120 --> 50:59.240
 is because you're getting on stage

50:59.240 --> 51:00.080
 and your heart's doing this

51:00.080 --> 51:01.280
 and your cortisol levels are doing this,

51:01.280 --> 51:03.520
 you're getting off stage and then you're just doing this.

51:03.520 --> 51:05.040
 And it's a really real thing.

51:05.040 --> 51:07.600
 Like you get off stage and you feel like you need drugs

51:07.600 --> 51:11.240
 because you're like, the world feels like,

51:11.240 --> 51:12.960
 oh, incredibly daunting.

51:12.960 --> 51:15.280
 And it's also, I'm sure, has to do with like

51:15.280 --> 51:17.640
 some like health things in your heart

51:17.640 --> 51:19.960
 and the cortisol levels that are so crazy

51:19.960 --> 51:21.760
 and then you come off and it's like,

51:22.840 --> 51:25.160
 I know people are like, well, then nothing's enough,

51:25.160 --> 51:27.120
 except meth, you know what I mean, right?

51:27.120 --> 51:28.940
 Nothing's enough except heroin.

51:28.940 --> 51:30.880
 And that's why a lot of artists turn to that stuff.

51:30.880 --> 51:33.440
 And I don't say it in a preachy way,

51:33.440 --> 51:36.280
 like I've struggled with drug abuse in my life.

51:36.280 --> 51:41.280
 And I really, I understand why artists turn to it.

51:43.400 --> 51:46.540
 But also the fact that you're an introvert.

51:46.540 --> 51:49.540
 So the other side of it, the fame.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.800
 That's something that you also said

51:51.800 --> 51:53.560
 is a double edged sword for you.

51:53.560 --> 51:55.960
 The interesting thing about fame,

51:55.960 --> 51:57.080
 is that you also mentioned,

51:57.080 --> 51:59.680
 is it something you can't take back?

51:59.680 --> 52:00.520
 Yeah.

52:00.520 --> 52:04.080
 It's the thing, you can't just like go on vacation

52:04.080 --> 52:06.300
 in Hawaii and it's like, consider, do I like it or not?

52:06.300 --> 52:08.600
 No, you're staying in Hawaii for the rest of your life

52:08.600 --> 52:10.840
 and you've never been there before,

52:10.840 --> 52:12.600
 whether you like it or not.

52:12.600 --> 52:17.600
 So what's that like being loved by millions

52:18.860 --> 52:20.640
 and millions and millions of people,

52:22.280 --> 52:26.320
 which is perhaps the best kind of fame

52:26.320 --> 52:28.360
 in terms of if you have to choose the kinds of fame

52:28.360 --> 52:29.520
 that there are.

52:29.520 --> 52:32.720
 And still being an introvert and all that kind of stuff.

52:32.720 --> 52:37.480
 So what, do you feel alone?

52:37.480 --> 52:40.200
 More alone being famous?

52:40.200 --> 52:41.520
 Is there a loneliness to it?

52:41.520 --> 52:44.720
 Yeah, I mean, it's such a funny thing.

52:44.720 --> 52:45.540
 Okay, if you had asked,

52:45.540 --> 52:47.360
 if we were having this conversation a couple of years ago,

52:47.360 --> 52:49.080
 I'd be incredibly guarded about this

52:49.080 --> 52:54.080
 because the last thing I wanna ever do

52:54.200 --> 52:58.620
 is sound ungrateful or unaware of how much I have

52:58.620 --> 53:02.000
 and woe is the famous celebrity with money.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.040
 Oh, is your life hard?

53:03.040 --> 53:05.380
 Is it really telling me about how hard it is?

53:05.380 --> 53:06.640
 But I'm also at a place in life now

53:06.640 --> 53:08.720
 where I just like, I'm gonna always just speak my truth

53:08.720 --> 53:10.120
 because that's the only reason I'm here

53:10.120 --> 53:11.600
 is I'm here to speak my truth to you.

53:11.600 --> 53:12.600
 So I'm gonna tell you my truth,

53:12.600 --> 53:14.440
 whether it's whatever it is.

53:14.440 --> 53:17.520
 But you're human and feelings are real.

53:17.520 --> 53:20.040
 And so, and that's the interesting thing.

53:20.040 --> 53:22.360
 You win a lottery, what's that gonna feel like?

53:22.360 --> 53:25.080
 It's not about complaining, oh, it's so hard to win a lottery

53:25.080 --> 53:25.960
 because you get a lot of money.

53:25.960 --> 53:27.960
 No, it's still, you're human.

53:27.960 --> 53:30.760
 You get to experience these feelings and it's fascinating.

53:30.760 --> 53:33.200
 You put humans in different situations.

53:33.200 --> 53:35.680
 And it's also fascinating because a lot of people think,

53:35.680 --> 53:38.080
 well, I would like to be famous.

53:38.080 --> 53:40.440
 That's a big thing now on social media and Instagram

53:40.440 --> 53:41.280
 and so on.

53:41.280 --> 53:42.120
 The whole world wants to be famous.

53:42.120 --> 53:43.340
 Or rich or famous.

53:43.340 --> 53:45.200
 And then it's very interesting to think, all right,

53:45.200 --> 53:49.680
 well, once you arrive, are all the problems solved?

53:49.680 --> 53:50.520
 No, yeah.

53:50.520 --> 53:52.480
 So I will tell you, according to me,

53:52.480 --> 53:54.760
 what the pitfalls are, whether it's true or not.

53:54.760 --> 53:56.280
 And there are certainly some pitfalls.

53:56.280 --> 53:58.960
 One, it's once you're there, you can't go back.

54:00.080 --> 54:01.360
 Whatever, maybe that's fine.

54:01.360 --> 54:02.960
 Cause maybe you love it.

54:02.960 --> 54:07.960
 But the real pitfall for me is that you're now you're Lex

54:09.900 --> 54:13.360
 and you're what everybody's perception is that Lex is.

54:13.360 --> 54:15.280
 And that's what you are.

54:15.280 --> 54:20.120
 Now Lex is probably a lot more complex and complicated

54:20.120 --> 54:23.600
 and has a lot more to Lex than the Lex

54:23.600 --> 54:24.880
 that is the celebrity.

54:24.880 --> 54:29.880
 So, but anybody who meets you, that's who you are to them.

54:32.680 --> 54:35.280
 And you may, you may not feel this way,

54:35.280 --> 54:37.760
 but you may feel confined to actually have to be that person

54:37.760 --> 54:39.280
 to that person.

54:39.280 --> 54:41.800
 Like I've early in my career for a long time,

54:41.800 --> 54:44.320
 anytime I met someone, I suddenly felt like I had to be

54:44.320 --> 54:46.400
 Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons.

54:46.400 --> 54:48.800
 Anytime I met someone, including my family now,

54:48.800 --> 54:50.600
 who are also like, whoa, this is crazy.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.920
 You're like Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons.

54:52.920 --> 54:55.560
 And I wanted to just be the goofball

54:55.560 --> 54:58.680
 that I have been my whole life with my brothers and family.

54:58.680 --> 55:00.720
 But suddenly I found myself feeling like,

55:00.720 --> 55:02.720
 no, I have to be this.

55:02.720 --> 55:05.240
 Like, cause that's who, that's who this is.

55:05.240 --> 55:06.720
 So you're almost like playing a role.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.760
 And it's like, I've heard a lot of actors talk about this

55:08.760 --> 55:10.320
 where they'll take on a role and then it's like,

55:10.320 --> 55:12.480
 they feel like they have to, they like become that.

55:12.480 --> 55:14.720
 And it's a really scary thing.

55:14.720 --> 55:17.720
 Like you alter who you are almost

55:17.720 --> 55:19.960
 to fit the notion of other people.

55:19.960 --> 55:23.520
 Cause especially if a lot of artists are empaths,

55:24.520 --> 55:26.360
 it, you know, a lot of people get into art

55:26.360 --> 55:27.560
 in a deep way are empaths.

55:27.560 --> 55:31.240
 And so you feel a lot of what people are feeling

55:31.240 --> 55:33.320
 and you're never wanting to burden people.

55:33.320 --> 55:36.680
 And you're always wanting to deliver to that person,

55:36.680 --> 55:39.240
 you know, what they want is like people pleasing is very,

55:39.240 --> 55:42.960
 goes hand in hand with a lot of like these famous people.

55:42.960 --> 55:44.200
 And they get to where they were

55:44.200 --> 55:45.880
 because they know how to do that.

55:45.880 --> 55:47.080
 They know how to be in a room with someone

55:47.080 --> 55:49.200
 and look them in the eye and make them feel

55:49.200 --> 55:51.080
 like they're the only person in the room.

55:51.080 --> 55:52.960
 And then now they got that role in that movie

55:52.960 --> 55:54.720
 because they sat with the casting director

55:54.720 --> 55:57.480
 and they were like, oh, you're so funny.

55:57.480 --> 55:59.520
 Oh, has anybody told, like put on the charisma,

55:59.520 --> 56:00.360
 do it all.

56:00.360 --> 56:02.400
 And it's like, anyway, I'm like,

56:02.400 --> 56:03.920
 I'm going on a different tangent here,

56:03.920 --> 56:07.160
 but long story short, there's a lot of things

56:07.160 --> 56:08.720
 that are really unhealthy about it.

56:08.720 --> 56:11.240
 And then a lot of people who want the fame,

56:11.240 --> 56:12.760
 then the second it starts to go away,

56:12.760 --> 56:14.840
 then they're like, who am I anymore?

56:14.840 --> 56:16.080
 Like that was everything.

56:16.080 --> 56:17.360
 And now I'm like on the down

56:17.360 --> 56:19.240
 and now I'm not a famous person anymore.

56:19.240 --> 56:21.720
 And now I hate myself and I'm going to do drugs.

56:21.720 --> 56:24.040
 And it's like, it's like this vicious cycle,

56:24.040 --> 56:25.800
 like you could never be famous enough.

56:25.800 --> 56:27.800
 You're always going to get like,

56:27.800 --> 56:29.680
 there's just so much to it that I've just,

56:29.680 --> 56:33.200
 and again, like I've lost friends

56:33.200 --> 56:35.880
 in this career to do that for sure.

56:36.960 --> 56:38.800
 And there's a certain element to sort of just

56:38.800 --> 56:42.920
 on the losing fame of interacting with a lot of folks,

56:44.880 --> 56:46.880
 especially young folks like on YouTube.

56:46.880 --> 56:51.000
 So fame is a thing that has levels.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.920
 You're always trying to be a little more famous.

56:52.920 --> 56:54.320
 A lot of folks who are chasing fame,

56:54.320 --> 56:55.160
 it doesn't matter how famous you are,

56:55.160 --> 56:56.680
 you're always trying to chase more.

56:56.680 --> 56:58.440
 And when you start to lose it,

56:58.440 --> 57:01.080
 interesting things can happen if you're not self aware,

57:01.080 --> 57:03.920
 which is like, like you mentioned,

57:03.920 --> 57:08.840
 you might be trying to grasp back at where you were

57:08.840 --> 57:11.440
 by leaning into the formula that got you there.

57:11.440 --> 57:15.600
 And so the constraints of the image that you mentioned

57:15.600 --> 57:19.560
 becomes the thing that you're now trying to lean into.

57:19.560 --> 57:22.600
 And that's actually walking away from who you really are.

57:22.600 --> 57:25.840
 Like you lean further into being that person.

57:25.840 --> 57:26.840
 That's true for acting.

57:26.840 --> 57:30.240
 That's true for even on like YouTube,

57:30.240 --> 57:32.440
 which is people acting, they have a role.

57:32.440 --> 57:34.600
 They got them to the table somehow.

57:34.600 --> 57:37.680
 Yeah, it's dark, but I think those are,

57:39.520 --> 57:43.920
 that's just put for everybody to see,

57:43.920 --> 57:47.120
 but that's a very human struggle even when you're not famous.

57:47.120 --> 57:49.280
 Finding yourself, being yourself,

57:49.280 --> 57:54.280
 of not letting, not doing the people pleasing at any scale

57:55.160 --> 57:56.280
 and being trapped by that.

57:56.280 --> 57:58.920
 Yeah, and also feeling like it's never enough.

57:58.920 --> 58:03.120
 I think that's something all, like it's not just

58:03.120 --> 58:04.560
 a famous thing, but it's like in the whole,

58:04.560 --> 58:06.360
 like everybody deals with feeling like

58:06.360 --> 58:08.640
 when I'm here, I'll be happy.

58:08.640 --> 58:10.080
 When I get that job, I'll be happy.

58:10.080 --> 58:12.760
 When I have that money, then I'll be happy.

58:12.760 --> 58:16.000
 When I get that surgery and my nose looks like this,

58:16.000 --> 58:17.240
 I will be happy then.

58:17.240 --> 58:22.240
 It's like a constant chase of happiness instead of happiness.

58:25.280 --> 58:27.640
 It's like the opposite, it's opposite of self love.

58:27.640 --> 58:29.480
 It's the opposite of happiness.

58:30.640 --> 58:31.920
 There's no presence to it.

58:31.920 --> 58:34.200
 You're constant, you're never going to find it.

58:34.200 --> 58:36.560
 You're never gonna arrive and you're just gonna

58:36.560 --> 58:38.240
 live your life and then you're gonna be on your death bed

58:38.240 --> 58:43.240
 and be like, I was chasing the wrong thing my whole life.

58:43.600 --> 58:46.280
 I should say that podcasts are interesting in that way.

58:46.280 --> 58:49.280
 So for me personally, because you just talk a lot,

58:49.280 --> 58:52.720
 you can't, people that meet you, they know you

58:52.720 --> 58:54.920
 and they know the evolution of you.

58:54.920 --> 58:58.760
 And that's the same thing for like you right now,

58:58.760 --> 59:02.000
 Dan of Imagine Dragons, just being on a podcast

59:02.000 --> 59:07.000
 like long form reveals a side that liberates you more

59:07.000 --> 59:12.000
 to be yourself, to like, people see, oh, there's a human.

59:12.200 --> 59:15.560
 They, cause they, music, they have a deep connection

59:15.560 --> 59:18.520
 with you, they have experiences with you

59:18.520 --> 59:21.240
 the way they experienced it and that's who you are

59:21.240 --> 59:22.800
 with them through the songs.

59:22.800 --> 59:26.080
 But now you get to see, oh, that's a human being.

59:26.080 --> 59:29.360
 He probably gets angry, he gets sad, he's excited,

59:29.360 --> 59:33.240
 he's hopeful and there's a core, there's a good human being

59:33.240 --> 59:36.240
 with the whole roller coaster of emotions all there.

59:36.240 --> 59:37.560
 It's a giant, beautiful mess.

59:37.560 --> 59:39.920
 And podcasts reveal that, that's why I love podcasts

59:39.920 --> 59:44.400
 like long form, you get to hear some artists and actors

59:44.400 --> 59:47.480
 and so on and some of them you get to see, oh,

59:47.480 --> 59:52.480
 you've lost yourself in the surface.

59:53.920 --> 59:57.200
 That's a tragedy with some actors, some great actors.

59:57.200 --> 1:00:01.200
 They've left so much of themselves in the roles

1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:06.000
 they've played that they can no longer be the thing

1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.400
 they were before, those great roles.

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:11.760
 That's for sure, it's hard, it's hard to see.

1:00:11.760 --> 1:00:13.480
 So you get to see that with Johnny Depp with,

1:00:13.480 --> 1:00:15.200
 I don't know, Pirates, he was talking about that

1:00:15.200 --> 1:00:18.760
 with Pirates of the Caribbean, that was a shift.

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:23.760
 Like he's not that guy, he's forever, forever that guy.

1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:27.440
 But the point is to remember that you're not

1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:29.120
 into your family, which is interesting you said

1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:31.600
 with your family, when I see people close to me,

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:34.860
 they also, there is an element like that

1:00:34.860 --> 1:00:37.400
 while you're that, they start treating you

1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:38.840
 like the famous person.

1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:43.840
 Yeah, I'm fortunate to have my manager who's my brother,

1:00:44.360 --> 1:00:47.820
 my older brother, and my lawyer is my other older brother.

1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:53.640
 And that's been helpful because it's weird,

1:00:53.640 --> 1:00:55.400
 it gets weird with everyone no matter what.

1:00:55.400 --> 1:00:59.440
 One of the best advice I was given was by Charlie Sheen.

1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:00.560
 You got advice from Charlie Sheen.

1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:02.160
 Yeah, we were playing.

1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:04.160
 The wise sage of our generation.

1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:07.760
 Wise sage Charlie Sheen, but it was, it was really wise.

1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:11.320
 I was sitting next to him and we were playing

1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:13.220
 some late night television and he said,

1:01:13.220 --> 1:01:14.940
 this was right at the beginning, and he just said,

1:01:14.940 --> 1:01:18.800
 boys, just mark my words, your life is about

1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:21.220
 to get really weird, that's all he said.

1:01:21.220 --> 1:01:22.840
 But it stuck with me forever and it's Charlie Sheen,

1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:25.060
 so of course it sticks with you.

1:01:25.060 --> 1:01:27.280
 And I remember being like, right, okay, Charlie Sheen,

1:01:27.280 --> 1:01:29.100
 I'm not Charlie Sheen, it's not gonna get weird,

1:01:29.100 --> 1:01:29.940
 like, you know.

1:01:29.940 --> 1:01:34.440
 But it got really, really weird, really quick,

1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:37.640
 because suddenly you've existed your whole life

1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:39.920
 in this way where everybody just,

1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:42.440
 everything you get, you achieved,

1:01:42.440 --> 1:01:44.520
 it was because you got it.

1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:47.220
 And every conversation you had, like,

1:01:47.220 --> 1:01:49.640
 if someone liked you at the end of that conversation,

1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:51.080
 well, it's because they liked you.

1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:53.580
 If they didn't like you, it's because they didn't like you.

1:01:53.580 --> 1:01:55.280
 And you can make complete peace with that.

1:01:55.280 --> 1:01:56.520
 At least I could my whole life.

1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.640
 I was like, life is a challenge.

1:01:58.640 --> 1:02:01.920
 And be myself and I'm gonna go through it

1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:04.280
 and find some people along the way that I connect with

1:02:04.280 --> 1:02:05.200
 and others, no.

1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:10.200
 And that social integrity is so important to us.

1:02:11.260 --> 1:02:13.880
 And we think it would be nice to have this,

1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:16.260
 and this is going back to the pitfalls of fame.

1:02:16.260 --> 1:02:18.940
 We think it would be nice to walk into a room

1:02:18.940 --> 1:02:20.340
 and have everyone be like,

1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:24.960
 and you could be like, dumpster fire.

1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:26.800
 And everybody's like, oh my gosh, dumpster fire,

1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:28.040
 that was amazing.

1:02:28.040 --> 1:02:30.360
 Well, you said dumpster fire was amazing.

1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:34.920
 It's like, it's incredibly, incredibly lonely.

1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:39.000
 And it just breaks everything that you knew about humanness.

1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:39.840
 And it sucks.

1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:42.800
 So then you're seeking out people who,

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:44.200
 that it doesn't exist with.

1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:46.120
 And family is the closest you can get to that for sure.

1:02:46.120 --> 1:02:47.760
 But even your family, it's gonna take a little bit

1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:49.160
 where they're like, oh, this is a little weird.

1:02:49.160 --> 1:02:51.840
 Like all my friends at work are now asking about you

1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:53.120
 and you're my young, stupid brother.

1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:55.200
 But now you're suddenly like the young, stupid brother

1:02:55.200 --> 1:02:56.640
 that they want an autograph from and stuff.

1:02:56.640 --> 1:02:59.200
 And it still makes, like they have to get over that

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:00.240
 and figure that out.

1:03:03.160 --> 1:03:04.280
 And then you meet people too

1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:06.440
 who know about this whole concept and they're like,

1:03:06.440 --> 1:03:08.160
 well, I'm gonna be an asshole to him

1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:11.720
 to show him that I don't subscribe.

1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:14.040
 And you're dealing with like people who are like,

1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:15.880
 dumpster fire, the person who's like,

1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:19.440
 you could say something actually profound and nice

1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:22.640
 and they'd be like, that's stupid and you're an idiot.

1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:25.640
 Cause it's like an actual attempt to like show you

1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:27.280
 how much they don't care.

1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:29.840
 So you live in this very, like this.

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:32.160
 Still, nevertheless, even when nobody knew you,

1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:35.040
 you were seeking for deep human connection

1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:37.000
 with a small number of people.

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.200
 And now when a lot of people know you,

1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:41.200
 you're still looking for deep connection

1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:43.280
 with a small number of people.

1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:45.000
 The struggle is the same.

1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:47.400
 Can you speak to,

1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:49.640
 cause you mentioned some of the dark moments.

1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:51.360
 What advice would you give to people

1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:53.640
 who are struggling with depression?

1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:57.560
 And maybe for the people who love the people

1:03:57.560 --> 1:03:59.360
 who are struggling with depression.

1:04:00.840 --> 1:04:03.600
 So what I have found to be most successful for me,

1:04:05.760 --> 1:04:09.160
 it's back to the basics of everything

1:04:09.160 --> 1:04:12.280
 that the therapist or psychologist will tell you,

1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:13.760
 psychiatrist will tell you right when you meet them,

1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:17.440
 which is exercise every day,

1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:22.520
 eat healthy for sure,

1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:24.760
 find time, make time every day to do something

1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:27.840
 that you love, whatever that may be,

1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:29.200
 whatever brings you joy.

1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:32.560
 And when you're really depressed,

1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:34.440
 that actually feels like nothing.

1:04:34.440 --> 1:04:36.400
 Cause the things that brought you joy,

1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:37.760
 don't bring you joy anymore.

1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:39.920
 When I'm really in the thick of it.

1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:43.840
 But for me, like this is the cycle

1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:46.000
 that I'll go through is I'll look at my life

1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.400
 and I'll say, okay, what can I clean up?

1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:51.960
 All right, well, for me it was cutting out alcohol

1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:53.160
 actually helped me a lot.

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.240
 I know that sounds like a big,

1:04:56.240 --> 1:04:59.200
 I'm not judging anybody for that.

1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:01.040
 And I still drink on occasion,

1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:03.840
 but I felt like alcohol has been very unhelpful

1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:05.120
 to my mental state.

1:05:06.960 --> 1:05:09.320
 Feel less drive and less happiness the next day

1:05:09.320 --> 1:05:10.320
 for things that I wanna do.

1:05:10.320 --> 1:05:12.760
 I feel like it plays a lot with your serotonin.

1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:14.680
 So look for stuff to change.

1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:16.600
 Clean living, yeah, clean living,

1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:21.600
 but also understanding that sometimes it just is,

1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:24.040
 and you just keep breathing

1:05:24.040 --> 1:05:25.960
 and it will get better with time.

1:05:25.960 --> 1:05:27.080
 This too shall pass.

1:05:27.080 --> 1:05:27.920
 This too shall pass.

1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:31.360
 Like I really think that in the winter,

1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:33.760
 I'm pretty sure, I mean, I've had a lot of,

1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:34.680
 I've seen a lot of therapists

1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:35.800
 and all of them say the same thing,

1:05:35.800 --> 1:05:37.800
 which is like, you have major depressive disorder

1:05:37.800 --> 1:05:38.640
 and this is what it is,

1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:41.360
 but it's certainly worse for me in the winter months.

1:05:41.360 --> 1:05:44.760
 So I know there's like, I can't think of the term for it,

1:05:44.760 --> 1:05:47.120
 but there's a term for like seasonal depression.

1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:47.960
 There it is.

1:05:49.200 --> 1:05:51.040
 So I'll get to the winter and suddenly I'm like,

1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:55.120
 geez, everything really sucks on a deeper level.

1:05:55.120 --> 1:05:58.280
 And then, so it's like this too shall pass is another thing.

1:05:58.280 --> 1:06:01.080
 It's like, just practice those things.

1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:02.800
 Absolutely see a therapist.

1:06:02.800 --> 1:06:04.960
 That's my biggest, like my biggest emphasis of life

1:06:04.960 --> 1:06:07.440
 is to like on stage, like my goal,

1:06:07.440 --> 1:06:09.480
 like I have a few things that I really, really care about.

1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:13.640
 One is mental health and destigmatizing therapy.

1:06:13.640 --> 1:06:15.640
 Cause for me, I didn't go to therapy for a long time

1:06:15.640 --> 1:06:18.680
 because I felt that it would be admitting that I was broken.

1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:22.320
 It'd be admitting that I was weaker than Lex

1:06:22.320 --> 1:06:23.880
 who doesn't have to go to a therapist

1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:25.480
 because Lex is stronger.

1:06:25.480 --> 1:06:27.880
 So be strong like Lex.

1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:29.400
 I would like look at all my older brothers

1:06:29.400 --> 1:06:30.600
 and I looked up to them so much

1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:32.880
 and they're all these incredibly successful people,

1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:35.960
 plastic surgeon, an anesthesiologist, a dentist,

1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:38.240
 two attorneys, Stanford, NYU,

1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:41.680
 like just like incredible high standards,

1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:45.400
 Eagle Scouts, you know, like they valedictorians,

1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:47.360
 like they just did it all.

1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:52.360
 So for me, I was very, really did not want to admit

1:06:53.480 --> 1:06:55.320
 and none of them went to therapy.

1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:56.680
 So it was like, what are you going to be?

1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:58.000
 Are you, oh, you're broken.

1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:01.160
 Are you like the weak one who can't hack life?

1:07:01.160 --> 1:07:03.600
 And I think that's incredibly dangerous.

1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:05.600
 And I feel like it almost cost me my life

1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:08.600
 because I took so long to finally go to therapy.

1:07:08.600 --> 1:07:10.760
 So I really want kids to know,

1:07:10.760 --> 1:07:14.440
 hey, like the great people that achieve great things

1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:16.120
 that are doing amazing things,

1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:18.720
 they probably have help, almost all of them.

1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:21.320
 It's like going to the gym, but it's a mental gym.

1:07:21.320 --> 1:07:23.440
 What, so I, unfortunately,

1:07:23.440 --> 1:07:26.040
 I wanted to be a psychiatrist when I was growing up.

1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:29.040
 Maybe that's why I like podcasts.

1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:29.880
 Maybe that's.

1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:30.720
 I think you'd be a good one.

1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:32.280
 Maybe, I would.

1:07:32.280 --> 1:07:35.360
 I think you are a psychiatrist, pretty much, right?

1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:36.200
 Sounds like you're a psychiatrist.

1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:37.120
 I think I need more.

1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:41.200
 I think actually, to be a good psychiatrist,

1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:44.480
 you also need to be seeking therapy from the,

1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:46.520
 like you also need to be,

1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:50.000
 have some stuff to work through in your mind.

1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.880
 I think, yeah, you have to have gone to some dark places.

1:07:55.560 --> 1:07:56.400
 What?

1:07:56.400 --> 1:07:57.240
 The empathize.

1:07:57.240 --> 1:07:58.080
 The empathy.

1:07:58.080 --> 1:07:59.200
 It's the ability to empathize,

1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:02.160
 and especially if you've directly experienced it,

1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:04.840
 you can go to those places in your mind.

1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:06.720
 Like you said, it's with the music,

1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:08.560
 to be authentic, you have to really go there.

1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:12.680
 What, why did therapy help so much?

1:08:12.680 --> 1:08:14.600
 What is the process of therapy,

1:08:14.600 --> 1:08:16.800
 if you can just educate a little more?

1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:20.720
 Is it, are you basically bringing to the surface

1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:24.520
 and talking through things that you,

1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:27.760
 because of the momentum of life,

1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:31.240
 you just never allow yourself to speak through,

1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:32.440
 to think through?

1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:33.680
 Is that what therapy is?

1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:36.280
 Or is there some more systematic thing?

1:08:36.280 --> 1:08:38.760
 So I've been to a lot of strange,

1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:39.840
 different kinds of therapy.

1:08:39.840 --> 1:08:41.720
 So I'll tell you my first therapist.

1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:43.560
 If I could sort of interrupt,

1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:47.760
 how hard is it to find a therapist that connected with you?

1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:50.880
 It is, it's actually pretty hard, I think.

1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:53.400
 I think, I think it for,

1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:55.080
 well, actually I have a skewed view of that,

1:08:55.080 --> 1:08:59.440
 because going back to the beginning of my therapy

1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:01.960
 was with a Mormon therapist.

1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:03.900
 So it was very much like,

1:09:03.900 --> 1:09:05.880
 well, are you reading your book of Mormon?

1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:07.440
 And are you praying at night?

1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:08.280
 You know what I mean?

1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:10.080
 Like, that was a big focus of my therapy

1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:10.920
 to begin with.

1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:13.720
 And you're having a faith crisis in the distance somewhere.

1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:17.040
 Yes, I was like, well, and then.

1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:18.080
 You're making it worse.

1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:20.640
 Yes, the next therapist I went to

1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:25.280
 was a Scientology therapist.

1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:28.120
 I met my wife and she was Scientologist at the time,

1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:29.640
 and she's not anymore.

1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:33.880
 She's like, it's such a funny thing to look back on,

1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:36.920
 because we met, and I was like this Mormon missionary

1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:38.200
 who had just got home from his mission,

1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:40.120
 and I met her, and she's a Scientologist.

1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:41.720
 I was like, wow, that's batshit crazy.

1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:43.840
 Like, that stuff's crazy.

1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:44.740
 And she's like, what are you talking about?

1:09:44.740 --> 1:09:47.120
 That's your crazy, you're a Mormon.

1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:48.720
 That's batshit crazy.

1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:51.760
 And the two of us were like, huh,

1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:54.280
 maybe there's something to this, to both of us here.

1:09:54.280 --> 1:09:56.760
 Yeah, the tension actually forces you to think through,

1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:58.280
 oh, well, what is true?

1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:01.520
 Yeah, and we really fell in love through that,

1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:05.200
 which was like, maybe we're both on the wrong track.

1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:06.200
 Let's figure this out.

1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:07.540
 But before that happened,

1:10:07.540 --> 1:10:12.120
 we went to a Scientologist therapist,

1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:14.600
 who that therapy consisted of,

1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:17.760
 what have you done wrong to Asia?

1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:19.240
 And they would ask me that question

1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:20.880
 over and over and over and over,

1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:23.420
 until I'm like thinking of the deepest, darkest things

1:10:23.420 --> 1:10:25.660
 that were in the recesses of my mind.

1:10:25.660 --> 1:10:28.280
 This was marriage therapy.

1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:30.240
 Anyway, I'm not gonna get into that,

1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:32.400
 but it was Scientology therapy.

1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:33.520
 So that was a different thing.

1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:36.680
 And then I went to therapy therapy,

1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:39.040
 like no, not attached to any religion.

1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:40.960
 And that was a really great experience for me.

1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:42.200
 And since then I've been through

1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:43.120
 a couple of different therapists,

1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:45.720
 but that was more because where I was

1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:47.680
 and moving and things like that.

1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:50.160
 So is it that hard to find a great therapist?

1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:51.800
 Probably not, but maybe don't go

1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:52.880
 to your Mormon therapist

1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:55.520
 versus that Scientology therapist.

1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:57.760
 Or maybe that's the route for you.

1:10:57.760 --> 1:10:59.080
 Maybe it's the route for you, I don't know.

1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:01.320
 Yeah, but what is, so is it bringing stuff

1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:02.840
 to the surface, basically?

1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:04.440
 Oh yeah, sorry, I didn't even answer your question.

1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:06.520
 What's the effect, why is it so effective?

1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:10.220
 Just, is there something you could put words to?

1:11:10.220 --> 1:11:11.720
 Yeah, I mean, I think it's, obviously,

1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:13.180
 there's the common things you would think of,

1:11:13.180 --> 1:11:15.120
 which is like, oh, I've been holding these things in

1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:16.160
 that I don't wanna tell anybody,

1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:17.280
 and then I tell this person,

1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:19.240
 and oh, there's relief in that.

1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:21.480
 But that's really not where the real work comes from.

1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:24.600
 I think the real work is meeting with someone

1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:29.000
 who is well versed and educated and understands.

1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:30.720
 It's like coding.

1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:32.760
 It really is, it's like someone who,

1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:33.920
 they listen to you, and they're like,

1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:34.800
 well, that was a trigger,

1:11:34.800 --> 1:11:36.240
 and then this became this trigger,

1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:38.280
 and you're probably, every time you're hearing that,

1:11:38.280 --> 1:11:41.340
 thinking of this thing that happened earlier in your life,

1:11:41.340 --> 1:11:43.120
 and they just will walk you through scenarios,

1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:44.520
 and maybe some of them aren't right,

1:11:44.520 --> 1:11:45.640
 but some of them, you'll be like,

1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:47.040
 it'll resonate sometimes, you're like,

1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:50.080
 wow, I am feeling that because of that,

1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:52.640
 and that did happen, and maybe if I call my mom

1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:54.520
 and say this to her, it will make me feel,

1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:56.520
 hey mom, this happened, it's like work.

1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:59.080
 You put in work, and you have hard conversations

1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:00.600
 and do difficult things,

1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:03.440
 and if, so if your therapy's not difficult,

1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:05.600
 I actually think that's not good therapy.

1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:08.320
 Good therapy is, it's gonna be a little difficult,

1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:10.280
 it's work, like.

1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:11.560
 During and after.

1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:15.360
 Yes, like I had this incredible therapist who was,

1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:16.840
 I told him when I was gonna do ayahuasca,

1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:18.240
 he was like, geez, you know,

1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:20.320
 he had actually was a doctor before

1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:22.520
 and a really well educated studied person

1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:26.560
 who had walked away from brain doctor,

1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:28.280
 what's the word for that, brain doctor?

1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:29.720
 Brain surgeon? Neurologist.

1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:30.880
 Oh yeah, neurologist, yep.

1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:35.880
 And he said, well basically his belief was that ayahuasca

1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:39.720
 was like basically doing therapy like 50 sessions.

1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:42.000
 He was like, it's like really intensive.

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.320
 He was like, I don't know if you wanna do that,

1:12:44.320 --> 1:12:47.560
 if you do, you can make some big steps forward,

1:12:47.560 --> 1:12:51.000
 but I prefer just to do one session at a time.

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.920
 And so yeah, it's hard work.

1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:56.360
 And that, I typically like,

1:12:56.360 --> 1:12:58.000
 it's really hard for me to even talk about ayahuasca

1:12:58.000 --> 1:12:58.920
 by the way, going back to that,

1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:01.840
 because I'm not looking to tell everybody to go do ayahuasca.

1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:03.800
 It's incredibly hard.

1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:07.120
 It was the scariest experience of my entire life.

1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:08.560
 It felt like I went to heaven,

1:13:08.560 --> 1:13:11.680
 but it also felt like I went to the darkest, deepest hell

1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:16.680
 that was incredibly scary, incredibly scary, yeah.

1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:21.680
 So you told the story of how you wrote the song Believer

1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:27.240
 or like your childhood friend, I guess, Donald,

1:13:27.800 --> 1:13:30.340
 like bullying and that kind of stuff.

1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:34.040
 This song, I mean, a lot of your songs

1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:37.920
 are super interesting sort of in terms of percussion,

1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:40.480
 super interesting, super interesting lyrically,

1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:45.480
 just how it flows and also pain is at the center of it.

1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:49.200
 I mean, a lot of, like you said, the crisis of faith,

1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:50.680
 some of these existential questions

1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:54.560
 are basically behind a lot of your songs, funny enough.

1:13:55.480 --> 1:13:59.440
 Maybe they're covered in metaphor, so it's hard to see,

1:14:00.340 --> 1:14:01.180
 but it's there.

1:14:01.180 --> 1:14:05.560
 And this song is really interesting in that way

1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:10.560
 that it puts pain, you made me a believer.

1:14:10.560 --> 1:14:15.560
 You break me down, you build me up, Believer.

1:14:16.380 --> 1:14:17.520
 That's so interesting.

1:14:18.980 --> 1:14:22.140
 Maybe can you tell the story of how the song came to be?

1:14:22.140 --> 1:14:23.220
 I'd love to listen to it too.

1:14:23.220 --> 1:14:25.220
 I have some questions musically about it too.

1:14:25.220 --> 1:14:29.900
 Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's exactly

1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:30.860
 what we're talking about with therapy.

1:14:30.860 --> 1:14:34.860
 I just feel like the greatest things in my life

1:14:34.860 --> 1:14:39.860
 have come from the deepest hurt, like losing someone,

1:14:43.980 --> 1:14:48.700
 that you love is maybe the hardest part of the human path

1:14:48.700 --> 1:14:51.260
 for me, at least thus far.

1:14:51.260 --> 1:14:52.820
 When I think of, okay, what was the hardest thing?

1:14:52.820 --> 1:14:55.740
 There's like, you think of physical pain

1:14:55.740 --> 1:14:58.540
 or maybe like going through financial pain or whatever.

1:14:58.540 --> 1:15:02.140
 I think losing someone that you really love to death

1:15:02.140 --> 1:15:05.260
 is one of the hardest, for me,

1:15:05.260 --> 1:15:06.860
 I would say it was the hardest.

1:15:08.580 --> 1:15:10.060
 But it also makes you look at your life

1:15:10.060 --> 1:15:13.160
 completely differently and alter your life,

1:15:13.160 --> 1:15:15.660
 at least for me in ways that were really healthy.

1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:19.300
 Being more present, letting go of things

1:15:19.300 --> 1:15:21.180
 that were meaningless, trying to control

1:15:21.180 --> 1:15:22.420
 what other people think about you,

1:15:22.420 --> 1:15:25.300
 like wasting your time on things like that.

1:15:25.300 --> 1:15:27.840
 And you suddenly see like, wow, like time,

1:15:28.740 --> 1:15:31.160
 I got small amount of time, like how do I wanna spend it?

1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:34.140
 I'm gonna spend it in the best way I know how and that's it.

1:15:34.140 --> 1:15:37.860
 So, yeah, I mean, it's a basic concept

1:15:37.860 --> 1:15:39.120
 that's been said a million times over

1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:39.960
 in a million different ways.

1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:42.860
 But that's pretty much what I was trying to say with Believer

1:15:42.860 --> 1:15:46.300
 which is like, I've lost faith in everything

1:15:46.300 --> 1:15:51.020
 at that time period or previous to that time period.

1:15:51.020 --> 1:15:53.180
 And then I was rebuilding my faith

1:15:53.180 --> 1:15:57.160
 or my spiritual thought process.

1:15:57.160 --> 1:16:02.100
 And it was after ayahuasca and it was like, finding,

1:16:02.100 --> 1:16:05.780
 being a Believer and that's not necessarily like

1:16:05.780 --> 1:16:09.220
 a Believer in God or a Believer in heaven and hell

1:16:09.220 --> 1:16:12.860
 or anything like that, but a Believer in more.

1:16:12.860 --> 1:16:17.700
 Believing in goodness, believing in that there is some light

1:16:17.700 --> 1:16:22.700
 like, and again, those words like, they're just words

1:16:22.780 --> 1:16:24.660
 and I wish there were better words to formulate

1:16:24.660 --> 1:16:25.900
 the thought that I'm trying to express,

1:16:25.900 --> 1:16:30.900
 but just more, like the thought of me dying,

1:16:33.060 --> 1:16:37.820
 for me, I don't fear it, I don't fear it,

1:16:37.820 --> 1:16:42.520
 but actually I really fear not seeing my kids again.

1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:44.820
 I'll say that, that is fearful for me.

1:16:44.820 --> 1:16:48.040
 I feel like I love so deeply these children

1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:51.140
 that the thought of like leaving them

1:16:51.140 --> 1:16:55.300
 for me is a scary thought or something.

1:16:55.300 --> 1:16:58.180
 They're kind of good reminder

1:16:58.180 --> 1:17:00.800
 how much you love life actually.

1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:04.160
 And you don't always remember that.

1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:07.260
 Yeah, and I think having kids is not for everyone

1:17:07.260 --> 1:17:09.540
 for absolutely for sure, but for me,

1:17:09.540 --> 1:17:11.420
 and especially you shouldn't be having kids

1:17:11.420 --> 1:17:13.140
 to give yourself a reason to live.

1:17:14.420 --> 1:17:16.980
 I feel like dying, I'm gonna have a kid.

1:17:16.980 --> 1:17:20.540
 You might feel more like dying after having a kid actually.

1:17:20.540 --> 1:17:23.900
 It's pretty stressful, but it is a place to like,

1:17:23.900 --> 1:17:26.480
 I've changed a lot of people that I've known

1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:29.660
 that it gave them a new intensity

1:17:29.660 --> 1:17:32.700
 of gratitude for life, for sure.

1:17:32.700 --> 1:17:35.740
 Guy, do you mind if we, I'll return to the pain

1:17:35.740 --> 1:17:37.080
 and the belief, do you mind if we listen

1:17:37.080 --> 1:17:38.140
 to a little bit of songs?

1:17:38.140 --> 1:17:38.980
 No, it's fine.

1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:47.380
 Do you write the music first or the words first?

1:17:47.380 --> 1:17:51.620
 Uh, the same time, which is very typical for me.

1:17:51.620 --> 1:17:56.620
 By just the way it opens, intensity of openings.

1:17:56.960 --> 1:18:00.100
 You ever think about what the first few seconds sound like?

1:18:00.100 --> 1:18:03.880
 Is that something that, like when you imagine a song,

1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:06.180
 is it the opening you imagine?

1:18:06.180 --> 1:18:10.500
 No, it's kind of a, I never think opening,

1:18:10.500 --> 1:18:14.180
 I never think final, I think soundscape

1:18:14.180 --> 1:18:16.240
 of how I'm feeling right now.

1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:17.820
 So it could be the middle of the song

1:18:17.820 --> 1:18:20.320
 for all I know when I'm doing that,

1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:24.700
 but my process for me is very much lyrics and melody

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:27.500
 and music really come at the same time.

1:18:27.500 --> 1:18:30.360
 Like I, by same time, I mean, I'm,

1:18:31.740 --> 1:18:34.980
 I'm, as I'm expressing maybe, you know,

1:18:34.980 --> 1:18:35.820
 I'm feeling like.

1:18:42.780 --> 1:18:44.340
 Like, it's not that simple, but it's like,

1:18:44.340 --> 1:18:47.540
 I'll hear it, like, it's like, here's all the orchestra

1:18:47.540 --> 1:18:49.540
 and you're kind of just pressing all the buttons at once

1:18:49.540 --> 1:18:53.600
 and melody and my voice is just one of those instruments.

1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:54.440
 You know what I mean?

1:18:54.440 --> 1:18:56.020
 It's just utilizing one instrument.

1:18:56.020 --> 1:18:57.820
 So you've seen the landscape and that landscape

1:18:57.820 --> 1:19:01.220
 includes melody, includes percussion, lyrics a little bit,

1:19:01.220 --> 1:19:02.180
 or lyrics?

1:19:02.180 --> 1:19:05.180
 I will be words to begin with, like a word here and there.

1:19:05.180 --> 1:19:06.080
 Like, I'll be like.

1:19:10.580 --> 1:19:12.820
 You know, I'm like, what's a word that I'm thinking of

1:19:12.820 --> 1:19:14.780
 when I'm feeling this soundscape?

1:19:14.780 --> 1:19:19.280
 And I always create with no theme in mind.

1:19:19.280 --> 1:19:21.740
 I'm never, for better or for worse,

1:19:21.740 --> 1:19:24.400
 just my process is I'm sitting down

1:19:24.400 --> 1:19:26.580
 and I'm writing a journal entry.

1:19:26.580 --> 1:19:27.420
 Simple as that.

1:19:27.420 --> 1:19:29.500
 It's like, when you sit down to write a journal entry,

1:19:29.500 --> 1:19:31.860
 are you sitting down and you're like, Kev,

1:19:31.860 --> 1:19:33.980
 I've had all these words here that I'm gonna put on the page

1:19:33.980 --> 1:19:35.580
 and I'm gonna order it in this way.

1:19:35.580 --> 1:19:38.260
 And my theme for my journal entry today is gonna be this.

1:19:38.260 --> 1:19:39.380
 Maybe some people do, but I don't.

1:19:39.380 --> 1:19:42.060
 My journal entry is, I don't know what I'm gonna say.

1:19:42.060 --> 1:19:43.020
 Oh, how was today?

1:19:43.020 --> 1:19:45.480
 Well, man, today was this and feeling this.

1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:46.320
 And now that I think about that,

1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:47.660
 I'm really angry about that.

1:19:47.660 --> 1:19:49.380
 That hurt my feelings when this happened.

1:19:49.380 --> 1:19:51.900
 I mean, you're like, you're formulating it as you go

1:19:51.900 --> 1:19:53.080
 and that's the joy of it.

1:19:53.080 --> 1:19:55.360
 And for me, that's what music is.

1:19:55.360 --> 1:19:57.820
 So I'll sit down, not thinking,

1:19:57.820 --> 1:20:00.540
 hey, I've been wanting to write a song that has a hard beat

1:20:00.540 --> 1:20:02.220
 or I've been wanting to write a song that's anthemic

1:20:02.220 --> 1:20:03.860
 or I've been wanting to write a song that's,

1:20:03.860 --> 1:20:06.080
 it's like, how am I feeling right now?

1:20:06.080 --> 1:20:07.340
 And it's joyful?

1:20:07.340 --> 1:20:10.980
 Is the feeling joyful to you or is it struggle?

1:20:10.980 --> 1:20:14.460
 You just made it sound like it's joyful.

1:20:15.940 --> 1:20:17.300
 Or at least fulfilling.

1:20:17.300 --> 1:20:18.140
 I wouldn't use that.

1:20:18.140 --> 1:20:20.180
 Yeah, fulfilling is the word I was kind of looking for,

1:20:20.180 --> 1:20:21.020
 but there was.

1:20:21.020 --> 1:20:23.020
 There's a lot of artists talk about really struggle,

1:20:23.020 --> 1:20:24.500
 like you talk about writers.

1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:26.460
 Cathartic, that's the word I was looking for.

1:20:26.460 --> 1:20:30.460
 It feels like having a good moment with a therapist

1:20:30.460 --> 1:20:34.540
 where you're like, okay, I'm expressing this thing

1:20:34.540 --> 1:20:36.100
 that I just need to express.

1:20:36.100 --> 1:20:38.980
 For whatever reason, I need to express this.

1:20:38.980 --> 1:20:40.220
 The majority of the songs I write,

1:20:40.220 --> 1:20:41.580
 for the record, are never heard.

1:20:41.580 --> 1:20:43.800
 I write over 100 songs a year.

1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:47.900
 I release 20 songs every three years.

1:20:47.900 --> 1:20:49.780
 So, I don't know, what's that percent?

1:20:49.780 --> 1:20:51.120
 20 out of 300.

1:20:51.120 --> 1:20:51.960
 Come on, Lex.

1:20:53.960 --> 1:20:55.620
 It's less than 10%.

1:20:55.620 --> 1:20:56.740
 Less than 10%, yeah.

1:20:56.740 --> 1:20:57.780
 Eight, seven or something?

1:20:57.780 --> 1:20:58.620
 Yeah.

1:20:59.460 --> 1:21:01.080
 Anyway, so it's.

1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:02.680
 And then getting together with the band

1:21:02.680 --> 1:21:04.740
 and getting them selected down

1:21:04.740 --> 1:21:06.740
 is really what the process has.

1:21:06.740 --> 1:21:11.740
 So you're really writing a song per one to three days.

1:21:11.740 --> 1:21:16.380
 Three days, maybe a song that you can't quite figure out

1:21:16.380 --> 1:21:20.140
 the puzzle of that's gonna last a little longer.

1:21:20.140 --> 1:21:20.980
 Is it worth the struggle?

1:21:20.980 --> 1:21:22.100
 I finish every idea.

1:21:22.100 --> 1:21:23.940
 Yeah, you finish every idea.

1:21:23.940 --> 1:21:25.100
 I do, I finish every idea.

1:21:25.100 --> 1:21:28.100
 So it's not just like laying completely unfinished.

1:21:28.100 --> 1:21:30.000
 I could open my computer for you right now

1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:33.260
 and I would show you hundreds and hundreds of songs

1:21:33.260 --> 1:21:35.300
 that you would listen to and think,

1:21:35.300 --> 1:21:36.420
 that sounds like a song.

1:21:36.420 --> 1:21:38.340
 It's like there's rhythm, there's melody,

1:21:38.340 --> 1:21:40.660
 there's multiple instruments, there's lyrics.

1:21:40.660 --> 1:21:45.020
 Like I, it's the same thing as for coding for me,

1:21:45.020 --> 1:21:47.660
 which is music, which is I can't walk away

1:21:47.660 --> 1:21:48.500
 until I've completed it.

1:21:48.500 --> 1:21:50.160
 But it's finished.

1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:51.000
 Well, finished is.

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.860
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it sounds like a song.

1:21:52.860 --> 1:21:55.060
 I certainly do a lot more with it after,

1:21:55.060 --> 1:21:56.740
 with the band, we'll pull it all apart.

1:21:56.740 --> 1:21:58.140
 But it's a song.

1:21:58.140 --> 1:22:00.620
 It'll be like, you know, you'll listen to it and say,

1:22:00.620 --> 1:22:01.460
 okay, that was a song.

1:22:01.460 --> 1:22:05.820
 I get, you understand what it is, for sure.

1:22:05.820 --> 1:22:08.340
 Do you think, this is a painful question

1:22:08.340 --> 1:22:10.400
 from a fan perspective.

1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:15.400
 Do you think there's genius on your computer

1:22:15.500 --> 1:22:19.500
 that you walked away from that you just didn't notice it?

1:22:19.500 --> 1:22:21.980
 Like, do you think there's truly great songs

1:22:21.980 --> 1:22:25.940
 that you've written that you just didn't notice

1:22:25.940 --> 1:22:26.900
 how great they are?

1:22:26.900 --> 1:22:31.900
 I think greatness is something that I feel I'm,

1:22:32.340 --> 1:22:34.660
 I don't feel like I've achieved greatness.

1:22:34.660 --> 1:22:36.300
 Genuine, I'm not saying that to you

1:22:36.300 --> 1:22:38.220
 in a way of like humility, falseness.

1:22:38.220 --> 1:22:39.660
 Like Michael Jordan type.

1:22:39.660 --> 1:22:44.660
 No, genuinely, I feel like I am on a journey right now

1:22:45.020 --> 1:22:46.300
 to find who I am.

1:22:46.300 --> 1:22:48.980
 And I'm 34 and it's like, I don't even,

1:22:48.980 --> 1:22:50.920
 I haven't begun that journey.

1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:52.980
 I feel like I'm just starting that.

1:22:52.980 --> 1:22:57.980
 But that being said, I certainly don't know

1:22:59.180 --> 1:23:02.120
 the right answer to what songs are, you know,

1:23:02.120 --> 1:23:04.180
 beloved or good to the masses.

1:23:04.180 --> 1:23:06.640
 Like Imagine Dragons is such a massive entity.

1:23:06.640 --> 1:23:09.520
 It's like, there have been a, I will say this,

1:23:09.520 --> 1:23:12.260
 there are a couple of times where I fought really hard

1:23:12.260 --> 1:23:15.220
 to decide on the single, really hard.

1:23:15.220 --> 1:23:17.920
 Or I always fight for what goes on the record, always.

1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:19.220
 I always put the record together

1:23:19.220 --> 1:23:20.820
 and that's the record that I wanted to be

1:23:20.820 --> 1:23:22.520
 and me and the guys come up with that.

1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:25.780
 And it's nobody else has influenced, no manager, no label.

1:23:25.780 --> 1:23:29.220
 The single, everybody wants to have a saying.

1:23:29.220 --> 1:23:30.660
 Your label wants to have a saying in it.

1:23:30.660 --> 1:23:32.860
 Your manager wants to have a saying in it.

1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:35.260
 And I have fought really hard over that.

1:23:35.260 --> 1:23:37.660
 And I've been wrong before and I've been right before.

1:23:37.660 --> 1:23:42.140
 But as far as songs that I haven't put out, I mean.

1:23:43.040 --> 1:23:44.560
 Because you can imagine so many songs,

1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:47.800
 you think of so many Beatles songs

1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:49.400
 that are like some of their greats,

1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:51.320
 while my guitar gently weeps.

1:23:51.320 --> 1:23:55.360
 I'm trying to imagine weird sounding,

1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:57.440
 not that interesting possibly songs.

1:23:57.440 --> 1:23:58.720
 The majority of what we put them.

1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:02.160
 Honestly, it may be our best stuff

1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:03.640
 is that we don't put out for instance.

1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:08.640
 Because our band is such a, it's such a complex question.

1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:11.320
 I really don't know actually.

1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:12.600
 I don't know, maybe one day I'll die

1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:13.960
 and people will look and be like,

1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:16.040
 I hated Imagine Dragons, but now I listen to that song.

1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:17.680
 I really liked that, wish they would put that out.

1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:19.400
 Or maybe they'll be like, oh, it's all sounds like shit.

1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:20.400
 I don't really know.

1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:24.420
 Well, that's, sorry, it is a tragic thing.

1:24:24.420 --> 1:24:27.080
 That's why I asked it, which is like,

1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:31.080
 there could be some great, incredible things

1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:35.360
 that will take you a long time to rediscover,

1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:36.920
 to realize how great they are.

1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:40.840
 And it's also the tragic aspect of being an artist

1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:45.020
 is you don't know, forget fame or all that kind of stuff.

1:24:45.020 --> 1:24:46.880
 You don't know what's going to really move people.

1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:51.220
 Cause ultimately what you want is to connect with people

1:24:51.220 --> 1:24:53.320
 and you don't know what that's going to be.

1:24:54.240 --> 1:24:57.280
 It's hard, I mean, to me it's tragic

1:24:57.280 --> 1:24:58.480
 just as a fan of yours to see,

1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:01.720
 maybe I wonder if there's like incredible stuff there.

1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:04.400
 Just as it is tragic to see great artists throughout history

1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:06.920
 who didn't get recognition until they died.

1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:09.880
 It's like, cause they basically held on,

1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:14.160
 Franz Kafka was extremely self critical.

1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:17.620
 A lot of these folks had an idea of what's good and not,

1:25:17.620 --> 1:25:18.620
 and they were wrong.

1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:23.440
 They had genius, they weren't entirely wrong

1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:25.320
 cause they became sufficiently popular,

1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:27.240
 but it's interesting.

1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:29.840
 I try to genuinely to release the songs

1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:31.560
 that move me the most.

1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:32.400
 I'll say that.

1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:34.000
 You're your own audience.

1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:39.000
 Yeah, I try to put out the songs that make me feel the most.

1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:42.640
 Like I feel that, that's my only gauge

1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:45.480
 because it's so subjective of like, what is good?

1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:46.320
 What's this?

1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:48.960
 Nobody knows the song the masses are going to like.

1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:51.000
 Nobody knows that formula, nobody knows it.

1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.400
 So for me, it's always what makes me feel something.

1:25:53.400 --> 1:25:55.000
 One of the main lessons Rick Rubin taught me

1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:56.160
 when we worked with him on this record

1:25:56.160 --> 1:26:00.640
 was he would say, his main point

1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:03.640
 that he would continually bring up when like,

1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:05.100
 cause he's not the type of person to be like,

1:26:05.100 --> 1:26:06.680
 that's a bad song or that's good.

1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:07.800
 It's just not who Rick Rubin is.

1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:09.760
 It's more like, there's more nuance to it.

1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:14.600
 He would say, I don't really believe you on that song.

1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:16.960
 That's what he would say.

1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:19.000
 He would say, and I knew that was like,

1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:21.320
 that song's a no go.

1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:23.280
 He would say, and I would genuinely,

1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:24.920
 there was a time he said it and it was about a song

1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:27.760
 that I really like, I really felt it

1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:29.320
 and meant it when I said it.

1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:32.280
 But he didn't believe it when he heard it.

1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:33.240
 And that was enough for, I was like,

1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:35.080
 man, well, at the end of the day,

1:26:35.080 --> 1:26:36.400
 like I can believe it all I want,

1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:39.360
 but if the listener doesn't feel the honesty in it,

1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:40.360
 just like we were talking about earlier,

1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:42.480
 I think the most important ingredient is,

1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:45.860
 is this truth, perceived as truth to someone else?

1:26:45.860 --> 1:26:48.080
 And if it's not, the bullshit indicator goes,

1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:49.720
 and you're like, I don't care, I don't throw it away.

1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:50.560
 I don't care about it.

1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:55.480
 You said that he made you go through, like line by line,

1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:56.360
 the lyrics.

1:26:56.360 --> 1:26:58.660
 Every single, it was excruciating for me.

1:26:59.860 --> 1:27:02.280
 Why was that excruciating?

1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:03.920
 Well, first of all, it's Rick Rubin.

1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:06.520
 So you're in the room with like Rick Rubin,

1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:09.840
 who's done a lot of the greatest of all time.

1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:13.480
 And so I had to first just put that aside

1:27:13.480 --> 1:27:14.320
 and be like, okay, well,

1:27:14.320 --> 1:27:15.600
 you've done a lot of my favorite records,

1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:18.920
 but still you're human and not everything you say

1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:20.280
 is gonna be right.

1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:22.000
 And I'm a strongly opinionated person,

1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:23.200
 and so is Rick.

1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:24.960
 And so when the two of us were sitting down in a room

1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:27.040
 together, it was, you know.

1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:30.160
 But the lyrics, which is interesting.

1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:32.360
 So it's not the entire composition,

1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:34.240
 but just like, let's look at the lyrics.

1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:35.400
 What do you mean here?

1:27:35.400 --> 1:27:37.680
 Yeah, oh yeah, cause he would look over every,

1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:42.160
 there was like, and there were battles he won,

1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:45.760
 battles that he didn't win, and maybe he was right.

1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:46.600
 I don't know.

1:27:46.600 --> 1:27:48.120
 I mean, there was, for instance, I'll give you an example.

1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:50.760
 There was a song on the record called Number One.

1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:52.760
 Rick will probably laugh when he hears this.

1:27:54.080 --> 1:27:55.960
 Cause this was a big one that we kept going back

1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:57.120
 and forth on.

1:27:57.120 --> 1:27:58.440
 But this will give you a good insight

1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:01.120
 of what it was like.

1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:02.800
 And there's a line in it that says,

1:28:03.800 --> 1:28:04.800
 I don't know, the chorus is,

1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:06.360
 I don't know what I'm meant to be.

1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:08.320
 I don't need no one to believe.

1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:10.120
 When it's all been said and done,

1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:12.320
 I'm still my number one.

1:28:12.320 --> 1:28:14.320
 And he was like, nah, it just makes me cringe

1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:15.160
 when I hear that.

1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:19.800
 He's like, I just, like, do you have to be like,

1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:21.800
 can it not be like, you're still my number one?

1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:23.480
 And I was like, no, it's not about anybody else.

1:28:23.480 --> 1:28:25.560
 Like, you know, it's about like self love.

1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:28.120
 He's like, yeah, but like, do you need to like talk

1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:29.400
 about self love like that?

1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:31.680
 And I was like, well, I feel like I need to.

1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:33.040
 He's like, well, maybe, you know,

1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:34.280
 there's something else we could say there.

1:28:34.280 --> 1:28:36.000
 Like we just kept, you know,

1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.200
 we kept coming back to this song, okay?

1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:40.280
 I was like, and I changed it.

1:28:40.280 --> 1:28:41.720
 I tried changing it.

1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:42.560
 What did I change it to?

1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:44.600
 It was like, it wasn't you're still my number one,

1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:45.560
 it just made no sense.

1:28:45.560 --> 1:28:49.680
 It wasn't about some love thing or like someone else.

1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:50.920
 I changed it to something else.

1:28:50.920 --> 1:28:53.360
 And it just, it was the one thing that I was like,

1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:54.560
 I'm really sorry, Rick.

1:28:54.560 --> 1:28:57.000
 Like, I get it.

1:28:57.000 --> 1:28:58.120
 And if it sounds cringy to you,

1:28:58.120 --> 1:28:59.720
 it's definitely sounding cringy to other people too.

1:28:59.720 --> 1:29:00.560
 And that sucks.

1:29:00.560 --> 1:29:02.520
 But I don't know how else to say this

1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:05.760
 in a way that I want to put that song out anymore.

1:29:05.760 --> 1:29:07.400
 But there were other songs for sure

1:29:07.400 --> 1:29:09.840
 where Rick was like, that or this,

1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:11.960
 that word feels a little trite.

1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:13.040
 You already said that once.

1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:14.640
 Can you say it in a different way?

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:15.600
 It was really helpful.

1:29:15.600 --> 1:29:16.800
 And then, yeah.

1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:17.640
 It's really interesting

1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:20.960
 because you're trying to say something so simply

1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:24.120
 and yet not make it cringe.

1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:25.080
 And that's really hard.

1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:27.720
 That's a strange art form

1:29:27.720 --> 1:29:30.720
 because you want to say some of the greatest love songs.

1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:33.460
 I mean, we looked at the Without You song.

1:29:33.460 --> 1:29:35.600
 I mean, that's the whole thing is cringy.

1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:40.600
 If you just read it on paper, like it's a court report

1:29:40.600 --> 1:29:43.340
 or something, but yet it's not,

1:29:43.340 --> 1:29:45.520
 especially when sung maybe.

1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:49.400
 But no, there's something about, yeah, maybe.

1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:50.920
 Sung in a way you believe it.

1:29:50.920 --> 1:29:52.020
 When you believe it,

1:29:52.020 --> 1:29:54.900
 but also written in a way that's singable

1:29:54.900 --> 1:29:56.100
 in the way you believe it.

1:29:56.100 --> 1:29:56.940
 So it's like.

1:29:56.940 --> 1:29:57.780
 Right.

1:29:57.780 --> 1:29:58.600
 Right.

1:29:58.600 --> 1:29:59.440
 And then.

1:29:59.440 --> 1:30:00.280
 It rolls off.

1:30:00.280 --> 1:30:02.540
 It just comes out in a way that just feels like silky.

1:30:02.540 --> 1:30:05.940
 No word catches your mind as cringy.

1:30:05.940 --> 1:30:06.780
 Yes.

1:30:06.780 --> 1:30:08.100
 It's just.

1:30:08.100 --> 1:30:13.100
 But then music, I think great speeches are like that too,

1:30:13.500 --> 1:30:18.500
 or just conveying, communicating ideas simply.

1:30:19.180 --> 1:30:22.420
 That's the art form is to not be cringy.

1:30:22.420 --> 1:30:23.380
 So interesting.

1:30:23.380 --> 1:30:27.480
 And then yet, because like when you're raw and real,

1:30:29.700 --> 1:30:31.640
 it might at first feel cringy.

1:30:32.800 --> 1:30:34.520
 So the battle there,

1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:39.400
 and that's where you see people fail.

1:30:39.400 --> 1:30:40.660
 Like just regular artists.

1:30:40.660 --> 1:30:43.140
 Like, I don't know, at open mic,

1:30:43.140 --> 1:30:45.820
 I got open mic, so I just listen to musicians.

1:30:45.820 --> 1:30:48.940
 Like when they write songs, like they fail that test.

1:30:48.940 --> 1:30:50.900
 They write simple stuff, but it's cringy.

1:30:50.900 --> 1:30:51.740
 Why?

1:30:51.740 --> 1:30:52.580
 I wonder what was that?

1:30:52.580 --> 1:30:53.660
 Like, what is that?

1:30:53.660 --> 1:30:54.480
 I'm telling you, Lex,

1:30:54.480 --> 1:30:56.860
 I tried to explain this to my brother the other day,

1:30:58.040 --> 1:31:00.820
 because it's the same thing with a live performance.

1:31:00.820 --> 1:31:03.980
 If I'm not in my right head space and I walk on stage

1:31:03.980 --> 1:31:06.980
 and I walk up and let's say I say something and I do this,

1:31:08.500 --> 1:31:10.180
 because I'm like, this is the move, right?

1:31:10.180 --> 1:31:12.180
 I'm like, this is the move.

1:31:12.180 --> 1:31:13.460
 The crowd doesn't care.

1:31:13.460 --> 1:31:16.640
 In fact, the crowd's like, that's cringy when you did this.

1:31:16.640 --> 1:31:19.420
 But if I wasn't thinking about doing this

1:31:19.420 --> 1:31:21.460
 and I went up there and I said something

1:31:21.460 --> 1:31:24.260
 and I really meant it and my body was like,

1:31:24.260 --> 1:31:25.420
 I can't explain this to you,

1:31:25.420 --> 1:31:28.340
 and it's so silly to say out loud,

1:31:28.340 --> 1:31:33.340
 but people will resonate to it when it's real.

1:31:33.340 --> 1:31:35.160
 And when it's acted, it doesn't,

1:31:35.160 --> 1:31:36.520
 you could do it the exact,

1:31:36.520 --> 1:31:39.020
 the motion could look the same, your eyes look the same,

1:31:39.020 --> 1:31:42.600
 but there's something about the energy that people know.

1:31:42.600 --> 1:31:44.000
 They know if it's real or not.

1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:45.460
 Yeah, people have, like you said,

1:31:45.460 --> 1:31:46.800
 incredible bullshit detectors.

1:31:46.800 --> 1:31:47.720
 That's why I love people. A hundred percent.

1:31:47.720 --> 1:31:50.240
 I'll go on a stage and if I'm not in the right head space

1:31:50.240 --> 1:31:52.600
 to be real, it won't be a good show.

1:31:52.600 --> 1:31:54.400
 If I'm real, then it's a good show.

1:31:54.400 --> 1:31:55.460
 It's as simple as that.

1:31:55.460 --> 1:31:56.760
 Let's go through the song.

1:31:59.200 --> 1:32:00.800
 Like I said, great opener.

1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:03.160
 So you had this in your mind,

1:32:03.160 --> 1:32:04.000
 this landscape?

1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:05.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:32:11.380 --> 1:32:13.780
 The beat was first on this.

1:32:13.780 --> 1:32:16.120
 What about the first and the second,

1:32:16.120 --> 1:32:17.920
 like first thing's first, second thing's second?

1:32:17.920 --> 1:32:21.140
 The first line I wrote was first thing's first.

1:32:21.140 --> 1:32:23.280
 I don't know why, it just was like,

1:32:23.280 --> 1:32:25.840
 and then I was like, oh, that principle of, you know.

1:32:27.100 --> 1:32:28.080
 Great line.

1:32:28.920 --> 1:32:30.240
 Second thing's second.

1:32:30.240 --> 1:32:33.600
 Don't you tell me what you think that I could be.

1:32:33.600 --> 1:32:35.880
 I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea.

1:32:35.880 --> 1:32:37.440
 I'm the master of my sea.

1:32:37.440 --> 1:32:39.360
 My dad had that in his office.

1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:44.360
 He had this saying that was something about the sailor

1:32:44.520 --> 1:32:47.960
 and being the master of his sea that I always loved.

1:32:47.960 --> 1:32:49.840
 There you go, simple statement.

1:32:49.840 --> 1:32:50.680
 Yeah.

1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:51.840
 Zero cringe in it.

1:32:51.840 --> 1:32:53.520
 It's so powerful.

1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:55.280
 It's so simple.

1:32:55.280 --> 1:32:56.280
 I'm the master of my sea.

1:32:56.280 --> 1:32:59.600
 This whole song is just trivial,

1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:03.760
 but in terms of lyrically,

1:33:03.760 --> 1:33:06.940
 but extremely powerful and original, unique sounding,

1:33:06.940 --> 1:33:08.420
 something about the words.

1:33:08.420 --> 1:33:10.080
 Just even, you don't have to actually sing them,

1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:11.120
 you just read them.

1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:14.960
 And then raw, I was broken from a young age,

1:33:14.960 --> 1:33:18.000
 tuck myself into the masses, writing my poems for the few

1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:20.640
 that look at me, took to me, shook at me,

1:33:20.640 --> 1:33:23.000
 feeling me, singing from the heartache, from the pain,

1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:24.760
 taking my message from the thing.

1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:27.520
 I can't, why am I reciting your words to you?

1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:30.660
 But the percussionist throughout it,

1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:34.320
 and that was there in the beginning.

1:33:34.320 --> 1:33:36.280
 The percussion is almost in the lyrics, yeah.

1:33:36.280 --> 1:33:37.640
 And I'm a very percussive singer

1:33:37.640 --> 1:33:40.800
 because I was a drummer first before I,

1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:44.120
 I think same with Dave Grohl, probably a similar thing,

1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:49.120
 which is I think in percussive sense a lot when I'm writing

1:33:49.640 --> 1:33:52.820
 and I also was, before I could play an instrument,

1:33:52.820 --> 1:33:54.160
 I would beatbox.

1:33:54.160 --> 1:33:56.340
 And I think Michael Jackson did this too, actually.

1:33:56.340 --> 1:33:58.520
 I've heard in the studio that he was very similar,

1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:02.360
 but a lot of what I do is percussive

1:34:03.400 --> 1:34:06.500
 because my brain thinks in percussively first.

1:34:07.840 --> 1:34:08.680
 A little more, because it's so good.

1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:09.680
 It's almost like a drum, like,

1:34:09.680 --> 1:34:14.400
 dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka.

1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:16.040
 And then you lay words on that.

1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:18.920
 Yeah.

1:34:18.920 --> 1:34:19.760
 Yeah, this.

1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:22.760
 Tuck myself into the masses, writing my poems for the few

1:34:22.760 --> 1:34:25.200
 that look at me, took to me, shook at me, feeling me,

1:34:25.200 --> 1:34:30.200
 it's almost like drums, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka.

1:34:30.840 --> 1:34:32.440
 It's all building to the chorus.

1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:39.440
 Hey, you made me a, you made me a believer, believer.

1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:41.080
 Hey, hey.

1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:44.360
 What about the word pain?

1:34:45.400 --> 1:34:46.640
 When did that come to you?

1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:51.400
 Pain, you made me, you made me a believer.

1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:53.040
 Yeah, just the idea of,

1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:57.400
 I just wanted to, I really,

1:34:57.400 --> 1:35:00.400
 one of the things that a lot of the songs that I like,

1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:05.400
 I like divisiveness, for instance, not always,

1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:07.320
 but there's times where I want someone to hear a song

1:35:07.320 --> 1:35:09.120
 and I want them to either love it or hate it.

1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:11.600
 I really don't want them to be in the middle ground.

1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:13.360
 A lot of the songs that,

1:35:13.360 --> 1:35:18.280
 like a lot of my favorite songs are divisive songs.

1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:22.480
 And so for instance, with pain,

1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:26.360
 I want you to hear that in almost like, it's like, whoa.

1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:27.200
 You know what I mean?

1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:29.320
 It's something either somebody is going to hear

1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:30.160
 and they'll be like, man,

1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:31.440
 I just don't want to hear that like that.

1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:33.360
 Or it's like, oh, I felt that so deeply

1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:35.640
 when he said that in that way, because it sounded like this.

1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:38.520
 And when you think of the word pain, it's like,

1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:43.520
 that's a, at least for me, when I hear that word,

1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:48.180
 it carries a lot of weight, carries a lot of weight.

1:35:48.180 --> 1:35:50.520
 So I wanted to sing it with a lot of weight

1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:52.760
 and to come into that chorus with like,

1:35:52.760 --> 1:35:55.100
 like it's a striking moment.

1:35:56.160 --> 1:35:58.520
 And I'm also a tenor singing as,

1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:01.280
 sorry, I'm a baritone singing as a tenor.

1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:04.100
 So that's where that natural,

1:36:04.100 --> 1:36:05.880
 like gruffness comes from is that I'm singing

1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:08.240
 out of my range really, up in my head voice.

1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:10.080
 And it carries a lot of weight with it

1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:11.320
 because of the baritone.

1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:15.960
 Can I ask you a specific sort of the pause before the pain?

1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:18.500
 It's really interesting.

1:36:18.500 --> 1:36:20.640
 Cause it's like a double.

1:36:20.640 --> 1:36:25.640
 What is that, how much work does that take

1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:28.200
 to get that right?

1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:29.760
 That's incredible.

1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:33.000
 Cause it's like a, so you're kind of seeing the beauty

1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:36.560
 through the, and then that, whatever that sound is.

1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:38.040
 Right, the bass being rolled off.

1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:39.480
 Yeah.

1:36:39.480 --> 1:36:43.240
 Yeah, I actually, when I first was approaching the chorus,

1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:44.720
 it was actually seeing,

1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:48.680
 taking my message from the veins,

1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:49.800
 taking my lesson from the veins,

1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:51.840
 seeing the beauty through the,

1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:53.920
 seeing the beauty through the pain.

1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:56.260
 You made me a, like it came in on one.

1:36:56.260 --> 1:36:59.080
 I'm not seeing it right right now, but it did not wait.

1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:02.440
 And it felt like it didn't hit

1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:04.000
 in the way that it was supposed to hit.

1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.300
 Because the, you predict that, right?

1:37:07.300 --> 1:37:09.200
 You're like, you're waiting to see the beauty

1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:11.080
 through the pain, you made me a, right?

1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:13.320
 It was like the beauty through the pain.

1:37:13.320 --> 1:37:15.200
 You made me a, made me.

1:37:15.200 --> 1:37:17.720
 So I wanted to feel a little more like striking,

1:37:17.720 --> 1:37:19.960
 like, again, it's like that thing that makes you

1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:20.960
 kind of do this a little bit.

1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:22.160
 You're like, huh?

1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:25.160
 But once you hear it a few times, you're like, ah, ah.

1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:26.320
 And you predict, you know what I mean?

1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:29.200
 It's like, I'd rather someone hear our song the first time

1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:31.320
 and be confused by it.

1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:33.120
 So they play it the second time.

1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:34.440
 And then they're like, oh, okay.

1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:35.280
 You know what I mean?

1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:39.400
 Like, I really don't want, you know,

1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:41.800
 I'd rather turn some people off along the way.

1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:43.560
 And then the people who come along for you

1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:46.960
 are gonna feel more committed, I think.

1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:49.120
 It's just an interesting, like,

1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:53.080
 it feels gutsy to insert silence, you know?

1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:54.240
 Yeah, that's what makes it, you know,

1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:57.080
 it's like the greatest speakers of all time are like,

1:37:57.080 --> 1:37:58.280
 and I told you.

1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:00.760
 Right.

1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:04.280
 You would know, I mean, it's like, you're like, oh.

1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:05.840
 Yeah, what is that?

1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:07.840
 Yeah, that's so interesting to do that

1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:09.080
 just at the right time.

1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:13.480
 And then, and then pain, right?

1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:15.880
 Man, it's a brilliant song.

1:38:15.880 --> 1:38:18.720
 Did you know it was a good song when you wrote it?

1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:20.800
 Out of the thousands of songs you've written?

1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:23.040
 You know, it's always the same thing for me,

1:38:23.040 --> 1:38:27.080
 which is like, if I wanna listen to the song

1:38:28.320 --> 1:38:29.680
 and I wanna listen to it a lot of times,

1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:31.840
 then those are the songs we put out.

1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:33.560
 And I only wanna listen to the songs

1:38:33.560 --> 1:38:35.040
 that make me feel something.

1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:36.600
 Whether or not it's like,

1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:39.920
 our single that did the very worst of all our singles

1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:42.880
 was the song that I wanted to listen to the least,

1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:45.000
 but it made the most sense as a single,

1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:46.680
 which was all the wrong reason to choose it, right?

1:38:46.680 --> 1:38:50.520
 It was, I Bet My Life is the single off our second album.

1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:51.840
 And that song was originally written,

1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:53.240
 it was just a guitar and a vocal,

1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:56.320
 and it was very just quiet and laid back.

1:38:56.320 --> 1:38:59.160
 And we were like, well, let's try to dial it up,

1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:00.040
 let's try to produce it.

1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:01.960
 And we overproduced that song.

1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:05.440
 We self produced it as a band and we overproduced.

1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:10.440
 And that song, I mean, it did good in terms of a song,

1:39:10.440 --> 1:39:14.200
 but for us, it did not do good compared to other songs.

1:39:14.200 --> 1:39:15.960
 And I really look back at that

1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:17.160
 and learned a lesson from that.

1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:19.560
 It's like, if I don't wanna listen to the song,

1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:21.880
 that's a sign already.

1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:23.880
 If you don't wanna listen to your own song,

1:39:23.880 --> 1:39:25.040
 it's probably not a good song.

1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:26.560
 Yeah.

1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:30.320
 You said your dad, elsewhere and today,

1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:35.320
 just said that your dad early on was a kind of the early

1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:37.120
 Rick Rubin.

1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:38.280
 Yeah.

1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:41.880
 So when you were starting out, he gave you feedback,

1:39:41.880 --> 1:39:42.720
 you listened.

1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:47.000
 What did you learn about music about life from your dad?

1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:53.080
 My dad is a really quiet farm, grew up on a farm,

1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:54.280
 very humble.

1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:59.280
 And I think he starts every sentence by saying,

1:40:00.680 --> 1:40:02.840
 this is just my two cents, pretty much.

1:40:02.840 --> 1:40:03.680
 You know what I mean?

1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:05.240
 It's like, take it or leave it.

1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:06.080
 Like, you know what I mean?

1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:08.240
 He's that kind of a sense, like there's humility

1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:09.960
 in everything and it's real for him.

1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:12.400
 It's not like false humility.

1:40:12.400 --> 1:40:14.160
 I really feel like when he's saying things,

1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:17.480
 he really is like, maybe this isn't any worth to you son.

1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:19.360
 And he means it, but here it is.

1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:20.200
 And it's always gold.

1:40:20.200 --> 1:40:22.600
 And I'm like, wow, dad, that's incredible.

1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:24.880
 So what, in those early days of you like,

1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:26.480
 so you were like 12 or something like that,

1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:27.320
 like starting to write songs.

1:40:27.320 --> 1:40:30.040
 I was 12, I wasn't showing my music to anyone.

1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:31.280
 I started writing right when I was 12

1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:33.120
 and I probably wrote for at least,

1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:34.480
 let's say six months or something.

1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:36.280
 And I had written probably, I don't know,

1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:38.560
 like a lot of songs during that time.

1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:39.640
 What was the topic by the way?

1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:40.480
 Love, anger?

1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:41.960
 It was all sad.

1:40:41.960 --> 1:40:53.320
 No, it was, the first song I ever wrote went,

1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:54.280
 and it was like a bluesy thing.

1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:55.720
 It was like, there was my voice doing that.

1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:56.560
 And then it was like,

1:40:56.560 --> 1:41:01.760
 all by himself, no other one around.

1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:04.440
 And he stood all alone.

1:41:04.440 --> 1:41:07.640
 When would he be found?

1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:10.120
 Did he want company?

1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:13.480
 Or was he fine on his own?

1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:15.920
 Everyone needs a friend.

1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:21.120
 So why was he all alone?

1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:24.760
 You know, it is like, but I was like a 12 year old with,

1:41:24.760 --> 1:41:28.880
 I just felt like depressed for the first time.

1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:31.560
 And I was, and I just was like, so.

1:41:31.560 --> 1:41:33.040
 I think he discovered the blues as a 12 year old.

1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:34.360
 Yeah, right, right.

1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:36.080
 It really was, it was like my sense of the blues

1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:38.080
 at that time for sure, like bad version of the blues.

1:41:38.080 --> 1:41:40.920
 But it was like 12 year old kid with a bunch of acne.

1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:43.880
 And like, I just like, I hated going to school.

1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:46.680
 I felt like that I just had not found myself.

1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:48.000
 Sounds like a great song, by the way.

1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:49.480
 But anyway, I wanted to keep listening.

1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:50.320
 I forgot I was.

1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:55.160
 Yeah, I don't know about that, but yeah.

1:41:55.160 --> 1:41:56.400
 Yeah, what was your dad,

1:41:56.400 --> 1:41:58.560
 at which point did you begin to share it with your dad?

1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:00.120
 A lot of the songs that I wrote in the beginning

1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:02.120
 were very much like Bobby McFerrin like that,

1:42:02.120 --> 1:42:05.240
 because our, Mike was in a part of the house

1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:06.480
 where I couldn't bring over the piano.

1:42:06.480 --> 1:42:07.840
 And the only instrument I played at the time

1:42:07.840 --> 1:42:08.680
 was the piano.

1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:11.120
 So I would do everything with my voice.

1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:13.200
 But then I started teaching myself the guitar

1:42:13.200 --> 1:42:15.200
 in those, in that beginning, like six month period,

1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:17.360
 just watching my brothers play in their garage bands

1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:18.320
 in the basement.

1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:19.280
 And then I started to write songs

1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:20.720
 a little bit more like Enya vibes,

1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:22.920
 like stack my voice like 20, 30 times.

1:42:22.920 --> 1:42:26.320
 And like Enya meets like Jaray,

1:42:26.320 --> 1:42:28.360
 which is who my dad would listen to a lot.

1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:31.280
 John Michael Jaray, he's an incredible synth genius.

1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:36.280
 But anyway, so I finally got my like gall up enough

1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:38.320
 to show it to my dad one day after work.

1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:39.800
 And I got very little of my dad

1:42:39.800 --> 1:42:41.320
 because there were nine kids and he worked

1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:43.680
 from 8 a.m. till 6 p.m.

1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:44.680
 We'll come home very tired.

1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:47.320
 And here's nine kids that are like, dad, you know,

1:42:47.320 --> 1:42:48.160
 and you're the young one.

1:42:48.160 --> 1:42:49.480
 You're not, you're just gonna miss.

1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:50.720
 I was in the middle kind of too.

1:42:50.720 --> 1:42:53.360
 So it's even, you know, middle child thing.

1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:54.480
 But I sat him down and I was like,

1:42:54.480 --> 1:42:57.360
 hey dad, I just wanna like kind of show you a song.

1:42:57.360 --> 1:42:58.840
 And he was like, oh, you know,

1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:00.320
 he didn't know I was writing anything.

1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:02.720
 And I showed it to him and he listened

1:43:02.720 --> 1:43:04.160
 and he took it off and he really looked at me.

1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:06.920
 And he was like, that was really good.

1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:08.640
 He was like, I've thought, and this,

1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:10.440
 when you said this, it made me feel this.

1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:12.040
 He was like, and that did it.

1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:14.320
 I probably would have given up music.

1:43:14.320 --> 1:43:17.520
 Like I look back, that was a very pivotal moment for me.

1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:20.920
 I was like in a place where I was like, is this good, bad?

1:43:20.920 --> 1:43:23.960
 I don't know, maybe it's so embarrassing and terrible.

1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:25.160
 And I was already writing lyrics

1:43:25.160 --> 1:43:27.480
 that were a little like overly metaphorical to hide

1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:29.200
 that I was dealing with faith crisis.

1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:31.240
 Cause I thought, okay, I'm gonna show this to dad.

1:43:31.240 --> 1:43:33.360
 I don't want my dad to know I'm like questioning

1:43:33.360 --> 1:43:35.560
 the truthfulness of Joseph Smith.

1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:38.560
 So I'm not gonna be like, is Joseph Smith a real prophet?

1:43:38.560 --> 1:43:39.760
 Is Mormonism true?

1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:40.600
 I don't really know.

1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:41.440
 Like, you know what I mean?

1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:43.480
 I was like writing way overly metaphorical,

1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:46.000
 but because my dad really validated it

1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:47.840
 and he was a no bullshit person.

1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:50.080
 So I knew when my dad said that, I was like, you know what?

1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:52.400
 At least my dad really actually thinks this is cool.

1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:54.520
 And I really trusted my dad's taste

1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:56.840
 and thought everything he listened to was cool.

1:43:56.840 --> 1:43:59.120
 So I was like, wow, I'm gonna keep doing this.

1:43:59.120 --> 1:44:01.080
 And I just showed it to my dad for years and years.

1:44:01.080 --> 1:44:03.160
 And still to this day, I send every song to my dad.

1:44:03.160 --> 1:44:06.520
 So he underneath it with the feedback is always like,

1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:07.480
 Ooh, I like this idea.

1:44:07.480 --> 1:44:08.320
 I like this.

1:44:08.320 --> 1:44:09.160
 It's just a positive, like a.

1:44:09.160 --> 1:44:10.400
 Not always positive, no.

1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:13.000
 But like underneath it, do you sense the positivity?

1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.080
 Cause I think that's. Always.

1:44:15.080 --> 1:44:18.420
 Never mean, never malicious.

1:44:19.640 --> 1:44:21.440
 You know, there's like, there's two types of criticism.

1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:22.840
 There's like criticism that's just like,

1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:24.680
 you're looking to be hurtful to someone.

1:44:24.680 --> 1:44:26.560
 And then there's criticism that's like

1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:28.600
 really important for art.

1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:30.700
 It's the type of criticism that's like,

1:44:30.700 --> 1:44:32.480
 you see the value in what's happening.

1:44:32.480 --> 1:44:34.360
 And if it's honest, then you can,

1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:35.980
 you maybe communicate with that person.

1:44:35.980 --> 1:44:39.280
 Like I, I see what you're trying to do with that.

1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:40.800
 You know, it's not even like you have to say that

1:44:40.800 --> 1:44:42.020
 or whatever, like butter it up.

1:44:42.020 --> 1:44:45.200
 But it's like, my dad would just give me the,

1:44:45.200 --> 1:44:49.320
 this honest criticism that would be like, you know,

1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:51.760
 it certainly wasn't always good,

1:44:51.760 --> 1:44:53.540
 but I knew it was always well intentioned.

1:44:53.540 --> 1:44:55.200
 I guess that's, that's how I would say.

1:44:55.200 --> 1:44:57.260
 You mentioned, made me re listen to it.

1:44:57.260 --> 1:44:58.600
 I'm a big fan of Cass Stevens.

1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:00.640
 You made me re listen to father and son.

1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:03.280
 I probably all sons have issues

1:45:03.280 --> 1:45:05.740
 to work through with their fathers.

1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:10.560
 And you said that you connect with this song in particular.

1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:13.180
 I think, so you're a father now.

1:45:13.180 --> 1:45:16.200
 What is it about the song that connects with you?

1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:19.540
 For people, let me play it, let me play a little bit.

1:45:19.540 --> 1:45:21.940
 People should educate themselves on Cass Stevens.

1:45:21.940 --> 1:45:22.780
 Oh my gosh.

1:45:22.780 --> 1:45:23.620
 Right on the peace train.

1:45:23.620 --> 1:45:27.000
 The best, the best, right on the peace train.

1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:29.840
 You think this is a hopeful, a sad song?

1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:31.160
 I hear it as hopeful.

1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:33.520
 I hear it as a loving father saying

1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:34.840
 just what his son needs to hear.

1:45:34.840 --> 1:45:38.260
 It's not time to make a change.

1:45:38.260 --> 1:45:42.040
 Just relax, take it easy.

1:45:42.040 --> 1:45:43.920
 You're still young.

1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:45.760
 That's your fault.

1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:47.720
 There's so much you have.

1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:49.400
 It's like that calm wisdom.

1:45:50.600 --> 1:45:51.440
 Yeah.

1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:52.260
 This time.

1:45:52.260 --> 1:45:53.100
 It wise.

1:45:53.100 --> 1:45:57.900
 If you want, you can marry, look at me.

1:45:57.900 --> 1:46:01.340
 I am old, but I'm happy.

1:46:01.340 --> 1:46:02.180
 And just the way he says that,

1:46:02.180 --> 1:46:03.180
 like that should be a corny line,

1:46:03.180 --> 1:46:04.220
 but it's not corny at all.

1:46:04.220 --> 1:46:05.060
 It's like.

1:46:05.060 --> 1:46:07.060
 Once like you are now.

1:46:07.060 --> 1:46:09.020
 Look at me, I'm old, but I'm happy.

1:46:09.020 --> 1:46:13.100
 It's not easy to be calm

1:46:13.100 --> 1:46:15.860
 when you found something going on.

1:46:15.860 --> 1:46:17.620
 Yeah, I mean, the simplicity there,

1:46:17.620 --> 1:46:22.620
 and it's such a contrast with, what's his name?

1:46:24.020 --> 1:46:26.340
 Harry Chapman with the cats in the cradle,

1:46:26.340 --> 1:46:31.340
 which is like the sadness of,

1:46:33.500 --> 1:46:38.380
 so this feels like there's a wise,

1:46:38.380 --> 1:46:42.100
 calm connection between father and son, right?

1:46:42.100 --> 1:46:44.540
 With cats in the cradle.

1:46:44.540 --> 1:46:46.500
 I don't know if you remember that song.

1:46:47.620 --> 1:46:49.420
 He learned to walk while I was away

1:46:49.420 --> 1:46:51.900
 and he was talking before I knew it.

1:46:51.900 --> 1:46:54.680
 And as he grew, he'd say, I'm going to be like you dad.

1:46:54.680 --> 1:46:56.020
 You know, I'm going to be like you.

1:46:56.020 --> 1:46:58.620
 And the idea of that song is

1:46:58.620 --> 1:47:00.300
 that he does become like his dad,

1:47:01.940 --> 1:47:03.940
 which is funny, you know, something you've said.

1:47:05.260 --> 1:47:06.460
 But in a different way,

1:47:06.460 --> 1:47:09.260
 you become too busy to make that connection.

1:47:09.260 --> 1:47:12.380
 His dad was too busy to make a connection with his son.

1:47:12.380 --> 1:47:14.380
 And in a, not in a dramatic way,

1:47:14.380 --> 1:47:16.340
 in a very kind of calm, natural way.

1:47:16.340 --> 1:47:18.340
 Like you don't, you just don't have time.

1:47:19.340 --> 1:47:21.980
 You're busy at work, you're providing for the family

1:47:21.980 --> 1:47:23.220
 and so on, there's connection.

1:47:23.220 --> 1:47:24.660
 But if you don't really get,

1:47:24.660 --> 1:47:27.060
 form that like depth of connection.

1:47:27.060 --> 1:47:31.020
 And then the father, when the son shows up from college

1:47:31.020 --> 1:47:31.860
 and all that kind of stuff,

1:47:31.860 --> 1:47:34.060
 he doesn't spend any time with the father.

1:47:34.060 --> 1:47:37.300
 All that, and just the calm sadness of that,

1:47:37.300 --> 1:47:40.340
 that we live, we can live parallel lives

1:47:40.340 --> 1:47:42.100
 and never quite connect.

1:47:42.100 --> 1:47:44.220
 And there is a little bit of that in father and son

1:47:44.220 --> 1:47:45.580
 with Cat Stevens too, you know,

1:47:45.580 --> 1:47:47.380
 like when the son is saying,

1:47:48.420 --> 1:47:51.580
 from the moment that I could talk, I was ordered to listen.

1:47:51.580 --> 1:47:54.060
 I always remember listening to that line,

1:47:54.060 --> 1:47:56.980
 feeling like that really moved me.

1:47:56.980 --> 1:47:59.700
 But the beauty of that song is it shows,

1:47:59.700 --> 1:48:01.860
 it's kind of like the theme of what I feel like

1:48:01.860 --> 1:48:03.500
 we've talked about since the second you got here,

1:48:03.500 --> 1:48:05.020
 which is something I really like.

1:48:05.020 --> 1:48:06.540
 I don't know why it's such an important theme

1:48:06.540 --> 1:48:11.340
 in my life right now, but the duality of just understanding

1:48:11.340 --> 1:48:14.580
 that you don't understand someone else's situation.

1:48:14.580 --> 1:48:16.620
 And there's truth to both sides.

1:48:16.620 --> 1:48:19.140
 Like there's truth to what the father is saying to the son.

1:48:19.140 --> 1:48:20.740
 He's like saying these things and he's like,

1:48:20.740 --> 1:48:23.380
 I'm looking out for you, I love you.

1:48:23.380 --> 1:48:24.460
 Take your time with these things.

1:48:24.460 --> 1:48:26.020
 If you want to get married, you know you can.

1:48:26.020 --> 1:48:27.020
 Like these things will bring you up.

1:48:27.020 --> 1:48:29.500
 And then the son saying, listen,

1:48:29.500 --> 1:48:31.180
 like I want to pave my own path.

1:48:31.180 --> 1:48:32.020
 I want to do this.

1:48:32.020 --> 1:48:33.300
 Like, why are you telling me this?

1:48:33.300 --> 1:48:36.180
 Like the son's not wrong.

1:48:36.180 --> 1:48:37.540
 Cause there's a lot of parents who tell their kids

1:48:37.540 --> 1:48:40.180
 what to do and they're wrong, you know what I mean?

1:48:40.180 --> 1:48:43.820
 Like, and they don't let the kid form the path

1:48:43.820 --> 1:48:47.380
 that they need to, but should you not be a parent?

1:48:47.380 --> 1:48:48.220
 Like, you know what I mean?

1:48:48.220 --> 1:48:49.060
 There's just two sides to it.

1:48:49.060 --> 1:48:54.060
 There's a thing, it is annoying when you're older,

1:48:54.860 --> 1:48:58.260
 you get to see people do all the same things.

1:48:58.260 --> 1:49:03.260
 You could say, well, this is a phase and you'll see

1:49:05.820 --> 1:49:08.260
 that this actually will end up in this way.

1:49:08.260 --> 1:49:10.260
 You can like predict how the life unrolls.

1:49:10.260 --> 1:49:12.380
 And it's very annoying for young people to hear,

1:49:12.380 --> 1:49:14.020
 especially cause it's probably going to be true.

1:49:14.020 --> 1:49:16.380
 It's like, no, it's not going to be like this.

1:49:16.380 --> 1:49:17.300
 No, I'm going to be different.

1:49:17.300 --> 1:49:18.940
 But then you become that person.

1:49:18.940 --> 1:49:22.660
 But that doesn't mean they also let them live that life.

1:49:22.660 --> 1:49:24.740
 Let them make the mistakes,

1:49:24.740 --> 1:49:26.340
 but they're not mistakes actually.

1:49:26.340 --> 1:49:30.660
 They're like beautiful deviations

1:49:30.660 --> 1:49:34.500
 from the path that they end up on.

1:49:34.500 --> 1:49:36.660
 And those make the path.

1:49:38.180 --> 1:49:43.060
 Do you have advice for young folks today?

1:49:43.060 --> 1:49:48.060
 You've had like an incredible dark journey

1:49:48.060 --> 1:49:51.380
 and a successful one, a loving one,

1:49:52.220 --> 1:49:55.940
 and one of the most successful artists in the world.

1:49:55.940 --> 1:49:58.420
 Is there advice you can give to young people today

1:49:58.420 --> 1:50:01.140
 that would like to find themselves to that way,

1:50:01.140 --> 1:50:02.580
 especially if they're struggling?

1:50:02.580 --> 1:50:04.060
 I thought you said device at first.

1:50:04.060 --> 1:50:05.780
 And I was like, honestly,

1:50:05.780 --> 1:50:07.700
 I feel like that device is not helping.

1:50:07.700 --> 1:50:10.940
 Maybe everybody should get away,

1:50:10.940 --> 1:50:12.820
 throw away their devices.

1:50:12.820 --> 1:50:13.820
 Advice.

1:50:13.820 --> 1:50:18.820
 I would just say like what I emphasize to my kids

1:50:20.580 --> 1:50:24.580
 is I really, really want my kids

1:50:24.580 --> 1:50:27.260
 to just learn to love themself.

1:50:27.260 --> 1:50:29.820
 It's easier said than done.

1:50:29.820 --> 1:50:32.260
 It's really easy to pick on yourself in life.

1:50:33.220 --> 1:50:35.860
 It's really easy to look in the mirror

1:50:35.860 --> 1:50:37.540
 and wish you looked different,

1:50:37.540 --> 1:50:41.300
 wish you were more successful like that person over there,

1:50:41.300 --> 1:50:44.660
 wish that, you know, wish a lot of things.

1:50:45.580 --> 1:50:50.580
 And people that I see that really succeed at life

1:50:52.100 --> 1:50:53.580
 really succeed truly.

1:50:53.580 --> 1:50:55.740
 And that doesn't mean they're making money necessarily

1:50:55.740 --> 1:50:56.620
 or they're succeeding.

1:50:56.620 --> 1:50:58.620
 And, you know, they're talking to a lot of people

1:50:58.620 --> 1:51:03.300
 like their success, success to me is like happy

1:51:03.300 --> 1:51:06.140
 and real, they have real self love.

1:51:06.140 --> 1:51:07.700
 You meet, you know, when you meet someone,

1:51:07.700 --> 1:51:10.700
 you meet Rick, for instance, you meet Rick Rubin.

1:51:10.700 --> 1:51:12.180
 Rick has a calmness about him.

1:51:12.180 --> 1:51:13.620
 And it's funny because everybody sees him

1:51:13.620 --> 1:51:16.460
 as this like Zen master.

1:51:16.460 --> 1:51:21.460
 Like Rick is just a really loving person

1:51:22.500 --> 1:51:24.820
 who also loves himself and has self confidence

1:51:24.820 --> 1:51:26.940
 because you just see it and it resonates.

1:51:26.940 --> 1:51:28.060
 And that's why he draws people.

1:51:28.060 --> 1:51:29.380
 And that's why he's so great in the studio

1:51:29.380 --> 1:51:31.740
 because you know his intentions, always.

1:51:31.740 --> 1:51:33.900
 As an artist, when a producer comes in, you're like,

1:51:33.900 --> 1:51:35.940
 whoa, whoa, whoa, what are your intentions?

1:51:35.940 --> 1:51:36.780
 What are you trying to do?

1:51:36.780 --> 1:51:38.460
 Are you trying to get a hit out of me for the label?

1:51:38.460 --> 1:51:40.020
 Are you trying to make me something?

1:51:40.020 --> 1:51:41.340
 Are you trying to like make me this

1:51:41.340 --> 1:51:42.660
 so you can prove this about yourself?

1:51:42.660 --> 1:51:44.740
 Like there's a lot in that dynamic.

1:51:44.740 --> 1:51:47.420
 And the reason that Rick is so good is because

1:51:47.420 --> 1:51:50.460
 you know his intentions and his intentions come

1:51:50.460 --> 1:51:52.020
 because Rick has that self love.

1:51:52.020 --> 1:51:56.300
 So for me, find the things about yourself

1:51:56.300 --> 1:51:58.580
 because they're there that you love

1:51:59.580 --> 1:52:01.700
 and really focus in on them.

1:52:01.700 --> 1:52:02.740
 And it's not selfish.

1:52:02.740 --> 1:52:05.140
 Like I feel like I was brought up in a family too

1:52:05.140 --> 1:52:09.940
 where it was like, never look inward, like be selfless.

1:52:09.940 --> 1:52:11.340
 Like serve, serve, serve.

1:52:11.340 --> 1:52:14.220
 Which by the way, is a true principle of life.

1:52:14.220 --> 1:52:16.420
 I think you love yourself more when you serve more.

1:52:16.420 --> 1:52:19.140
 I think that's really evident in life.

1:52:19.140 --> 1:52:22.660
 But also spend time doing the things that make you happy.

1:52:22.660 --> 1:52:24.380
 Take time every day to go on that walk

1:52:24.380 --> 1:52:25.660
 that you need to go on.

1:52:25.660 --> 1:52:28.060
 Listen to that book tape that you need to listen to.

1:52:28.060 --> 1:52:29.940
 Like for me, that's something I need.

1:52:29.940 --> 1:52:31.700
 I know if I do that, I'm gonna be a better dad

1:52:31.700 --> 1:52:36.380
 because I gave myself some love back in life.

1:52:37.420 --> 1:52:39.740
 And just forgive yourself.

1:52:39.740 --> 1:52:42.020
 I think forgive yourself because everybody messes up.

1:52:42.020 --> 1:52:43.340
 Everybody hurts others.

1:52:43.340 --> 1:52:45.500
 Everybody says unkind words at times.

1:52:45.500 --> 1:52:49.740
 Everybody fails all the time.

1:52:49.740 --> 1:52:52.940
 And if you think that you're gonna not, you're wrong.

1:52:52.940 --> 1:52:54.020
 And you're eventually going to

1:52:54.020 --> 1:52:56.700
 and you're either gonna punish yourself for it every day

1:52:56.700 --> 1:52:59.380
 and be a lesser version of what you could be

1:52:59.380 --> 1:53:01.540
 or you're gonna forgive yourself for it.

1:53:01.540 --> 1:53:03.340
 And if you learned that that's not something you want

1:53:03.340 --> 1:53:04.460
 then try not to do it again.

1:53:04.460 --> 1:53:06.620
 If you do it again and you're probably gonna do it again,

1:53:06.620 --> 1:53:09.260
 whatever that is, you're gonna gossip about that person.

1:53:09.260 --> 1:53:10.100
 You're gonna feel bad

1:53:10.100 --> 1:53:12.340
 because then you gossiped about someone.

1:53:12.340 --> 1:53:14.980
 Is there something you could say in terms of self love?

1:53:14.980 --> 1:53:17.660
 Is there a role for being critical?

1:53:17.660 --> 1:53:20.540
 Like those demons of self criticism,

1:53:20.540 --> 1:53:21.780
 do you need a little bit of that?

1:53:21.780 --> 1:53:23.100
 Tom Waits talks about,

1:53:23.100 --> 1:53:25.420
 I like my Tom with a little drop of poison.

1:53:25.420 --> 1:53:27.420
 Need a little poison?

1:53:27.420 --> 1:53:29.460
 Or is that silly?

1:53:29.460 --> 1:53:31.020
 Or a mental situation of poison?

1:53:31.020 --> 1:53:35.140
 Look, my biggest thing in life that has been

1:53:35.140 --> 1:53:36.660
 the thing that I've worked on the hardest

1:53:36.660 --> 1:53:40.140
 for the last few years is to not be overly critical.

1:53:42.540 --> 1:53:45.860
 And to let go of control.

1:53:45.860 --> 1:53:50.860
 I think it's really easy to kill an artist.

1:53:53.340 --> 1:53:55.100
 It's really easy to kill an artist.

1:53:55.100 --> 1:53:58.020
 Like if my dad would have sat down with me that day

1:53:58.020 --> 1:54:01.420
 and even if he would have just sat down and been like,

1:54:01.420 --> 1:54:02.740
 good job son, okay.

1:54:02.740 --> 1:54:03.580
 It's not silly, right?

1:54:03.580 --> 1:54:05.620
 Like I didn't, not everybody has a dad

1:54:05.620 --> 1:54:07.540
 who's gonna ever do something

1:54:07.540 --> 1:54:09.220
 or put in the time or whatever.

1:54:09.220 --> 1:54:14.220
 But that might've altered everything for me.

1:54:14.620 --> 1:54:16.220
 Like my dad taking the extra time

1:54:16.220 --> 1:54:19.340
 to just give me a thoughtful response opposed to,

1:54:19.340 --> 1:54:21.580
 kids know, kids know when you're just like

1:54:21.580 --> 1:54:23.060
 trying to get out of the room or whatever.

1:54:23.060 --> 1:54:25.820
 I knew he wasn't and that did a lot.

1:54:25.820 --> 1:54:26.660
 So yeah.

1:54:26.660 --> 1:54:30.740
 But is that a huge, isn't that what makes the artist?

1:54:30.740 --> 1:54:34.700
 It's the fragility of it that like,

1:54:34.700 --> 1:54:36.300
 would you have it any other way?

1:54:37.700 --> 1:54:40.060
 No, no, I agree with you.

1:54:40.060 --> 1:54:45.060
 I think that that's what, that's the beauty of art.

1:54:45.940 --> 1:54:48.740
 But I think also on the same token, it's like,

1:54:51.620 --> 1:54:54.460
 I went to Music Cares recently,

1:54:54.460 --> 1:54:56.860
 which is a charity for musicians

1:54:56.860 --> 1:54:58.340
 that are down on their luck.

1:54:58.340 --> 1:54:59.780
 That maybe were successful at one point

1:54:59.780 --> 1:55:00.940
 or have never been successful

1:55:00.940 --> 1:55:02.380
 and they can't even pay the bills

1:55:02.380 --> 1:55:05.420
 and this charity contributes money to these artists,

1:55:05.420 --> 1:55:08.380
 aspiring artists or artists who've had drug issues.

1:55:08.380 --> 1:55:09.780
 And like, there's a lot that they do,

1:55:09.780 --> 1:55:11.500
 but, and there was a statistic

1:55:11.500 --> 1:55:12.740
 that they told it was staggering to me,

1:55:12.740 --> 1:55:17.740
 which is, I think it was 75% of artists, musicians,

1:55:17.820 --> 1:55:20.540
 say they struggle with severe depression.

1:55:20.540 --> 1:55:22.180
 That's really high.

1:55:22.180 --> 1:55:24.260
 I don't know what the national average is,

1:55:24.260 --> 1:55:27.460
 but I would guess that that's higher than national average

1:55:27.460 --> 1:55:29.180
 per occupation.

1:55:29.180 --> 1:55:33.020
 So I just think there's a tricky balance.

1:55:33.020 --> 1:55:36.300
 There's a tricky balance in art.

1:55:38.020 --> 1:55:42.020
 So yeah, of course, like it's a necessary thing,

1:55:42.020 --> 1:55:44.420
 the fragility of it all, but.

1:55:46.220 --> 1:55:49.700
 Yeah, I wonder, cause I'm extremely self critical

1:55:49.700 --> 1:55:52.020
 and I sometimes ask myself the question,

1:55:53.540 --> 1:55:58.460
 I've romanticized it or rather I've learned to be,

1:55:58.460 --> 1:56:01.820
 for it to be productive, to channel it into productivity.

1:56:01.820 --> 1:56:05.300
 But I wonder if there's better ways to do that.

1:56:05.300 --> 1:56:07.620
 And I also wonder if it's eventually the thing

1:56:07.620 --> 1:56:08.780
 that destroys me.

1:56:08.780 --> 1:56:11.620
 Like if longterm, if it's a healthy thing,

1:56:11.620 --> 1:56:14.780
 it might be useful when you're sort of

1:56:17.260 --> 1:56:20.980
 actively fighting the battles of the day,

1:56:20.980 --> 1:56:22.420
 for me it's engineering challenges

1:56:22.420 --> 1:56:23.780
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:56:23.780 --> 1:56:28.100
 But then when you're sitting back and enjoying life

1:56:28.100 --> 1:56:30.700
 with family and so on, is that going to be,

1:56:30.700 --> 1:56:32.860
 like, do you need to find that self love,

1:56:32.860 --> 1:56:37.860
 like ability to kind of silence the voice of criticism

1:56:38.700 --> 1:56:39.540
 in your head?

1:56:39.540 --> 1:56:41.380
 You know what, I really, there's a good,

1:56:41.380 --> 1:56:42.500
 you're making a good point.

1:56:42.500 --> 1:56:47.020
 And I think that the middle ground is you need,

1:56:51.580 --> 1:56:55.940
 you need self doubt to push you to be better.

1:56:55.940 --> 1:56:58.780
 I do believe that like, for instance,

1:56:58.780 --> 1:57:02.820
 if I believed I've hit my, like when you're like,

1:57:02.820 --> 1:57:04.980
 is there a song on there that you think is genius?

1:57:04.980 --> 1:57:07.380
 If I think I've written a genius song ever,

1:57:07.380 --> 1:57:09.420
 I think I'd probably stop.

1:57:09.420 --> 1:57:11.740
 I think I'd be like, you know what?

1:57:11.740 --> 1:57:16.340
 Did it, I wrote, what's that perfect song?

1:57:20.700 --> 1:57:21.540
 Imagine.

1:57:21.540 --> 1:57:22.380
 Imagine, yeah.

1:57:22.380 --> 1:57:26.980
 If I'd written imagine, I'd probably be like, that's it,

1:57:26.980 --> 1:57:28.940
 did it, all right, perfect song has been written.

1:57:28.940 --> 1:57:31.180
 That's the best thing I'll ever do.

1:57:31.180 --> 1:57:36.180
 So the fact that there is like self criticism

1:57:36.860 --> 1:57:39.780
 and criticism outside, I think is necessary.

1:57:39.780 --> 1:57:41.100
 A hundred percent for sure.

1:57:41.100 --> 1:57:44.180
 It pushes you, it pushes you, it pushes you.

1:57:44.180 --> 1:57:47.620
 It's just finding the right middle ground

1:57:47.620 --> 1:57:51.660
 for that young aspiring artist to also not feel squashed

1:57:51.660 --> 1:57:53.700
 and to be heard and to love,

1:57:53.700 --> 1:57:56.920
 just to not even to feel squashed, just to love themself.

1:57:56.920 --> 1:57:59.940
 So that when they're in the room playing the song,

1:57:59.940 --> 1:58:03.260
 they'll believe it because they believe themself.

1:58:03.260 --> 1:58:05.100
 They love themself enough that they believe it

1:58:05.100 --> 1:58:06.060
 and then they'll do a great,

1:58:06.060 --> 1:58:07.500
 and then the song will come out great

1:58:07.500 --> 1:58:10.020
 and they'll do a great performance.

1:58:10.020 --> 1:58:14.980
 I have to ask, it's one of the very interesting aspects

1:58:14.980 --> 1:58:18.500
 of your life of the way you put love out there in the world.

1:58:18.500 --> 1:58:22.480
 What is at the core of your support for the LGBT community?

1:58:23.820 --> 1:58:24.660
 A couple of things.

1:58:24.660 --> 1:58:29.340
 So one, growing up in, from a young age

1:58:29.340 --> 1:58:30.720
 in the artist community,

1:58:31.660 --> 1:58:34.940
 a lot of my closest friends were LGBTQ,

1:58:34.940 --> 1:58:36.240
 starting in middle school.

1:58:38.100 --> 1:58:41.340
 And I think a lot of the best artists in the world

1:58:41.340 --> 1:58:44.620
 are LGBTQ and that's just, it's not a secret.

1:58:44.620 --> 1:58:47.500
 Like it just is, like the artist community is filled

1:58:47.500 --> 1:58:50.860
 with lots of LGBTQ people.

1:58:50.860 --> 1:58:53.620
 So I think being raised in that community

1:58:54.580 --> 1:58:58.100
 in that my friends struggled with their faith

1:58:58.100 --> 1:59:03.100
 and their sexuality really opened up my eyes

1:59:03.340 --> 1:59:08.300
 to how incredibly hard that path is.

1:59:08.300 --> 1:59:10.980
 For instance, okay, when I was in high school,

1:59:10.980 --> 1:59:13.200
 there was someone who went in front of,

1:59:13.200 --> 1:59:17.920
 who was LGBTQ and was Mormon

1:59:17.920 --> 1:59:21.640
 and felt like there was not a place for them in the church.

1:59:21.640 --> 1:59:24.240
 They felt like the path, when you're being told

1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:26.600
 that it's evil and you believe it

1:59:26.600 --> 1:59:28.680
 because you believe in your faith

1:59:28.680 --> 1:59:31.300
 and you feel like it's unchangeable,

1:59:31.300 --> 1:59:32.980
 you're putting a kid in a situation

1:59:32.980 --> 1:59:36.060
 where there's really no good resolution.

1:59:36.060 --> 1:59:39.020
 It's either be alone for the rest of your life

1:59:39.020 --> 1:59:41.300
 or marry outside your sexual preference,

1:59:41.300 --> 1:59:43.000
 which I don't wanna marry a man.

1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:44.120
 Like if I was forced to marry a man,

1:59:44.120 --> 1:59:47.480
 I'm like, I don't want to marry a man

1:59:47.480 --> 1:59:49.500
 because I'm heterosexual.

1:59:49.500 --> 1:59:51.920
 So you're forcing a kid into a situation

1:59:51.920 --> 1:59:54.160
 where it's very dangerous.

1:59:54.160 --> 1:59:55.360
 Long story short, this kid went in front

1:59:55.360 --> 1:59:58.360
 of the Las Vegas Mormon temple and shot himself,

1:59:58.360 --> 1:59:59.200
 killed himself.

2:00:00.240 --> 2:00:01.920
 That impacted our community.

2:00:01.920 --> 2:00:06.840
 Like, and not just that, but it was like severe bullying

2:00:06.840 --> 2:00:10.480
 to LGBTQ kids in the 90s, it was especially different.

2:00:10.480 --> 2:00:12.580
 Like there's still bullying, don't get me wrong,

2:00:12.580 --> 2:00:14.160
 but man, like bullying in school,

2:00:14.160 --> 2:00:16.380
 I don't really know actually what it's like in schools now.

2:00:16.380 --> 2:00:18.720
 Maybe the bullying is just as bad as it was in the 90s,

2:00:18.720 --> 2:00:23.080
 but there was like, it was like,

2:00:23.080 --> 2:00:27.520
 I would hear all the time, like the F slur being slung out

2:00:27.520 --> 2:00:30.960
 at people who were LGBTQ all the time

2:00:31.920 --> 2:00:33.980
 and I wasn't even LGBTQ.

2:00:33.980 --> 2:00:38.980
 So I, you know, it's just seeing that,

2:00:38.980 --> 2:00:43.980
 I think that every, any social justice issue

2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:48.840
 takes all sides.

2:00:48.840 --> 2:00:50.480
 It takes all pieces of the puzzle.

2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:53.000
 If only the pieces of the puzzle contributed

2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:54.680
 are from the side that is affected,

2:00:54.680 --> 2:00:57.240
 I don't believe that we'll ever have resolution.

2:00:57.240 --> 2:01:01.000
 We're doing a shit job and we need to do better.

2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:05.560
 And that's just, that's the reality of it.

2:01:05.560 --> 2:01:07.240
 So that was part of the reason I also have family

2:01:07.240 --> 2:01:09.960
 who's LGBTQ and it's just something

2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:12.460
 that's been part of my path.

2:01:12.460 --> 2:01:14.480
 And I feel like I'm a big believer

2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:16.920
 and take the path that is presented to you.

2:01:16.920 --> 2:01:18.960
 And this was just something that came up in my life a lot.

2:01:18.960 --> 2:01:21.120
 When I met my wife, she was living with her two best friends

2:01:21.120 --> 2:01:24.400
 who were LGBTQ who really didn't want her to marry me

2:01:24.400 --> 2:01:25.320
 because I was Mormon.

2:01:25.320 --> 2:01:27.160
 And at the time it was prop eight,

2:01:27.160 --> 2:01:31.660
 which was Mormons were fighting against LGBT gay marriage.

2:01:31.660 --> 2:01:35.880
 And so that, then they didn't come to our wedding

2:01:35.880 --> 2:01:38.000
 and that really broke my wife's heart.

2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:41.880
 So it was just like, because Mormonism represented everything

2:01:41.880 --> 2:01:45.840
 that was against their community.

2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:46.680
 So.

2:01:46.680 --> 2:01:48.240
 So you felt you had to say something.

2:01:48.240 --> 2:01:50.680
 Yeah, I felt like by not saying anything,

2:01:50.680 --> 2:01:52.220
 I was saying everything.

2:01:52.220 --> 2:01:55.360
 I felt like by not speaking up and being like,

2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:58.240
 hey, Dan Reynolds is Mormon singer.

2:01:58.240 --> 2:02:01.120
 Here's this new band, Magic Dragons and they're Mormons.

2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:03.520
 It was like, okay, well, what do Mormons represent?

2:02:03.520 --> 2:02:04.880
 They represent prop eight.

2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:06.320
 What does prop eight represent?

2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:09.480
 Bigotry towards the LGBTQ community.

2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:10.320
 So what do I do?

2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:12.180
 Okay, I can speak in every interview and be like,

2:02:12.180 --> 2:02:13.080
 well, that's not me.

2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:15.160
 I don't believe that too.

2:02:15.160 --> 2:02:17.780
 Or I could just be more active about it.

2:02:17.780 --> 2:02:19.800
 And especially when it's affecting my family

2:02:19.800 --> 2:02:21.640
 and friends throughout my entire life, it was like,

2:02:21.640 --> 2:02:25.040
 all right, this seems like a path that you need to go down.

2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:29.240
 So long story short is a path that just presented itself

2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:30.720
 through things in my life.

2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:33.500
 So just on that topic that religion and God

2:02:33.500 --> 2:02:35.840
 give a lot of meaning to a lot of people.

2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:40.080
 It gives a tradition that brings people together

2:02:42.500 --> 2:02:46.180
 across the generations, but it also can hurt people.

2:02:47.460 --> 2:02:50.560
 What do you make about that tension?

2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:54.740
 So source of meaning, but also a source of pain for people.

2:02:56.200 --> 2:02:58.440
 The reality is, at least to me,

2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:00.640
 again, this is just my reality.

2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:01.880
 I feel like I'm doing my dad's thing

2:03:01.880 --> 2:03:03.080
 every time I'm talking to him.

2:03:03.080 --> 2:03:05.720
 Or I'm like, I don't really know, here's my two cents.

2:03:05.720 --> 2:03:06.880
 You have become your father.

2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:07.720
 Yeah.

2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:12.800
 The reality and it's my reality and it is the reality

2:03:12.800 --> 2:03:17.800
 for sure is there's, I think that religion

2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:24.460
 has brought a lot of hurt and pain to a lot of people.

2:03:24.460 --> 2:03:26.360
 Absolutely it has.

2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:29.060
 I don't think anybody can dispute that on either side,

2:03:29.060 --> 2:03:34.060
 whether it's war, whether it's slaughtering

2:03:36.860 --> 2:03:40.780
 of entire peoples, there's been a lot of pain

2:03:40.780 --> 2:03:42.940
 and suffering that has come from religion.

2:03:44.740 --> 2:03:46.640
 So my little thing that has been hard for me

2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:47.820
 is a faith crisis, right?

2:03:47.820 --> 2:03:50.860
 I had religion and then I lost it and then I had nothing.

2:03:50.860 --> 2:03:52.060
 So that's for me, I was like,

2:03:52.060 --> 2:03:53.960
 well, religion did that to me, right?

2:03:55.360 --> 2:03:58.060
 But then at one point it's kind of like,

2:03:58.060 --> 2:03:59.980
 how much of my life am I just gonna complain

2:03:59.980 --> 2:04:04.460
 about being raised Mormon or being depressed?

2:04:04.460 --> 2:04:07.940
 As I get older, I'm like, okay, so what?

2:04:07.940 --> 2:04:09.260
 Okay, it's really hurt me,

2:04:09.260 --> 2:04:12.780
 but were there any good things that came out of Mormonism?

2:04:12.780 --> 2:04:14.180
 Well, yeah, there's a lot of good things

2:04:14.180 --> 2:04:16.740
 that have come to my family through Mormonism.

2:04:16.740 --> 2:04:18.540
 Closeness, we're really, really close.

2:04:18.540 --> 2:04:21.580
 Mormon culture is that you live together forever, right?

2:04:21.580 --> 2:04:24.320
 The teaching is that your families are forever.

2:04:24.320 --> 2:04:25.820
 We die and then we go to heaven together

2:04:25.820 --> 2:04:27.000
 and we're together forever.

2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:30.080
 My family really believes that principle, all of them do.

2:04:31.460 --> 2:04:35.280
 And that instills a certain way of living

2:04:35.280 --> 2:04:38.160
 that's kind of beautiful, even if it's naivety.

2:04:39.020 --> 2:04:40.260
 There's something kind of beautiful

2:04:40.260 --> 2:04:42.980
 about believing that we're forming these bonds together

2:04:42.980 --> 2:04:44.220
 as a family and that like,

2:04:44.220 --> 2:04:46.220
 we're gonna be together forever.

2:04:46.220 --> 2:04:48.140
 It brings a lot of comfort to a kid too.

2:04:48.140 --> 2:04:50.580
 When I was little, I was like, wow,

2:04:50.580 --> 2:04:51.700
 it's gonna be okay if I die

2:04:51.700 --> 2:04:53.860
 because I get to see my mom again, you know what I mean?

2:04:53.860 --> 2:04:55.940
 I really believe that.

2:04:55.940 --> 2:04:58.240
 Is the right answer that you tell that kid,

2:04:59.140 --> 2:05:01.980
 actually when you die, you're not gonna see your mom again.

2:05:01.980 --> 2:05:04.420
 Maybe, it might be, I don't know.

2:05:04.420 --> 2:05:08.340
 And anybody who has a kid is gonna face that moment.

2:05:08.340 --> 2:05:10.060
 I've already faced it where you sit down

2:05:10.060 --> 2:05:12.060
 and my kid was like, hey dad,

2:05:12.060 --> 2:05:14.300
 when you die, am I gonna see you again?

2:05:14.300 --> 2:05:16.720
 That was actually a really hard moment for me

2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:18.980
 because I was suddenly faced with,

2:05:18.980 --> 2:05:22.900
 okay, do I give the answer that I thought was bullshit?

2:05:22.900 --> 2:05:25.140
 Or do I give the answer of what I think it is?

2:05:25.140 --> 2:05:29.200
 Or do I give the real answer, which is, I don't know.

2:05:29.200 --> 2:05:30.680
 And that's what I chose,

2:05:30.680 --> 2:05:33.220
 which as a father, that's not always the easiest answer

2:05:33.220 --> 2:05:35.260
 because your kid, it's a wonderful thing

2:05:35.260 --> 2:05:37.580
 that you feel like you can give your kid the comfort of like,

2:05:37.580 --> 2:05:40.060
 hey, your parents are gonna take care of everything.

2:05:40.060 --> 2:05:41.220
 We know everything.

2:05:41.220 --> 2:05:42.060
 We've been around.

2:05:42.060 --> 2:05:43.500
 My kid's always like, are you the strongest?

2:05:43.500 --> 2:05:45.100
 I'm like, yeah, I am the strongest.

2:05:45.100 --> 2:05:46.620
 I'm stronger than everybody.

2:05:46.620 --> 2:05:48.900
 Yeah, I'm stronger than everybody.

2:05:48.900 --> 2:05:51.140
 So when you're faced with that moment,

2:05:51.140 --> 2:05:54.020
 it's like, it kind of sucks to tell your kid like,

2:05:54.020 --> 2:05:55.460
 you know what?

2:05:55.460 --> 2:05:58.140
 I don't know if you're gonna see me after I die,

2:05:58.140 --> 2:05:59.780
 but I hope.

2:05:59.780 --> 2:06:01.940
 That's why I said, I was like, I don't know, but I hope.

2:06:01.940 --> 2:06:02.980
 I really hope,

2:06:02.980 --> 2:06:06.260
 because that would be awesome if we can hang out forever.

2:06:06.260 --> 2:06:07.860
 And if there's any way for it to happen,

2:06:07.860 --> 2:06:08.980
 I'll make it happen.

2:06:08.980 --> 2:06:09.820
 You know what I mean?

2:06:09.820 --> 2:06:11.660
 That's kind of what my answer was.

2:06:11.660 --> 2:06:13.260
 So long story short,

2:06:13.260 --> 2:06:15.740
 sorry, I know that I'm being lengthy on this.

2:06:15.740 --> 2:06:18.260
 Is there like, what is my thought on religion?

2:06:18.260 --> 2:06:19.260
 It just is.

2:06:19.260 --> 2:06:20.700
 It's been here forever.

2:06:20.700 --> 2:06:22.100
 It's coping.

2:06:22.100 --> 2:06:24.980
 Maybe it's, I can't say whether it's true or false.

2:06:24.980 --> 2:06:27.420
 How the hell am I supposed to know?

2:06:27.420 --> 2:06:28.260
 You know what I mean?

2:06:28.260 --> 2:06:31.980
 Like I've lived 34 years on this planet.

2:06:31.980 --> 2:06:34.140
 A lot of people have been around a lot longer than me

2:06:34.140 --> 2:06:35.900
 and they really believe very deeply.

2:06:35.900 --> 2:06:37.900
 And a lot of them are smarter than me.

2:06:37.900 --> 2:06:38.740
 You know what I mean?

2:06:38.740 --> 2:06:40.180
 Like I look at my older brothers, for instance,

2:06:40.180 --> 2:06:43.020
 who are very practicing Mormons.

2:06:43.020 --> 2:06:45.420
 These guys are hyper intelligent.

2:06:45.420 --> 2:06:47.660
 My younger sister, hyper intelligent.

2:06:47.660 --> 2:06:49.300
 All of them start smarter than me.

2:06:49.300 --> 2:06:50.340
 They all believe it still.

2:06:50.340 --> 2:06:52.460
 So what am I supposed to say?

2:06:52.460 --> 2:06:53.820
 Well, you're all stupid.

2:06:53.820 --> 2:06:54.660
 You know what I mean?

2:06:54.660 --> 2:06:55.740
 Like you're all wrong.

2:06:55.740 --> 2:06:56.580
 I don't know.

2:06:56.580 --> 2:06:58.380
 Like maybe it's the South Park episode

2:06:58.380 --> 2:07:00.500
 where everybody dies and then they're like,

2:07:00.500 --> 2:07:02.540
 well, the right answer was Mormonism.

2:07:02.540 --> 2:07:03.860
 And everybody's like, aww.

2:07:03.860 --> 2:07:04.700
 You know what I mean?

2:07:04.700 --> 2:07:08.220
 Like Mormons love that moment in South Park.

2:07:08.220 --> 2:07:09.900
 They're like, hey, that day may come.

2:07:09.900 --> 2:07:12.140
 That day may come.

2:07:13.060 --> 2:07:16.700
 Yeah, so maybe I don't know is the honest answer

2:07:16.700 --> 2:07:18.980
 for everybody around the table.

2:07:18.980 --> 2:07:20.780
 But the biggest question

2:07:20.780 --> 2:07:23.300
 for which I don't know is the right answer

2:07:23.300 --> 2:07:26.340
 is what's the meaning of this whole thing?

2:07:26.340 --> 2:07:27.700
 What's the meaning of life?

2:07:29.820 --> 2:07:32.180
 No, you're not allowed to say I don't know.

2:07:32.180 --> 2:07:33.380
 Okay.

2:07:33.380 --> 2:07:36.500
 You can be just like your dad and say,

2:07:36.500 --> 2:07:38.700
 let me just give my two cents.

2:07:38.700 --> 2:07:40.100
 Take it or leave it.

2:07:40.100 --> 2:07:41.660
 Whatever it's worth, take it or leave it.

2:07:41.660 --> 2:07:42.500
 It's probably worth nothing.

2:07:42.500 --> 2:07:44.660
 It's piddled on the ground.

2:07:44.660 --> 2:07:49.660
 I mean, why are we here?

2:07:50.620 --> 2:07:55.500
 It's just busily creating all these kinds of things,

2:07:55.500 --> 2:07:57.820
 worrying about things, having kids.

2:07:59.300 --> 2:08:01.580
 My purpose, at least right now,

2:08:03.140 --> 2:08:08.140
 is to wake up and try to

2:08:08.140 --> 2:08:13.140
 to bring light love to the world,

2:08:14.700 --> 2:08:18.820
 light love to myself and have integrity.

2:08:18.820 --> 2:08:21.160
 That's my purpose.

2:08:24.460 --> 2:08:27.100
 The ultimate purpose of life,

2:08:27.100 --> 2:08:29.340
 that I guess that's my ultimate purpose of life.

2:08:29.340 --> 2:08:32.660
 I don't know what happens when I die.

2:08:33.660 --> 2:08:37.180
 Ayahuasca gave me some sense that there's more to be known.

2:08:37.180 --> 2:08:38.700
 I'm sure there are other things in life

2:08:38.700 --> 2:08:41.180
 that would give me that, and I'm looking for it.

2:08:41.180 --> 2:08:42.020
 I'm a seeker.

2:08:42.020 --> 2:08:46.060
 I'm always looking for the next something

2:08:46.060 --> 2:08:48.660
 to give me hope in something more,

2:08:48.660 --> 2:08:51.500
 even if so, I could just not bullshit my kids

2:08:51.500 --> 2:08:52.780
 when they ask me that question and be like,

2:08:52.780 --> 2:08:56.220
 you know what, I really don't know.

2:08:56.220 --> 2:08:59.900
 I wanna not know more, if that makes sense.

2:08:59.900 --> 2:09:04.900
 I don't wanna, I want to see things that make me confused,

2:09:04.900 --> 2:09:08.300
 that make me question what I already knew.

2:09:08.300 --> 2:09:13.300
 Like I am like, when I meet an atheist who comes up to me

2:09:13.540 --> 2:09:16.500
 and they're like, atheism, atheism, atheism.

2:09:16.500 --> 2:09:19.700
 It's just as laughable to me as when I meet the Mormon

2:09:19.700 --> 2:09:20.700
 who comes up and they're like,

2:09:20.700 --> 2:09:22.220
 Mormonism, Mormonism, Mormonism.

2:09:22.220 --> 2:09:26.980
 I'm like, how do you, how do anyone, how do you guys know?

2:09:26.980 --> 2:09:31.700
 They'd like, like, you know.

2:09:31.700 --> 2:09:35.700
 So you feel like you're doing some, through all your travels,

2:09:35.700 --> 2:09:36.980
 through all the people you meet,

2:09:36.980 --> 2:09:38.940
 you feel like you're still keeping your eyes open

2:09:38.940 --> 2:09:43.940
 and your heart open to sort of discover something new,

2:09:44.780 --> 2:09:47.020
 like the ayahuasca experience,

2:09:47.020 --> 2:09:50.580
 that there might be deeper truths out there.

2:09:50.580 --> 2:09:52.460
 Yeah, and I wanna find them,

2:09:52.460 --> 2:09:54.060
 and I wanna surround myself with people

2:09:54.060 --> 2:09:55.220
 who are just looking for it.

2:09:55.220 --> 2:09:57.940
 I'm not interested in people who are just looking

2:09:57.940 --> 2:10:00.500
 to point fingers at each, like life is so short.

2:10:00.500 --> 2:10:02.980
 I'm looking for, it's one of the reasons

2:10:02.980 --> 2:10:05.740
 that I wanna meet with you is I was like, wow,

2:10:05.740 --> 2:10:08.060
 Lex really seems like he's on a journey to find truth.

2:10:08.060 --> 2:10:10.340
 And that humility for me is same thing with Rick.

2:10:10.340 --> 2:10:11.180
 It drew me to Rick.

2:10:11.180 --> 2:10:15.140
 It was like, I really, I see that and identify with it.

2:10:15.140 --> 2:10:16.260
 And that's what I'm looking for.

2:10:16.260 --> 2:10:18.140
 There's the final song on our record,

2:10:18.140 --> 2:10:19.860
 our new record that's coming out.

2:10:20.900 --> 2:10:24.460
 The chorus goes, and this is like,

2:10:24.460 --> 2:10:27.260
 this is my best answer to what you're asking.

2:10:27.260 --> 2:10:30.900
 So the chorus goes,

2:10:30.900 --> 2:10:33.300
 take it easy on me.

2:10:33.300 --> 2:10:35.780
 I need some lullaby.

2:10:35.780 --> 2:10:38.540
 They tell me heaven's just a lie.

2:10:38.540 --> 2:10:40.460
 Well, I'm not surprised.

2:10:40.460 --> 2:10:42.300
 Tell me that you know.

2:10:42.300 --> 2:10:43.620
 No, you don't.

2:10:43.620 --> 2:10:45.540
 Yeah, you're just like me.

2:10:45.540 --> 2:10:48.700
 Can we just all hope for the best?

2:10:48.700 --> 2:10:51.420
 Take it easy.

2:10:51.420 --> 2:10:52.260
 So that's it for me.

2:10:52.260 --> 2:10:56.580
 It's like, I'm in a place where I'm like, I don't know.

2:10:56.580 --> 2:10:58.940
 Tell me, I'm not gonna believe you.

2:10:58.940 --> 2:10:59.780
 Maybe you do.

2:10:59.780 --> 2:11:00.940
 I'm not gonna believe it,

2:11:00.940 --> 2:11:04.300
 but let's just be easier on each other

2:11:04.300 --> 2:11:07.420
 and try to find truth wherever it may lie.

2:11:07.420 --> 2:11:11.220
 But above all, know that we don't know jack shit.

2:11:11.220 --> 2:11:13.020
 I think that's a mic drop moment.

2:11:13.020 --> 2:11:14.100
 Dan, thank you so much.

2:11:14.100 --> 2:11:15.260
 You're an incredible human.

2:11:15.260 --> 2:11:17.500
 I love that you share with the world

2:11:17.500 --> 2:11:20.980
 the darkness of your mind, of your life experience

2:11:20.980 --> 2:11:23.340
 and the beautiful light that you've shown to the world.

2:11:23.340 --> 2:11:25.260
 So it's a huge honor

2:11:25.260 --> 2:11:27.060
 and thank you for spending your valuable time.

2:11:27.060 --> 2:11:28.140
 Good luck on the tour.

2:11:28.140 --> 2:11:28.980
 Thanks, man.

2:11:28.980 --> 2:11:30.460
 Thanks for having me.

2:11:30.460 --> 2:11:31.940
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:11:31.940 --> 2:11:33.020
 with Dan Reynolds.

 And now let me leave you with some words

2:11:38.980 --> 2:11:40.340
 from Aldous Huxley.

2:11:41.220 --> 2:11:44.260
 After silence, that which comes nearest

2:11:44.260 --> 2:11:48.500
 to expressing the inexpressible is music.

2:11:48.500 --> 2:12:00.060
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
