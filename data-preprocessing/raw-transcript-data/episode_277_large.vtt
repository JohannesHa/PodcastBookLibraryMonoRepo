00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
 If you get into the sauna the way I just described,

00:02.640 --> 00:05.240
 not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes,

00:05.240 --> 00:07.460
 twice a week or three times per week,

00:07.460 --> 00:09.460
 you reduce the likelihood of dying

00:09.460 --> 00:12.440
 of a cardiovascular event by 27%.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.720
 If you do it four or more times per week,

00:14.720 --> 00:17.960
 you reduce the probability of dying by 50%.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.840
 Is there any scientific evidence

00:19.840 --> 00:22.460
 that being naked is beneficial in the sauna?

00:22.460 --> 00:25.640
 Well, in certain contexts, it leads to childbirth.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.560
 Okay, well, I'll have to read up on that.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.200
 I think Dorothy Parker said,

00:30.200 --> 00:32.520
 the cure for boredom is curiosity.

00:32.520 --> 00:34.400
 There is no cure for curiosity.

00:36.660 --> 00:39.360
 The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman,

00:39.360 --> 00:41.800
 his third time on this podcast.

00:41.800 --> 00:45.240
 He's a brilliant neuroscientist at Stanford University

00:45.240 --> 00:48.180
 and the host of one of the best,

00:49.480 --> 00:51.280
 the best, if you ask me,

00:51.280 --> 00:53.240
 health and science podcasts in the world

00:53.240 --> 00:55.600
 called Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.840
 Check him out on Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.920
 Most importantly, Andrew is a great human being

01:01.920 --> 01:05.320
 and has quickly become a great friend.

01:05.320 --> 01:07.380
 This is the Lex Riebman Podcast.

01:07.380 --> 01:09.520
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:09.520 --> 01:10.800
 in the description.

01:10.800 --> 01:14.780
 And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Huberman.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.600
 We meet again, my friend.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.760
 We should talk on each other's podcast once a year.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.520
 I think we should make a deal.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.040
 I was just talking to the guys,

01:23.040 --> 01:25.560
 this is a show called Louie, I don't know if you know it.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.680
 And yeah, with Louie CK.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.320
 And there's this thing called Bang Bang,

01:30.320 --> 01:31.640
 which people that are probably watching

01:31.640 --> 01:33.520
 know exactly what I'm talking about.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.520
 It's this worst possible thing you can do

01:35.520 --> 01:39.000
 in terms of meals, which is you go to a restaurant,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.480
 do a full meal, and then you go to another restaurant

01:42.480 --> 01:44.240
 and do a full meal and you pet me.

01:44.240 --> 01:46.480
 You, exactly.

01:46.480 --> 01:51.040
 So they go Mexican, Italian, sushi, pizza, barbecue,

01:51.040 --> 01:52.960
 IHOP, that one is disgusting.

01:52.960 --> 01:57.880
 This kind of thing reminds me of the joy of food.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.740
 Last time we were hanging out,

01:59.740 --> 02:01.920
 we went to see Joe Do Comedy

02:01.920 --> 02:04.680
 and then we went to eat Russian food.

02:04.680 --> 02:08.480
 And it was a particularly fun experience

02:08.480 --> 02:10.880
 to go to a Russian restaurant.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.380
 I was the only person there that didn't speak Russian

02:14.380 --> 02:16.260
 and eat Russian food with you.

02:16.260 --> 02:20.460
 And because I felt walking in, they trusted you.

02:20.460 --> 02:21.840
 They didn't trust me.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.800
 Yeah, the funny thing about the people there,

02:24.800 --> 02:26.640
 they were talking to you in Russian

02:26.640 --> 02:29.160
 and then they refused to sort of switch to English,

02:29.160 --> 02:31.280
 even though they understood you speak no Russian.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.080
 This is Russian House in Austin, by the way.

02:34.080 --> 02:38.120
 Anyway, by way of question, what's the worst or the best,

02:38.120 --> 02:40.160
 depending on your perspective, cheap meal?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.560
 Let's call it a pigging out meal,

02:41.560 --> 02:45.220
 but it could be a cheap meal that you've ever had

02:45.220 --> 02:48.640
 or you want to have that's like on the bucket list

02:48.640 --> 02:50.120
 or something that's in the past,

02:50.120 --> 02:52.360
 where you did something like a Bang Bang,

02:52.360 --> 02:54.160
 which is like, you're talking about

02:54.160 --> 02:56.840
 multiple thousands of calories

02:56.840 --> 02:59.120
 that you just feel horrible about yourself

02:59.120 --> 03:01.600
 but you still keep eating because it's delicious,

03:01.600 --> 03:04.000
 but also great company.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.360
 Something about the atmosphere is just right.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.600
 Screw the diet, screw all the things,

03:11.360 --> 03:12.480
 like you should be doing,

03:12.480 --> 03:14.540
 but just throw it all out the window.

03:14.540 --> 03:16.980
 I've done that several times.

03:16.980 --> 03:18.160
 Yeah, I don't do this anymore,

03:18.160 --> 03:21.280
 but the entire time I was a postdoc, so five years,

03:21.280 --> 03:23.660
 and the entire time I was a pretenured professor,

03:23.660 --> 03:27.460
 so five years, so I basically followed

03:27.460 --> 03:29.680
 the Tim Ferriss slow carb diet,

03:29.680 --> 03:32.960
 which is, people can look it up, but it worked really well.

03:32.960 --> 03:37.480
 It was basically some good animal proteins,

03:37.480 --> 03:38.680
 fish and meat and things like that.

03:38.680 --> 03:39.520
 Why slow carb?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.620
 Because slow carb is like low glycemic stuff,

03:41.620 --> 03:44.480
 it's mostly lentils and beans and things and vegetables,

03:44.480 --> 03:48.440
 no dairy, no, anyway, but then one day.

03:48.440 --> 03:49.280
 Is pasta in there?

03:49.280 --> 03:50.120
 Sorry to interrupt.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.200
 No, no pasta.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.600
 So it wasn't low carb, but it was low glycemic carb.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.280
 And I did that and it worked terrifically well

03:55.280 --> 03:56.320
 just for energy levels,

03:56.320 --> 03:57.400
 cause I want to be able to train and work.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.880
 And then one day a week,

03:58.880 --> 04:02.760
 you're supposed to go full cheat day.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.400
 And so I would do what used to be 12 hours,

04:05.400 --> 04:07.200
 but then it became 24,

04:07.200 --> 04:09.800
 you can start to redefine what the day is.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.800
 And I would, and that was when Costello was pretty young

04:13.800 --> 04:14.920
 and we would do it together.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.100
 So I would get pizzas and croissants and donuts,

04:18.100 --> 04:20.060
 and I would just do the full thing.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.640
 And by the end of the day,

04:21.640 --> 04:24.000
 you don't want to look at an item of food.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.520
 You're just repulsed by food.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.880
 The only modification I made was the next day,

04:27.880 --> 04:29.360
 I would fast completely,

04:29.360 --> 04:32.360
 just to avoid the gastric distress of eating anything.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.200
 And so I would do them on Sundays

04:34.200 --> 04:35.520
 and then Mondays I'd fast all day.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.580
 And then by Tuesday, I felt pretty good again,

04:37.580 --> 04:38.720
 but Sunday and Monday,

04:38.720 --> 04:42.680
 or you just feel like you're sliding down the slope

04:42.680 --> 04:44.880
 of just blood sugar disaster.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.000
 Terrible idea or a good idea?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.160
 You know, at the time I enjoyed it.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.300
 I love donuts, croissants, all that kind of stuff.

04:50.300 --> 04:53.400
 What's interesting is after stopping that whole protocol,

04:53.400 --> 04:54.840
 now I just try and eat well each day.

04:54.840 --> 04:55.680
 Protocol.

04:55.680 --> 04:56.520
 It's really a protocol.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.240
 Now I basically, I do a pseudo intermittent fasting.

04:59.240 --> 05:02.200
 I'm not really strict, but I'll start at eating around 11,

05:02.200 --> 05:03.280
 eat my first meal around 11,

05:03.280 --> 05:04.360
 I usually train in the morning,

05:04.360 --> 05:06.520
 eat my last bite of food somewhere around eight or nine,

05:06.520 --> 05:07.620
 and I'm not super strict.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.440
 I might have some berries or something late at night.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.160
 Three meals, two meals?

05:11.160 --> 05:12.960
 Two meals.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.280
 And then maybe a little bit of snacking on some nuts

05:15.280 --> 05:16.160
 or something in the middle.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.720
 Ever fast, 24 hour?

05:17.720 --> 05:18.900
 Never done a long fast,

05:18.900 --> 05:20.800
 except when I was doing the cheat days.

05:20.800 --> 05:24.520
 And then, and actually there are a couple different ways

05:24.520 --> 05:25.840
 to do cheat days that were fun.

05:25.840 --> 05:26.920
 Like if you were in a new city,

05:26.920 --> 05:30.520
 you could try all the restaurants that you wanted.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.040
 Yeah, and I think Tim and our mutual friend,

05:33.040 --> 05:34.440
 John Romanello did a,

05:34.440 --> 05:36.760
 I think it was like a cheat day marathon where they did,

05:36.760 --> 05:38.360
 you know, marathon's 26.3 miles.

05:38.360 --> 05:41.680
 They went to 26.3 different locations in New York.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.800
 They put it on a map and I never took it to that extreme,

05:44.800 --> 05:45.640
 but.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.480
 Wait, wait, wait.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.500
 Over how many days?

05:47.500 --> 05:48.340
 One day.

05:48.340 --> 05:49.160
 That was their cheat day.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.000
 Why?

05:50.000 --> 05:50.840
 Just cause they were, you know.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.040
 Just a little bit of something at each place.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.320
 Yeah, exactly.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.440
 I mean, there are things that guys do in their thirties

05:56.440 --> 05:58.040
 that you just shouldn't do in your forties.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.520
 I can say that cause I'm in my forties.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.980
 And now I just try and eat well most days.

06:01.980 --> 06:05.220
 And what's interesting is about 12 to 14 months ago,

06:05.220 --> 06:08.140
 I completely lost all appetite for sweets.

06:08.140 --> 06:08.980
 I don't know what happened.

06:08.980 --> 06:10.000
 I still love savory food.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.320
 So meat and butter and cheese,

06:12.320 --> 06:14.200
 and I love vegetables too.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.880
 I love fruit also, but lost all appetite.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.780
 So if you put a donut in front of me or ice cream

06:18.780 --> 06:20.280
 or something like that, I just,

06:20.280 --> 06:23.320
 it's almost aversive to me and I don't know what happened.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.240
 I don't know what changed.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.760
 It's probably a scientific explanation.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.580
 Sure.

06:26.580 --> 06:27.420
 It has to do maybe with habit.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.560
 Neuron loss, dementia.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.400
 Yeah.

06:29.400 --> 06:34.400
 The sugar, the desire for that rush maybe is gone

06:35.820 --> 06:37.440
 from your soul.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.600
 So what was the most delicious things, croissant donuts?

06:40.600 --> 06:42.240
 Is there a thing that?

06:42.240 --> 06:44.760
 There's a place in Portland.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.800
 I don't know if it's still open called Little T's Bakery.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.780
 And they have croissants that easily rival

06:50.780 --> 06:52.200
 the croissants in Paris.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.680
 People make a lot of the pastry in Paris,

06:54.680 --> 06:57.040
 but it's really the bread in Paris that's amazing.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.400
 We lived there when I was a kid and we did a sabbatical

06:59.400 --> 07:01.120
 there and you know, there they do the baguette,

07:01.120 --> 07:02.880
 morning bake and afternoon bake.

07:02.880 --> 07:07.000
 And there's nothing like the bread in Paris or the people,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.700
 you know, and, but if you're in the Pacific Northwest,

07:10.700 --> 07:13.000
 you know, you can find amazing croissants there.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.040
 What do you do with the croissant?

07:14.040 --> 07:15.280
 What do you do with the bread?

07:15.280 --> 07:16.520
 Butter or is it just?

07:16.520 --> 07:18.380
 I actually used to, I don't eat them anymore.

07:18.380 --> 07:19.760
 I don't have much of an appetite for them,

07:19.760 --> 07:20.840
 even though they're not a sweet food,

07:20.840 --> 07:24.000
 but I'm always putting butter on the croissant.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.360
 Butter on the butter croissant.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.200
 No jam.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.480
 I would never adulterate my croissant.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.360
 I have to actually be honest about this

07:30.360 --> 07:33.380
 because people talk about steak and they talk about bread

07:33.380 --> 07:34.440
 with the butter.

07:34.440 --> 07:35.800
 I feel like butter is cheating.

07:35.800 --> 07:40.060
 I feel like you're disrespecting the fundamental food

07:40.060 --> 07:41.320
 by adding butter.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.580
 Cause butter, it's like, it's like,

07:43.580 --> 07:47.680
 it's like a elite version of ketchup.

07:47.680 --> 07:48.520
 You're.

07:48.520 --> 07:49.520
 Well there we diverge because for me,

07:49.520 --> 07:52.840
 bread is just a vehicle for butter.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.760
 A cracker is just a vehicle for cheese.

07:56.760 --> 07:57.880
 Oh, so that's just the,

07:57.880 --> 07:59.920
 the cracker and the bread is just texture.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.160
 It's just that people look at you funny

08:01.160 --> 08:03.240
 if you, if you just eat the butter straight,

08:03.240 --> 08:04.360
 which occasionally I do.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.200
 I got it.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.880
 So I put a little piece of bread underneath it,

08:07.880 --> 08:10.240
 not because I'm low carb, strictly low carb,

08:10.240 --> 08:13.000
 but just because otherwise you get some funny looks.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.140
 That's like pasta is a vehicle for pasta sauce.

08:17.140 --> 08:20.640
 It's interesting, but like Indian non bread,

08:20.640 --> 08:23.400
 you have, you have the bread.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.440
 I've had a lot of soul searching

08:25.440 --> 08:28.780
 on which part of Indian is, brings me so much joy.

08:28.780 --> 08:30.800
 Is it the bread or is it all the sauces

08:30.800 --> 08:31.680
 that come with the bread?

08:31.680 --> 08:32.820
 Well, there we diverge again,

08:32.820 --> 08:36.920
 because for whatever reason, no disrespect to anyone,

08:36.920 --> 08:39.120
 but Indian food doesn't appeal to me.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.320
 Well, you're a lucky man

08:40.320 --> 08:43.160
 because the number of calories in that food,

08:43.160 --> 08:44.800
 it sneaks like non bread.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.120
 I don't know how non bread is made,

08:46.120 --> 08:49.320
 but I think it's just soaked in oil

08:49.320 --> 08:51.800
 and it just very intensely,

08:51.800 --> 08:55.360
 like the density of calories is very, very high.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.680
 For me, barbecue, I would say is probably the,

08:58.680 --> 08:59.560
 that's good.

08:59.560 --> 09:02.940
 Anytime I'm in Austin, I start thinking about barbecue.

09:02.940 --> 09:04.360
 I do love, you know, I do love meat.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.240
 My dad's Argentine.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.200
 I mean, I love steak.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.040
 I love meat.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.440
 I mean, Argentina chorizo sausage

09:09.440 --> 09:12.600
 is an appetizer before you have steak.

09:12.600 --> 09:13.680
 It's meat on top of meat.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.000
 And it's not just, you know, it's not just the men, right?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.380
 You see women, sometimes very petite women

09:18.380 --> 09:22.360
 eating steaks that are bigger than their skull size.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.340
 You know, slowly, they eat very slowly there.

09:24.340 --> 09:26.240
 And they all eat dessert too, which is interesting.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.880
 And they generally do the sort of one meal per day

09:28.880 --> 09:30.520
 and do that kind of real flexibly.

09:30.520 --> 09:31.700
 That's how I think about it.

09:31.700 --> 09:32.920
 Cause I often eat one meal a day,

09:32.920 --> 09:34.200
 especially when I'm traveling.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.640
 It feels like a cheap meal because it allows,

09:36.640 --> 09:38.800
 it gives you a bit of more freedom

09:38.800 --> 09:42.480
 to just lose yourself in the quantity of the food.

09:42.480 --> 09:46.160
 I did the three day fast and I ate chicken breast,

09:46.160 --> 09:47.960
 like literally chicken breast with nothing else,

09:47.960 --> 09:48.840
 just grilled.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.400
 And it was the most delicious piece of meat I've ever eaten.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.560
 And that, and that gives you,

09:53.560 --> 09:55.440
 the problem is when you fast the three days,

09:55.440 --> 09:56.440
 you really can't pig out.

09:56.440 --> 09:57.280
 You really shouldn't.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.520
 Your stomach will shrink in size already.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.280
 Your gut microbiome is almost completely

10:01.280 --> 10:02.840
 depleted by fasting.

10:02.840 --> 10:03.680
 A lot of people think, oh,

10:03.680 --> 10:05.800
 cleanses and fasts are great for the microbiome.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.640
 They quash your microbiome.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.680
 However, when you start eating again,

10:09.680 --> 10:11.640
 the microbiome comes back better

10:11.640 --> 10:13.120
 than it was before your fast.

10:13.120 --> 10:15.400
 For people who don't know, Sergey and Todd are on the call.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.960
 They're kind of pulling stuff up.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.360
 They just pulled up Phelps with the,

10:19.360 --> 10:21.700
 I forget how many calories he was eating, 10,000.

10:21.700 --> 10:22.540
 You know what's interesting?

10:22.540 --> 10:24.800
 There's some, some cool physiology around this.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.760
 The reason he needed to eat so much

10:26.760 --> 10:30.040
 is not that he was burning that many calories

10:30.040 --> 10:31.320
 in pure movement.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.340
 It's that when you do exercise in water,

10:33.340 --> 10:34.680
 even if it's warm water,

10:34.680 --> 10:36.520
 the heat transfer in water is greater.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.220
 So you burn far more calories.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.520
 And again, here, I'm admittedly lifting that

10:40.520 --> 10:43.240
 from knowledge that was passed on to me by Tim Ferriss.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.160
 I didn't, so, but I checked it out

10:45.160 --> 10:46.120
 and it's absolutely true.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.960
 So if you exercise in water,

10:47.960 --> 10:49.560
 even if it's not really cold water,

10:49.560 --> 10:50.680
 your caloric needs go way up,

10:50.680 --> 10:52.280
 which is why you get out of the pool

10:52.280 --> 10:53.640
 and you're often really hungry.

10:53.640 --> 10:56.040
 And for fans of the Human Lab podcast,

10:56.040 --> 10:57.400
 and if you're not a fan,

10:57.400 --> 10:59.160
 what are you doing with your life?

11:00.440 --> 11:02.120
 You would probably chuckle at the fact

11:02.120 --> 11:04.740
 that Andrew just cited his sources,

11:04.740 --> 11:05.940
 even on that statement,

11:05.940 --> 11:08.120
 because you're so good at,

11:08.120 --> 11:09.360
 I don't know how your memory works,

11:09.360 --> 11:12.400
 but the only person whose memory

11:12.400 --> 11:14.520
 is better than Joe Rogan is yours.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.420
 But my colleagues joke,

11:16.420 --> 11:20.840
 you know, PubMed sort of scrolls through my mind.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.580
 Also in science, as you know,

11:22.580 --> 11:25.560
 attribution is so baked into what we do.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.520
 And I think that it's interesting

11:27.520 --> 11:29.840
 because now spending a lot of time on social media,

11:29.840 --> 11:31.760
 attribution is not as common.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.960
 And, but in academia, you learn really early on

11:34.960 --> 11:37.280
 that if you give a talk about your data

11:37.280 --> 11:39.320
 and you cite all these amazing sources,

11:39.320 --> 11:42.380
 all it does is make you look better, right?

11:42.380 --> 11:44.520
 Whereas in social media and elsewhere

11:44.520 --> 11:45.620
 in the business sector,

11:45.620 --> 11:47.000
 it's almost like citing other people,

11:47.000 --> 11:48.480
 people feel as if it's going to take away

11:48.480 --> 11:49.340
 some of the credit.

11:49.340 --> 11:50.880
 All it does is place you in the company

11:50.880 --> 11:52.500
 of people that do really nice work.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.340
 So I have tremendous,

11:53.340 --> 11:55.680
 and I have genuine and tremendous respect for Tim.

11:55.680 --> 11:56.960
 He's been about 10 years ahead

11:56.960 --> 11:59.000
 on a huge number of health related things

11:59.000 --> 12:01.320
 and other things and extremely kind person,

12:01.320 --> 12:02.320
 very thoughtful person.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.080
 So it's also just a pleasure to shine light

12:05.080 --> 12:05.920
 on other people.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.480
 Yeah, well, I actually, to push back,

12:07.480 --> 12:11.960
 I know there's a culture of if you write a paper,

12:11.960 --> 12:15.080
 standing on the shoulders of giants is a powerful thing,

12:15.080 --> 12:18.320
 but there's also a culture of not giving credit

12:19.320 --> 12:21.320
 to the strongest idea in your paper.

12:21.320 --> 12:24.860
 And instead say it's kind of, or imply that it's original.

12:24.860 --> 12:28.480
 There is a culture of kind of not celebrating others.

12:28.480 --> 12:33.160
 I think people get most competitive in all walks of life,

12:33.160 --> 12:35.400
 but especially in science when they're,

12:35.400 --> 12:39.000
 the closer they get in the exact thing they work on.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.040
 And so there's this dance,

12:41.040 --> 12:43.040
 you know, there's a few researchers

12:43.040 --> 12:46.160
 in each of the individual little things that you work on.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.000
 If you're studying a particular kind of ant,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.120
 you know that other asshole

12:50.120 --> 12:52.560
 that also is studying that particular ant,

12:52.560 --> 12:56.080
 and then you're not going to often give credit

12:56.080 --> 12:59.700
 for the brilliant ideas that that other researcher is doing.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.880
 And I think one of the things you've discovered

13:01.880 --> 13:04.280
 and just as part of your nature,

13:04.280 --> 13:08.520
 which is why it's really great that you have an audience

13:08.520 --> 13:09.800
 and you inspire others to do the same,

13:09.800 --> 13:12.660
 is you celebrate that other ant studier.

13:12.660 --> 13:16.780
 It's great and everybody wins, it raises all boats.

13:16.780 --> 13:19.820
 But that initial instinct to be like,

13:19.820 --> 13:21.120
 what is it in Borat?

13:21.120 --> 13:26.120
 Like my neighbor gets a toaster, I get a bigger toaster.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.240
 Yeah, that mindset to, you know,

13:28.240 --> 13:31.280
 it's not that I'm not competitive in certain domains,

13:31.280 --> 13:33.760
 but yeah, I get great pleasure

13:33.760 --> 13:37.160
 from sharing things that I find.

13:37.160 --> 13:40.940
 And I think that, you know, at the end of the day,

13:40.940 --> 13:43.640
 you're as strong as your community

13:43.640 --> 13:45.920
 and you can build a wonderful community

13:45.920 --> 13:48.760
 just by pointing out things that you love.

13:48.760 --> 13:49.880
 Like these are all just loves.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.600
 I see a paper and I love it.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.080
 Only rarely do I think, oh, I wish we had done that.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.320
 I usually think, fantastic,

13:55.320 --> 13:56.680
 now I can just focus on something else

13:56.680 --> 13:58.420
 because they checked off that box.

13:59.320 --> 14:02.000
 And by the way, you mentioned PubMed and barbecue.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.160
 I should mention that I got a chance to hang out

14:04.160 --> 14:06.120
 with Rick Rubin, thanks to you.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.940
 He's a friend of yours and you made the connection.

14:07.940 --> 14:11.160
 That was a huge gift to my spirit, I guess.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.160
 He's a truly, truly special human being.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.560
 And there's a lot I could say

14:15.560 --> 14:17.440
 about why he's a special human being.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.640
 I'd love to learn how you met him,

14:19.640 --> 14:22.360
 but I should also just mention on the PubMed thing,

14:23.560 --> 14:25.920
 it was so interesting talking to him about music

14:27.320 --> 14:31.000
 and both on the podcast and privately

14:31.000 --> 14:32.780
 and just listening to music together.

14:32.780 --> 14:36.000
 Because when you mention a song,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.960
 he does this thing where he like closes his eyes

14:39.960 --> 14:44.120
 and he finds that song in the album that we're talking about

14:44.120 --> 14:45.880
 and he steps through the album.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.840
 You could see the brain like stepping

14:47.840 --> 14:51.200
 through individual songs to find that song in the album.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.080
 And there's that kind of lookup process.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.320
 And then he puts himself mentally in that space

14:55.320 --> 14:59.800
 of like, okay, this is, you know, whatever the album is.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.520
 And not just the ones he produced,

15:01.520 --> 15:04.940
 but all of these in the encyclopedia of music.

15:04.940 --> 15:06.480
 And it's so interesting.

15:06.480 --> 15:10.160
 It also, the thing I really love about him

15:10.160 --> 15:13.520
 is something like a calmness that radiates from him.

15:13.520 --> 15:16.680
 That it's okay to close your eyes and place yourself

15:16.680 --> 15:19.680
 in the place where that album was recorded,

15:20.540 --> 15:24.540
 in the feeling of that album and like that silence.

15:24.540 --> 15:26.640
 Let's go there, let's go there together.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.680
 It's like Alice in Wonderland and we'll go there together.

15:28.680 --> 15:31.160
 You do a good Rick Rubin, minus the beard.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.000
 Minus the beard.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.720
 His beard is epic, right?

15:33.720 --> 15:35.900
 You can't fake a beard like that, you know.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.240
 How'd you guys meet?

15:37.240 --> 15:42.240
 Yeah, well, Rick, I'm very blessed to consider a close friend.

15:42.240 --> 15:45.840
 Rick and I got introduced through a common friend

15:45.840 --> 15:47.320
 during the pandemic.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.660
 And we started doing some FaceTime together

15:49.660 --> 15:52.000
 and just talking about things related to science and health.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.020
 And I'm not a musician, I have no musical ability or talent.

15:56.020 --> 15:58.200
 I have a good ability to memorize lyrics

15:58.200 --> 16:00.280
 and I love lyrics and I love poetry.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.740
 So I asked him a lot of questions about musicians

16:02.740 --> 16:05.420
 that I happen to love that he's worked with and knows.

16:05.420 --> 16:07.840
 And so he would give me stories about musicians

16:07.840 --> 16:10.140
 and I would talk to him about health.

16:10.140 --> 16:12.040
 And then eventually we formed a friendship

16:12.040 --> 16:13.340
 where we would talk about any number

16:13.340 --> 16:15.560
 of different topics in life.

16:15.560 --> 16:18.720
 And then we started spending time together in person

16:18.720 --> 16:21.100
 when he was in town or nearby.

16:21.100 --> 16:25.300
 And as you now know, you know, Rick,

16:26.360 --> 16:28.520
 in addition to all his incredible accomplishments,

16:28.520 --> 16:31.240
 has an incredible understanding

16:31.240 --> 16:36.240
 of how to get the brain and body into state, right?

16:36.640 --> 16:40.800
 And as you pointed out, he's willing to do the things

16:40.800 --> 16:43.560
 that allow him to help these incredible artists

16:43.560 --> 16:46.960
 get into the best state to do their craft.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.660
 And so if he needs to sit there and be quiet

16:49.660 --> 16:53.600
 with his eyes closed for a minute or two or more,

16:53.600 --> 16:54.880
 he'll do that.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.960
 He has routines to allow himself to get into state.

16:57.960 --> 17:01.200
 And it's really inspired me to think about states of mind

17:01.200 --> 17:02.680
 as something that, you know, we'd all love

17:02.680 --> 17:04.160
 to just flip the switch and say,

17:04.160 --> 17:05.640
 we're focused or we're creative,

17:05.640 --> 17:09.960
 but to actually ratchet through the challenging steps

17:09.960 --> 17:11.280
 in order to do that and to figure out

17:11.280 --> 17:14.360
 what one needs to do on a regular basis

17:14.360 --> 17:16.400
 to get into a proper state.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.360
 It's not just gonna come from a cup of coffee,

17:19.360 --> 17:22.640
 you know, a lamp of a particular wavelength or something.

17:22.640 --> 17:23.620
 It's gonna be those things,

17:23.620 --> 17:26.680
 but it's also going to be really teaching oneself

17:26.680 --> 17:28.480
 how to get into proper state.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.120
 Yeah, you did an episode on hypnosis.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.600
 Do you think it's a kind of self hypnosis?

17:32.600 --> 17:33.920
 Yes, I do.

17:33.920 --> 17:38.160
 Because hypnosis is a, you limit the context,

17:38.160 --> 17:41.400
 you're very alert and you're very calm.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.360
 And he has a number of these different practices.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.640
 And so we would talk about those.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.480
 And then we also have enjoyed a lot of discussions

17:48.480 --> 17:50.220
 about deep neuroscience.

17:50.220 --> 17:52.760
 In fact, I introduced Rick to a friend of mine

17:52.760 --> 17:54.920
 who's a neurosurgeon and neuroscientist

17:54.920 --> 17:56.320
 and they've become friendly.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.520
 You know, Rick is one of these people

17:57.520 --> 18:00.680
 that he sort of defies definition, incredibly kind,

18:00.680 --> 18:02.160
 incredibly private person too.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.000
 So, you know, I'm being respectful of that.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.520
 But, and then of course he's a fan of your podcast.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.040
 And so when I learned that,

18:09.040 --> 18:11.900
 I just made natural sense to introduce you.

18:11.900 --> 18:13.780
 And I know he really enjoyed meeting you.

18:13.780 --> 18:15.440
 And we talk about you a lot.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.600
 And of course, in a positive light, you know,

18:17.600 --> 18:21.880
 I think his dedication to getting into these states of mind

18:21.880 --> 18:22.920
 and his willingness to do that

18:22.920 --> 18:26.400
 has completely transformed my routines around life.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.240
 Like for instance,

18:27.240 --> 18:29.360
 before doing a very long podcast recording,

18:29.360 --> 18:32.280
 the solo ones, which often take me several hours or more,

18:32.280 --> 18:35.300
 six hours to record, sometimes more, sometimes less.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.440
 I realized that there's a certain brain state

18:37.440 --> 18:38.320
 associated with that.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.040
 So I have to really limit the kind of interactions I have

18:41.040 --> 18:42.520
 for the two hours before.

18:42.520 --> 18:45.680
 I actually walk and talk out loud through my neighborhood.

18:45.680 --> 18:46.960
 People think I'm crazy,

18:46.960 --> 18:47.920
 but I live in a neighborhood

18:47.920 --> 18:50.880
 where there are a lot of crazy creatives anyway.

18:50.880 --> 18:51.720
 So.

18:51.720 --> 18:52.560
 Are you saying you're not crazy?

18:52.560 --> 18:57.560
 Well, at least not institutionally defined as crazy yet.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.760
 But, you know, getting into state of mind

19:00.760 --> 19:02.840
 is something that we'd all just imagine we flip the switch,

19:02.840 --> 19:04.080
 but Rick really convinced me,

19:04.080 --> 19:06.680
 you have to do the work to do the work.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.440
 Can you maybe linger on that,

19:09.440 --> 19:11.200
 elucidate a little bit more of your process

19:11.200 --> 19:12.880
 of how you get in that space?

19:12.880 --> 19:14.040
 That's really interesting.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.600
 Cause I have to admit,

19:16.600 --> 19:19.240
 I do everything last minute before a podcast.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.080
 I don't know.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.160
 Like there's a lot of anxiety because like whatever,

19:24.160 --> 19:27.120
 if I have to pack, if I have to set up stuff,

19:27.120 --> 19:29.040
 you were luckily a few minutes,

19:29.040 --> 19:30.520
 you showed up a few minutes later.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.080
 Which for an academic is right on time.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.280
 Right on time.

19:33.280 --> 19:36.040
 But the stress is immense.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.080
 And on top of that,

19:38.080 --> 19:41.560
 you look at like a situation with Rick Rubin,

19:41.560 --> 19:44.760
 is I had to set up microphones in front of him

19:44.760 --> 19:47.000
 and just that stress, the anxiety.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.320
 He knows a lot about microphones.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.160
 What did he say?

19:49.160 --> 19:50.180
 Which I really loved.

19:50.180 --> 19:55.180
 He's like, how close do you like the microphone to be?

19:56.000 --> 19:56.840
 It's like.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.120
 That's a very Rick Rubin kind of thing, right?

19:59.120 --> 20:01.620
 That the details really matter.

20:01.620 --> 20:03.600
 The details really matter,

20:03.600 --> 20:07.600
 right down to your relationship to the microphone, right?

20:07.600 --> 20:09.660
 Distance and whether or not it brings out the timbre

20:09.660 --> 20:10.500
 in your voice.

20:10.500 --> 20:11.320
 But of course that's what he does.

20:11.320 --> 20:12.160
 He produces music.

20:12.160 --> 20:15.880
 But he also said like, you know, he is the professional.

20:15.880 --> 20:20.320
 He said, how close do you like it to be?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.440
 And he said it with a gentleness

20:22.440 --> 20:24.820
 where I had like an existential crisis.

20:24.820 --> 20:26.420
 Where I don't, I don't know.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.120
 He gave me so much like, wow.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.960
 Like he made me feel like an artist.

20:31.960 --> 20:35.040
 Like that the microphone distance

20:35.040 --> 20:37.320
 is a decision you're supposed to make.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.400
 Well, I have to say, and this has actually come up

20:39.400 --> 20:41.440
 in some of our conversations about you.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.920
 I mean, you are, you are an artist.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.800
 And actually Joe Rogan,

20:44.800 --> 20:46.960
 once I heard him talking about podcasting

20:46.960 --> 20:48.960
 and the fact that he's always trying to get better at it,

20:48.960 --> 20:50.960
 you know, and he described podcasting at one moment

20:50.960 --> 20:52.500
 as an art, right?

20:52.500 --> 20:55.600
 And it is, it's a certain medium of communication

20:55.600 --> 20:59.400
 and there's a cadence and a rhythm that when it's working,

20:59.400 --> 21:01.920
 it really can facilitate the transfer of information.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.220
 When it's not, it doesn't.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.720
 I mean, obviously Joe just being himself

21:05.720 --> 21:08.800
 has tapped into that cadence that allows

21:08.800 --> 21:11.840
 and it's made so many people excited to hear him talk.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.200
 Well, in his case and in general,

21:13.200 --> 21:17.880
 I think part of the art is refusing the world

21:17.880 --> 21:21.120
 as you get a bigger audience, change who you are.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.180
 There's one quote that I've seen out there where he says,

21:23.180 --> 21:25.600
 you know, I'm like the, talking about himself, he says,

21:25.600 --> 21:27.540
 you know, I'm like the fish that got through the net.

21:27.540 --> 21:29.760
 There's no stage version of me, right?

21:29.760 --> 21:33.240
 How he is in person is how he is, you know,

21:33.240 --> 21:34.080
 out in the world.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.460
 And of course there's nuance to his life, right?

21:36.460 --> 21:40.200
 And his different relationships, of course, but it's true.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.760
 I mean, we've had the, you know,

21:41.760 --> 21:43.720
 the great fortune of spending time with him

21:43.720 --> 21:46.860
 out away from the microphones, so to speak.

21:46.860 --> 21:48.160
 Joe is Joe.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.120
 So can you speak to your, that process you mentioned,

21:51.120 --> 21:52.720
 the walking and the talking to yourself?

21:52.720 --> 21:53.560
 Cause that's fascinating.

21:53.560 --> 21:57.600
 Yeah, I try and do a couple of things.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.100
 First of all, when I was a kid,

21:59.100 --> 22:01.360
 I had a little bit of a grunting tick.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.220
 When I was five or six,

22:03.220 --> 22:06.680
 I would feel this buildup of tension in my throat

22:06.680 --> 22:07.700
 and I would do this grunting tick.

22:07.700 --> 22:10.280
 If I get very tired, I start to do it still.

22:10.280 --> 22:11.800
 We actually know that this is related

22:11.800 --> 22:14.120
 to these basal ganglia circuits for go, no go.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.160
 You've got an accelerator and a brake basically

22:16.160 --> 22:21.160
 in your neural circuitry and kids with Tourette's and OCD,

22:21.220 --> 22:23.360
 the brake doesn't work quite as well.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.080
 And so one thing that happens is if I wake up

22:25.080 --> 22:27.880
 in the morning and especially if I'm well rested,

22:27.880 --> 22:30.120
 well, if I'm not well rested, I do a hypnosis

22:30.120 --> 22:32.240
 or yoga nidra in order to recover my sleep.

22:32.240 --> 22:33.080
 That works really well.

22:33.080 --> 22:36.800
 But then once I'm into the process of preparing the podcast,

22:36.800 --> 22:37.940
 I've already gone through my notes.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.480
 I know what I want to say more or less

22:39.480 --> 22:40.840
 in a kind of general contour.

22:40.840 --> 22:45.480
 And then I take a walk and I try to, so no phone with me.

22:45.480 --> 22:49.920
 And I try to assess whether or not my energy is too high

22:49.920 --> 22:52.140
 or too low for podcasting.

22:52.140 --> 22:54.160
 Because when you podcast, as you know,

22:54.160 --> 22:55.920
 you have to punch out a lot of material,

22:55.920 --> 22:57.660
 but then there's times when you really need to slow down

22:57.660 --> 22:59.600
 and emphasize and articulate.

22:59.600 --> 23:04.160
 And so what I do, I've never revealed this.

23:04.160 --> 23:08.000
 What I do actually is I will recite the lyrics of songs

23:08.000 --> 23:12.480
 for about 10 minutes, songs I love while I walk out loud.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.480
 It calms you and focuses you, what does it do for you?

23:14.480 --> 23:19.480
 I think it gets my vocal cords warmed up and it also.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.120
 Do you sing or speak them?

23:21.120 --> 23:25.600
 I often sing them and fortunately nobody hears.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.880
 And as I do this, I start to evaluate

23:28.880 --> 23:30.920
 whether or not I'm straining to get the words out

23:30.920 --> 23:34.960
 or whether or not I'm straining to make them slow enough

23:34.960 --> 23:37.240
 so that I can articulate them.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.800
 So there are days when I have so much energy

23:39.800 --> 23:44.460
 that I'm trying to speak faster than I should

23:44.460 --> 23:46.080
 in order to articulate properly.

23:46.080 --> 23:47.380
 There are other days when I'm tired

23:47.380 --> 23:49.520
 and I can't sort of keep up with my thoughts.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.480
 And so what I try and do is assess that

23:51.480 --> 23:55.260
 and then adjust the transmission, the RPM, so to speak.

23:55.260 --> 23:56.560
 For instance, I can speak very quickly

23:56.560 --> 23:57.860
 and then I can slow down.

23:57.860 --> 23:59.680
 So I can change the cadence of my voice.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.520
 And when you teach in the classroom,

24:01.520 --> 24:02.940
 you learn as you know,

24:02.940 --> 24:03.920
 cause you're an excellent teacher,

24:03.920 --> 24:05.800
 I've watched your lectures in the classroom.

24:05.800 --> 24:09.480
 As you teach in the classroom, when you want to slow down,

24:09.480 --> 24:11.880
 every teacher knows you turn to the whiteboard or chalkboard

24:11.880 --> 24:13.040
 and you start writing, right?

24:13.040 --> 24:14.240
 It gives you a break.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.220
 And then you turn around and you fire back

24:16.220 --> 24:19.040
 the kind of machine gun fire of information.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.920
 And then you slow down or you underline something.

24:20.920 --> 24:24.600
 When you podcast, you don't have that opportunity, right?

24:24.600 --> 24:26.340
 There are no visuals in my podcast.

24:26.340 --> 24:31.340
 So what I try and do is always get my voice warmed up

24:31.560 --> 24:33.720
 and make sure that I'm thinking and speaking

24:33.720 --> 24:36.040
 at approximately the same rate.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.920
 And then I also do this thing of as I put my vision

24:38.920 --> 24:42.680
 into panoramic vision when I walk, which is very calming.

24:42.680 --> 24:46.040
 And then I actually start to remind myself

24:46.040 --> 24:47.520
 of the purpose of podcasting.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.480
 This sounds very mission statementy,

24:49.480 --> 24:51.480
 but you asked what I do.

24:51.480 --> 24:54.820
 I remind myself first and foremost

24:54.820 --> 24:56.160
 that what I want to communicate,

24:56.160 --> 24:57.920
 what I want to come through is the beauty

24:57.920 --> 25:00.160
 and utility of biology.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.980
 And I only feel comfortable saying the word beauty

25:02.980 --> 25:06.360
 publicly now about science things thanks to you,

25:06.360 --> 25:07.600
 because I think.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.000
 Love and beauty.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.840
 Yeah, love and beauty.

25:10.840 --> 25:11.840
 Dr. Andrew Huberman.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.760
 Love and beauty, but also darkness and hatred.

25:14.760 --> 25:17.200
 And if you're talking about the Lex Friedman podcast,

25:17.200 --> 25:18.040
 you have to adjust,

25:18.040 --> 25:21.100
 you have to address the shadow also, the shadow side.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.360
 But I think about the,

25:22.360 --> 25:26.360
 I want to communicate the beauty and utility of biology.

25:26.360 --> 25:29.960
 And then I check my emotional state.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.760
 I want to make sure that I'm not angry about anything.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.640
 And certainly if I am that I'm going to set it aside

25:35.640 --> 25:36.480
 for the podcast,

25:36.480 --> 25:38.600
 because that's not a place for my,

25:38.600 --> 25:40.260
 whatever I might be dealing with.

25:40.260 --> 25:43.460
 I also really start to feel into the parts of the research

25:43.460 --> 25:45.620
 and the papers I found that I really love,

25:45.620 --> 25:50.620
 because that's the part of me that I like the most frankly.

25:52.060 --> 25:54.760
 And on the podcast, if there's a paper,

25:54.760 --> 25:56.740
 like for instance, we have a paper, excuse me,

25:56.740 --> 26:01.040
 a podcast coming out soon about heat as a tool,

26:01.040 --> 26:02.320
 sauna, but some other things.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.680
 And in researching this,

26:03.680 --> 26:07.440
 I learned so much about these heat shock proteins

26:07.440 --> 26:09.960
 and the use of sauna in Finland

26:09.960 --> 26:11.080
 for increasing growth hormone,

26:11.080 --> 26:12.960
 but also for the treatment of mental illness.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.160
 And I realized I fell in love with this literature.

26:15.160 --> 26:17.000
 It's just a beautiful literature.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.020
 These people are true pioneers for doing this work.

26:19.020 --> 26:21.740
 Now everyone's in the sauna, but this was 20 years ago.

26:21.740 --> 26:23.840
 The way the experiments were done were amazing

26:23.840 --> 26:26.800
 with all these Finnish people with thermocouples up there,

26:26.800 --> 26:29.480
 rectum to measure temperature, swimming in pools.

26:29.480 --> 26:30.680
 It's hilarious and great.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.780
 And so I start to think about, and I think,

26:33.880 --> 26:36.660
 I just start to really access my love of the work.

26:36.660 --> 26:39.180
 And then when we finally sit down,

26:39.180 --> 26:42.440
 meaning my producer Rob and I and record,

26:42.440 --> 26:46.200
 I just sort of want to just bask in sharing it.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.760
 Just like the little version of me when I was six or seven,

26:48.760 --> 26:51.120
 I used to spend all weekend reading the encyclopedia,

26:51.120 --> 26:53.020
 Guinness Book of World Records,

26:53.020 --> 26:55.960
 making my mother drive me places to introduce me to,

26:55.960 --> 26:57.720
 I had this obsession with trapping animals

26:57.720 --> 26:58.880
 when I was a kid, meet these people.

26:58.880 --> 27:02.100
 And then on Monday, I would insist on giving a lecture

27:02.100 --> 27:03.640
 in class, which as a little kid.

27:03.640 --> 27:04.720
 So that's basically what it is.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.920
 I just try and access that childlike energy.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.960
 And so I want to be clear.

27:09.960 --> 27:13.120
 The goal is always to make the information interesting,

27:13.120 --> 27:15.640
 clear and actionable.

27:15.640 --> 27:18.720
 And if it's also surprising, then that's a bonus.

27:18.720 --> 27:19.920
 But that's basically the process.

27:19.920 --> 27:24.640
 But yeah, I'm singing and talking and getting into state.

27:24.640 --> 27:27.920
 And I used to feel very sheepish about sharing any of this.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.780
 This is the first time I've ever shared it out loud,

27:29.780 --> 27:32.000
 but Rick was the one who encouraged me

27:32.000 --> 27:34.640
 to find a process that works

27:34.640 --> 27:36.840
 and continue to develop that process

27:36.840 --> 27:39.600
 and not let anything get near that process.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.640
 People in my personal life know this.

27:41.640 --> 27:43.000
 And when it's time, it's like,

27:43.000 --> 27:44.960
 I don't care what else is going on,

27:44.960 --> 27:47.240
 I'm moving into that brain state.

27:47.240 --> 27:48.640
 And there's probably a process like that

27:48.640 --> 27:51.900
 for anything that you do in life that you take seriously.

27:51.900 --> 27:55.120
 So the people that have perfected this is athletes.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.640
 Like if Olympic level athletes,

27:56.640 --> 27:58.360
 they have to have a process like this.

27:58.360 --> 27:59.720
 You know what, I think Tiger Woods actually

27:59.720 --> 28:02.320
 was taught self hypnosis quite young

28:03.760 --> 28:07.760
 and use self hypnosis often during his tournaments,

28:07.760 --> 28:11.420
 sometimes to great success and other times less so.

28:11.420 --> 28:15.200
 Is there other places in life that you use

28:16.360 --> 28:20.480
 kind of a protocol, like a mental protocol to get ready?

28:20.480 --> 28:22.440
 Many of the best areas of life

28:22.440 --> 28:25.240
 are their own form of hypnosis, right?

28:25.240 --> 28:26.080
 True.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.040
 You know that you're in hypnosis,

28:27.040 --> 28:29.220
 if for instance, you're in a movie and something happens

28:29.220 --> 28:30.560
 and you feel the emotional lift

28:30.560 --> 28:32.880
 without being self conscious about it.

28:32.880 --> 28:37.880
 Yes, I think that one thing that we've tried to do

28:38.440 --> 28:42.800
 in our house is around meal times to try and set a state

28:42.800 --> 28:44.000
 that food isn't just something

28:44.000 --> 28:46.440
 that we just throw down our throats.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.300
 And I'm fortunate that my partner cooks really well.

28:49.300 --> 28:52.400
 And so I try and give her the space to do that.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.280
 And that's the whole thing of her getting into state.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.120
 And then.

28:56.120 --> 28:56.960
 For the cooking.

28:56.960 --> 28:57.780
 For the cooking.

28:57.780 --> 28:58.620
 The preparation of all the.

28:58.620 --> 28:59.460
 I can just see it.

28:59.460 --> 29:01.240
 I just see the way she approaches the whole thing

29:01.240 --> 29:03.160
 and the pleasure in serving it.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.760
 And I'm an eater, not a cooker.

29:05.800 --> 29:06.640
 But.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.000
 Both are important roles.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.560
 You could be a very good eater.

29:09.560 --> 29:11.200
 Like there's something about,

29:11.200 --> 29:14.680
 is there anything better in this world than that feeling?

29:14.680 --> 29:18.560
 Especially if it's a family, getting around a table.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.500
 Just the warmth of that.

29:20.500 --> 29:21.340
 I don't know.

29:21.340 --> 29:26.340
 It's like the cold outside of the cruel world

29:27.120 --> 29:29.840
 cannot touch you in this place that you've returned to.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.640
 And if.

29:31.640 --> 29:32.480
 I mean.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.640
 Did you grow up eating meals as a family?

29:34.640 --> 29:35.480
 Yeah, yeah.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.320
 I mean.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.880
 No television?

29:37.880 --> 29:38.720
 No.

29:38.720 --> 29:43.280
 I didn't really have television period outside of meals.

29:44.400 --> 29:48.280
 So most of my time was spent, you know,

29:48.280 --> 29:53.080
 like a stray cat outdoors, just running around,

29:53.080 --> 29:53.920
 playing soccer.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.960
 I imagine you in this like dirt or concrete lot

29:56.960 --> 30:00.280
 between two very high rise buildings playing soccer

30:00.280 --> 30:04.480
 in like athletic gear that you only see in Eastern Europe.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.800
 You know how like you come to the States

30:05.800 --> 30:07.200
 and people wear their athletic gear.

30:07.200 --> 30:10.880
 You go to Europe and you see, maybe it's the soccer culture,

30:10.880 --> 30:12.240
 but you see athletic gear

30:12.240 --> 30:14.160
 that you just don't see anywhere else.

30:14.160 --> 30:15.000
 That's interesting.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
 I mean, I grew up pretty poor.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.760
 So first of all, I was always wearing my brother's,

30:20.760 --> 30:23.600
 who's an older brother, brother's clothes.

30:23.600 --> 30:28.600
 And they were like old, like my favorite things

30:29.440 --> 30:31.960
 were American things that I didn't understand.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.280
 It would be like a Pepsi shirt or something.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.560
 And it was just, that was the gear.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.040
 And it was like too large for me,

30:38.040 --> 30:40.200
 but I thought I was the coolest person ever

30:40.200 --> 30:44.800
 just wearing this fancy like Kanye like type of fashion.

30:44.800 --> 30:45.640
 Yeah, there's something about,

30:45.640 --> 30:47.720
 I feel like in Eastern Europe,

30:47.720 --> 30:50.080
 they wear athletic gear where like the guys like zip up.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.080
 Yeah, no, that's like fancy stuff.

30:52.080 --> 30:54.480
 That's if you like, those are the cool kids.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.960
 I see, I see.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.640
 Like the cool soccer players, football players

30:58.640 --> 31:02.400
 that like they were in a league of some kind.

31:02.400 --> 31:06.880
 So they would get uniforms or like, or they somehow,

31:06.880 --> 31:10.360
 I always thought anyone who had anything nice

31:10.360 --> 31:13.040
 had to do something really bad to get it.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.680
 That was my way, view of the world.

31:15.680 --> 31:20.360
 Because like, I guess I didn't understand

31:20.360 --> 31:22.360
 how it's possible to be rich.

31:22.360 --> 31:25.280
 Cause most of us were surrounded by people who are poor

31:25.280 --> 31:26.800
 and that life is beautiful and simple.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.840
 And it's like, why do you escape that life?

31:28.840 --> 31:30.960
 But you still admire the cool,

31:30.960 --> 31:34.800
 like when we got McDonald's, it was like,

31:35.680 --> 31:39.960
 what kind of world does this place come from?

31:39.960 --> 31:42.600
 Like who invented this?

31:42.600 --> 31:45.520
 This is a fascinating view from a child's perspective

31:45.520 --> 31:47.720
 of like, of capitalism essentially.

31:47.720 --> 31:49.920
 Yeah, but the fact that you ate dinner together

31:49.920 --> 31:51.400
 is really interesting.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.520
 My parents divorced when I was an adolescent.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.560
 So then there was a total fracture of any family structure.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.880
 But prior to that, we ate dinner together every night.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.880
 I was expected to know how to use my knife and fork.

32:00.880 --> 32:05.880
 And it was like a very structured thing.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.560
 I don't know if kids do that now.

32:09.080 --> 32:11.200
 If I ever have kids, they're gonna do that.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.680
 And certainly, actually on the way over here,

32:13.680 --> 32:16.720
 I was thinking, I was like, I really want a lot of kids.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.320
 I want like a whole litter.

32:18.320 --> 32:21.600
 And I was thinking, if Lex has kids and I have kids,

32:21.600 --> 32:25.200
 then we can like pit them against each other with jujitsu.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.800
 This is my chance at redemption.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.400
 It's the law game.

32:30.400 --> 32:33.120
 They'll all wanna be engineers or physicists.

32:33.120 --> 32:34.640
 They won't wanna be biologists.

32:35.840 --> 32:38.360
 But in all seriousness, I look forward to the day

32:38.360 --> 32:41.360
 that our kids play together.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.480
 Yeah, I think there's something,

32:43.480 --> 32:47.200
 so the family dinner, the ritual of the family dinner,

32:47.200 --> 32:49.160
 but also the special occasion dinners,

32:49.160 --> 32:51.920
 like where there's a little bit more preparation,

32:51.920 --> 32:53.760
 a little bit more cooking,

32:53.760 --> 32:57.000
 whether it's on the weekend or for some holiday.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.600
 In Russia, it was a thing that actually

32:59.600 --> 33:02.800
 I find completely missing for the most part.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.800
 In America is there was neighbors.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.360
 There was a, you broke the walls

33:08.360 --> 33:11.080
 between families much more commonly.

33:11.080 --> 33:13.800
 Like there would be kinda regular characters,

33:13.800 --> 33:15.120
 like a sitcom almost.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.600
 If you watch the sitcom, it's never just the family.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.200
 There's always like other characters that.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.120
 Just bursting in the door.

33:20.120 --> 33:20.960
 Bursting in the door.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.120
 I'm gonna start doing that here,

33:22.120 --> 33:22.960
 just to make you feel at home.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.680
 Just start showing up at your studio.

33:24.680 --> 33:25.640
 I know where you live.

33:25.640 --> 33:27.520
 I think people wanna respect,

33:27.520 --> 33:30.720
 like Michael Malice lives next door to me.

33:30.720 --> 33:33.760
 And I think people wanna respect each other's privacy

33:33.760 --> 33:34.600
 or something like that.

33:34.600 --> 33:37.400
 And I think we all get super busy.

33:37.400 --> 33:42.400
 And it's kind of work

33:42.400 --> 33:46.080
 to do this dinner together.

33:46.080 --> 33:49.760
 Or if you see it as a thing that needs to be scheduled,

33:49.760 --> 33:50.600
 it's work.

33:50.600 --> 33:51.440
 We get busy.

33:51.440 --> 33:52.280
 There's a lot of stuff going on.

33:52.280 --> 33:55.520
 But if it's part of a ritual, a part of the culture,

33:55.520 --> 33:58.560
 all of those walls get broken down.

33:58.560 --> 34:00.160
 And then you realize like that's,

34:00.160 --> 34:03.120
 like later looking back, those are the things you miss.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.880
 Like that's what life is about.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.360
 Like all the stupid stuff you're doing

34:06.360 --> 34:08.160
 in terms of career or whatever,

34:08.160 --> 34:10.080
 all the busy things, those don't matter.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.240
 What matters is the people.

34:12.240 --> 34:17.080
 In academia, this changed in the last few years, of course.

34:17.080 --> 34:20.800
 But one of the great joys was professors will stop by

34:20.800 --> 34:21.640
 your office or your lab.

34:21.640 --> 34:23.560
 Nobody set up an appointment.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.480
 There was a guy when I was a professor in San Diego,

34:25.480 --> 34:26.400
 a guy named Harvey Cartney,

34:26.400 --> 34:28.440
 he's a member of the National Academies,

34:28.440 --> 34:31.320
 truly the world's expert in the evolution of vision

34:31.320 --> 34:33.720
 and evolution of brains generally.

34:33.720 --> 34:35.320
 And he would show up in my lab

34:35.320 --> 34:37.880
 and he would just start talking to the students in postdocs.

34:37.880 --> 34:42.600
 And I mean, a pure encyclopedia.

34:42.600 --> 34:43.840
 And then at some point you'd say,

34:43.840 --> 34:45.080
 hey, Harvey, I gotta go.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.640
 And you'd have, you'd kick him out, right?

34:46.640 --> 34:49.600
 Or this guy, he's a physicist, David Klinefield,

34:49.600 --> 34:50.920
 who's, same way.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.040
 Actually, David Klinefield is an interesting one.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.800
 A student of his went on to create

34:55.800 --> 34:57.400
 the Beavis and Butthead cartoon.

34:57.400 --> 34:59.360
 And one of them is David, he's a physics professor.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.000
 Now people can look him up.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.320
 And David's one of those guys who just walk into your office

35:03.320 --> 35:05.400
 and you just sit down and you just start talking to you.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.360
 And so there's a kind of a family field.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.800
 It's like Cheers or Seinfeld or one of those shows

35:09.800 --> 35:10.880
 where somebody just walks in.

35:10.880 --> 35:13.720
 And yeah, I think you and I both share a love

35:13.720 --> 35:14.960
 of the community around things.

35:14.960 --> 35:17.720
 And podcasting is a little bit more isolated.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.600
 I should say for the guest episodes,

35:19.600 --> 35:21.320
 the preparation is completely different

35:21.320 --> 35:22.960
 because it's more conversational.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.560
 And so there, I don't do any of this business

35:24.560 --> 35:26.280
 of putting myself into state.

35:26.280 --> 35:30.080
 I just try and make sure that the guest is taken care of.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.920
 And I do list out the questions I'm gonna ask before,

35:32.920 --> 35:35.440
 but those actually really like the interview episodes

35:35.440 --> 35:37.920
 far more than I like doing the solo ones.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.160
 Just psychologically I mean.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.520
 I just like learning from someone directly

35:41.520 --> 35:44.080
 because you asking an expert about something,

35:44.080 --> 35:46.680
 like sitting here with you when we recorded the podcast

35:46.680 --> 35:48.560
 where you were a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.480
 And for the first time, and finally,

35:51.480 --> 35:53.200
 someone was explaining to me the difference

35:53.200 --> 35:55.160
 between machine learning, artificial intelligence

35:55.160 --> 35:56.440
 and all these other things.

35:56.440 --> 35:58.040
 You know, and I've finally forgiven you

35:58.040 --> 36:02.400
 for making me cry about Costello on camera,

36:02.400 --> 36:03.560
 because it helped me move through it.

36:03.560 --> 36:06.160
 But in all seriousness, the interview ones

36:06.160 --> 36:08.560
 are a sheer pleasure.

36:08.560 --> 36:12.600
 The solo ones I really enjoy, but they're work.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.120
 Sometimes I think like I'm gonna sweat

36:14.120 --> 36:16.120
 a little blood prepping for them.

36:16.120 --> 36:18.480
 Well, it's interesting because I do think prepping

36:18.480 --> 36:21.160
 for interviews, having a similar process

36:21.160 --> 36:23.000
 might be also very valuable.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.280
 Like I have to think about that

36:26.280 --> 36:31.200
 because I think when you do a conversation

36:31.200 --> 36:35.000
 for several hours, especially when it's a high stakes one.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.720
 So it's not like you and I know,

36:36.720 --> 36:38.560
 it's more like it's just chatting and so on.

36:38.560 --> 36:40.720
 The world order isn't gonna shift according to it.

36:40.720 --> 36:43.320
 Although you never know, knowing you will probably

36:43.320 --> 36:46.000
 be into some pretty controversial topics in a few minutes.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.080
 You like to ride the edge more than I do.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.360
 There are a number of topics that I just completely avoid.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.560
 And my response to those is always that

36:52.560 --> 36:54.080
 I have a lot of opinions about that,

36:54.080 --> 36:55.800
 but not a lot to say, you know.

36:55.800 --> 37:00.720
 But whereas you've become far braver

37:00.720 --> 37:02.800
 in terms of the topics you'll encounter

37:02.800 --> 37:06.200
 and some of your guests have been a bit controversial.

37:06.200 --> 37:11.080
 Some of them are people that a lot of people don't like.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.760
 And you've been willing to just sit down

37:13.760 --> 37:16.240
 and maybe it's the jujitsu thing.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.080
 I don't know, it is tricky.

37:18.080 --> 37:20.840
 One of my goals for this year is to talk to people

37:20.840 --> 37:24.520
 that a lot of people really don't like.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.200
 Are you gonna share with us?

37:26.200 --> 37:27.040
 And here I am.

37:27.040 --> 37:32.040
 People that are in prison, major political leaders

37:34.280 --> 37:37.000
 have been thinking a lot about how to talk

37:37.000 --> 37:41.280
 to really difficult, controversial figures,

37:41.280 --> 37:45.160
 but find together something with them

37:45.160 --> 37:47.680
 that's deeply honest about their nature,

37:47.680 --> 37:52.680
 about the ideas they have about the world.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.600
 Reveal something real.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.440
 And some people, you have to be very careful,

37:59.440 --> 38:03.560
 some people are very good at hiding the real inside them,

38:03.560 --> 38:05.240
 even from themselves.

38:05.240 --> 38:06.600
 That's something I think about a lot.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.320
 I think about dictators of the past

38:08.320 --> 38:09.960
 and I put myself in the mindset,

38:09.960 --> 38:12.720
 well, how do you reveal something real

38:12.720 --> 38:14.720
 about this person to themselves?

38:14.720 --> 38:17.640
 I think that to me, and you kind of spoke to that,

38:17.640 --> 38:22.640
 but a great conversation is one where

38:22.640 --> 38:25.800
 both of you discover something new.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.280
 So I love that too, that's my favorite thing

38:31.280 --> 38:33.640
 what you mentioned, which is allowing your curiosity

38:33.640 --> 38:35.520
 and ask all kinds of questions and get excited

38:35.520 --> 38:37.240
 and to learn from an expert.

38:37.240 --> 38:40.520
 But also to push them to discover something

38:40.520 --> 38:44.320
 about themselves, about their ideas together.

38:44.320 --> 38:48.840
 And then that discovery, and sometimes it's like,

38:48.840 --> 38:53.840
 we don't see it in the moment, but the audience hears it.

38:55.440 --> 38:58.240
 It's weird to say, I would compare it to

38:58.240 --> 38:59.520
 when you're a musician and you're playing

38:59.520 --> 39:02.080
 with other musicians, you lose yourself in the moment.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.360
 Yeah, it's all, it's like, it's working right.

39:04.360 --> 39:09.360
 It's working, but you don't really see the big picture

39:09.800 --> 39:13.760
 impact of what it's working right actually feels like.

39:13.760 --> 39:17.680
 And that's where the audience could see that.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.320
 If you talk to somebody evil,

39:22.920 --> 39:26.560
 for me as an interviewer, I have to empathize

39:26.560 --> 39:27.560
 with that person.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.840
 If I want to understand, I have to put myself

39:29.840 --> 39:32.920
 in that mind space, and to put yourself in that mindset,

39:32.920 --> 39:37.600
 you really have to understand the evil inside of you.

39:38.560 --> 39:41.360
 Like you can't just think if somebody's in power

39:41.360 --> 39:45.200
 and has used that power to abuse others,

39:45.200 --> 39:48.160
 you can't just be a, I personally,

39:48.160 --> 39:49.960
 a person who seeks to understand.

39:49.960 --> 39:52.920
 You can't just be a journalist asking generic questions.

39:52.920 --> 39:55.840
 You have to put yourself in a place

39:55.840 --> 39:58.480
 where you're somebody who's given a lot of power

39:58.480 --> 40:01.320
 and slowly you start to abuse that power.

40:01.320 --> 40:03.280
 And what does that person become?

40:03.280 --> 40:04.520
 Who are you?

40:04.520 --> 40:07.200
 I have to plug myself into those moments in my life

40:07.200 --> 40:09.640
 in the past where I've been angry at something

40:11.000 --> 40:14.560
 and where I've been cruel because I was angry.

40:14.560 --> 40:17.560
 In little ways, but then you magnify them at scale

40:17.560 --> 40:21.000
 and I have to go there and that's very human.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
 And then I have to look at another person

40:23.000 --> 40:25.200
 from across the table for me and understand,

40:25.200 --> 40:26.800
 well, you're there too.

40:26.800 --> 40:31.320
 And then you had more opportunity to do truly cruel things.

40:31.320 --> 40:36.320
 And then where, like I have to plug myself

40:36.440 --> 40:39.600
 into places where I've been, I can imagine I can go,

40:39.600 --> 40:43.240
 where I was cruel to others and was unaware of it.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.720
 So I was in a mind space where I was thinking

40:45.720 --> 40:48.200
 that I'm doing good and I was doing not good.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.280
 Again, I've never gotten the opportunity

40:50.280 --> 40:52.480
 to do any of those things at large scale,

40:52.480 --> 40:54.840
 but all of us have done it at a small scale.

40:54.840 --> 40:58.760
 And I plug myself into that and then we're here,

40:58.760 --> 41:01.480
 we're to, if it's somebody who's in prison,

41:01.480 --> 41:03.400
 if it's somebody who's a dictator,

41:03.400 --> 41:07.040
 we're in that space where evil is,

41:07.040 --> 41:09.560
 all of us have the capacity to do that evil

41:09.560 --> 41:13.480
 and I have to imagine myself being able to do that evil.

41:13.480 --> 41:17.920
 And then we're here together in that dark, dark place.

41:17.920 --> 41:20.000
 And then if it's just right,

41:20.000 --> 41:21.800
 something real can actually come,

41:21.800 --> 41:23.960
 something from that person's childhood,

41:23.960 --> 41:27.640
 maybe awakening to a realization

41:27.640 --> 41:30.800
 that I thought it was a good person and I'm not.

41:30.800 --> 41:34.880
 And that only happens when you truly empathize.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.960
 Those moments of discovery are beautiful,

41:36.960 --> 41:38.720
 but they also happen in science.

41:38.720 --> 41:42.360
 When you just have a conversation and you realize,

41:42.360 --> 41:44.000
 I feel like talking to Stephen Wolfram,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.080
 I feel like we constantly realize

41:46.080 --> 41:48.040
 beautiful things together.

41:48.040 --> 41:52.240
 On this element of evil and sociopathy,

41:52.240 --> 41:57.240
 that Jung had this notion that we have all things inside us

41:57.760 --> 42:00.800
 and that we all have the capacity to be good or evil,

42:00.800 --> 42:05.160
 et cetera, but I have the good fortune

42:05.160 --> 42:08.040
 of working with somebody who has deep understanding

42:08.040 --> 42:10.200
 of psychiatry, but also psychoanalysis

42:10.200 --> 42:11.720
 and Jungian theory.

42:11.720 --> 42:15.040
 And he said to me recently, he said,

42:15.040 --> 42:17.960
 whether or not all people have all things inside them

42:17.960 --> 42:20.400
 is still debated in the psychology community

42:20.400 --> 42:22.840
 and in the neuroscience community.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.440
 And as a matter of philosophy,

42:24.440 --> 42:28.240
 but there are certain people, not many,

42:28.240 --> 42:29.960
 but there are certain people

42:29.960 --> 42:33.280
 for whom they've actually lived out many versions

42:33.280 --> 42:37.040
 of their possible selves in the first person.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.760
 And so those are unique individuals.

42:38.760 --> 42:41.280
 Then even if they tapped into these things,

42:41.280 --> 42:44.440
 as you mentioned, at a more minor level,

42:44.440 --> 42:49.000
 as opposed to impacting people negatively at scale.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.440
 So being able to access those different parts of oneself

42:51.440 --> 42:54.120
 is key and you've been willing to step into that.

42:54.120 --> 42:57.480
 My podcast is not one in which we get down to those matters.

42:57.480 --> 42:59.120
 Yet, yet.

42:59.120 --> 43:00.560
 You never know, we might do an episode

43:00.560 --> 43:02.840
 on narcissism and sociopathy.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.960
 The other thing that I took away from a conversation

43:04.960 --> 43:08.480
 with a friend, he was a lot of years in special operations

43:08.480 --> 43:09.520
 in the intelligence community.

43:09.520 --> 43:13.280
 He said, if you look at somebody's past,

43:13.280 --> 43:16.280
 at some point you will come to understand

43:16.280 --> 43:19.520
 some pretty good reasons as to why they became who they are,

43:19.520 --> 43:21.720
 but you have to draw the, his words,

43:21.720 --> 43:23.320
 the red line someplace.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.040
 And what he was referring to was the fact

43:25.040 --> 43:26.920
 that certain people, at least in the eyes

43:26.920 --> 43:30.240
 of certain communities deserve to be eliminated

43:30.240 --> 43:33.200
 as a consequence of their actions, right?

43:33.200 --> 43:35.160
 Regardless of what drove them to those actions.

43:35.160 --> 43:36.800
 So it gets right down to the line

43:36.800 --> 43:40.800
 between nature, nurture, neuroscience,

43:40.800 --> 43:43.880
 and the law and justice.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.720
 Complicated, complicated themes.

43:45.720 --> 43:47.040
 I can think of a number of people

43:47.040 --> 43:49.240
 that I would love to hear you interview.

43:49.240 --> 43:51.920
 And here I'm not revealing the reasons why,

43:51.920 --> 43:53.520
 but except for the fact that I think

43:53.520 --> 43:56.040
 you would be uniquely suited to bring out

43:56.040 --> 43:58.480
 the important components of the conversation

43:58.480 --> 44:02.600
 that other people have not been able to do,

44:02.600 --> 44:04.840
 which for instance, Liz Holmes,

44:04.840 --> 44:08.520
 this is one of the most mysterious

44:08.520 --> 44:11.520
 and yet disliked people on the planet.

44:13.640 --> 44:15.640
 She's sort of synonymous with deception.

44:17.280 --> 44:20.200
 I don't know if there've been any real interviews

44:20.200 --> 44:22.920
 of her since the whole thing.

44:22.920 --> 44:23.920
 I haven't followed that case.

44:23.920 --> 44:27.240
 I listened to the book and I followed it a little bit

44:27.240 --> 44:29.400
 because it was happening in my hometown, right?

44:29.400 --> 44:31.000
 Theranos was right up the road.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.280
 The building's still there.

44:32.280 --> 44:33.120
 It's interesting.

44:33.120 --> 44:34.600
 It's some of the most premier real estate

44:34.600 --> 44:36.920
 in Silicon Valley, but nobody wants it.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.480
 It's sort of like, it's very hard to sell a home

44:38.480 --> 44:41.080
 where somebody committed suicide or committed a murder,

44:41.080 --> 44:42.560
 even if it's a beautiful home.

44:42.560 --> 44:46.040
 It sort of feel like the Theranos building is that building.

44:46.040 --> 44:48.520
 So that would be a really interesting interview.

44:48.520 --> 44:50.560
 I would love to hear that interview.

44:50.560 --> 44:55.560
 One of the most interesting dark human beings in science.

44:55.760 --> 44:58.600
 Yeah, and then there'll even be people that say,

44:58.600 --> 44:59.720
 was it even science, right?

44:59.720 --> 45:01.120
 It might've all been deception.

45:01.120 --> 45:02.360
 It might've been one part deception,

45:02.360 --> 45:05.520
 one part goal setting mixed in with,

45:05.520 --> 45:08.580
 clearly that there were so many factors

45:08.580 --> 45:10.760
 impacting what happened.

45:10.760 --> 45:15.000
 I think the big difference between Theranos and that story

45:15.000 --> 45:17.520
 and some of the other stories about Silicon Valley

45:17.520 --> 45:19.900
 where people promised a lot more than they could deliver

45:19.900 --> 45:22.720
 is they were promising things that were directly related

45:22.720 --> 45:23.720
 to health and healthcare.

45:23.720 --> 45:26.960
 People were taking blood tests with the understanding

45:26.960 --> 45:29.280
 that the data they were getting was important,

45:29.280 --> 45:31.200
 information about sexually transmitted diseases

45:31.200 --> 45:33.400
 and other diseases and making real world decisions

45:33.400 --> 45:34.480
 on the basis of that.

45:34.480 --> 45:37.240
 Whereas if you remember when the iPhone first came out

45:37.240 --> 45:38.760
 and Steve Jobs was still alive

45:38.760 --> 45:40.600
 and the phones were dropping calls

45:40.600 --> 45:41.940
 if you held it in a particular way.

45:41.940 --> 45:43.480
 And his response was a little flip.

45:43.480 --> 45:45.920
 He said, hey folks, it's a phone

45:45.920 --> 45:47.720
 as if like don't get so worked up.

45:47.720 --> 45:51.040
 But people held them understandably to a very high standard.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.080
 She sort of, it seemed, and I don't know,

45:54.080 --> 45:55.360
 cause I certainly wasn't there,

45:55.360 --> 45:57.820
 seemed like she sort of adopted this idea

45:57.820 --> 45:59.360
 that you could get it wrong a bunch of times

45:59.360 --> 46:00.960
 before you get it right.

46:00.960 --> 46:02.720
 Except if the allegations are true.

46:02.720 --> 46:05.760
 And I think she was found guilty, I believe,

46:05.760 --> 46:07.120
 on a number of counts.

46:07.120 --> 46:09.080
 That a number of the things that they were doing

46:09.080 --> 46:11.880
 were impacting real world decision making.

46:11.880 --> 46:14.560
 So Steve's point about the phone, it's just a phone.

46:14.560 --> 46:15.400
 Well, it depends on the call.

46:15.400 --> 46:18.460
 If you're calling 911, then it's not just a phone, right?

46:19.360 --> 46:22.160
 But in the case of blood tests and disease,

46:22.160 --> 46:23.000
 that's serious.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.960
 I think that the Theranos case was super interesting to me

46:24.960 --> 46:27.600
 because of the number of people from major universities

46:27.600 --> 46:31.400
 and from government that both trusted her

46:31.400 --> 46:34.360
 and the number of people who did not trust her

46:34.360 --> 46:37.320
 and yet either didn't speak up or no one listened to them.

46:37.320 --> 46:39.700
 It was only in the forensic version of it

46:39.700 --> 46:42.440
 that everyone said, oh yeah, I knew that she was lying,

46:42.440 --> 46:43.280
 et cetera, et cetera.

46:43.280 --> 46:45.320
 They were lying to multiple people involved

46:45.320 --> 46:46.680
 in those lies apparently.

46:46.680 --> 46:49.120
 But I have a deep interest in the neuroscience

46:49.120 --> 46:51.520
 of narcissism, sociopathy,

46:51.520 --> 46:54.000
 and some of the darker aspects of the mind.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.480
 So yeah, maybe someday.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.080
 Maybe we'll do a podcast together.

46:57.080 --> 47:00.400
 I mean, like in the kind of early 90s version of talk shows

47:00.400 --> 47:02.680
 where we darken the lights and we do it together,

47:02.680 --> 47:03.520
 you can use your voice

47:03.520 --> 47:06.840
 because your voice is much more sinister sounding than mine.

47:06.840 --> 47:07.940
 Good cop, bad cop.

47:08.800 --> 47:11.440
 Well, it'd be interesting from a scientific perspective

47:11.440 --> 47:15.740
 of somebody who is a sociopath or a psychopath,

47:16.780 --> 47:20.200
 how to reveal something real about them.

47:20.200 --> 47:24.480
 I think that requires not just,

47:24.480 --> 47:26.520
 well, I don't know what that requires.

47:26.520 --> 47:27.920
 That requires the same skill

47:27.920 --> 47:31.620
 that it takes to be a good therapist.

47:31.620 --> 47:35.140
 Right, and some therapists won't work with sociopaths

47:35.140 --> 47:38.420
 because they don't feel any progress can be made.

47:38.420 --> 47:40.400
 Some therapists will work with sociopaths

47:40.400 --> 47:41.960
 because for the wealthy ones,

47:41.960 --> 47:44.900
 they often, they want their money.

47:44.900 --> 47:47.360
 I think most therapists are good and benevolent,

47:47.360 --> 47:48.320
 but there's some that will do it

47:48.320 --> 47:50.480
 just the same way lawyers will work with criminals

47:50.480 --> 47:52.120
 knowing they're criminals, right?

47:53.440 --> 47:55.320
 Oftentimes because they're criminals.

47:55.320 --> 47:57.000
 There are certain domains of psychiatry

47:57.000 --> 47:59.760
 that are more tractable than others, right?

47:59.760 --> 48:00.720
 Borderlines are interesting.

48:00.720 --> 48:01.560
 I should just mention

48:01.560 --> 48:03.860
 because they have this phenomenon of splitting.

48:03.860 --> 48:05.740
 So in the world of psychology,

48:05.740 --> 48:09.960
 the idea is that being neurotic is actually the goal.

48:09.960 --> 48:12.360
 The idea that you could be, you know,

48:12.360 --> 48:15.100
 feel something and then work a lot to overcome it

48:15.100 --> 48:18.760
 or have some sort of defense mechanism in place,

48:18.760 --> 48:20.340
 but that's not destructive.

48:20.340 --> 48:22.560
 That's actually a pretty healthy state to be in.

48:22.560 --> 48:25.380
 It's provided it's not destructive.

48:25.380 --> 48:29.800
 Psychotic is truly delusional thinking about reality.

48:29.800 --> 48:31.980
 And the idea is that borderlines split,

48:33.120 --> 48:37.340
 intermittently split between psychotic and neurotic.

48:37.340 --> 48:38.180
 That's why it was called,

48:38.180 --> 48:41.000
 there's beautiful work by Melanie Klein that describes this,

48:41.000 --> 48:42.980
 which I'm just now kind of delving into.

48:42.980 --> 48:46.020
 But, you know, so the borderline is the person who is like,

48:46.020 --> 48:47.520
 I love you, I love you, I love you,

48:47.520 --> 48:49.720
 and then truly feels as if they hate you

48:49.720 --> 48:51.320
 and you become the bad object.

48:51.320 --> 48:54.580
 So borderlines are challenging for psychologists

48:54.580 --> 48:56.460
 because of the splitting, right?

48:57.500 --> 48:58.780
 Schizophrenics are challenging

48:58.780 --> 49:02.940
 because of the detachment from reality.

49:02.940 --> 49:05.120
 And narcissists are challenging

49:05.120 --> 49:07.620
 because they're often so charming

49:07.620 --> 49:10.060
 that even the therapists are charmed.

49:10.060 --> 49:12.280
 I believe you mentioned Karl Deisseroth.

49:12.280 --> 49:13.120
 We'll talk about him.

49:13.120 --> 49:14.460
 He was definitely not a narcissist.

49:14.460 --> 49:16.420
 He's one of the more humble people, but he is brilliant.

49:16.420 --> 49:17.900
 Thanks again to you.

49:17.900 --> 49:19.420
 You've connected us.

49:19.420 --> 49:22.820
 I had the pleasure of having a conversation with him.

49:22.820 --> 49:23.900
 You had a conversation with him.

49:23.900 --> 49:25.660
 I really enjoyed it on the podcast.

49:25.660 --> 49:29.740
 You guys come from the same science, from the same place,

49:29.740 --> 49:31.500
 maybe different journeys, fascinating.

49:31.500 --> 49:32.340
 And levels.

49:32.340 --> 49:33.940
 We were postdocs together.

49:33.940 --> 49:37.860
 Karl is truly the Michael Jordan, the Wayne Gretzky,

49:37.860 --> 49:40.420
 five children, amazing marriage to it.

49:40.420 --> 49:41.940
 Also an amazing scientist.

49:41.940 --> 49:42.940
 His wife, Michelle Monge,

49:42.940 --> 49:44.940
 is in our neurology department at Stanford.

49:44.940 --> 49:49.940
 An incredible thinker, writer, very kind person, humble.

49:51.500 --> 49:52.740
 Speaking of getting into state,

49:52.740 --> 49:54.300
 sorry, Karl, I'm gonna out you on this,

49:54.300 --> 49:58.340
 but Karl, despite being at the highest levels

49:58.340 --> 50:01.420
 of science and engineering and a practicing psychiatrist,

50:02.300 --> 50:06.200
 his office is literally a coat closet

50:06.200 --> 50:07.900
 with a small table lamp.

50:07.900 --> 50:10.220
 When you meet with Karl, if you manage to meet with him,

50:10.220 --> 50:12.300
 because he's very hard to get to,

50:12.300 --> 50:13.700
 you walk in, you sit down

50:13.700 --> 50:15.700
 as if you're going through some interrogation

50:15.700 --> 50:18.100
 and some spy novel.

50:18.100 --> 50:22.100
 And he'll ask you, what are you most excited about lately?

50:22.100 --> 50:23.980
 And I've got 11 minutes or something.

50:23.980 --> 50:27.040
 And that's a meeting with Karl, because he's that busy.

50:27.040 --> 50:29.300
 But he doesn't have the office with the pictures of the kids

50:29.300 --> 50:30.800
 and the thing and all that.

50:30.800 --> 50:32.540
 All that is kept elsewhere.

50:32.540 --> 50:34.420
 So in order to get, I asked him

50:34.420 --> 50:36.020
 why he work in this office, right?

50:36.020 --> 50:38.060
 You work on light and channels of light,

50:38.060 --> 50:39.820
 things related to light of all things.

50:39.820 --> 50:40.740
 Here you are in this dark room.

50:40.740 --> 50:41.940
 And he said, well, this is what gets me

50:41.940 --> 50:44.260
 into the state of mind to be able to do what I want to do.

50:44.260 --> 50:48.860
 Very Rick Rubin ish, not at all the same person,

50:48.860 --> 50:50.600
 but very similar in that he's figured out

50:50.600 --> 50:52.380
 the physical space he needs in order to get

50:52.380 --> 50:54.540
 into the optimal state to do the work he needs to do

50:54.540 --> 50:55.460
 in this lifetime.

50:55.460 --> 50:57.460
 And it's very unusual, right?

50:57.460 --> 50:59.340
 If I don't have a window, I kind of freak out.

50:59.340 --> 51:00.540
 I can do it here for a while.

51:00.540 --> 51:03.960
 We're in this black cube here, floating in space, of course.

51:05.380 --> 51:08.900
 But I find that amazing that these people

51:08.900 --> 51:10.820
 that are operating in this super high level

51:10.820 --> 51:12.580
 are willing to actually deprive themselves

51:12.580 --> 51:14.040
 of a lot of conditions.

51:14.040 --> 51:16.580
 They're not sitting there with the secretary coming in

51:16.580 --> 51:19.100
 offering them espresso every five minutes and things that,

51:19.100 --> 51:21.940
 no, no, no, that's New York Neuroscience.

51:21.940 --> 51:23.980
 The New York Neuroscience Mafia is kind of famous

51:23.980 --> 51:28.160
 for having all the tickets to the opera and this and that.

51:28.160 --> 51:30.180
 And they enjoy lifestyle a lot.

51:30.180 --> 51:31.500
 The New York Neuroscience Mafia.

51:31.500 --> 51:32.980
 Oh, there is one, there definitely is one.

51:32.980 --> 51:34.380
 They know who they are.

51:34.380 --> 51:35.220
 They know who they are.

51:35.220 --> 51:38.940
 People don't know, Andrew Huberman is from the West Coast

51:38.940 --> 51:41.620
 and now he's just starting wars with the Neuroscience Mafia.

51:41.620 --> 51:42.660
 Well, they do amazing science.

51:42.660 --> 51:45.520
 They think, they love their lifestyle and that's wonderful,

51:45.520 --> 51:47.120
 but the culture is very different.

51:48.380 --> 51:50.560
 Carl and I think Silicon Valley in general

51:50.560 --> 51:55.300
 kind of prides itself on this kind of monk like assesism,

51:55.300 --> 51:56.140
 right?

51:56.140 --> 51:57.820
 But at the individual scale,

51:57.820 --> 51:59.700
 be deliberate about controlling the environment.

51:59.700 --> 52:01.860
 I think about that with the conversations too.

52:01.860 --> 52:04.160
 I haven't been deliberate about that either

52:04.160 --> 52:07.460
 in terms of controlling the space you're in.

52:07.460 --> 52:10.680
 Visually, yes, black curtains, all those kinds of things.

52:10.680 --> 52:13.820
 There is nothing like the Lex Friedman podcast studio.

52:14.820 --> 52:17.180
 First of all, when you do them remotely,

52:17.180 --> 52:20.620
 I always feel like I'm in a witness relocation program.

52:20.620 --> 52:23.140
 You only get the coordinates at the last moment

52:23.140 --> 52:26.260
 and you always get the sense that there are people

52:26.260 --> 52:30.140
 behind the walls that are recording things.

52:30.140 --> 52:32.620
 Well, there's something about creating a feeling.

52:32.620 --> 52:34.460
 I have a sense that there's a robot over there.

52:34.460 --> 52:36.580
 There's several throughout this place.

52:36.580 --> 52:41.500
 And I think part of that,

52:42.860 --> 52:46.220
 part of creating a feeling would be having the robots

52:46.220 --> 52:49.960
 constantly moving around and having a mind of their own

52:49.960 --> 52:54.660
 because that would most closely put guests

52:54.660 --> 52:58.080
 and other humans that I interact with into a place

52:58.080 --> 53:01.460
 that's closest to my mind

53:01.460 --> 53:03.940
 because it's such an engineering mind

53:03.940 --> 53:06.500
 and one where when things come to life,

53:06.500 --> 53:08.460
 it's a beautiful place to be.

53:08.460 --> 53:10.700
 And whatever that is, that could be like art,

53:10.700 --> 53:12.620
 but to me, robots are art.

53:12.620 --> 53:17.300
 And so I'm thinking about that both for me and for guests.

53:17.300 --> 53:19.900
 And I'm also thinking about the difficult guests

53:19.900 --> 53:22.540
 just to return to, you said, Elizabeth Holmes.

53:22.540 --> 53:26.460
 One person, maybe a couple of things I want to say.

53:26.460 --> 53:31.660
 One person I think I would like to talk to is

53:32.800 --> 53:34.300
 Ghislaine Maxwell.

53:34.300 --> 53:36.380
 I always get afraid right before you reveal

53:36.380 --> 53:37.220
 these kinds of things.

53:37.220 --> 53:39.020
 And now I know why I get afraid.

53:39.020 --> 53:42.220
 Yeah, I mean, again, assuming that she did the things

53:42.220 --> 53:45.900
 that people claim she did, they're despicable, right?

53:45.900 --> 53:48.020
 I mean, these were underage children, right?

53:48.020 --> 53:50.500
 There's just no version of the story

53:50.500 --> 53:54.580
 where she did the things she was accused of doing

53:54.580 --> 53:56.600
 and is still a quote unquote good person.

53:56.600 --> 53:58.400
 There's just, in my mind, right?

53:59.260 --> 54:01.780
 And yet I think there is tremendous interest

54:01.780 --> 54:05.980
 in understanding like what led her to do all that.

54:05.980 --> 54:07.300
 So at least for some people.

54:07.300 --> 54:08.180
 Let me say a couple of things.

54:08.180 --> 54:13.180
 So one is at a high level, let me say that she believes

54:14.860 --> 54:18.900
 or her current story is that she's the victim.

54:18.900 --> 54:20.060
 Of who?

54:20.060 --> 54:21.020
 Jeffrey Epstein.

54:21.020 --> 54:21.860
 Oh my.

54:23.160 --> 54:26.780
 I think I'll just leave that there as is.

54:26.780 --> 54:29.920
 So these are ideas that you're facing.

54:31.380 --> 54:34.700
 The nature of truth and the nature of the human mind

54:34.700 --> 54:38.940
 is what it is and this is, imagine folks,

54:38.940 --> 54:43.060
 if you went into a room with a person that says that,

54:43.060 --> 54:44.240
 what do you do next?

54:45.200 --> 54:50.200
 Let me also say that I never or rarely,

54:51.100 --> 54:54.500
 let me say not say never, I rarely mention names

54:54.500 --> 54:57.240
 that I'm interested in talking to

54:57.240 --> 55:00.880
 without having made significant progress

55:00.880 --> 55:03.180
 in already securing that interview.

55:03.180 --> 55:07.640
 So people sometimes ask me about Vladimir Zelensky

55:07.640 --> 55:09.700
 and Vladimir Putin.

55:09.700 --> 55:14.700
 I do not bring them up lightly in terms of their being

55:15.800 --> 55:17.220
 a path to an actual conversation.

55:17.220 --> 55:20.140
 That said, something I regret but I'm not sure

55:20.140 --> 55:23.740
 I know what to do with it.

55:23.740 --> 55:27.380
 But in the case of all the people I just mentioned,

55:27.380 --> 55:30.540
 I haven't been preparing for those conversations.

55:30.540 --> 55:35.100
 I only start really preparing seriously

55:35.100 --> 55:40.100
 when it's confirmed because it's such a heavy burden.

55:40.340 --> 55:44.300
 And one of the things I regret in having mentioned

55:44.300 --> 55:47.260
 a conversation with Vladimir Putin

55:47.260 --> 55:51.220
 before the war in Ukraine broke out in the past few years

55:51.220 --> 55:55.780
 is that I would mention it very loosely, very casually.

55:55.780 --> 56:00.780
 And without having really deeply put myself into a place

56:01.380 --> 56:02.940
 that I'm ready to talk to him.

56:02.940 --> 56:07.460
 And that's a tricky thing because then the internet,

56:08.500 --> 56:11.640
 the audience in general, and just me,

56:11.640 --> 56:14.380
 when I listen back to my dumb self,

56:14.380 --> 56:16.280
 think, well, why are you speaking so lightly

56:16.280 --> 56:17.740
 about these topics?

56:17.740 --> 56:19.540
 Well, I know you've had a longstanding interest

56:19.540 --> 56:21.620
 in talking to him.

56:21.620 --> 56:25.860
 I think now, well, I don't understand

56:27.120 --> 56:31.200
 how I would sit down and have a conversation

56:31.200 --> 56:32.140
 with somebody like that,

56:32.140 --> 56:36.380
 but that's not in the range of my skill sets.

56:36.380 --> 56:39.940
 Or like maybe not in the range of things

56:39.940 --> 56:41.980
 that you're drawn to somehow.

56:41.980 --> 56:42.820
 Not so much.

56:42.820 --> 56:46.240
 I mean, I would watch that episode with great interest.

56:47.380 --> 56:49.700
 Well, you did an episode recently with this guy

56:49.700 --> 56:53.940
 who was a former cyber criminal turned state side, right?

56:53.940 --> 56:55.220
 I think he works for the government now.

56:55.220 --> 56:57.360
 And there was a segment in there.

56:57.360 --> 56:58.200
 Remind me his name?

56:58.200 --> 56:59.040
 Brett Johnson.

56:59.040 --> 56:59.860
 Brett Johnson.

56:59.860 --> 57:02.260
 There was a segment in there where he talked about

57:02.260 --> 57:06.140
 stealing a lifetime's worth of collected coins

57:06.140 --> 57:08.780
 from some elderly woman.

57:08.780 --> 57:10.220
 And this was everything she had.

57:10.220 --> 57:15.220
 And then he openly admitted that he felt no remorse,

57:15.660 --> 57:18.540
 which is the way he described is purely sociopathic.

57:18.540 --> 57:20.660
 And then of course we learned that he grew up in a family

57:20.660 --> 57:23.140
 where criminal behavior was very common.

57:23.140 --> 57:25.820
 It was kind of embedded into his notions

57:25.820 --> 57:27.700
 of what typical behaviors were.

57:27.700 --> 57:30.580
 And I found myself somewhat conflicted,

57:30.580 --> 57:33.540
 but also hung up on this idea that,

57:33.540 --> 57:37.500
 I mean, he had behaved as a sociopath

57:38.420 --> 57:39.960
 or in a sociopathic way.

57:39.960 --> 57:42.580
 And it created an internal conflict

57:42.580 --> 57:44.020
 because he's quite charming guest

57:44.020 --> 57:45.860
 and his stories are terrific.

57:45.860 --> 57:49.180
 Especially I really enjoyed his discussions

57:49.180 --> 57:52.740
 about how he would go out and do all these things

57:52.740 --> 57:56.460
 out of a desire to please his girlfriend.

57:56.460 --> 57:58.280
 So he was in service to other people,

57:58.280 --> 57:59.420
 despite being sociopathic,

57:59.420 --> 58:01.780
 he could say he was in service to them as a way to extract.

58:01.780 --> 58:03.260
 Gets very complicated.

58:03.260 --> 58:05.140
 I think is the reason I went into science

58:05.140 --> 58:07.340
 is that at some level,

58:07.340 --> 58:10.500
 it's more about facts than it is opinions and judgments.

58:10.500 --> 58:12.100
 And I don't know that I have the ability

58:12.100 --> 58:16.540
 to suspend judgment away from the kind of

58:16.540 --> 58:19.460
 top level contours of my initial reaction to like,

58:20.300 --> 58:22.420
 if it's true, like the Ghislaine Maxwell's

58:22.420 --> 58:25.340
 and the Liz Holmes and the other sociopaths

58:25.340 --> 58:28.220
 is one of just kind of revulsion and repulsion.

58:28.220 --> 58:29.740
 But that could also reflect the fact

58:29.740 --> 58:33.660
 that I'm not as neurologically sophisticated

58:33.660 --> 58:38.660
 as somebody that can spin all the plates of empathy,

58:38.660 --> 58:43.660
 forgiveness, but also holding people accountable

58:44.140 --> 58:44.980
 at the same time.

58:44.980 --> 58:45.820
 That's work.

58:45.820 --> 58:46.820
 That takes, if you think about it,

58:46.820 --> 58:50.700
 that's three four brain circuits having to work in parallel.

58:50.700 --> 58:52.700
 That's the difference between chess or a game of go

58:52.700 --> 58:53.540
 and a game of checkers.

58:53.540 --> 58:56.020
 I guess I'm playing checkers and you're playing chess.

58:56.020 --> 58:58.500
 No, so one is actually holding in your mind

58:58.500 --> 59:01.160
 and two is the raw skill of conversation.

59:01.160 --> 59:04.020
 You're very, just having listened to your interviews,

59:04.020 --> 59:05.620
 you're very good at conversation,

59:05.620 --> 59:08.940
 but the skill of conversation is really tricky.

59:08.940 --> 59:10.300
 I'm not being self deprecating.

59:10.300 --> 59:12.060
 I'm being just objective.

59:12.060 --> 59:15.540
 I'm not good at conversation.

59:15.540 --> 59:18.780
 I'm working very hard, getting better at it.

59:18.780 --> 59:22.660
 I'm speaking not about just podcasting.

59:22.660 --> 59:25.380
 I'm speaking just normal life.

59:25.380 --> 59:30.260
 I have anxiety from social interaction.

59:30.260 --> 59:31.100
 I...

59:31.100 --> 59:31.940
 Do you really?

59:31.940 --> 59:33.060
 A huge amount, yeah, yeah.

59:33.060 --> 59:37.260
 So this is interesting because I never detect that in you.

59:37.260 --> 59:38.100
 Ever.

59:38.100 --> 59:40.660
 And I think there are people that we both know

59:40.660 --> 59:45.180
 that have said to me that they too feel anxious

59:45.180 --> 59:49.500
 and yet your voice is steady.

59:49.500 --> 59:51.460
 I don't see any perspiration.

59:51.460 --> 59:52.740
 Oh yeah.

59:52.740 --> 59:54.060
 You appear incredibly calm.

59:54.060 --> 59:55.380
 I'm scared shitless.

59:55.380 --> 59:57.500
 I was scared shitless with Rick Rubin.

59:57.500 --> 1:00:00.940
 Rick Rubin is, when you first meet him,

1:00:00.940 --> 1:00:03.300
 is intimidatingly calm.

1:00:03.300 --> 1:00:04.540
 But as you get to know him a bit,

1:00:04.540 --> 1:00:07.340
 you realize that the kindness

1:00:07.340 --> 1:00:09.740
 and the generosity that you sense is real.

1:00:11.420 --> 1:00:14.660
 But yeah, I would never in a million years

1:00:14.660 --> 1:00:16.740
 have guessed that you get anxious in conversation.

1:00:16.740 --> 1:00:19.100
 Can I just make another quick comment?

1:00:19.100 --> 1:00:22.380
 This may come off entertaining to you, Andrew.

1:00:22.380 --> 1:00:24.260
 Maybe you've already gotten the same.

1:00:24.260 --> 1:00:31.260
 But having mentioned Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Zelensky,

1:00:31.260 --> 1:00:37.260
 Ghislaine Maxwell, there is a natural question.

1:00:37.260 --> 1:00:43.260
 How does Lex have access to these people?

1:00:43.260 --> 1:00:45.540
 Who does he work for?

1:00:45.540 --> 1:00:48.060
 Like how does he...

1:00:48.060 --> 1:00:49.420
 Or who works for him.

1:00:49.420 --> 1:00:50.580
 Who works for him.

1:00:50.580 --> 1:00:51.420
 Right.

1:00:51.420 --> 1:00:52.940
 What does he have on others?

1:00:52.940 --> 1:00:55.780
 This, I'm actually, I ask myself,

1:00:55.780 --> 1:00:57.820
 when I look in the mirror,

1:00:57.820 --> 1:01:01.980
 just somebody who kind of enjoys conspiracy theories,

1:01:01.980 --> 1:01:03.300
 I want to ask the same question.

1:01:03.300 --> 1:01:05.500
 Like, well, I usually ask in the following way,

1:01:05.500 --> 1:01:07.220
 like, how the fuck am I so lucky?

1:01:07.220 --> 1:01:11.100
 Like, who am I being, am I a robot

1:01:11.100 --> 1:01:12.540
 being controlled by somebody else?

1:01:12.540 --> 1:01:16.340
 Or like, how is this my life right now?

1:01:16.340 --> 1:01:17.180
 What is happening?

1:01:17.180 --> 1:01:18.780
 It really does feel like a simulation.

1:01:18.780 --> 1:01:22.060
 So let me just speak to several things.

1:01:22.060 --> 1:01:25.300
 First of all, I have no boss.

1:01:25.300 --> 1:01:29.180
 I know of nor am I controlled

1:01:29.180 --> 1:01:32.460
 by any intelligence agencies of any nation.

1:01:32.460 --> 1:01:34.940
 We're going to get you a dog, Lex.

1:01:34.940 --> 1:01:37.140
 So that I could talk to.

1:01:37.140 --> 1:01:38.420
 I'm scared of getting a dog

1:01:38.420 --> 1:01:41.580
 because I would fall in love so deeply, I think.

1:01:41.580 --> 1:01:43.700
 Next time I'm bringing a puppy.

1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:44.540
 I'm just going to bring a puppy

1:01:44.540 --> 1:01:46.900
 and I'm going to leave it here.

1:01:46.900 --> 1:01:48.540
 And then you'll never see me again.

1:01:48.540 --> 1:01:50.300
 I mean, I love dogs so much.

1:01:50.300 --> 1:01:54.420
 But I was also surprised and maybe,

1:01:55.740 --> 1:02:00.540
 I have never talked to an intelligence agency,

1:02:00.540 --> 1:02:02.380
 which is very interesting to me.

1:02:02.380 --> 1:02:03.500
 Like, I haven't.

1:02:03.500 --> 1:02:05.060
 That you're aware of.

1:02:05.060 --> 1:02:07.780
 Cause they're very good at communicating.

1:02:07.780 --> 1:02:08.620
 Right.

1:02:08.620 --> 1:02:10.980
 But I've been very suspicious on this exact point.

1:02:10.980 --> 1:02:15.500
 That's the downside of kind of being an introvert,

1:02:15.500 --> 1:02:17.460
 having anxiety about social interaction,

1:02:17.460 --> 1:02:20.180
 but then having so much love thrown your way

1:02:20.180 --> 1:02:21.860
 because we connect over podcasts.

1:02:21.860 --> 1:02:24.540
 Podcasts have a powerful way of connecting people.

1:02:24.540 --> 1:02:28.220
 So people come with you with love that I really love.

1:02:28.220 --> 1:02:32.220
 I appreciate, but I wonder like exactly this question,

1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:37.220
 like why is this person with a Russian accent talking to me

1:02:37.380 --> 1:02:39.180
 and showing me so much love?

1:02:39.180 --> 1:02:41.100
 Well, because, sorry to interrupt you again,

1:02:41.100 --> 1:02:42.820
 but it's what we do.

1:02:44.100 --> 1:02:46.340
 And it's a sign of interest, by the way, too.

1:02:46.340 --> 1:02:47.620
 Sometimes. Sometimes.

1:02:47.620 --> 1:02:49.020
 Yeah, I have a colleague at Stanford

1:02:49.020 --> 1:02:53.260
 and she said, you know, interruption 75% of the time

1:02:53.260 --> 1:02:55.740
 is a sign of real interest in what the person is saying,

1:02:55.740 --> 1:02:56.660
 if nothing else.

1:02:57.540 --> 1:03:00.740
 Well, you're very lovable.

1:03:00.740 --> 1:03:01.660
 Well, that, that, but,

1:03:01.660 --> 1:03:04.460
 I mean, I learned about a hedgehog in the fog from you.

1:03:04.460 --> 1:03:05.300
 Yeah.

1:03:05.300 --> 1:03:07.940
 You know, when I learned, you know, you're very lovable.

1:03:07.940 --> 1:03:09.700
 People love you because you're lovable.

1:03:09.700 --> 1:03:10.540
 I love, love.

1:03:10.540 --> 1:03:12.460
 Okay. So 100%.

1:03:12.460 --> 1:03:14.780
 And it's, I mean, especially here in Austin, Texas,

1:03:14.780 --> 1:03:17.060
 people are so, so amazing.

1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:19.780
 I go just hugs and just, ah, I love people.

1:03:19.780 --> 1:03:20.740
 Do you want a family?

1:03:20.740 --> 1:03:21.580
 Or are you eventually?

1:03:21.580 --> 1:03:22.420
 100%.

1:03:22.420 --> 1:03:25.220
 I mean, you're, I take what you said as a challenge

1:03:26.140 --> 1:03:28.860
 in terms of having a family with kids

1:03:28.860 --> 1:03:32.220
 and they do jiu jitsu and obviously defeat you

1:03:32.220 --> 1:03:37.220
 and make you miserable for your failures as a father

1:03:37.220 --> 1:03:38.220
 because you couldn't.

1:03:39.540 --> 1:03:40.900
 But you're gonna be a great dad.

1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:43.060
 Build up an army of good jiu jitsu people.

1:03:43.060 --> 1:03:44.820
 But yes, I would love a family.

1:03:44.820 --> 1:03:47.100
 I would love to have children.

1:03:47.100 --> 1:03:49.580
 But I just want to finish that point

1:03:49.580 --> 1:03:50.580
 because I'm nervous about it.

1:03:50.580 --> 1:03:52.780
 I'm nervous about the way people perceive.

1:03:52.780 --> 1:03:54.940
 What you're seeing is a Forrest Gump type character.

1:03:54.940 --> 1:03:58.100
 Like what, who I am, I seem to be,

1:03:58.100 --> 1:04:00.700
 and this is how like the world seems to work,

1:04:00.700 --> 1:04:03.420
 is you just try, you try to be yourself.

1:04:03.420 --> 1:04:05.540
 Like you try to find yourself.

1:04:05.540 --> 1:04:07.220
 That's maybe the better way to say it.

1:04:07.220 --> 1:04:09.420
 And just be that.

1:04:10.740 --> 1:04:12.620
 Be kind to people.

1:04:12.620 --> 1:04:14.580
 Work your ass off.

1:04:14.580 --> 1:04:19.460
 And say F you to anybody that wants to control you

1:04:19.460 --> 1:04:21.460
 or to tell you what to do.

1:04:21.460 --> 1:04:22.700
 Just be free.

1:04:22.700 --> 1:04:24.500
 And then put love out there in the world.

1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:25.380
 And doors open.

1:04:25.380 --> 1:04:27.660
 This karma thing seems to work.

1:04:28.780 --> 1:04:32.820
 Like how the hell, my friends as you know,

1:04:32.820 --> 1:04:35.620
 how the hell did I get a chance to eat barbecue

1:04:35.620 --> 1:04:37.060
 with Rick Rubin, right?

1:04:37.060 --> 1:04:38.180
 Like doors.

1:04:38.180 --> 1:04:39.020
 You guys had a barbecue?

1:04:39.020 --> 1:04:40.380
 Yeah, I had barbecue.

1:04:40.380 --> 1:04:42.420
 He, right, of course I did.

1:04:42.420 --> 1:04:43.260
 He's from New York.

1:04:43.260 --> 1:04:46.900
 Any New Yorker that I know has very high standards for food

1:04:46.900 --> 1:04:49.300
 because bad restaurants don't last long in New York.

1:04:49.300 --> 1:04:50.780
 And barbecue counts as?

1:04:50.780 --> 1:04:51.620
 Oh yeah.

1:04:51.620 --> 1:04:52.860
 Oh yeah, Texas barbecue.

1:04:52.860 --> 1:04:56.780
 Well, you know, I would also add that you,

1:04:56.780 --> 1:04:57.900
 whether or not you realize it or not,

1:04:57.900 --> 1:04:59.460
 you took tremendous risk.

1:04:59.460 --> 1:05:01.260
 I mean, we come from the same original community,

1:05:01.260 --> 1:05:03.220
 which is academic science, right?

1:05:03.220 --> 1:05:07.620
 And to be at MIT and to start posting lectures online

1:05:07.620 --> 1:05:09.460
 is risky, right?

1:05:09.460 --> 1:05:12.700
 To, you know, I was third or fourth man in

1:05:12.700 --> 1:05:14.620
 in terms of podcasting as an academic.

1:05:14.620 --> 1:05:16.980
 Cause you had gone on Rogan many times,

1:05:16.980 --> 1:05:18.500
 David Sinclair had gone on there.

1:05:18.500 --> 1:05:22.580
 You know, especially before the pandemic,

1:05:22.580 --> 1:05:24.340
 you just didn't see many academics and scientists

1:05:24.340 --> 1:05:26.900
 talking in a public facing way.

1:05:26.900 --> 1:05:29.020
 So you took tremendous risk, right?

1:05:29.020 --> 1:05:30.180
 You took tremendous risk

1:05:30.180 --> 1:05:33.380
 always wearing that jacket and tie, right?

1:05:33.380 --> 1:05:35.020
 The only time I haven't seen you in that truly

1:05:35.020 --> 1:05:36.820
 is when we rolled jujitsu, which is,

1:05:36.820 --> 1:05:38.420
 and I hear I'm being generous to myself saying

1:05:38.420 --> 1:05:40.300
 I rolled jujitsu when basically you choked me out

1:05:40.300 --> 1:05:41.140
 in front of hundreds of people.

1:05:41.140 --> 1:05:41.980
 Thank you for doing that.

1:05:41.980 --> 1:05:44.700
 It was, it was great fun.

1:05:44.700 --> 1:05:45.780
 And I...

1:05:45.780 --> 1:05:46.700
 Thank you for doing that.

1:05:46.700 --> 1:05:48.620
 To have a beginner's mind is a beautiful thing.

1:05:48.620 --> 1:05:51.260
 I have admittedly, I have not been taking the classes,

1:05:51.260 --> 1:05:54.060
 but I'm going to, I truly am.

1:05:54.060 --> 1:05:56.620
 Especially there's a small chance I might find myself

1:05:56.620 --> 1:05:59.420
 in Austin a bit more often in the near future.

1:05:59.420 --> 1:06:00.380
 But the...

1:06:00.380 --> 1:06:01.620
 Well, if you're out in San Francisco,

1:06:01.620 --> 1:06:02.860
 you should train with Mark Zuckerberg.

1:06:02.860 --> 1:06:04.220
 He just started, so there you go.

1:06:04.220 --> 1:06:05.060
 Oh yeah?

1:06:05.060 --> 1:06:05.900
 You guys can...

1:06:05.900 --> 1:06:06.740
 Interesting.

1:06:07.940 --> 1:06:09.180
 Sure.

1:06:09.180 --> 1:06:10.540
 I mean, he's actually,

1:06:10.540 --> 1:06:12.380
 I mean, people listen to an episode,

1:06:12.380 --> 1:06:14.140
 perhaps he's a fascinating human being too.

1:06:14.140 --> 1:06:15.820
 I listened to it, it was great.

1:06:15.820 --> 1:06:19.740
 You took tremendous risk as an academic to do what you did.

1:06:19.740 --> 1:06:24.140
 So I do believe that when one takes intelligent risk,

1:06:24.140 --> 1:06:26.300
 because you can die or can crash your career,

1:06:26.300 --> 1:06:28.820
 you can do all sorts of self destructive

1:06:28.820 --> 1:06:31.180
 or destructive things when taking risks.

1:06:31.180 --> 1:06:33.460
 You took risks and they paid off, right?

1:06:33.460 --> 1:06:35.220
 And you take different risks at different stages,

1:06:35.220 --> 1:06:38.940
 but I don't throw around the word admiration lightly.

1:06:38.940 --> 1:06:41.500
 I mean, I admire that you were in this classroom at MIT.

1:06:41.500 --> 1:06:44.460
 You're like, I'm gonna film this and put it online.

1:06:44.460 --> 1:06:47.020
 One of your early interviews is with Ido Portal,

1:06:47.020 --> 1:06:49.140
 who's very hard to get to.

1:06:49.140 --> 1:06:50.820
 I've communicated with Ido a few times.

1:06:50.820 --> 1:06:51.740
 You should definitely talk to him.

1:06:51.740 --> 1:06:53.020
 I can't wait to talk to him.

1:06:53.020 --> 1:06:54.180
 I'm dying to talk to him.

1:06:54.180 --> 1:06:57.460
 I was supposed to do some course teaching with him

1:06:57.460 --> 1:06:58.740
 right before the pandemic hit,

1:06:58.740 --> 1:07:00.700
 and then it got canceled because he couldn't travel,

1:07:00.700 --> 1:07:02.980
 but getting to him is exceedingly challenging.

1:07:02.980 --> 1:07:06.380
 So you do have this incredible ability to get to people

1:07:06.380 --> 1:07:09.900
 and for them to trust you and know you.

1:07:09.900 --> 1:07:12.380
 And I think it's through your authenticity.

1:07:12.380 --> 1:07:15.060
 And I think it's the fact that you're willing to go places

1:07:15.060 --> 1:07:16.780
 where people haven't been before.

1:07:16.780 --> 1:07:19.540
 You know, this is, what's the saying about pioneers?

1:07:19.540 --> 1:07:20.860
 How do you spot the pioneers?

1:07:20.860 --> 1:07:23.060
 They're the people with the arrows in their backs.

1:07:23.060 --> 1:07:26.260
 You know, so that's the, you know, yeah.

1:07:26.260 --> 1:07:28.220
 And that's actually a quote that I lifted

1:07:28.220 --> 1:07:30.820
 from Terry Siknowski, who's a, you know.

1:07:30.820 --> 1:07:34.340
 You should talk to Terry.

1:07:34.340 --> 1:07:37.620
 He's a computational neuroscientist

1:07:37.620 --> 1:07:39.460
 down at the Salk Institute,

1:07:39.460 --> 1:07:40.820
 Howard Hughes investigator, et cetera.

1:07:40.820 --> 1:07:43.420
 But so, you know, taking risks

1:07:43.420 --> 1:07:48.300
 that other people have not taken is, that's a real thing.

1:07:48.300 --> 1:07:53.220
 And to do it with integrity and rigor, that's a real thing.

1:07:53.220 --> 1:07:55.180
 And so, yeah, I'm complimenting you

1:07:55.180 --> 1:07:57.980
 and I hope it lands and lands deeply.

1:07:57.980 --> 1:07:59.460
 But I also hope that people will hear that

1:07:59.460 --> 1:08:01.700
 and understand that it's one thing

1:08:01.700 --> 1:08:06.380
 to do what other people are already doing boldly.

1:08:06.380 --> 1:08:10.540
 It's a whole other thing to launch an entire art form

1:08:10.540 --> 1:08:12.860
 or venue and you did that.

1:08:12.860 --> 1:08:15.580
 And you didn't write a book, hopefully you will someday,

1:08:15.580 --> 1:08:16.540
 but you didn't go write a book.

1:08:16.540 --> 1:08:18.460
 A lot of academics have written books.

1:08:18.460 --> 1:08:19.940
 You went online.

1:08:19.940 --> 1:08:22.020
 Jordan Peterson, another controversial character.

1:08:22.020 --> 1:08:24.420
 He did it too, all those lectures that he filmed.

1:08:24.420 --> 1:08:26.060
 And then it's led to this other thing.

1:08:26.060 --> 1:08:30.180
 So, you know, there's karma.

1:08:30.180 --> 1:08:32.780
 And then there's also having the spine

1:08:32.780 --> 1:08:34.740
 to just put it all on the line

1:08:34.740 --> 1:08:38.860
 and do something for which there is no prior example

1:08:38.860 --> 1:08:43.020
 to hold onto while you go through those headwinds.

1:08:43.020 --> 1:08:44.100
 The really fascinating thing,

1:08:44.100 --> 1:08:46.500
 and actually a lot of people tell me about you,

1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:51.500
 Andrew Huberman, like the reach of a podcast

1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:53.020
 is really fascinating.

1:08:53.020 --> 1:08:56.100
 It's not the numbers of people listen.

1:08:56.100 --> 1:08:59.420
 I don't know if that's important at all.

1:08:59.420 --> 1:09:02.460
 Is what's important is like the depth of connection

1:09:02.460 --> 1:09:04.180
 you have with certain people.

1:09:04.180 --> 1:09:05.420
 It really moves them.

1:09:05.420 --> 1:09:08.540
 Like a great, and like they really get you.

1:09:08.540 --> 1:09:11.220
 So there's a lot of big Andrew Huberman fans

1:09:11.220 --> 1:09:12.620
 that really get you.

1:09:12.620 --> 1:09:13.940
 It's not just the science.

1:09:13.940 --> 1:09:15.860
 It's the stuff between the lines.

1:09:15.860 --> 1:09:16.900
 It's Costello.

1:09:16.900 --> 1:09:18.980
 It's the whole picture of a scientist

1:09:18.980 --> 1:09:22.100
 that finds beauty in biology and reveals it.

1:09:22.100 --> 1:09:23.300
 And they love you for it.

1:09:23.300 --> 1:09:28.220
 You know, because it was on television at the time,

1:09:28.220 --> 1:09:31.660
 I followed that Amanda Knox story pretty carefully.

1:09:31.660 --> 1:09:33.260
 And I don't watch television,

1:09:33.260 --> 1:09:34.740
 but whenever I would travel,

1:09:34.740 --> 1:09:37.140
 if there was a TV on the airplane,

1:09:37.140 --> 1:09:39.380
 I would find myself getting wrapped into things

1:09:39.380 --> 1:09:42.220
 like locked up abroad, you know, like,

1:09:42.220 --> 1:09:44.100
 and these things where they would make you terrified

1:09:44.100 --> 1:09:47.220
 to travel anywhere, let alone commit a crime overseas.

1:09:47.220 --> 1:09:49.540
 You know, the scenes of some of these prisons

1:09:49.540 --> 1:09:50.580
 are so dramatic.

1:09:50.580 --> 1:09:52.500
 And, you know, I mean, her case got a ton of interest.

1:09:52.500 --> 1:09:55.620
 And then I, you know, she went and then was a student

1:09:55.620 --> 1:09:57.220
 at the University of Washington

1:09:57.220 --> 1:09:59.660
 and has talked quite openly about, you know,

1:09:59.660 --> 1:10:02.620
 how she was treated and how people assume guilt

1:10:02.620 --> 1:10:04.140
 and, you know, and eventually, you know,

1:10:04.140 --> 1:10:05.940
 she was exonerated and, you know,

1:10:05.940 --> 1:10:08.460
 we can only go by what we know what the law determined,

1:10:08.460 --> 1:10:10.540
 but, you know, these are people that

1:10:11.420 --> 1:10:13.580
 the world is fascinated by.

1:10:13.580 --> 1:10:15.540
 I would, I'm guessing about a third of people

1:10:15.540 --> 1:10:18.220
 have already decided this person is despicable.

1:10:18.220 --> 1:10:20.540
 Why would you ever give them an audience?

1:10:20.540 --> 1:10:24.140
 About a third of people I think are open to,

1:10:24.140 --> 1:10:27.100
 or at least interested in learning more about them.

1:10:27.100 --> 1:10:29.180
 And then I think the remaining third,

1:10:29.180 --> 1:10:32.820
 kind of the third that the category that I put myself in,

1:10:32.820 --> 1:10:37.820
 which is what can I learn about people and myself,

1:10:37.940 --> 1:10:41.100
 even in my revulsion, right?

1:10:41.100 --> 1:10:42.540
 What can I learn?

1:10:42.540 --> 1:10:44.180
 Yeah, what can I learn about myself

1:10:44.180 --> 1:10:45.700
 from listening to this conversation

1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:48.220
 with somebody that I like to think,

1:10:48.220 --> 1:10:49.300
 I'm not talking about Amanda here,

1:10:49.300 --> 1:10:50.740
 I'm talking about the other people that you're talking about

1:10:50.740 --> 1:10:54.500
 that I don't, I can't relate to, right?

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:57.300
 Hearing conversations with and about people

1:10:57.300 --> 1:10:59.740
 that you cannot relate to is informative.

1:10:59.740 --> 1:11:03.660
 Otherwise, your whole mind literally becomes insular.

1:11:03.660 --> 1:11:06.260
 Well, there's an interesting thing I also had to,

1:11:07.260 --> 1:11:09.620
 ever since the war in Ukraine broke out,

1:11:09.620 --> 1:11:12.060
 one of the questions I was asking myself,

1:11:13.420 --> 1:11:15.180
 and this is not to be dramatic,

1:11:15.180 --> 1:11:17.740
 it's just a very simple, honest question

1:11:17.740 --> 1:11:19.180
 that I think a lot of journalists

1:11:19.180 --> 1:11:21.060
 that operate in the war zone,

1:11:21.060 --> 1:11:22.780
 or documentary filmmakers

1:11:22.780 --> 1:11:24.740
 that ever since they got a chance to meet,

1:11:24.740 --> 1:11:27.300
 have to be honest with themselves,

1:11:27.300 --> 1:11:32.300
 are you willing to put at risk your life for things you do?

1:11:34.860 --> 1:11:36.020
 What are you willing to die for?

1:11:36.020 --> 1:11:37.460
 Yeah, what are you willing to die for?

1:11:37.460 --> 1:11:42.460
 It sounds very dramatic, but whenever risk goes up,

1:11:44.140 --> 1:11:46.060
 I mean, I don't know, you asked that

1:11:46.060 --> 1:11:48.740
 if you wanna take a trip out to space

1:11:48.740 --> 1:11:51.300
 on a commercial space flight,

1:11:51.300 --> 1:11:56.220
 you have to, are you willing to die for this journey?

1:11:56.220 --> 1:11:58.020
 Now, the odds, they're really small.

1:11:58.020 --> 1:12:00.180
 I just watched Apollo 13 again.

1:12:00.180 --> 1:12:01.300
 Great movie.

1:12:01.300 --> 1:12:02.780
 I'm not going to space.

1:12:02.780 --> 1:12:05.660
 I'm not going to space.

1:12:05.660 --> 1:12:06.580
 Afraid of heights?

1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:08.420
 No, I'm not afraid of heights.

1:12:08.420 --> 1:12:11.660
 I just, it feels like a terrible place to die.

1:12:13.820 --> 1:12:17.020
 Well, first of all, death anywhere is not great.

1:12:17.020 --> 1:12:21.500
 Yeah, although, I have a song teed up in my phone.

1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:24.260
 If the plane starts to go down,

1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:25.540
 I'm gonna spend the last few.

1:12:25.540 --> 1:12:26.420
 It's a rare song.

1:12:26.420 --> 1:12:27.260
 Nobody knows it.

1:12:27.260 --> 1:12:29.780
 It's a song off a B track of my favorite band,

1:12:29.780 --> 1:12:30.620
 which is Rancid.

1:12:30.620 --> 1:12:32.020
 It's a song called The Sentence.

1:12:32.020 --> 1:12:34.060
 And nobody, and I love it.

1:12:34.060 --> 1:12:36.340
 And I listen to it almost every day.

1:12:36.340 --> 1:12:38.180
 Rancid, The Sentence, it's called The Sentence?

1:12:38.180 --> 1:12:41.700
 The band is called Rancid, famous band, relatively.

1:12:41.700 --> 1:12:43.220
 Love those guys, love their music.

1:12:43.220 --> 1:12:44.700
 And the song is The Sentence.

1:12:44.700 --> 1:12:46.900
 You can only find it on like a B side or outtake.

1:12:46.900 --> 1:12:49.860
 And it's, if you don't know how to decipher

1:12:49.860 --> 1:12:50.900
 Tim Armstrong's voice,

1:12:50.900 --> 1:12:52.460
 then you probably won't understand the lyrics.

1:12:52.460 --> 1:12:55.340
 But because it's sung very, very fast.

1:12:55.340 --> 1:12:56.420
 But if the plane ever goes,

1:12:56.420 --> 1:12:57.380
 anytime there's turbulence,

1:12:57.380 --> 1:12:59.020
 I put that thing in, I put the headphones in.

1:12:59.020 --> 1:13:01.060
 I'm like, well, you know, if it's time, it's time.

1:13:01.060 --> 1:13:02.340
 I'm gonna go out like this.

1:13:02.340 --> 1:13:04.180
 I don't wanna drift off into the galaxy,

1:13:04.180 --> 1:13:06.420
 just slowly asphyxiating and freezing to death.

1:13:06.420 --> 1:13:08.060
 That sounds horrible.

1:13:08.060 --> 1:13:09.500
 Just like I wouldn't wanna drown or burn.

1:13:09.500 --> 1:13:10.860
 But on a plane is okay?

1:13:10.860 --> 1:13:11.820
 Well, on a plane, I mean, like,

1:13:11.820 --> 1:13:13.060
 if the thing starts going down

1:13:13.060 --> 1:13:15.100
 and there's truly nothing you can do,

1:13:15.100 --> 1:13:17.180
 you might as well at least listen to your favorite song.

1:13:17.180 --> 1:13:18.140
 Yeah, true, true.

1:13:18.140 --> 1:13:19.220
 I'll probably go with The Pixies,

1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:21.500
 Where's My Mind, like from Fight Club.

1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:23.580
 And just the calmness, just sit back,

1:13:23.580 --> 1:13:26.340
 like the musicians playing at the Titanic.

1:13:26.340 --> 1:13:27.420
 I didn't know you were a Pixies fan.

1:13:27.420 --> 1:13:28.260
 I'm gonna have to.

1:13:28.260 --> 1:13:29.740
 Not so much a Pixies fan.

1:13:29.740 --> 1:13:32.660
 Actually, I should say that I just,

1:13:32.660 --> 1:13:35.980
 that was the, Where's My Mind was the chosen song

1:13:35.980 --> 1:13:39.660
 for Fight Club at the end when the buildings

1:13:39.660 --> 1:13:41.900
 are coming down or something like that.

1:13:41.900 --> 1:13:46.820
 So that there's certain songs that just fit just right

1:13:46.820 --> 1:13:49.140
 for the collapse of human civilization

1:13:49.140 --> 1:13:54.140
 and you're calmly appreciating, like,

1:13:54.220 --> 1:13:55.500
 that that's just it.

1:13:55.500 --> 1:13:58.100
 This is how absurd this life is at any moment it can end.

1:13:58.100 --> 1:13:58.940
 And this is it.

1:14:01.380 --> 1:14:05.460
 I love how we both have death and demise soundtracks.

1:14:05.460 --> 1:14:08.420
 It's just a question when you're an academic,

1:14:08.420 --> 1:14:10.460
 doesn't come up often.

1:14:10.460 --> 1:14:11.300
 Right, well.

1:14:11.300 --> 1:14:15.940
 Yeah, there are some academics that are bold and brave.

1:14:15.940 --> 1:14:17.980
 It's not a phenotype.

1:14:17.980 --> 1:14:19.700
 Being bold and brave in the physical world

1:14:19.700 --> 1:14:22.100
 is not a common phenotype of academics.

1:14:22.100 --> 1:14:24.260
 I mean, the great neurologist, one of my,

1:14:24.260 --> 1:14:27.780
 I don't have many heroes, but Oliver Sacks is a true hero.

1:14:27.780 --> 1:14:30.340
 I mean, people think of him as a writer,

1:14:30.340 --> 1:14:32.140
 but he was foremost a neurologist

1:14:32.140 --> 1:14:36.660
 and he took tremendous pushback from the neurology community

1:14:36.660 --> 1:14:39.020
 for doing his books and his articles.

1:14:39.020 --> 1:14:40.940
 He has a great biography called On the Move.

1:14:40.940 --> 1:14:42.100
 There's a wonderful documentary

1:14:42.100 --> 1:14:42.980
 that just came out about him.

1:14:42.980 --> 1:14:44.660
 He died in 2015.

1:14:44.660 --> 1:14:49.220
 I'm actually kind of a collector of his things,

1:14:50.100 --> 1:14:53.900
 but he, tremendous, but he was accused of horrible things

1:14:53.900 --> 1:14:56.260
 until the movie Awakenings came out

1:14:56.260 --> 1:14:58.020
 with De Niro and Robin Williams.

1:14:58.020 --> 1:15:00.100
 Amazing movie, by the way, people don't,

1:15:00.100 --> 1:15:02.260
 they seem to not say great things about the movie.

1:15:02.260 --> 1:15:03.100
 I love that movie.

1:15:03.100 --> 1:15:04.140
 It was amazing.

1:15:04.140 --> 1:15:08.460
 And it was only once he became famous from that movie

1:15:08.460 --> 1:15:11.260
 that his more academic work started

1:15:11.260 --> 1:15:12.940
 to receive any kind of attention

1:15:12.940 --> 1:15:15.380
 and he was invited back to Columbia and NYU.

1:15:15.380 --> 1:15:18.140
 You know, the New York Neuroscience Mafia is a real thing.

1:15:18.140 --> 1:15:20.140
 And yes, you know who you are.

1:15:20.140 --> 1:15:22.580
 And some of them are actually coming on the broadcast.

1:15:22.580 --> 1:15:25.340
 They are...

1:15:25.340 --> 1:15:26.900
 I think we talked offline about this.

1:15:26.900 --> 1:15:30.060
 We should start a mafia to fight off

1:15:30.060 --> 1:15:31.620
 whatever's going on in the East Coast.

1:15:31.620 --> 1:15:33.980
 Although I'm still at MIT, so I don't know how that works,

1:15:33.980 --> 1:15:36.020
 but Boston is different than New York.

1:15:36.020 --> 1:15:37.420
 Yeah, so I have tremendous respect

1:15:37.420 --> 1:15:38.780
 for science done in New York.

1:15:38.780 --> 1:15:39.620
 Don't get me wrong.

1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:41.220
 They are excellent scientists.

1:15:41.220 --> 1:15:44.500
 It's just a very different culture than on the West Coast.

1:15:44.500 --> 1:15:46.780
 And the personalities, the personalities...

1:15:46.780 --> 1:15:48.900
 Tremendous respect for the mob.

1:15:48.900 --> 1:15:53.700
 Well, and the personalities are a bit more grandiose.

1:15:53.700 --> 1:15:56.260
 However, because of some of the shift

1:15:56.260 --> 1:15:59.300
 in science culture in the last few years,

1:15:59.300 --> 1:16:03.580
 things around scandals and things of that sort,

1:16:03.580 --> 1:16:07.180
 they've been forced to tamp down some of their personality

1:16:07.180 --> 1:16:09.380
 or at least their outspoken personality.

1:16:09.380 --> 1:16:11.140
 And I actually think it's revealed something

1:16:11.140 --> 1:16:12.740
 really important and useful in science,

1:16:12.740 --> 1:16:15.180
 which is it used to be the case

1:16:15.180 --> 1:16:18.420
 you could really inject your personality into what you do.

1:16:19.540 --> 1:16:21.900
 Richard Feynman is a good example.

1:16:21.900 --> 1:16:25.060
 If he did today what he did then,

1:16:25.060 --> 1:16:28.660
 bongo drumming on the roof of Caltech naked,

1:16:28.660 --> 1:16:31.620
 working out theorems in strip clubs and things of that,

1:16:31.620 --> 1:16:35.500
 he would have lost his job in moments.

1:16:35.500 --> 1:16:37.740
 So that kind of behavior isn't celebrated anymore.

1:16:37.740 --> 1:16:39.460
 It's actually punished.

1:16:39.460 --> 1:16:40.540
 And I'm only half kidding

1:16:40.540 --> 1:16:42.260
 about this New York neuroscience mafia,

1:16:42.260 --> 1:16:44.140
 but because I now exist in multiple realms,

1:16:44.140 --> 1:16:45.220
 I can say these sorts of things.

1:16:45.220 --> 1:16:47.340
 And I, again, admiration and respect,

1:16:47.340 --> 1:16:50.460
 but I will say that I think it's important

1:16:50.460 --> 1:16:53.380
 that people in science and kids that are curious

1:16:53.380 --> 1:16:58.060
 about science understand that you can have any personality

1:16:58.060 --> 1:17:01.220
 provided that you're ethical and respectful in science

1:17:01.220 --> 1:17:03.020
 and do well, right?

1:17:03.020 --> 1:17:05.500
 There are true bench scientists

1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:07.060
 that just want to be at the bench.

1:17:07.060 --> 1:17:08.580
 There are people that just want to be in their office.

1:17:08.580 --> 1:17:11.580
 There are people that really enjoy public speaking.

1:17:11.580 --> 1:17:12.980
 And there are people that love meetings

1:17:12.980 --> 1:17:14.220
 and there are people that hate crowds.

1:17:14.220 --> 1:17:16.140
 And so there's a place for everybody,

1:17:16.140 --> 1:17:19.020
 truly a place for everybody in science.

1:17:19.020 --> 1:17:21.300
 I would like to be able to shine light

1:17:21.300 --> 1:17:23.180
 on the fact that there are,

1:17:23.180 --> 1:17:27.580
 you can have a shy personality, an outgoing personality,

1:17:27.580 --> 1:17:30.740
 and you can, all of those can be,

1:17:30.740 --> 1:17:32.420
 have excellent careers in science,

1:17:32.420 --> 1:17:34.140
 but you have to find the community in place

1:17:34.140 --> 1:17:34.980
 that's right for you.

1:17:34.980 --> 1:17:36.580
 One reason I like Stanford

1:17:36.580 --> 1:17:39.620
 is that Stanford is very much about the future.

1:17:39.620 --> 1:17:40.980
 We have Nobel prize winners,

1:17:40.980 --> 1:17:43.020
 we have field medal winners and all that stuff,

1:17:43.020 --> 1:17:44.260
 and their names are on walls

1:17:44.260 --> 1:17:46.100
 and we acknowledge their great works.

1:17:46.100 --> 1:17:49.060
 But most of what you hear about in the halls of Stanford

1:17:49.060 --> 1:17:52.420
 is about what's happening now and what could happen next.

1:17:52.420 --> 1:17:53.980
 It's really about the future.

1:17:53.980 --> 1:17:55.940
 Whereas when I've spent time at other institutions

1:17:55.940 --> 1:17:58.340
 not to be named, you hear that,

1:17:58.340 --> 1:18:02.060
 but there's a lot of kind of recycling and regurgitation

1:18:02.060 --> 1:18:03.620
 of how wonderful people are

1:18:03.620 --> 1:18:05.820
 based on things they did previously.

1:18:05.820 --> 1:18:09.260
 And the students at Stanford, because of Silicon Valley,

1:18:09.260 --> 1:18:10.980
 sure, they have respect for Nobel prizes,

1:18:10.980 --> 1:18:12.140
 they're delighted to be learning from

1:18:12.140 --> 1:18:14.140
 and surrounded by all these great minds,

1:18:14.140 --> 1:18:15.460
 but they're mostly interested

1:18:15.460 --> 1:18:17.660
 in what they are gonna create.

1:18:17.660 --> 1:18:19.980
 And so I kind of, not kind of,

1:18:19.980 --> 1:18:23.260
 I really like the shift toward possibility

1:18:23.260 --> 1:18:26.420
 as opposed to things that are steeped in tradition.

1:18:26.420 --> 1:18:28.660
 You know, I've never been to high table dinner at Oxford,

1:18:28.660 --> 1:18:30.540
 I'm sure it's a wonderful experience.

1:18:30.540 --> 1:18:35.140
 I'm also not sure what purpose it serves for the world,

1:18:35.140 --> 1:18:36.260
 but I've never been,

1:18:36.260 --> 1:18:37.740
 and so I don't know what the conversations are,

1:18:37.740 --> 1:18:40.860
 and so maybe I'm, you know, speaking out of line here.

1:18:40.860 --> 1:18:43.060
 And then now I'm definitely not getting invited.

1:18:43.060 --> 1:18:44.860
 No, you're definitely getting invited.

1:18:44.860 --> 1:18:45.740
 But yeah, I'm with you,

1:18:45.740 --> 1:18:48.180
 the culture's picked the right ones for you.

1:18:48.180 --> 1:18:50.900
 That's why I like MIT, the spirit of it.

1:18:51.980 --> 1:18:55.140
 To me, it's not about the past or the future,

1:18:55.140 --> 1:18:58.180
 it's about just tinkering and having fun,

1:18:58.180 --> 1:18:59.500
 building cool stuff.

1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:03.500
 Like the big ambitious projects, it's there.

1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:06.620
 I mean, it may be more in the biology and the health side,

1:19:06.620 --> 1:19:08.740
 but like the engineering side,

1:19:08.740 --> 1:19:10.780
 it doesn't matter if this has any impact,

1:19:10.780 --> 1:19:13.780
 let us build the coolest thing the world has ever built.

1:19:13.780 --> 1:19:16.580
 Well, whenever I'm in Kendall Square,

1:19:16.580 --> 1:19:18.780
 I've seen, they have those buildings there

1:19:18.780 --> 1:19:20.380
 that actually tilt toward the ground.

1:19:20.380 --> 1:19:22.460
 These are these, the architecture of MIT

1:19:22.460 --> 1:19:24.060
 is also really impressive.

1:19:24.060 --> 1:19:25.500
 Yeah, this, he pulled up,

1:19:25.500 --> 1:19:27.380
 Sergei just pulled up Yilmaz tweet.

1:19:27.380 --> 1:19:28.820
 I'm inspired by curiosity.

1:19:28.820 --> 1:19:30.180
 That is what drives me.

1:19:30.180 --> 1:19:32.980
 So let us expand the scope and scale of consciousness

1:19:32.980 --> 1:19:35.700
 so that we may aspire to understand the universe.

1:19:35.700 --> 1:19:37.220
 Those are like three tweets in one,

1:19:37.220 --> 1:19:41.700
 but curiosity, yeah, yeah, curiosity for its own sake.

1:19:41.700 --> 1:19:42.740
 What's that saying?

1:19:43.620 --> 1:19:45.340
 I think Dorothy Parker said,

1:19:46.260 --> 1:19:48.580
 the cure for boredom is curiosity.

1:19:48.580 --> 1:19:50.460
 There is no cure for curiosity.

1:19:51.460 --> 1:19:52.580
 And you need to celebrate.

1:19:52.580 --> 1:19:54.900
 So let me just briefly mention

1:19:54.900 --> 1:19:59.900
 to my lovely friends at MIT

1:20:00.580 --> 1:20:03.220
 to celebrate different weirdness,

1:20:03.220 --> 1:20:06.020
 to celebrate the weird characters.

1:20:06.020 --> 1:20:10.780
 I've, I sometimes get loving pressure

1:20:10.780 --> 1:20:15.020
 from my lovely friends at MIT

1:20:15.020 --> 1:20:18.580
 to tone down the weirdness a bit.

1:20:18.580 --> 1:20:19.420
 Really?

1:20:19.420 --> 1:20:20.460
 Even from MIT?

1:20:20.460 --> 1:20:24.980
 I'm very fortunate to have a lot of leverage

1:20:24.980 --> 1:20:29.140
 to where I have completely resist the pressure,

1:20:29.140 --> 1:20:32.500
 but I'm very sure that there's young faculty

1:20:32.500 --> 1:20:35.980
 that with that subtle pressure would...

1:20:37.340 --> 1:20:39.860
 Dissolve them into a puddle of tears.

1:20:39.860 --> 1:20:40.700
 Not, no, no.

1:20:40.700 --> 1:20:41.860
 Oh, they're from Boston, excuse me.

1:20:41.860 --> 1:20:42.900
 From Boston, that's right.

1:20:42.900 --> 1:20:43.740
 They're tougher than that.

1:20:43.740 --> 1:20:45.820
 That's right, but it's a slight nudging

1:20:45.820 --> 1:20:50.820
 towards conformity that I think ultimately destroys,

1:20:51.340 --> 1:20:56.340
 or at least lessens the power of the kind of science

1:20:56.660 --> 1:21:00.220
 that you can do when you encourage diversity.

1:21:00.220 --> 1:21:02.420
 Diversity in all of its forms,

1:21:02.420 --> 1:21:04.220
 including the weirdness of ideas,

1:21:04.220 --> 1:21:05.820
 the out of the box thinkers,

1:21:05.820 --> 1:21:08.880
 including the flamboyant behavior online,

1:21:10.260 --> 1:21:13.860
 how you choose to educate, how you choose to inspire.

1:21:13.860 --> 1:21:15.260
 People talk about freedom of speech,

1:21:15.260 --> 1:21:17.820
 but it's not just freedom of speech

1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:20.320
 to say controversial things.

1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:23.140
 It's also freedom of speech to be weird.

1:21:23.140 --> 1:21:26.060
 If you're, for some reason, fascinated in...

1:21:27.060 --> 1:21:28.100
 You look at Elon Musk.

1:21:28.100 --> 1:21:29.660
 He talks about sex a lot.

1:21:29.660 --> 1:21:31.740
 Let the guy put sex memes up.

1:21:31.740 --> 1:21:33.060
 Who cares?

1:21:33.060 --> 1:21:36.400
 I mean, I feel like Elon can do basically whatever he wants.

1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:37.640
 Right, there's no pressure,

1:21:37.640 --> 1:21:40.380
 but there's a bunch of Elons in the academic world.

1:21:40.380 --> 1:21:42.440
 There's a bunch of Elons.

1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:43.480
 No, actually, sorry.

1:21:43.480 --> 1:21:47.100
 Let me backtrack, because the man deserves props.

1:21:47.100 --> 1:21:48.780
 Right, he's unparalleled.

1:21:48.780 --> 1:21:50.480
 He's a CEO of major companies.

1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:53.260
 You better believe there's pressure

1:21:53.260 --> 1:21:55.000
 to behave more like a CEO,

1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:57.660
 as opposed to a giggling schoolboy

1:21:57.660 --> 1:22:00.140
 who's posting memes throughout the night.

1:22:00.140 --> 1:22:02.060
 But that is him.

1:22:02.060 --> 1:22:06.060
 And that freedom, that's what freedom looks like.

1:22:06.060 --> 1:22:08.100
 I talk to a lot of CEOs,

1:22:08.100 --> 1:22:13.100
 and a lot of them feel like caged birds

1:22:13.940 --> 1:22:17.740
 who have long ago forgotten how to sing, quite honestly.

1:22:17.740 --> 1:22:20.740
 Like, there's like shareholders,

1:22:20.740 --> 1:22:22.660
 and they come up with excuses for themselves.

1:22:22.660 --> 1:22:25.660
 Here's why I have to be this way, you have to understand.

1:22:25.660 --> 1:22:27.820
 So on, there's PR, there's marketing people,

1:22:27.820 --> 1:22:30.300
 there's lawyers, there's all that kind of stuff.

1:22:30.300 --> 1:22:35.080
 But the final result is the authenticity is suffocated.

1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:38.460
 The beautiful weirdness of a CEO,

1:22:38.460 --> 1:22:41.660
 of a leader, of a creator, of a scientist, all that,

1:22:41.660 --> 1:22:45.060
 that's all gone.

1:22:45.060 --> 1:22:49.100
 Well, Steve Jobs wouldn't have kept his job

1:22:49.100 --> 1:22:52.100
 in acting the way he did in his 20s and 30s

1:22:52.100 --> 1:22:53.540
 in today's climate.

1:22:53.540 --> 1:22:57.200
 But he probably would have updated his protocols,

1:22:57.200 --> 1:22:58.040
 so to speak. A little bit,

1:22:58.040 --> 1:22:59.740
 but maybe.

1:22:59.740 --> 1:23:01.100
 You know, you're screaming at employees.

1:23:01.100 --> 1:23:02.940
 I mean, these are anecdotes, right?

1:23:02.940 --> 1:23:04.440
 I call them anecdata,

1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:05.780
 because people treat them as data,

1:23:05.780 --> 1:23:07.160
 but they're really just anecdotes.

1:23:07.160 --> 1:23:08.660
 We don't know, I wasn't there.

1:23:09.700 --> 1:23:14.300
 But, you know, I like the idea of authenticity

1:23:14.300 --> 1:23:16.500
 without oversharing, right?

1:23:16.500 --> 1:23:19.620
 You're very authentic, but there are aspects to your life

1:23:19.620 --> 1:23:22.340
 that I'm aware of that your audiences will never be aware of,

1:23:22.340 --> 1:23:23.280
 and there are aspects of your life

1:23:23.280 --> 1:23:24.380
 that I'll never be aware of.

1:23:24.380 --> 1:23:26.540
 And so you're still authentic, but.

1:23:26.540 --> 1:23:29.500
 Yeah, wait, which ones are you aware of?

1:23:29.500 --> 1:23:30.620
 People are gonna wonder, like,

1:23:30.620 --> 1:23:32.860
 what is, is he up in sex dungeon?

1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:33.700
 What is this?

1:23:33.700 --> 1:23:35.380
 No, no, no, no.

1:23:35.380 --> 1:23:37.720
 But interesting choice of examples.

1:23:39.300 --> 1:23:42.220
 No, but I think that, you know,

1:23:42.220 --> 1:23:44.940
 people lose the careers on the basis

1:23:44.940 --> 1:23:47.460
 of the movement of their thumbs, right?

1:23:47.460 --> 1:23:50.360
 I mean, the chair of psychiatry at Columbia

1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:55.360
 recently lost his position based on a response to a tweet.

1:23:55.380 --> 1:23:56.220
 People can look that up.

1:23:56.220 --> 1:23:58.260
 This is one of the most famous psychiatry departments

1:23:58.260 --> 1:23:59.240
 in the world.

1:23:59.240 --> 1:24:01.000
 And he put something out there

1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:03.060
 that was very insensitive, frankly.

1:24:03.060 --> 1:24:06.300
 And everyone that I talked to about it was like,

1:24:06.300 --> 1:24:09.060
 gosh, that was very, very insensitive,

1:24:09.060 --> 1:24:10.080
 not thoughtful at all.

1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:11.940
 And he lost his job, right?

1:24:11.940 --> 1:24:12.960
 Or at least had to step down.

1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:14.260
 I don't know the specifics.

1:24:14.260 --> 1:24:18.680
 So, you know, I think I read someplace

1:24:18.680 --> 1:24:22.700
 that more than half of the job loss due to online behavior

1:24:22.700 --> 1:24:25.940
 is because people were trying to be funny, right?

1:24:25.940 --> 1:24:29.760
 I mean, not everyone can pull off what Tim Dillon.

1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:30.980
 Oh, and by the way, congratulations.

1:24:30.980 --> 1:24:32.500
 I heard that you and Tim just got married.

1:24:32.500 --> 1:24:33.340
 Yeah, I saw that too.

1:24:33.340 --> 1:24:34.180
 No, no, we didn't just get married.

1:24:34.180 --> 1:24:35.000
 Engaged.

1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:35.840
 He proposed.

1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:36.680
 Yeah, got it, got it, got it.

1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:37.580
 And I said, yes.

1:24:37.580 --> 1:24:38.420
 Right.

1:24:38.420 --> 1:24:40.380
 So some people can get away.

1:24:40.380 --> 1:24:41.220
 Oh, yeah.

1:24:41.220 --> 1:24:42.040
 Thank you.

1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:42.880
 Thank you, Sergey.

1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:43.720
 Has that ready to go.

1:24:43.720 --> 1:24:46.140
 See those 13.3 thousand likes?

1:24:46.140 --> 1:24:48.140
 One of those is mine.

1:24:48.140 --> 1:24:49.760
 So for people who are not aware,

1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:52.980
 one of the days in April tweeted that Tim Dillon

1:24:52.980 --> 1:24:55.180
 asked me to get married and I said, yes.

1:24:55.180 --> 1:24:59.380
 I think Tim said, the wedding will be on 6th Street

1:24:59.380 --> 1:25:01.280
 in Austin, bring all of your weapons,

1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:03.320
 which of course is totally inappropriate.

1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:08.320
 This is, I was like PG funny,

1:25:08.900 --> 1:25:12.620
 and he's goes rated R funny right away.

1:25:12.620 --> 1:25:16.260
 But that said, I mean, if there's anyone

1:25:17.180 --> 1:25:19.380
 I would like to get married with,

1:25:19.380 --> 1:25:21.340
 it's that guy and we would do it in Austin

1:25:21.340 --> 1:25:24.460
 and it would be epic.

1:25:24.460 --> 1:25:31.460
 It would be like the wedding from November rain, one of the,

1:25:31.500 --> 1:25:32.540
 Mr. and Mrs.

1:25:32.540 --> 1:25:33.380
 Oh, wow.

1:25:33.380 --> 1:25:34.340
 Oh, Mr. and Mr., I apologize.

1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:38.820
 Wow, yeah, and you broke tradition with the jacket color.

1:25:38.820 --> 1:25:42.780
 So it sounds to me that you are a free speech absolutist.

1:25:42.780 --> 1:25:44.540
 I think freedom is really important

1:25:44.540 --> 1:25:48.460
 and that includes letting people who are hateful,

1:25:48.460 --> 1:25:51.220
 letting people who are controversial

1:25:51.220 --> 1:25:53.140
 have a voice on platforms.

1:25:53.140 --> 1:25:57.140
 But it becomes, I'm not sure what exactly to think

1:25:57.140 --> 1:26:02.140
 because I also treasure the quiet voices

1:26:03.380 --> 1:26:04.600
 in the back of the room.

1:26:05.540 --> 1:26:10.540
 And sometimes the assholes silence those voices,

1:26:10.620 --> 1:26:14.300
 meaning by being loud and obnoxious and so on,

1:26:14.300 --> 1:26:16.460
 it pushes away the thoughtful people.

1:26:16.460 --> 1:26:19.340
 So I'm also a fan of creating communities.

1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:23.980
 Like you should be able to let people kind of

1:26:23.980 --> 1:26:27.580
 build a community that's positive, that's loving,

1:26:27.580 --> 1:26:32.580
 or that's constantly trolling, or that's super hateful.

1:26:33.940 --> 1:26:37.100
 All those communities should have a place in the world.

1:26:37.100 --> 1:26:40.540
 But like the thing I've noticed is that

1:26:41.980 --> 1:26:44.860
 hate can destroy, a community full of hate

1:26:44.860 --> 1:26:46.820
 can destroy a community full of love

1:26:46.820 --> 1:26:49.540
 easier than a community full of love

1:26:49.540 --> 1:26:51.020
 can overtake one with hate.

1:26:51.020 --> 1:26:54.020
 And so you have to kind of, I don't know exactly how,

1:26:54.020 --> 1:26:58.760
 but create digital mechanisms that discourage

1:26:58.760 --> 1:27:00.340
 the collision of these communities.

1:27:00.340 --> 1:27:03.900
 They should all have a platform and ability to speak

1:27:03.900 --> 1:27:06.880
 to a large audience, but you have to be careful

1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:11.540
 to protect that like little flame of connection

1:27:11.540 --> 1:27:12.380
 that people have.

1:27:12.380 --> 1:27:17.140
 Yeah, that's good, the goodness, it sounds like, I mean,

1:27:17.140 --> 1:27:20.220
 yeah, I think in any great city like New York,

1:27:20.220 --> 1:27:24.020
 which I love, by the way, you wanna have a symphony

1:27:24.020 --> 1:27:26.100
 in an opera house and you want some punk rock shows

1:27:26.100 --> 1:27:29.540
 happening on the Lower East Side, you want all of that.

1:27:29.540 --> 1:27:32.180
 You just don't necessarily want them to overlap.

1:27:32.180 --> 1:27:36.060
 In terms of social media and then podcasts and engagement,

1:27:36.060 --> 1:27:38.600
 one thing that I decided very early on

1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:41.260
 is was to encourage comments and feedback, et cetera.

1:27:41.260 --> 1:27:44.980
 But I have in my mind what I call classroom rules.

1:27:44.980 --> 1:27:46.180
 You've taught in the university

1:27:46.180 --> 1:27:48.040
 and then you teach in the university

1:27:48.040 --> 1:27:51.580
 and you establish a certain etiquette within the classroom

1:27:51.580 --> 1:27:54.140
 of the kinds of questions that you'll tolerate, right?

1:27:54.140 --> 1:27:56.300
 So there's always the student that's gonna ask a question,

1:27:56.300 --> 1:27:58.340
 which is basically a 10 minute monologue

1:27:58.340 --> 1:28:00.100
 about their experience that really isn't a question

1:28:00.100 --> 1:28:01.540
 that pertains to a lot of people.

1:28:01.540 --> 1:28:04.580
 So you politely discourage that kind of question

1:28:04.580 --> 1:28:05.820
 and you encourage the kinds of questions

1:28:05.820 --> 1:28:08.180
 that are likely to be in the minds of many other students.

1:28:08.180 --> 1:28:09.500
 It's just more efficient that way.

1:28:09.500 --> 1:28:12.740
 Or not politely, which is more, you know,

1:28:12.740 --> 1:28:15.160
 I try and respond to comments and I try and respond,

1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:16.460
 but also, you know, there's this,

1:28:16.460 --> 1:28:17.820
 also this really interesting question.

1:28:17.820 --> 1:28:20.620
 Now, if you block people or restrict people,

1:28:20.620 --> 1:28:22.080
 people think that you're somehow afraid

1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:23.780
 of the information that they're posting,

1:28:23.780 --> 1:28:25.580
 but that's often not the case.

1:28:25.580 --> 1:28:26.740
 I'm not in the habit of blocking

1:28:26.740 --> 1:28:27.820
 or restricting too many people.

1:28:27.820 --> 1:28:29.380
 Occasionally we've had to do it

1:28:29.380 --> 1:28:31.420
 only because of how other people are being treated

1:28:31.420 --> 1:28:32.900
 in the comment section.

1:28:32.900 --> 1:28:35.300
 What I can take and what I think other people deserve to take

1:28:35.300 --> 1:28:37.100
 are two completely different things.

1:28:37.100 --> 1:28:40.020
 David Goggins, right, who we both know well,

1:28:40.020 --> 1:28:40.920
 I don't know if he still does this,

1:28:40.920 --> 1:28:42.940
 but a few years ago, he posted something like,

1:28:42.940 --> 1:28:45.900
 if people ask him, when do you sleep?

1:28:45.900 --> 1:28:47.220
 He would just block them.

1:28:48.060 --> 1:28:49.920
 Because it wasn't consistent with what he was trying to say.

1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:51.640
 Of course he sleeps, but it's, you know,

1:28:51.640 --> 1:28:53.300
 he's trying to get a particular message out.

1:28:53.300 --> 1:28:54.600
 I think people should just understand

1:28:54.600 --> 1:28:59.500
 that everybody's page is their own to moderate, right?

1:28:59.500 --> 1:29:02.020
 Just like in a classroom, there are certain rules,

1:29:02.020 --> 1:29:03.280
 of course, of institution,

1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:05.140
 but then you establish the etiquette

1:29:05.140 --> 1:29:06.660
 within the context of the kind of class.

1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:09.160
 You know, a class about personality psychology

1:29:09.160 --> 1:29:11.380
 or the psychology of love,

1:29:11.380 --> 1:29:14.920
 you're gonna have a very different range of conversations

1:29:14.920 --> 1:29:17.860
 than, you know, a class on, you know,

1:29:17.860 --> 1:29:19.200
 memory and physiology.

1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:25.140
 So I think social media is a great place for conversation,

1:29:25.320 --> 1:29:26.880
 but it's not necessarily a great place

1:29:26.880 --> 1:29:28.460
 for every kind of conversation.

1:29:28.460 --> 1:29:31.540
 Yeah, and I also just say that people that do get blocked,

1:29:31.540 --> 1:29:35.260
 I never, this is something I do very deliberately,

1:29:35.260 --> 1:29:37.180
 blocked or ignored.

1:29:37.180 --> 1:29:38.980
 I never think poorly of them.

1:29:38.980 --> 1:29:41.980
 I actually explicitly think,

1:29:41.980 --> 1:29:44.120
 if there's somebody that's like saying

1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:45.780
 hateful things about me or whatever,

1:29:45.780 --> 1:29:47.540
 I always think positive thoughts.

1:29:47.540 --> 1:29:49.680
 It's not some kind of weird guru thing,

1:29:49.680 --> 1:29:52.140
 but just actually found that as a hack.

1:29:52.140 --> 1:29:53.720
 I think well of them,

1:29:53.720 --> 1:29:56.700
 and that allows me to never think of them again.

1:29:56.700 --> 1:29:58.220
 Like I send them my love,

1:29:58.220 --> 1:30:01.200
 and like I think this is a like fascinating human being

1:30:01.200 --> 1:30:02.820
 with a fascinating story.

1:30:02.820 --> 1:30:04.620
 I would love to have time to actually learn

1:30:04.620 --> 1:30:07.140
 about their story, but there's not enough time in the world.

1:30:07.140 --> 1:30:09.660
 And I just think well of them and then I move on

1:30:09.660 --> 1:30:13.460
 and enjoy a delicious meal with people that are close to me

1:30:13.460 --> 1:30:16.660
 and I love and so on and just, and move on.

1:30:16.660 --> 1:30:19.340
 And then never adding to the negativity of like,

1:30:19.340 --> 1:30:21.520
 just even in the privacy of my own mind,

1:30:21.520 --> 1:30:23.700
 thinking a hateful thought towards them,

1:30:23.700 --> 1:30:25.500
 it serves no purpose whatsoever.

1:30:25.500 --> 1:30:27.080
 Yeah, I love that about you.

1:30:27.080 --> 1:30:29.540
 And I know that what you just said to be true,

1:30:29.540 --> 1:30:33.940
 one of the, I think more toxic things in life

1:30:33.940 --> 1:30:37.780
 is what's called, you know, a vacuative projection.

1:30:37.780 --> 1:30:40.260
 When people feel something and they try and evacuate it

1:30:40.260 --> 1:30:41.500
 and project it onto somebody else.

1:30:41.500 --> 1:30:43.220
 Projection is fascinating, right?

1:30:43.220 --> 1:30:44.620
 What you essentially just said is that

1:30:44.620 --> 1:30:46.700
 you don't accept projections.

1:30:46.700 --> 1:30:49.020
 And in fact, you transmute them

1:30:49.020 --> 1:30:51.320
 to put it in the language of the Buddhist, you know,

1:30:51.320 --> 1:30:53.300
 you transmute it into positivity.

1:30:53.300 --> 1:30:58.300
 And in that way, you truly neutralize it and transmute it.

1:30:58.540 --> 1:31:02.900
 I think that if people were better understood

1:31:02.900 --> 1:31:04.340
 when they were experiencing

1:31:04.340 --> 1:31:06.500
 or observing a vacuative projection,

1:31:08.400 --> 1:31:11.580
 the world would be a much healthier and happier place.

1:31:11.580 --> 1:31:14.780
 But it requires a certain stable internal rudder.

1:31:14.780 --> 1:31:18.300
 And, you know, when we're tired or sick or angry,

1:31:18.300 --> 1:31:21.460
 you know, we're hungry, excessively hungry.

1:31:21.460 --> 1:31:23.460
 All of us are less good at it.

1:31:23.460 --> 1:31:25.580
 I've been positively struck by the nature

1:31:25.580 --> 1:31:28.580
 of most of the interactions, not just feedback,

1:31:28.580 --> 1:31:32.340
 but my favorite thing as an educator in the classroom,

1:31:32.340 --> 1:31:33.440
 but also on social media.

1:31:33.440 --> 1:31:36.340
 My absolute favorite thing is when the comments

1:31:36.340 --> 1:31:39.660
 about other people's comments are positively reinforcing.

1:31:39.660 --> 1:31:42.940
 So you see people having conversations within the comments

1:31:42.940 --> 1:31:45.060
 and you realize this is like, if you, as an educator,

1:31:45.060 --> 1:31:47.020
 again, you know, it's fun to teach

1:31:47.020 --> 1:31:48.520
 and it's fun to talk to the students,

1:31:48.520 --> 1:31:51.740
 but the real pleasure is in walking by a small group

1:31:51.740 --> 1:31:54.220
 of students on campus and hearing them talking

1:31:54.220 --> 1:31:58.380
 about the material, that just fills me with joy.

1:31:58.380 --> 1:32:02.700
 And because what it means is that the ideas are reverberating

1:32:02.700 --> 1:32:05.020
 in their nervous systems and will eventually wick out

1:32:05.020 --> 1:32:06.260
 to others.

1:32:06.260 --> 1:32:07.700
 So it's not just about feedback,

1:32:07.700 --> 1:32:11.120
 it's about a venue for parsing information.

1:32:11.120 --> 1:32:13.700
 So you actually posted that we're gonna talk on Instagram

1:32:13.700 --> 1:32:15.460
 and I collected a bunch of the questions,

1:32:15.460 --> 1:32:20.460
 which reminds me of, I have to mention Mike Jones

1:32:21.040 --> 1:32:24.780
 and a question he asked, but also a gift he gave

1:32:24.780 --> 1:32:26.860
 quite a while ago, if it's okay.

1:32:26.860 --> 1:32:29.140
 But first, a quick bathroom break.

1:32:29.140 --> 1:32:30.460
 Yes.

1:32:30.460 --> 1:32:33.180
 We're looking at an Instagram page of Mike Jones,

1:32:33.180 --> 1:32:35.580
 Knife and Tool, you should check it out.

1:32:35.580 --> 1:32:39.480
 He, Andrew gave me a gift from him,

1:32:39.480 --> 1:32:44.260
 that is a badass butcher knife.

1:32:44.260 --> 1:32:46.660
 Yours is the earth, da, da, da,

1:32:46.660 --> 1:32:48.820
 is from If by Richard Kipling.

1:32:48.820 --> 1:32:52.020
 Yeah, the story of this knife is kind of interesting,

1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:53.740
 perhaps, to people where it was,

1:32:53.740 --> 1:32:56.100
 I was coming out here to Austin to meet with Lex

1:32:56.100 --> 1:32:57.900
 and it was his birthday.

1:32:57.900 --> 1:33:00.140
 I wanna get him a gift, but I didn't know what to get him.

1:33:00.140 --> 1:33:02.460
 And I contacted this guy, Mike Jones,

1:33:02.460 --> 1:33:04.480
 that I learned about through Joe Rogan.

1:33:04.480 --> 1:33:08.380
 Cause the first, remember in the old days of Joe Rogan,

1:33:08.380 --> 1:33:09.920
 when you go on the episode afterwards,

1:33:09.920 --> 1:33:11.660
 you take a picture with an object.

1:33:11.660 --> 1:33:13.780
 So it was like Elon with a flamethrower

1:33:13.780 --> 1:33:14.760
 or people would have the ax.

1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:18.820
 I picked up this Bushwhacker hatchet thing.

1:33:18.820 --> 1:33:21.100
 And I was like, I love this thing.

1:33:21.100 --> 1:33:22.700
 And Joe said, oh yeah, you should check out

1:33:22.700 --> 1:33:25.500
 Mike Jones's work, he does these beautiful knives.

1:33:25.500 --> 1:33:29.180
 And so then I heard your episode with Joe

1:33:29.180 --> 1:33:31.140
 and you recited a poem at the end.

1:33:31.140 --> 1:33:33.320
 It was right after your grandmother died.

1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:36.880
 And there's a line in that poem from If

1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:39.540
 that Mike engraved on that knife for you.

1:33:39.540 --> 1:33:41.740
 So he makes these by hand.

1:33:41.740 --> 1:33:46.740
 I love, the old days, before the podcast and all that.

1:33:47.980 --> 1:33:48.820
 That's the first appearance.

1:33:48.820 --> 1:33:50.620
 That was the first time on there.

1:33:50.620 --> 1:33:55.380
 And it was a lot of fun in the old studio in Los Angeles.

1:33:55.380 --> 1:33:59.180
 And yeah, Mike makes these beautiful knives.

1:33:59.180 --> 1:34:02.340
 And I have this, I just have a great admiration

1:34:02.340 --> 1:34:04.540
 for crafts people.

1:34:04.540 --> 1:34:06.260
 So, do you use it?

1:34:06.260 --> 1:34:08.540
 Do you cut your one meal a day steaks with it?

1:34:08.540 --> 1:34:10.140
 I feel.

1:34:10.140 --> 1:34:11.660
 Are you taking it with you on your travels?

1:34:11.660 --> 1:34:12.820
 Exactly.

1:34:12.820 --> 1:34:15.260
 I actually used to keep it on the table,

1:34:15.260 --> 1:34:18.340
 but I thought it really intimidates guests.

1:34:18.340 --> 1:34:19.280
 A little bit.

1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:20.120
 But like.

1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:20.940
 You can put it on their side.

1:34:20.940 --> 1:34:21.900
 Yeah, right.

1:34:21.900 --> 1:34:22.780
 It's like, oops.

1:34:22.780 --> 1:34:24.980
 It's trust, right?

1:34:24.980 --> 1:34:26.300
 What's the story?

1:34:26.300 --> 1:34:27.460
 I mean, yeah.

1:34:27.460 --> 1:34:28.940
 But it's, cause it's not,

1:34:30.620 --> 1:34:33.580
 it's quite bad ass if I may say.

1:34:33.580 --> 1:34:37.860
 So the craftsmanship is obvious, but also it is a knife.

1:34:37.860 --> 1:34:40.140
 It's got some like Dexter like qualities to it.

1:34:40.140 --> 1:34:40.980
 Yeah.

1:34:40.980 --> 1:34:43.660
 It looks like it's designed to cleave through a limb.

1:34:43.660 --> 1:34:46.040
 If I had like a family or something where people,

1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:49.940
 there's nothing about this place that softens your kind

1:34:49.940 --> 1:34:54.620
 of sense that this person might not murder me.

1:34:54.620 --> 1:34:56.780
 Let's put it differently.

1:34:56.780 --> 1:34:58.900
 This place could use a woman's touch.

1:34:58.900 --> 1:35:00.820
 That's one way to put it.

1:35:00.820 --> 1:35:01.820
 If it's okay, let me,

1:35:01.820 --> 1:35:06.820
 because it is a poem I go to often actually.

1:35:09.140 --> 1:35:10.760
 You mentioned reciting some lyrics

1:35:10.760 --> 1:35:13.260
 and I'm actually gonna go back to that at some point

1:35:13.260 --> 1:35:15.560
 to get a few songs that touch you.

1:35:17.380 --> 1:35:20.060
 But this is one of the things I go to often.

1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:23.200
 I'll read it to remind myself.

1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:27.940
 It's advice from a father to son.

1:35:27.940 --> 1:35:31.100
 And it's a kind of mantra that it's just nice to live by.

1:35:31.100 --> 1:35:31.940
 So if it's okay with me,

1:35:31.940 --> 1:35:34.260
 just use this opportunity one more time.

1:35:34.260 --> 1:35:36.520
 Read If by Roger Kipling.

1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:38.820
 If you can keep your head when all about you

1:35:38.820 --> 1:35:41.540
 are losing theirs and blaming it on you,

1:35:41.540 --> 1:35:44.300
 if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you

1:35:44.300 --> 1:35:47.020
 but make allowance for their doubting too,

1:35:47.020 --> 1:35:49.940
 if you can wait to not be tired by waiting

1:35:49.940 --> 1:35:53.020
 or being lied about don't deal in lies

1:35:53.020 --> 1:35:55.940
 or being hated don't give way to hating

1:35:55.940 --> 1:35:59.740
 and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise.

1:35:59.740 --> 1:36:02.740
 If you can dream and not make dreams your master,

1:36:02.740 --> 1:36:05.860
 if you can think and not make thoughts your aim,

1:36:05.860 --> 1:36:08.300
 if you can meet with triumph and disaster

1:36:08.300 --> 1:36:11.420
 and treat those two imposters just the same,

1:36:11.420 --> 1:36:14.180
 if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken

1:36:14.180 --> 1:36:17.020
 twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools

1:36:17.020 --> 1:36:20.660
 or watch the things you gave your life to broken

1:36:20.660 --> 1:36:24.420
 and stoop and build them up with worn out tools,

1:36:24.420 --> 1:36:26.980
 if you can make one heap of all your winnings

1:36:26.980 --> 1:36:30.740
 and risk it all on one turn of pitch and toss

1:36:30.740 --> 1:36:34.180
 and lose and start again at your beginnings

1:36:34.180 --> 1:36:37.180
 and never breathe a word about your loss,

1:36:37.180 --> 1:36:40.000
 if you can force your heart to nerve and sinew

1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.940
 to serve your turn long after they're gone

1:36:42.940 --> 1:36:46.220
 and so hold on when there's nothing in you

1:36:46.220 --> 1:36:49.300
 except the will which says to them, hold on.

1:36:49.300 --> 1:36:53.240
 If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,

1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:55.680
 I like this one, and walk with kings

1:36:55.680 --> 1:36:58.600
 nor lose the common touch, if neither foes

1:36:58.600 --> 1:37:00.680
 nor loving friends can hurt you,

1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:05.580
 if all men count with you but none too much,

1:37:05.580 --> 1:37:07.980
 if you can fill the unforgiving minute

1:37:07.980 --> 1:37:10.600
 with 60 seconds worth of distance run,

1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:15.680
 yours is the earth and everything that's in it

1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:19.080
 and which is more, you'll be a man, my son.

1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:20.920
 Thank you, Andrew, thank you, thank you, Mike,

1:37:20.920 --> 1:37:23.560
 for the knife, it's a, I don't know.

1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:24.880
 It's an important poem.

1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:28.080
 And engraved in it, yeah, it's yours.

1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:31.320
 Yours is the earth and everything that's in it.

1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:34.160
 We toiled over what to engrave,

1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:36.320
 and then finally I just said, Mike,

1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:38.860
 just pick something that speaks to you,

1:37:38.860 --> 1:37:41.120
 you're the craftsman, and so he selected that.

1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:42.920
 There's certain ways to pull yourself in that book.

1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:47.920
 Actually, Karl Deisseroth, he wrote the book Projections.

1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:50.080
 One of my favorite, first of all,

1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:53.080
 just as you said, incredible writer.

1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:57.900
 Just, I mean, if you wrote fiction,

1:37:57.900 --> 1:37:59.000
 if you wrote those kinds of things,

1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.600
 I'm curious to see where he goes with his writing.

1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:02.440
 It's very interesting.

1:38:02.440 --> 1:38:04.880
 I think that book took him 10 years to write,

1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:06.520
 which is vindication for me and for you

1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:07.860
 because we're both supposed to write books

1:38:07.860 --> 1:38:08.960
 and we haven't done it.

1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:13.600
 Yeah, I mean, in some sense,

1:38:13.600 --> 1:38:18.600
 your first book will have decades in it, right?

1:38:20.700 --> 1:38:23.640
 Even if you just take a half a year to write it.

1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:27.300
 It's like the first book, like the first album for a musician,

1:38:27.300 --> 1:38:28.900
 I mean, it's a journey.

1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:35.140
 But he uses poems and quotes in there really well.

1:38:35.140 --> 1:38:36.040
 It's a beautiful book.

1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:36.860
 It's a dreamy book.

1:38:36.860 --> 1:38:39.560
 I think when people hear that it's a book about neuroscience,

1:38:39.560 --> 1:38:41.240
 they think they're gonna get a textbook

1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:44.200
 or a protocols book or something, it's nothing like that.

1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:46.500
 But it really is a deep dive into the mind

1:38:46.500 --> 1:38:48.140
 of the psychiatrist and the researcher

1:38:48.140 --> 1:38:50.600
 and so much feeling and compassion.

1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:51.880
 I love that you love poetry.

1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:53.480
 I mean, I didn't know that until I saw you

1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:58.480
 on Rogan Read If and I'm not a very rabid consumer of poetry

1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:03.180
 but I'm a big Wendell Berry fan.

1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:10.640
 And I try and read a poem once every few days.

1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:13.400
 Also, I think if is a tough act to follow.

1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:14.760
 Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:18.320
 I mean, that's the richness and the, I mean,

1:39:18.320 --> 1:39:21.480
 you said every third line in there is something

1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:25.440
 that you would consider your life well lived

1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:27.760
 if you said that, right?

1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:31.440
 What about the preparation for the solo podcast?

1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:34.120
 You said you listen to certain songs,

1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:37.200
 you sing or recite the lyrics to certain songs.

1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:39.320
 Is there ones that kind of come to mind

1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:40.680
 that are interesting?

1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:43.640
 Um, yeah, I've always been very lyrics driven

1:39:43.640 --> 1:39:45.400
 and I don't understand music.

1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:46.600
 I've talked to Rick about this.

1:39:46.600 --> 1:39:47.720
 I think I've talked to you about this a little bit.

1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:50.840
 I don't really understand, I mean,

1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:53.920
 I can hear music and like it,

1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:56.580
 but I don't really understand the structure of it.

1:39:56.580 --> 1:39:57.420
 But lyrics make a lot of sense to me.

1:39:57.420 --> 1:40:00.400
 But does it touch your soul, music, or is it the lyrics?

1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:02.280
 It's the lyrics, it's not the instrumentals.

1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:04.080
 So I'm a huge Joe Strummer fan

1:40:04.080 --> 1:40:05.880
 and I'm gonna lose punk points for saying this

1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:07.320
 but I'm not a Clash fan.

1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:08.280
 Oh, okay.

1:40:08.280 --> 1:40:10.240
 So he obviously is best known for the Clash.

1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:12.640
 Most Clash songs start off great

1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:15.520
 and then after about 30 seconds, at least in my mind,

1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:17.840
 just kind of disintegrate into a bunch of mush.

1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:21.100
 Whereas Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros,

1:40:21.100 --> 1:40:23.320
 which is what he did as an adult,

1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:25.880
 as a later and some of his solo work,

1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:28.000
 he actually, Rick produced some work

1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.240
 that he did with Johnny Cash.

1:40:30.240 --> 1:40:31.920
 Rick pulled Johnny Cash out of,

1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:33.060
 essentially out of retirement

1:40:33.060 --> 1:40:35.920
 and had him do his albums before he died.

1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:38.720
 And so anything that Strummer did,

1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:40.920
 there's a favorite song of mine by Strummer,

1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:43.040
 it's called Burning Lights.

1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:44.680
 You can find it, there is an album now

1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:46.360
 where you can find it or Tennessee Rain

1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:47.320
 or some of these things that he did,

1:40:47.320 --> 1:40:49.920
 which are a little bit more folky, so not really punk.

1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:52.160
 So I love that song.

1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:54.440
 Bunch of songs by Rancid that I love.

1:40:54.440 --> 1:40:55.880
 Yeah, Rancid is great.

1:40:55.880 --> 1:40:57.920
 And then if I listen to instrumentals,

1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:01.800
 I do, I'll listen to classical piano.

1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:04.400
 Some dreams are made for children.

1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:06.080
 But it's not gonna sound good as a poem.

1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:07.720
 They can play the, people can play the song.

1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:08.720
 Play the song, okay.

1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:12.880
 Yeah, so I'll, I mean, cause it has to be something,

1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:14.880
 Joe's voice is what makes the song.

1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:15.880
 Got it.

1:41:15.880 --> 1:41:17.120
 Joe's voice is what makes the song.

1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:18.760
 But yeah, that song Burning Lights

1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:21.800
 from I Hired a Contract Killer.

1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:23.080
 I don't know, the licks are pretty good.

1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:23.920
 They're pretty good.

1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:25.480
 I mean, Joe is an amazing writer, right?

1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:27.920
 I'm also a big Bob Dylan fan.

1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:30.040
 Glenn Gould for classical piano.

1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:33.360
 He was at Asperger's, and actually I think

1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:36.800
 you can hear him grunting, he had a Tourette's like tick.

1:41:36.800 --> 1:41:40.640
 And I learned about Glenn Gould from Oliver Sacks.

1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:42.080
 So I'll listen to any number of things.

1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:43.040
 It depends on my mood.

1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:44.200
 If I'm feeling a little more tired

1:41:44.200 --> 1:41:45.680
 and I need to be amped up,

1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:48.040
 I'll listen to something that's a little louder and faster.

1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:49.560
 If I'm feeling kind of keyed up

1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:52.040
 and I need to bring the cadence down a little bit,

1:41:53.080 --> 1:41:55.880
 then I'll listen to something a little mellower, poppier.

1:41:55.880 --> 1:42:00.120
 I love bands like, yeah, I'm a big fan

1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:02.880
 of this British pop band called James.

1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:04.760
 There's like 20 bands named James.

1:42:04.760 --> 1:42:06.360
 But this one, you know, and again,

1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:09.320
 I lose punk points for saying that, but they're amazing.

1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:10.160
 And best luck.

1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:11.320
 I think you've accumulated enough points

1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:13.760
 where you can afford to lose a few.

1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:15.120
 Yeah.

1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:18.800
 But in any case, yeah, music and poetry are,

1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:21.880
 they're the subconscious, right?

1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:23.600
 I mean, if you think about a Bob Dylan song

1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:25.960
 or a really good Strummer song or a poem

1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:29.080
 that the words don't mean anything when read linearly,

1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:30.660
 but they make you feel something,

1:42:30.660 --> 1:42:32.880
 they're tapping into the subconscious.

1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:34.120
 That's really what they're doing.

1:42:34.120 --> 1:42:38.440
 They're pulling on neural threads of emotion

1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:41.280
 based on either timbre or cadence

1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:45.480
 or something that's independent of the word structure.

1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:48.640
 And that to me is the beauty of music and poetry.

1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:51.720
 I often say Johnny Cash's version, Hurt,

1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:55.040
 that I say would be my favorite song ever.

1:42:55.040 --> 1:42:56.680
 Well, he did a Nine Inch Nails song.

1:42:56.680 --> 1:42:57.520
 He did, he covered.

1:42:57.520 --> 1:42:58.840
 I think Rick produced that.

1:42:58.840 --> 1:42:59.680
 Pretty sure he produced that.

1:42:59.680 --> 1:43:01.080
 He produced it.

1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:04.120
 I mean, he did, like Rick produced the,

1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:08.000
 he pulled Johnny Cash out from a dark place

1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:11.040
 to produce something that, I mean,

1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:15.440
 when you look back as one of the great things ever in music,

1:43:15.440 --> 1:43:19.320
 which are these like haunting covers

1:43:19.320 --> 1:43:21.960
 of certain songs and originals.

1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:25.160
 Johnny Cash and Joe Strummer did a version

1:43:25.160 --> 1:43:30.040
 of Redemption song together that Rick produced,

1:43:30.040 --> 1:43:33.800
 which is on loop in my house sometimes,

1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:35.560
 for hours and hours.

1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:37.000
 That song is fascinating.

1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:38.720
 Bob Marley's song.

1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:41.200
 Song by Johnny Cash and Joe Strummer.

1:43:41.200 --> 1:43:43.200
 You know, sometimes I think what it would be

1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:46.120
 to be a fly on the wall when these guys were doing this.

1:43:46.120 --> 1:43:48.520
 These songs of freedom.

1:43:48.520 --> 1:43:51.140
 There's certain songs where you're like,

1:43:51.140 --> 1:43:56.140
 it elicits an emotion that's unlike anything else.

1:43:58.660 --> 1:44:01.980
 I mean, I was trying to figure that out with Rick, too.

1:44:01.980 --> 1:44:04.620
 Like, there's certain songs that make you wanna pull out

1:44:04.620 --> 1:44:07.340
 over to the side of the road and just weep

1:44:07.340 --> 1:44:11.660
 or just get inspired to just get shit done

1:44:11.660 --> 1:44:13.260
 or all of those kinds of things.

1:44:13.260 --> 1:44:16.620
 Remember your family, the people you've lost,

1:44:16.620 --> 1:44:17.460
 all that kind of stuff.

1:44:17.460 --> 1:44:20.980
 When you hurt, I hurt myself today

1:44:20.980 --> 1:44:22.940
 to see if I still feel.

1:44:22.940 --> 1:44:26.080
 There's certain songs that I've loved so much

1:44:26.080 --> 1:44:29.380
 that I actually won't play them during a relationship

1:44:29.380 --> 1:44:32.660
 until the relationship passes a certain duration

1:44:32.660 --> 1:44:35.560
 because if you start sharing in those experiences

1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:38.020
 with somebody and it starts to become associated

1:44:38.020 --> 1:44:40.180
 with the relationship, you braiding it in

1:44:40.180 --> 1:44:43.860
 with the dopamine of love and that relationship ends,

1:44:43.860 --> 1:44:45.480
 the song is forever tainted.

1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:47.220
 There are certain songs that I will never play

1:44:47.220 --> 1:44:49.260
 in the company of anybody else.

1:44:49.260 --> 1:44:50.620
 They're mine.

1:44:50.620 --> 1:44:54.980
 I just, it's too risky to give those up.

1:44:54.980 --> 1:44:58.900
 And you know, and I think that.

1:44:58.900 --> 1:45:00.700
 And there's like levels.

1:45:00.700 --> 1:45:04.020
 There are levels, right, exactly.

1:45:04.020 --> 1:45:05.820
 We'll leave it at that.

1:45:05.820 --> 1:45:10.020
 Yeah, and the interesting thing about this kind

1:45:10.020 --> 1:45:12.900
 of preparing for the solo episode,

1:45:14.060 --> 1:45:17.140
 just interacting with Rick about that process

1:45:17.140 --> 1:45:22.140
 of preparation and because you mentioned with interviews.

1:45:23.420 --> 1:45:25.140
 By the way, are you do solo, solo?

1:45:25.140 --> 1:45:26.900
 Are you the only one in the room or?

1:45:26.900 --> 1:45:30.180
 No, well, it used to be Rob, my producer,

1:45:30.180 --> 1:45:33.900
 who I should say, you know, he's really the person

1:45:33.900 --> 1:45:35.540
 behind the podcast.

1:45:35.540 --> 1:45:37.540
 I mean, first of all, we're equal partners.

1:45:37.540 --> 1:45:38.900
 You're just a pretty face.

1:45:40.180 --> 1:45:41.900
 We're just, and I'm aging, man.

1:45:41.900 --> 1:45:43.340
 Not to say I love him.

1:45:43.340 --> 1:45:45.500
 I actually really, I like aging.

1:45:45.500 --> 1:45:46.340
 It's weird.

1:45:46.340 --> 1:45:47.900
 I'm like friends with David Sinclair

1:45:47.900 --> 1:45:49.540
 and it's all about not aging.

1:45:49.540 --> 1:45:52.540
 I don't wanna live past 90, 95.

1:45:52.540 --> 1:45:54.340
 I'm just trying to get as much done as I can

1:45:54.340 --> 1:45:56.020
 in this short life and do it right

1:45:56.020 --> 1:46:00.820
 and with integrity and heart and accuracy, you know.

1:46:00.820 --> 1:46:02.460
 And you like the stages.

1:46:02.460 --> 1:46:05.340
 Oh yeah, if you read Erickson's stages of development,

1:46:05.340 --> 1:46:08.620
 you realize that every stage of life

1:46:08.620 --> 1:46:12.140
 is a set of neural circuits trying to resolve a problem.

1:46:12.140 --> 1:46:16.140
 And if you're gonna try and avoid that progression

1:46:16.140 --> 1:46:19.820
 sure, you might live longer, but you know,

1:46:19.820 --> 1:46:21.140
 it's sort of like saying like,

1:46:21.140 --> 1:46:25.380
 do you wanna go win the high school jujitsu championship?

1:46:25.380 --> 1:46:28.540
 No, you graduated high school a long time ago, right?

1:46:28.540 --> 1:46:32.140
 So I actually look forward to the future,

1:46:32.140 --> 1:46:34.980
 even if it means that I'm starting to shift.

1:46:34.980 --> 1:46:37.060
 I think that my biology will shift.

1:46:37.060 --> 1:46:37.900
 Oh, you know, I'll fight that.

1:46:37.900 --> 1:46:39.140
 I try and take good care of myself,

1:46:39.140 --> 1:46:41.140
 but I don't wanna get sick.

1:46:41.140 --> 1:46:43.060
 I don't wanna suffer, who does?

1:46:43.060 --> 1:46:46.580
 But I'm embracing this whole developmental arc.

1:46:46.580 --> 1:46:49.780
 I mean, we're not children and then adults.

1:46:49.780 --> 1:46:52.820
 Our entire life is one long developmental arc.

1:46:52.820 --> 1:46:54.780
 And if you fail to embrace that,

1:46:54.780 --> 1:46:56.420
 you fail to extract the richness

1:46:56.420 --> 1:46:58.620
 of what it is to be a human being.

1:46:58.620 --> 1:47:03.620
 So in any event, I record Rob is in the room.

1:47:05.780 --> 1:47:08.060
 I'll sometimes stop and ask him for feedback

1:47:08.060 --> 1:47:09.740
 if I feel like something's not landing right.

1:47:09.740 --> 1:47:11.580
 So he gives, if it's clear, he'll let me know.

1:47:11.580 --> 1:47:12.820
 If it's not clear, he'll let me know.

1:47:12.820 --> 1:47:13.660
 Excuse me.

1:47:13.660 --> 1:47:15.580
 And then, you know, Costello used to be in the room.

1:47:15.580 --> 1:47:18.380
 The early days of the podcast, which weren't that long ago,

1:47:19.300 --> 1:47:22.180
 he's snoring at my feet and farting

1:47:22.180 --> 1:47:23.180
 and smelling up the room.

1:47:23.180 --> 1:47:24.980
 And we're all just kind of like gasping for air.

1:47:24.980 --> 1:47:25.820
 He's a bulldog.

1:47:25.820 --> 1:47:26.860
 That's what they do.

1:47:26.860 --> 1:47:28.900
 With him gone, it changed.

1:47:28.900 --> 1:47:30.180
 You know, the whole thing changed.

1:47:30.180 --> 1:47:31.740
 There will be another dog soon.

1:47:32.700 --> 1:47:35.300
 And as you know, I've been moving

1:47:35.300 --> 1:47:36.540
 through that grief process,

1:47:36.540 --> 1:47:41.540
 but having him there gave me a levity that I miss.

1:47:41.540 --> 1:47:43.100
 But in my mind, he's still there.

1:47:43.100 --> 1:47:43.940
 Yeah, he's still there.

1:47:43.940 --> 1:47:44.900
 Yeah, he's still there.

1:47:44.900 --> 1:47:47.740
 So, and you know, in time there'll be another dog

1:47:47.740 --> 1:47:49.780
 and who knows, you know, maybe there'll be a dog

1:47:49.780 --> 1:47:51.300
 and a couple of infants running around,

1:47:51.300 --> 1:47:52.820
 but that would be more distracting.

1:47:52.820 --> 1:47:57.820
 So, but it's, there's no podcast that exists

1:47:58.020 --> 1:47:59.540
 just because of the podcaster.

1:47:59.540 --> 1:48:01.820
 This is true for Joe, this is true for your podcast,

1:48:01.820 --> 1:48:03.860
 for me, that there's, it's not just a staff

1:48:03.860 --> 1:48:05.220
 of people to post stuff.

1:48:05.220 --> 1:48:07.060
 That's just the top level contour.

1:48:07.060 --> 1:48:09.220
 There's the constant feedback and iteration

1:48:09.220 --> 1:48:11.620
 of what you want it to become

1:48:11.620 --> 1:48:14.540
 and trying to hold on to something

1:48:14.540 --> 1:48:16.540
 that's essential along the way.

1:48:16.540 --> 1:48:17.620
 Cause everything has to evolve,

1:48:17.620 --> 1:48:20.460
 but you can't lose the essence of something.

1:48:20.460 --> 1:48:24.100
 Anytime a company or brand or a course

1:48:24.100 --> 1:48:27.820
 or a scientist has done that, it just ends up terrible.

1:48:27.820 --> 1:48:29.180
 It just is a, you know, it becomes

1:48:29.180 --> 1:48:31.380
 like a Senator version of itself.

1:48:31.380 --> 1:48:35.660
 So to Rick is very, the power of the people in the room

1:48:35.660 --> 1:48:39.700
 is great to inspire and to destroy.

1:48:39.700 --> 1:48:42.140
 So you have to be extremely careful

1:48:42.140 --> 1:48:44.460
 with the selection of people that are in the room.

1:48:44.460 --> 1:48:46.540
 To me, I never really thought of it that way.

1:48:46.540 --> 1:48:50.980
 I thought only positive things can happen.

1:48:50.980 --> 1:48:51.900
 Oh, by adding people in the room?

1:48:51.900 --> 1:48:52.740
 By adding people in the room.

1:48:52.740 --> 1:48:55.300
 Oh, I think if there were an audience in the room for,

1:48:55.300 --> 1:48:56.540
 well, you know what, someday I'd love

1:48:56.540 --> 1:48:58.180
 to do a live podcast with you.

1:48:59.420 --> 1:49:01.980
 I saw you doing like a couple of live things,

1:49:01.980 --> 1:49:04.380
 which is great that you're paving the way there to try.

1:49:04.380 --> 1:49:06.140
 Well, we did one, I went up to University

1:49:06.140 --> 1:49:11.140
 of British Columbia and did a lecture on a college campus.

1:49:11.700 --> 1:49:13.780
 And one of the more gratifying things that happened

1:49:13.780 --> 1:49:16.060
 is this kid, he's in his early twenties, I think,

1:49:16.060 --> 1:49:17.580
 stood up and said, you know,

1:49:17.580 --> 1:49:19.740
 I've never been on a college campus.

1:49:19.740 --> 1:49:22.140
 I didn't think I could go onto a college campus.

1:49:22.140 --> 1:49:23.500
 And that still rings in my mind.

1:49:23.500 --> 1:49:25.340
 Whoever you are out there, that meant so much to me.

1:49:25.340 --> 1:49:27.740
 Cause I was like, yes, there was something about that to me.

1:49:27.740 --> 1:49:30.300
 I was like, okay, this, it made sense to come all the way

1:49:30.300 --> 1:49:31.620
 up here and do this in person.

1:49:31.620 --> 1:49:34.700
 Cause you can get out to a lot more people online.

1:49:34.700 --> 1:49:35.660
 Public speaking events,

1:49:35.660 --> 1:49:37.580
 it's not like it's that lucrative or anything.

1:49:37.580 --> 1:49:39.300
 I mean, unless you're whatever,

1:49:39.300 --> 1:49:41.780
 you're a famous celebrity or politician or something,

1:49:41.780 --> 1:49:43.120
 I'm sure there are people that do well with it,

1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:44.700
 but that's not what it's about for us.

1:49:44.700 --> 1:49:47.260
 It's really about being able to connect with people

1:49:47.260 --> 1:49:50.740
 in a different venue and for interactions like that.

1:49:50.740 --> 1:49:53.700
 I don't know how many of them we will do,

1:49:53.700 --> 1:49:55.500
 but I'm curious to see how it goes,

1:49:55.500 --> 1:49:57.940
 but I'd love to do a podcast with you.

1:49:57.940 --> 1:50:02.940
 Is it energizing? My fear is the fear of the introvert

1:50:03.780 --> 1:50:08.020
 is that I don't know if I can handle so much love

1:50:08.020 --> 1:50:11.940
 and fascinating people all around.

1:50:11.940 --> 1:50:14.020
 It's like, I don't know.

1:50:14.020 --> 1:50:16.180
 Well, we'll invite a few haters too.

1:50:16.180 --> 1:50:19.900
 Well, yes, but I love the haters too, but I don't know.

1:50:19.900 --> 1:50:20.860
 It makes me nervous.

1:50:20.860 --> 1:50:23.140
 Cause Jordan Peterson is currently on tour.

1:50:23.140 --> 1:50:24.460
 I got a chance to hang out with him.

1:50:24.460 --> 1:50:28.180
 Oh right, he does a lot of live speaking.

1:50:28.180 --> 1:50:31.900
 Yeah, he's now on tour where he does like every other day.

1:50:33.300 --> 1:50:35.460
 But he doesn't have any small kids at home anymore.

1:50:35.460 --> 1:50:36.580
 So you can't do that.

1:50:36.580 --> 1:50:38.180
 So yeah, you should do it before you have a fan.

1:50:38.180 --> 1:50:39.020
 It's also exhausting.

1:50:39.020 --> 1:50:42.380
 I mean, I'm just speaking from an athlete perspective,

1:50:42.380 --> 1:50:45.980
 like if you're Mick Jagger with the Rolling Stones,

1:50:45.980 --> 1:50:50.980
 it's just physically, I mean, you have to speak potentially

1:50:50.980 --> 1:50:55.980
 for two hours, then off stage, like hanging out with people.

1:50:56.620 --> 1:50:58.460
 It's a lot of hours.

1:50:58.460 --> 1:51:00.020
 It's a lot of hours to stay focused,

1:51:00.020 --> 1:51:04.460
 to keep finding your place of like calmness and excitement.

1:51:04.460 --> 1:51:05.700
 Well, and you're staying in hotels,

1:51:05.700 --> 1:51:07.540
 your circadian rhythm is disrupted.

1:51:07.540 --> 1:51:09.420
 You're not getting your like cold and sauna

1:51:09.420 --> 1:51:10.380
 and your workout every day.

1:51:10.380 --> 1:51:11.820
 Your food isn't optimal.

1:51:12.780 --> 1:51:15.620
 I think done in patches, I could enjoy it

1:51:15.620 --> 1:51:17.220
 because it's fun to meet people from different places.

1:51:17.220 --> 1:51:19.900
 I'm doing a public lecture in Copenhagen

1:51:19.900 --> 1:51:22.820
 for the Lundbeck Foundation in June, June 3rd.

1:51:22.820 --> 1:51:25.020
 And that one is particularly gratifying for me

1:51:25.020 --> 1:51:27.580
 because the Lundbeck Foundation is an academic foundation.

1:51:27.580 --> 1:51:29.500
 So the fact that, and then so when they invited,

1:51:29.500 --> 1:51:31.740
 I asked, do you want me to talk about what my lab does

1:51:31.740 --> 1:51:33.580
 or do you want me to talk about the stuff on the podcast?

1:51:33.580 --> 1:51:35.500
 They're like, no, no, not your lab.

1:51:35.500 --> 1:51:37.460
 We want to hear about this, like health stuff

1:51:37.460 --> 1:51:39.380
 and the stuff that we cover on the podcast.

1:51:39.380 --> 1:51:43.300
 So that was amusing to me and tells me that things

1:51:43.300 --> 1:51:44.140
 are changing now.

1:51:44.140 --> 1:51:47.180
 I think 2020 and 2021 revealed a lot of things

1:51:47.180 --> 1:51:50.060
 about people to ourselves.

1:51:50.060 --> 1:51:52.020
 But one thing that it made very clear

1:51:52.020 --> 1:51:55.700
 is that there's an enormous appetite for tools

1:51:55.700 --> 1:51:56.740
 for mental and physical health,

1:51:56.740 --> 1:51:58.100
 but also understanding about science

1:51:58.100 --> 1:51:59.580
 and how science is done.

1:51:59.580 --> 1:52:02.420
 So thanks to you, again, I'm not saying this to flatter you.

1:52:02.420 --> 1:52:03.740
 It's true gratitude.

1:52:03.740 --> 1:52:07.300
 There's now a runway for scientists to talk to people.

1:52:07.300 --> 1:52:09.060
 I mean, you had the, I always forget this guy's name,

1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:10.940
 the virus guy from Columbia.

1:52:10.940 --> 1:52:12.140
 It's a wrecking yellow.

1:52:12.140 --> 1:52:13.340
 Yeah, amazing, right?

1:52:13.340 --> 1:52:16.460
 I mean, forgetting the controversy around all the stuff

1:52:16.460 --> 1:52:17.500
 of 2020, 21.

1:52:17.500 --> 1:52:21.860
 I mean, he is an encyclopedia of all things virology.

1:52:21.860 --> 1:52:24.460
 Yeah, people should listen to his podcast

1:52:24.460 --> 1:52:25.660
 this week in virology.

1:52:25.660 --> 1:52:28.140
 He's also an incredible lecturer and educator.

1:52:28.140 --> 1:52:30.340
 It's fascinating.

1:52:30.340 --> 1:52:33.580
 It's fascinating when people take again that leap

1:52:33.580 --> 1:52:36.060
 of putting all that education online.

1:52:36.060 --> 1:52:39.220
 That's non controversial at all.

1:52:39.220 --> 1:52:43.300
 It's like everybody there, people should go listen to him

1:52:43.300 --> 1:52:47.580
 for the most part in terms of, at his best, at least.

1:52:47.580 --> 1:52:48.780
 There's no politics in it.

1:52:48.780 --> 1:52:50.140
 There's none of that.

1:52:50.140 --> 1:52:51.660
 No, he's a virus jockey.

1:52:51.660 --> 1:52:55.700
 He likes playing around with bacteria and viruses and.

1:52:55.700 --> 1:52:57.820
 But that said, molecular biology.

1:52:57.820 --> 1:53:00.480
 We all say stuff carelessly all the time.

1:53:00.480 --> 1:53:02.700
 So he gets in a bit of trouble on some of the things

1:53:02.700 --> 1:53:06.500
 you've said about like dismissing lab leak theory.

1:53:06.500 --> 1:53:07.940
 Like, there's no way.

1:53:07.940 --> 1:53:08.780
 He dismisses that.

1:53:08.780 --> 1:53:10.940
 Yeah, but not, he's not making,

1:53:10.940 --> 1:53:15.940
 like folks, there's a difference when you say stuff

1:53:16.580 --> 1:53:20.820
 like off the cuff and when you say stuff

1:53:20.820 --> 1:53:22.340
 that's like courts your principles

1:53:22.340 --> 1:53:25.060
 and you've thought about it for a very long time.

1:53:25.060 --> 1:53:28.340
 You talking for hours, for hundreds of hours

1:53:28.340 --> 1:53:29.660
 and you can just say stuff.

1:53:29.660 --> 1:53:31.360
 You could just say your opinions.

1:53:32.860 --> 1:53:34.780
 Will Smith slapped.

1:53:34.780 --> 1:53:36.020
 I was wondering, okay, wait,

1:53:36.020 --> 1:53:37.180
 how long have we been recording?

1:53:37.180 --> 1:53:38.580
 I was wondering how long it was gonna take us

1:53:38.580 --> 1:53:40.300
 before someone talked about Ukraine.

1:53:40.300 --> 1:53:41.340
 No, no, Will Smith.

1:53:41.340 --> 1:53:43.240
 I was wondering whether or not we'd make it the end.

1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:45.020
 I had it planned.

1:53:45.020 --> 1:53:46.940
 I was literally in the back of my mind.

1:53:46.940 --> 1:53:48.420
 I had it planned that at the end,

1:53:48.420 --> 1:53:50.860
 if we didn't talk about the Will Smith, Chris Rock thing,

1:53:50.860 --> 1:53:52.920
 that I was gonna say, it's amazing.

1:53:52.920 --> 1:53:54.580
 This is the first conversation to happen

1:53:54.580 --> 1:53:58.040
 in a long time where it wasn't mentioned.

1:53:58.040 --> 1:53:59.460
 Oh, no.

1:53:59.460 --> 1:54:01.020
 No, do not pull it up.

1:54:01.020 --> 1:54:01.860
 We don't need to see it.

1:54:01.860 --> 1:54:02.680
 We don't need to see it.

1:54:02.680 --> 1:54:03.520
 Here we go.

1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:04.340
 It revealed some interesting things

1:54:04.340 --> 1:54:08.900
 about human beings, impulse control and lack thereof.

1:54:08.900 --> 1:54:11.760
 But, you know, oh my goodness.

1:54:11.760 --> 1:54:13.940
 Chris Rock has a material for the rest of his career.

1:54:13.940 --> 1:54:16.620
 Yeah, I think he's not short on material.

1:54:16.620 --> 1:54:21.140
 But I do, see, if I knew what I wanted to tweet,

1:54:21.140 --> 1:54:23.620
 if I knew you a lot to just slap comedians,

1:54:23.620 --> 1:54:25.020
 my conversation with Tim Dillon

1:54:25.020 --> 1:54:27.140
 would have gone very differently.

1:54:27.140 --> 1:54:29.220
 People just being humans.

1:54:29.220 --> 1:54:33.260
 There's so much fascinating human nature on display there.

1:54:33.260 --> 1:54:37.460
 It's also, in terms of it becoming a topic

1:54:37.460 --> 1:54:39.380
 that a lot of people are talking about

1:54:39.380 --> 1:54:41.020
 versus the war in Ukraine, for example,

1:54:41.020 --> 1:54:42.280
 is also fascinating to watch,

1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:46.180
 like just these kind of news cycles moving through.

1:54:46.180 --> 1:54:48.140
 I think, if I may, I'm sorry to interrupt,

1:54:48.140 --> 1:54:53.020
 but, you know, anytime we observe something very limbic,

1:54:53.020 --> 1:54:55.260
 very emotional, you know,

1:54:55.260 --> 1:54:59.660
 we generally can empathize somewhat, right?

1:54:59.660 --> 1:55:00.980
 We all know what it's like to feel angry.

1:55:00.980 --> 1:55:02.260
 We all know what it's like to feel ashamed.

1:55:02.260 --> 1:55:04.500
 We all know what it's like to feel shocked.

1:55:04.500 --> 1:55:09.380
 Images of war are, for most people, very hard to relate to.

1:55:09.380 --> 1:55:12.460
 We see it, it's, you know, there are these images

1:55:12.460 --> 1:55:15.260
 and they're very traumatic and challenging

1:55:15.260 --> 1:55:16.100
 to look at at times,

1:55:16.100 --> 1:55:17.500
 and yet most people have no idea

1:55:17.500 --> 1:55:19.780
 what it feels like to be shot at

1:55:19.780 --> 1:55:21.660
 or what it feels like to have your home destroyed

1:55:21.660 --> 1:55:26.260
 or what it feels like to be an aggressor in that way.

1:55:26.260 --> 1:55:29.180
 So it's very, so I think that people naturally orient

1:55:29.180 --> 1:55:31.780
 towards things that feel familiar to them,

1:55:31.780 --> 1:55:33.540
 even though the circumstances are different.

1:55:33.540 --> 1:55:36.500
 And people also forget, they look at these celebrities,

1:55:37.780 --> 1:55:39.900
 that's just like looking at criticism of Will Smith,

1:55:39.900 --> 1:55:43.220
 you forget that they're human too.

1:55:43.220 --> 1:55:45.580
 That's one of the most surprising things for me,

1:55:45.580 --> 1:55:48.300
 having done this podcast and met celebrities

1:55:48.300 --> 1:55:50.020
 and stuff like that.

1:55:50.020 --> 1:55:52.020
 They're human, they're all human.

1:55:52.020 --> 1:55:53.140
 And that's inspiring to me,

1:55:53.140 --> 1:55:55.980
 like some of these great folks that have won Nobel Prizes

1:55:55.980 --> 1:55:57.460
 and built some cool things,

1:55:57.460 --> 1:55:59.460
 they're just human, like the rest of us.

1:55:59.460 --> 1:56:01.420
 Well, and if you look at actors and actresses,

1:56:01.420 --> 1:56:03.060
 I mean, there's some amazing ones, right?

1:56:03.060 --> 1:56:05.260
 And who also do well in the outside life,

1:56:05.260 --> 1:56:09.740
 but their careers were built on the business

1:56:09.740 --> 1:56:12.900
 of pretending to be other people.

1:56:12.900 --> 1:56:16.460
 And that's got to distort maybe positively,

1:56:16.460 --> 1:56:19.020
 but also just let's be honest,

1:56:19.020 --> 1:56:21.020
 what it is that the neuroplasticity there,

1:56:21.020 --> 1:56:22.860
 the changes in the areas of the brain

1:56:22.860 --> 1:56:25.420
 that represent personality have to be quite different

1:56:25.420 --> 1:56:26.700
 for somebody who pretends to be

1:56:26.700 --> 1:56:28.940
 lots of different personalities and gets paid for it.

1:56:28.940 --> 1:56:30.820
 You're working the reward system

1:56:30.820 --> 1:56:33.260
 into the system of self identity.

1:56:33.260 --> 1:56:37.260
 And you have to imagine that that can really

1:56:38.500 --> 1:56:41.220
 contort somebody's neurology

1:56:41.220 --> 1:56:43.780
 in ways that maybe they are not as,

1:56:43.780 --> 1:56:45.860
 maybe they are not in touch with reality

1:56:45.860 --> 1:56:47.060
 in the same way that we are.

1:56:47.060 --> 1:56:47.940
 Remember earlier we were talking about

1:56:47.940 --> 1:56:49.420
 neurotic versus psychotic.

1:56:50.300 --> 1:56:52.180
 They may be more borderline

1:56:53.140 --> 1:56:56.100
 in their kind of ground state than we think.

1:56:56.100 --> 1:56:58.260
 And so I'm actually impressed anytime there's a celebrity

1:56:58.260 --> 1:57:00.540
 who doesn't have a messed up life.

1:57:00.540 --> 1:57:02.900
 I'm like, oh wow, finally somebody who's managed

1:57:02.900 --> 1:57:05.860
 to maintain some semblance,

1:57:05.860 --> 1:57:08.260
 at least from the outside, of normalcy.

1:57:08.260 --> 1:57:11.300
 So first of all, I can empathize

1:57:11.300 --> 1:57:14.140
 with the actions that Will Smith did, right?

1:57:14.140 --> 1:57:16.500
 They're not, I think they're kind of,

1:57:16.500 --> 1:57:18.540
 not kind of, they're just shitty.

1:57:18.540 --> 1:57:21.580
 You should probably talk privately, man to man,

1:57:21.580 --> 1:57:24.660
 not, because otherwise it's like a dramatic display.

1:57:24.660 --> 1:57:27.980
 It's almost like you are a fake, you're acting.

1:57:27.980 --> 1:57:29.740
 Well, there are all these questions, right?

1:57:29.740 --> 1:57:33.140
 I mean, obviously it was aggressive at some level.

1:57:33.140 --> 1:57:36.180
 There's this question of whether or not it was impulsive.

1:57:36.180 --> 1:57:37.380
 I think most people feel yes.

1:57:37.380 --> 1:57:39.540
 There's a question, there was the protective nature of it

1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:42.220
 because he was doing it to, you know,

1:57:42.220 --> 1:57:43.940
 apparently in defense.

1:57:43.940 --> 1:57:47.180
 But then there's also the context,

1:57:47.180 --> 1:57:49.480
 he lost touch with the context, right?

1:57:50.620 --> 1:57:52.740
 Whereas Chris Rock basically gets,

1:57:53.700 --> 1:57:56.740
 there's the possible critique that he went too far.

1:57:56.740 --> 1:57:59.140
 That's gonna be in the eye of the beholder.

1:57:59.140 --> 1:58:01.620
 But then, and depending on how you view comedy and jokes,

1:58:01.620 --> 1:58:04.100
 but then there's also the fact that he took that slap

1:58:04.100 --> 1:58:05.220
 and then just snapped right back,

1:58:05.220 --> 1:58:07.500
 so much so that people thought maybe it was fake.

1:58:07.500 --> 1:58:10.020
 He also waited with his hands behind his back.

1:58:10.020 --> 1:58:12.260
 That's just natural, he likes to stand like that.

1:58:12.260 --> 1:58:17.260
 I mean, I got to a little bit of a story here

1:58:18.260 --> 1:58:22.740
 to connect to what Chris Rock did.

1:58:22.740 --> 1:58:27.260
 Like I wish, what Chris Rock did in terms of just

1:58:27.260 --> 1:58:28.540
 taking the slap and keep going,

1:58:28.540 --> 1:58:30.720
 first of all, just props for somebody

1:58:30.720 --> 1:58:33.740
 that's able to maintain cool in that situation

1:58:33.740 --> 1:58:35.220
 for the most part.

1:58:35.220 --> 1:58:36.900
 I think I like watched it once.

1:58:36.900 --> 1:58:39.300
 You only have to be alive on this planet

1:58:39.300 --> 1:58:42.060
 to see it, you can't avoid seeing it.

1:58:42.060 --> 1:58:47.060
 I wish at that afterwards, he would sort of say something

1:58:47.860 --> 1:58:52.460
 loving and kind to Will Smith and his wife

1:58:52.460 --> 1:58:56.180
 and then hit him real hard, lean into the joke.

1:58:56.180 --> 1:59:00.100
 But I think in hockey, they call it taking a number.

1:59:00.100 --> 1:59:01.700
 I have a friend who plays hockey and there's this idea

1:59:01.700 --> 1:59:04.500
 that if someone checks you really badly in one game,

1:59:04.500 --> 1:59:06.260
 you don't go and check them again,

1:59:06.260 --> 1:59:07.240
 you don't get into a fight.

1:59:07.240 --> 1:59:11.120
 But three games later, you blade them in the shin.

1:59:14.700 --> 1:59:18.220
 The ability to defer and to handle it

1:59:18.220 --> 1:59:20.260
 in whatever fashion one feels is appropriate.

1:59:20.260 --> 1:59:22.540
 They're probably also friends and all those kinds of things

1:59:22.540 --> 1:59:25.900
 that they respect each other, so he probably didn't,

1:59:25.900 --> 1:59:27.740
 but there's a comedian instinct.

1:59:27.740 --> 1:59:32.740
 I saw this, I was at an open mic here in Texas.

1:59:33.300 --> 1:59:35.620
 I won't say where, there's many open mics.

1:59:35.620 --> 1:59:36.460
 Have you gone to a few of these?

1:59:36.460 --> 1:59:37.460
 These are pretty good.

1:59:37.460 --> 1:59:42.460
 No, so there is more sort of rougher kind of.

1:59:44.180 --> 1:59:47.420
 Yeah, you've been hanging out in West Texas lately.

1:59:47.420 --> 1:59:50.540
 Austin's too tame for Lex, so he's headed to West Texas.

1:59:50.540 --> 1:59:53.180
 Exactly, I put on a cowboy hat

1:59:53.180 --> 1:59:54.700
 and instantly I became a cowboy.

1:59:54.700 --> 1:59:56.580
 I've been talking like a cowboy.

1:59:56.580 --> 1:59:58.940
 I mean, I belong out there in the desert.

1:59:58.940 --> 2:00:02.180
 He's gone from eating meat and athletic greens

2:00:02.180 --> 2:00:03.980
 to rattlesnakes, rattlesnake jerky.

2:00:03.980 --> 2:00:04.940
 Exactly.

2:00:04.940 --> 2:00:08.460
 No, there was a, open mic is late at night

2:00:08.460 --> 2:00:11.100
 and I was one of the only people in the audience.

2:00:11.100 --> 2:00:15.340
 There's a couple of drunk folks, a few drunk folks.

2:00:15.340 --> 2:00:20.340
 One of them was a couple, like bikers with helmets and so on,

2:00:22.620 --> 2:00:23.500
 a guy and a girl.

2:00:23.500 --> 2:00:27.580
 And then the comedian, the open mic comedian,

2:00:28.740 --> 2:00:31.780
 did a joke about people who wear helmets.

2:00:31.780 --> 2:00:33.340
 I don't know if it was on purpose or not,

2:00:33.340 --> 2:00:34.780
 but he did the joke.

2:00:34.780 --> 2:00:38.980
 And then the guy about women who wear helmets.

2:00:38.980 --> 2:00:41.780
 And the guy, it's this exact same situation.

2:00:41.780 --> 2:00:44.180
 The guy stood up, walked up to him.

2:00:44.180 --> 2:00:45.020
 There was no slap.

2:00:45.020 --> 2:00:45.860
 It's so interesting,

2:00:45.860 --> 2:00:47.940
 because this happened before the Will Smith thing.

2:00:47.940 --> 2:00:51.180
 So he walked up to the comedian

2:00:51.180 --> 2:00:56.180
 and said, I think he pointed his finger down

2:00:59.300 --> 2:01:01.380
 and told him to stop or something like that.

2:01:01.380 --> 2:01:02.900
 And then sat down.

2:01:02.900 --> 2:01:05.540
 This is an audience of like six people.

2:01:05.540 --> 2:01:09.140
 And at midnight around then, there's nobody,

2:01:09.140 --> 2:01:10.460
 no security, nothing.

2:01:10.460 --> 2:01:11.300
 In Texas.

2:01:11.300 --> 2:01:12.140
 In Texas.

2:01:12.140 --> 2:01:12.980
 Which implies.

2:01:12.980 --> 2:01:16.220
 And then this guy was the energy drunk,

2:01:16.220 --> 2:01:21.220
 but also a biker and what he felt his lady

2:01:23.100 --> 2:01:25.660
 was now attacked by the comedian, right?

2:01:25.660 --> 2:01:26.540
 With his words.

2:01:27.940 --> 2:01:32.900
 And the comedian was a kind of out of shape, small guy.

2:01:32.900 --> 2:01:37.180
 So he's not threatening at all and probably in trouble.

2:01:37.180 --> 2:01:39.220
 And the comedian, after he sat down,

2:01:39.220 --> 2:01:41.340
 he looked a little bit scared.

2:01:41.340 --> 2:01:43.620
 He paced back and forth.

2:01:43.620 --> 2:01:47.580
 And then he did the joke again.

2:01:47.580 --> 2:01:48.660
 Wow.

2:01:48.660 --> 2:01:50.820
 And I was sitting and I started,

2:01:50.820 --> 2:01:53.300
 I leaned back and I just did this like,

2:01:55.140 --> 2:01:56.980
 because that is comedy.

2:01:56.980 --> 2:02:00.620
 And the guy was getting angrier and angrier.

2:02:00.620 --> 2:02:02.500
 And he just sat there.

2:02:02.500 --> 2:02:06.100
 And the comedian went on for a couple more minutes

2:02:06.100 --> 2:02:09.300
 and then did another bad joke,

2:02:09.300 --> 2:02:10.660
 but another joke about him.

2:02:10.660 --> 2:02:12.700
 It's just like, he leaned into it.

2:02:12.700 --> 2:02:15.820
 If you go to a small comedy club, open mic or otherwise,

2:02:15.820 --> 2:02:17.220
 you're in the shooting gallery.

2:02:17.220 --> 2:02:21.900
 Like you're basically there teed up as a pin to get it.

2:02:21.900 --> 2:02:24.340
 We went and saw Andrew Scholls in San Francisco.

2:02:24.340 --> 2:02:25.180
 In San Francisco?

2:02:25.180 --> 2:02:26.380
 Yeah, it was hilarious.

2:02:26.380 --> 2:02:27.220
 It was amazing.

2:02:27.220 --> 2:02:30.020
 I mean, he's just masterful in his ability

2:02:30.020 --> 2:02:32.500
 to command an audience.

2:02:32.500 --> 2:02:34.380
 But I felt for the people up front,

2:02:34.380 --> 2:02:37.420
 but no sympathy either because you buy tickets

2:02:37.420 --> 2:02:41.460
 to sit up front at a Scholls show, you're gonna get it.

2:02:41.460 --> 2:02:43.140
 But he was very loving.

2:02:43.140 --> 2:02:44.660
 Yeah, and funny.

2:02:44.660 --> 2:02:46.100
 First of all, funny.

2:02:46.100 --> 2:02:48.300
 The funniness really helps you.

2:02:48.300 --> 2:02:52.820
 But the ethic of the comedian is like that fearlessness.

2:02:52.820 --> 2:02:57.540
 What I really liked is like the danger,

2:02:57.540 --> 2:03:00.700
 there's risk to comedy and there's also consequences.

2:03:00.700 --> 2:03:02.300
 Have you watched that show?

2:03:02.300 --> 2:03:03.140
 What is it?

2:03:03.140 --> 2:03:04.580
 The Marvelous Miss Maisel show?

2:03:04.580 --> 2:03:05.820
 It's really good.

2:03:05.820 --> 2:03:07.740
 I watched a few of them.

2:03:07.740 --> 2:03:09.100
 Guilty pleasure there.

2:03:09.100 --> 2:03:14.100
 She plays a comic in the, I think it's mid 1960s in New York.

2:03:14.940 --> 2:03:18.940
 And there's a character that somewhat resembles Lenny Bruce.

2:03:18.940 --> 2:03:21.220
 It's sort of meant to be Lenny Bruce.

2:03:21.220 --> 2:03:24.260
 And they're always getting arrested and this kind of thing.

2:03:24.260 --> 2:03:25.620
 I think I learned about it from Joe.

2:03:25.620 --> 2:03:27.180
 Anyway, the writing is great.

2:03:27.180 --> 2:03:28.020
 It's very funny.

2:03:29.260 --> 2:03:32.460
 But yeah, comedy is designed to push boundaries, right?

2:03:32.460 --> 2:03:36.940
 And to say the thing that other people aren't,

2:03:36.940 --> 2:03:38.180
 feel they can't say.

2:03:38.180 --> 2:03:39.460
 Not something in science, right?

2:03:39.460 --> 2:03:40.460
 Science you're supposed to,

2:03:40.460 --> 2:03:43.340
 etiquette is a big part of how you communicate ideas.

2:03:43.340 --> 2:03:46.300
 It's about constraining communication.

2:03:46.300 --> 2:03:48.420
 This is something, I mean, I confess on the podcast,

2:03:48.420 --> 2:03:52.500
 in the goals of making it clear, interesting,

2:03:52.500 --> 2:03:54.500
 surprising and actionable,

2:03:54.500 --> 2:03:57.100
 you have to constrain the amount

2:03:57.100 --> 2:03:58.420
 and the style of information.

2:03:58.420 --> 2:04:01.260
 Otherwise it becomes something else altogether, right?

2:04:02.780 --> 2:04:05.460
 I saw Sandra Perchay, Google CEO,

2:04:05.460 --> 2:04:08.620
 said that he likes the thing you mentioned,

2:04:08.620 --> 2:04:11.940
 not the yoga nidra, but the NSDR,

2:04:11.940 --> 2:04:15.020
 non sleep deep rest podcast over meditation.

2:04:15.900 --> 2:04:16.940
 I don't know if you saw that.

2:04:16.940 --> 2:04:18.380
 Yeah, I saw that, yeah.

2:04:18.380 --> 2:04:19.460
 Yeah.

2:04:19.460 --> 2:04:20.300
 Why?

2:04:20.300 --> 2:04:21.140
 What do you think that is?

2:04:21.140 --> 2:04:22.500
 What do you think the difference is?

2:04:22.500 --> 2:04:25.460
 Yeah, so non sleep deep rest, NSDR is an acronym

2:04:25.460 --> 2:04:28.420
 that I coined because it encompasses a lot of practices

2:04:28.420 --> 2:04:31.180
 that are not meditation per se,

2:04:31.180 --> 2:04:32.780
 but that bring the brain and body

2:04:32.780 --> 2:04:34.940
 into a state of relaxation and focus.

2:04:34.940 --> 2:04:37.100
 So hypnosis is one variant of NSDR.

2:04:37.100 --> 2:04:38.580
 There are other variants of NSDR.

2:04:38.580 --> 2:04:40.620
 You can just look these up and you'll find them.

2:04:40.620 --> 2:04:42.460
 And I think that they've caught on

2:04:42.460 --> 2:04:47.460
 and that the CEO of Google is an avid practitioner of NSDR

2:04:49.620 --> 2:04:51.580
 because it has this amazing ability

2:04:51.580 --> 2:04:53.980
 to reset your energy levels and focus.

2:04:53.980 --> 2:04:57.420
 Whereas with meditation, many people find meditation hard.

2:04:57.420 --> 2:04:58.900
 And part of the reason they find it hard

2:04:58.900 --> 2:05:00.980
 is that it requires focus.

2:05:00.980 --> 2:05:04.380
 NSDR is a state which is very calm and relaxing.

2:05:04.380 --> 2:05:05.580
 You don't have to work too hard.

2:05:05.580 --> 2:05:06.820
 You're just listening to a script,

2:05:06.820 --> 2:05:08.980
 whereas most forms of meditation, not all,

2:05:08.980 --> 2:05:11.860
 but most forms of meditation involve cranking up

2:05:11.860 --> 2:05:14.180
 the activity in your prefrontal cortex

2:05:14.180 --> 2:05:16.620
 and trying to see your thoughts

2:05:16.620 --> 2:05:18.020
 as opposed to thinking your thoughts

2:05:18.020 --> 2:05:20.180
 or focus on your breath,

2:05:20.180 --> 2:05:23.300
 but then third personing yourself in some respect

2:05:23.300 --> 2:05:24.140
 and that's work.

2:05:24.140 --> 2:05:26.540
 And so many people who meditate quite intensely

2:05:26.540 --> 2:05:28.180
 feel more exhausted.

2:05:28.180 --> 2:05:30.140
 Now that doesn't mean that meditation

2:05:30.140 --> 2:05:31.580
 doesn't have any utility,

2:05:31.580 --> 2:05:33.900
 but it's distinctly different than NSDR.

2:05:33.900 --> 2:05:35.460
 And I think that people are working,

2:05:35.460 --> 2:05:37.260
 certainly the CEO of Google I have to imagine

2:05:37.260 --> 2:05:39.500
 is working very hard and using his forebrain.

2:05:39.500 --> 2:05:42.260
 If he's going to have 20 or 30 minutes to take a break,

2:05:42.260 --> 2:05:44.420
 he should, and I think this is what he's doing,

2:05:44.420 --> 2:05:46.940
 he should go out for a jog and not listen to anything

2:05:46.940 --> 2:05:48.780
 and just kind of let his mind wander

2:05:48.780 --> 2:05:52.340
 or sit there in a chair and just zone out or do NSDR.

2:05:52.340 --> 2:05:57.340
 The problem is people are not that good at shifting states.

2:05:57.540 --> 2:05:59.300
 We are all actually pretty good at,

2:05:59.300 --> 2:06:01.820
 even people with severe ADHD,

2:06:01.820 --> 2:06:03.460
 we had an episode about this,

2:06:03.460 --> 2:06:07.260
 can become hyper focused on things that they actually enjoy

2:06:07.260 --> 2:06:10.460
 because dope and most of the drugs designed to treat ADHD

2:06:10.460 --> 2:06:12.660
 are drugs that increase the levels of dopamine.

2:06:12.660 --> 2:06:13.500
 So when you like something,

2:06:13.500 --> 2:06:15.300
 there's dopamine release and you can focus.

2:06:15.300 --> 2:06:17.140
 It's when you don't like something that's hard to focus,

2:06:17.140 --> 2:06:18.860
 shifting states is hard.

2:06:18.860 --> 2:06:19.900
 I'm sure you've experienced this.

2:06:19.900 --> 2:06:22.180
 If you've ever been in deep research or podcasting,

2:06:22.180 --> 2:06:24.580
 podcasting, and then all of a sudden you go for a run,

2:06:24.580 --> 2:06:27.140
 you probably spend the first third of that run thinking.

2:06:27.140 --> 2:06:28.420
 And then in the middle third,

2:06:28.420 --> 2:06:30.900
 you're kind of that thinking is fractured a bit.

2:06:30.900 --> 2:06:32.100
 And then in the final third

2:06:32.100 --> 2:06:34.300
 is where you finally get to relax

2:06:34.300 --> 2:06:37.100
 because the brain doesn't shift states very quickly.

2:06:37.100 --> 2:06:39.140
 We can go from sleep to wakefulness quickly.

2:06:39.140 --> 2:06:41.700
 We can go from wakefulness to sleep quickly,

2:06:41.700 --> 2:06:45.020
 but we don't shift between different states of consciousness

2:06:45.020 --> 2:06:49.420
 like a step function, except in rare cases, right?

2:06:49.420 --> 2:06:50.420
 Fear is one.

2:06:50.420 --> 2:06:51.980
 All of a sudden we hear an explosion right now,

2:06:51.980 --> 2:06:52.860
 it's a step function.

2:06:52.860 --> 2:06:55.660
 We're in fear or we're in alertness, right?

2:06:56.740 --> 2:06:57.980
 A heightened state of alertness.

2:06:57.980 --> 2:07:01.020
 But NSDR is terrific at allowing people

2:07:01.020 --> 2:07:03.060
 to learn to shift their state.

2:07:03.060 --> 2:07:05.500
 And I actually would venture to argue that

2:07:07.420 --> 2:07:09.900
 part of the value of meditation and exercise

2:07:09.900 --> 2:07:11.460
 is the actual state that you get into

2:07:11.460 --> 2:07:13.420
 in deep meditation or exercise,

2:07:13.420 --> 2:07:16.180
 but just as valuable is the transition

2:07:16.180 --> 2:07:17.700
 that you have to take yourself through

2:07:17.700 --> 2:07:20.940
 from one state of mind to the other and then back again.

2:07:20.940 --> 2:07:23.980
 When I look, David Goggins, he always seems to come up

2:07:23.980 --> 2:07:25.980
 because he represents so many important things,

2:07:25.980 --> 2:07:29.660
 drive, determination, override of emotional state,

2:07:29.660 --> 2:07:31.620
 going from being a 300 pound plus person

2:07:31.620 --> 2:07:32.820
 to a fit person through,

2:07:32.820 --> 2:07:35.620
 he's never revealed anything substantial

2:07:35.620 --> 2:07:36.780
 about what he ate or what he didn't eat.

2:07:36.780 --> 2:07:39.660
 He basically says like, listen, run a lot, eat less, right?

2:07:40.980 --> 2:07:44.060
 But what's remarkable is so much of what he says

2:07:44.060 --> 2:07:46.300
 is about those transitions,

2:07:46.300 --> 2:07:48.980
 about taking oneself from a state of I don't want to

2:07:48.980 --> 2:07:52.220
 to scruffing oneself and like you're gonna do it anyway.

2:07:52.220 --> 2:07:55.460
 And then being able to carry that into regular life,

2:07:55.460 --> 2:07:56.420
 so to speak.

2:07:56.420 --> 2:08:00.140
 So I think that NSDR is immensely powerful.

2:08:00.140 --> 2:08:01.260
 It's zero cost.

2:08:01.260 --> 2:08:04.660
 And one of the reasons I'm such a fan of people doing it

2:08:04.660 --> 2:08:08.220
 is that most people don't stick to a meditation practice.

2:08:08.220 --> 2:08:09.380
 There are also been a few cases

2:08:09.380 --> 2:08:10.300
 you might find this interesting.

2:08:10.300 --> 2:08:11.940
 There's a book by Scott Carney.

2:08:11.940 --> 2:08:13.100
 I forget what it's called.

2:08:13.100 --> 2:08:15.220
 I think it's called the transcendence trap or something.

2:08:15.220 --> 2:08:16.220
 I'm gonna have that title wrong,

2:08:16.220 --> 2:08:20.100
 but there have been a fair number of cases of people

2:08:20.100 --> 2:08:22.580
 that go and do very extensive meditation,

2:08:22.580 --> 2:08:24.500
 silent meditation retreats,

2:08:24.500 --> 2:08:28.060
 who then return to normal life and end up killing themselves.

2:08:28.060 --> 2:08:31.340
 There are states of mind inside of extended meditations

2:08:31.340 --> 2:08:34.020
 or silent meditations that are very beneficial.

2:08:34.020 --> 2:08:37.020
 And I'm certainly not suggesting people don't meditate,

2:08:37.020 --> 2:08:39.060
 but I know at least one person who came back

2:08:39.060 --> 2:08:41.140
 from one of these long extended meditation retreats

2:08:41.140 --> 2:08:43.740
 and wasn't able to shift their state back

2:08:43.740 --> 2:08:45.700
 into one that was functional in regular life.

2:08:45.700 --> 2:08:47.620
 And that book includes a very dramatic story.

2:08:47.620 --> 2:08:50.300
 I don't wanna give it away in case people

2:08:50.300 --> 2:08:51.140
 check out the book,

2:08:51.140 --> 2:08:53.540
 but Scott told the story to me directly once,

2:08:53.540 --> 2:08:58.140
 where someone feels they've reached enlightenment

2:08:58.140 --> 2:09:00.500
 and then commit suicide.

2:09:00.500 --> 2:09:03.100
 So these very unusual brain states

2:09:03.100 --> 2:09:06.380
 are potentially hazardous if people can't return from them.

2:09:07.260 --> 2:09:11.060
 So it's nice to focus not on those brain states,

2:09:11.060 --> 2:09:12.580
 but instead on the shifting.

2:09:12.580 --> 2:09:15.300
 Right, this morning I woke up a little bit earlier

2:09:15.300 --> 2:09:16.140
 than I would have liked.

2:09:16.140 --> 2:09:18.860
 I use this reverie app that's research backed,

2:09:18.860 --> 2:09:20.620
 REVRI.com.

2:09:20.620 --> 2:09:23.400
 There's a free version of it or you can try it for free.

2:09:23.400 --> 2:09:24.240
 So I feel comfortable.

2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:25.060
 That's for hypnosis?

2:09:25.060 --> 2:09:25.900
 For hypnosis.

2:09:25.900 --> 2:09:29.140
 And I do a self hypnosis to put me back into sleep.

2:09:29.140 --> 2:09:29.980
 And if I can't sleep,

2:09:29.980 --> 2:09:31.540
 you just put me into a state of deep relaxation.

2:09:31.540 --> 2:09:35.300
 I would put hypnosis under the category of NSDR,

2:09:35.300 --> 2:09:37.220
 yoga nidra under the category of NSDR.

2:09:37.220 --> 2:09:39.500
 There are now some NSDR scripts online

2:09:39.500 --> 2:09:42.100
 if you just go to YouTube that you can just listen to.

2:09:42.100 --> 2:09:43.140
 Do you like those?

2:09:43.140 --> 2:09:43.980
 I do, yeah.

2:09:43.980 --> 2:09:45.340
 I think the one from made for is quite good.

2:09:45.340 --> 2:09:46.860
 I have an affiliation with them, but it's free.

2:09:46.860 --> 2:09:48.540
 So I feel comfortable mentioning it.

2:09:48.540 --> 2:09:50.820
 I do, I really like the reverie app.

2:09:50.820 --> 2:09:52.620
 I can vary.

2:09:52.620 --> 2:09:53.700
 And as you, the more you do them,

2:09:53.700 --> 2:09:55.000
 the more quickly you can shift your brain

2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:56.740
 into a state of deep relaxation.

2:09:56.740 --> 2:09:59.740
 I will sometimes stop mid podcast.

2:09:59.740 --> 2:10:02.460
 If it's, sometimes our recordings go seven, eight hours

2:10:02.460 --> 2:10:04.620
 and I'll stop and I'll do a one minute hypnosis.

2:10:04.620 --> 2:10:06.540
 They have one minute hypnosis inside reverie.

2:10:06.540 --> 2:10:08.140
 You're only going to,

2:10:08.140 --> 2:10:10.220
 you're only going to find that one minute hypnosis

2:10:10.220 --> 2:10:13.500
 is effective if you are routinely doing 10

2:10:13.500 --> 2:10:16.940
 and 15 minute hypnosis in addition to that.

2:10:16.940 --> 2:10:19.420
 Meaning I do it every other day or so at 10 or 15.

2:10:19.420 --> 2:10:22.940
 So there's a, is there a YouTube one minute hypnosis

2:10:22.940 --> 2:10:23.780
 or is this for the reverie?

2:10:23.780 --> 2:10:25.460
 There are, but inside of reverie as well.

2:10:25.460 --> 2:10:26.580
 You can find them online.

2:10:26.580 --> 2:10:27.400
 A really good.

2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:28.580
 Pull it up so I can see.

2:10:28.580 --> 2:10:29.580
 Yeah, so reverie is good.

2:10:29.580 --> 2:10:32.940
 And then Michael Sealy, S E A L E Y.

2:10:32.940 --> 2:10:34.860
 He has some long hypnosis scripts, but again,

2:10:34.860 --> 2:10:37.480
 these are all free and you know,

2:10:37.480 --> 2:10:40.460
 there's a lot of good research now on the neural networks

2:10:40.460 --> 2:10:42.380
 and it shifts your so called default network,

2:10:42.380 --> 2:10:43.780
 the default mode network.

2:10:43.780 --> 2:10:46.900
 It shifts how much of your forebrain you're using.

2:10:46.900 --> 2:10:48.700
 And it also is very, very good.

2:10:48.700 --> 2:10:51.900
 If I get so many questions about,

2:10:51.900 --> 2:10:53.080
 hey, I'm really upset.

2:10:53.080 --> 2:10:55.860
 I found out about my girlfriend's sexual past

2:10:55.860 --> 2:10:57.120
 or, hey, I'm so upset.

2:10:57.120 --> 2:10:58.420
 I found out that my boyfriend was cheating

2:10:58.420 --> 2:10:59.940
 or, oh, so and so died.

2:10:59.940 --> 2:11:01.300
 How do I get over these emotions?

2:11:01.300 --> 2:11:02.380
 How do I deal with them?

2:11:02.380 --> 2:11:05.060
 And hypnosis has shown to be very useful for people

2:11:05.060 --> 2:11:07.180
 to learn to bring themselves into a state

2:11:07.180 --> 2:11:12.060
 of deep relaxation, to literally project in their mind's eye

2:11:12.060 --> 2:11:15.400
 these very intense things that they don't like.

2:11:15.400 --> 2:11:19.600
 And then for people to associate with other emotions

2:11:19.600 --> 2:11:21.440
 in their body to learn to be calm

2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:23.660
 while feeling your feelings,

2:11:23.660 --> 2:11:26.900
 to dissociate the mind body communication to some extent.

2:11:26.900 --> 2:11:28.500
 Just observe the feelings.

2:11:28.500 --> 2:11:30.360
 Observe them and start to associate them

2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:31.840
 with positive experiences.

2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:32.800
 You're an Android guy,

2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:35.340
 so soon it should be available on Android.

2:11:35.340 --> 2:11:36.700
 Then it doesn't exist for me.

2:11:36.700 --> 2:11:37.540
 Yeah, I know.

2:11:37.540 --> 2:11:38.900
 It's only, you know, I don't get it.

2:11:38.900 --> 2:11:40.840
 Android is the device of the people,

2:11:40.840 --> 2:11:43.300
 all you elitist people with your iPhones.

2:11:43.300 --> 2:11:44.500
 Tell me this about Android.

2:11:44.500 --> 2:11:48.260
 Now you want to, this is the one thing that gets me.

2:11:48.260 --> 2:11:50.760
 Cause I'm very close to someone who uses an Android phone.

2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:51.780
 I feel like that.

2:11:51.780 --> 2:11:53.940
 So you have great people in your life.

2:11:53.940 --> 2:11:54.780
 That's good to know.

2:11:54.780 --> 2:11:56.780
 No, their messages always look green to me,

2:11:56.780 --> 2:11:59.340
 but I answer yours, not despite that.

2:12:00.200 --> 2:12:02.300
 But they, I feel like the Android phones

2:12:02.300 --> 2:12:03.500
 are very trigger happy.

2:12:03.500 --> 2:12:05.380
 Like anything I touch does something.

2:12:05.380 --> 2:12:07.260
 Whereas the Apple phone is kind of built

2:12:07.260 --> 2:12:10.100
 for like a macaque monkey to be able to operate,

2:12:10.100 --> 2:12:12.500
 which is great for me because I'm more of a macaque monkey

2:12:12.500 --> 2:12:14.180
 and you're a more sophisticated ape.

2:12:14.180 --> 2:12:15.060
 Oh, I see.

2:12:15.060 --> 2:12:15.900
 I see.

2:12:15.900 --> 2:12:16.720
 I feel like that.

2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:17.560
 I think like you have to be.

2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:18.380
 They're more sensitive.

2:12:18.380 --> 2:12:19.220
 Yeah, you have to have, you know, I mean,

2:12:19.220 --> 2:12:22.220
 I've got fat fingers, you know, I've got clumsy fingers.

2:12:22.220 --> 2:12:24.860
 The Android is too, well, maybe you need

2:12:24.860 --> 2:12:26.480
 to soften your touch.

2:12:26.480 --> 2:12:27.900
 What I would do is go into the most,

2:12:27.900 --> 2:12:31.420
 sort by most popular, because there's some older ones

2:12:31.420 --> 2:12:33.420
 that I really like and it generally scales with that.

2:12:33.420 --> 2:12:35.500
 So I'll do the, this one,

2:12:35.500 --> 2:12:38.900
 the hypnosis for clearing subconscious negativity.

2:12:38.900 --> 2:12:40.020
 That's an hour long one.

2:12:40.020 --> 2:12:41.840
 The sleep and anxiety one, 40 minutes,

2:12:41.840 --> 2:12:44.100
 but those you listen to as you fall asleep.

2:12:44.100 --> 2:12:44.940
 As you fall asleep.

2:12:44.940 --> 2:12:45.780
 Oh, we're going to do this now?

2:12:45.780 --> 2:12:48.180
 Yeah, yeah, let's listen to it.

2:12:48.180 --> 2:12:52.100
 And I have created this hypnosis recording for you

2:12:52.100 --> 2:12:53.060
 to help you.

2:12:53.060 --> 2:12:53.940
 And this is the voice.

2:12:53.940 --> 2:12:55.900
 How often does the voice pop up?

2:12:55.900 --> 2:12:57.120
 And at the same time.

2:12:57.120 --> 2:12:58.220
 You don't watch it.

2:12:58.220 --> 2:12:59.140
 You just listen to it.

2:12:59.140 --> 2:13:00.320
 Your anxiety.

2:13:03.300 --> 2:13:05.420
 Now, one of the most important things.

2:13:05.420 --> 2:13:06.420
 It's a great voice.

2:13:06.420 --> 2:13:10.300
 At the outset of any self hypnosis experience

2:13:10.300 --> 2:13:12.700
 is to know and understand.

2:13:12.700 --> 2:13:16.880
 So people really should know that stage hypnosis

2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:19.120
 is about the hypnotist getting you to do things

2:13:19.120 --> 2:13:20.380
 you wouldn't normally do.

2:13:21.260 --> 2:13:23.380
 Self hypnosis, which is what we're talking about here,

2:13:23.380 --> 2:13:26.480
 reverie in this is about you getting your brain

2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:28.500
 into the state that you want.

2:13:28.500 --> 2:13:32.060
 And again, I mean, there's a ton of neuroimaging data

2:13:32.060 --> 2:13:34.300
 and work on trauma and pain relief.

2:13:34.300 --> 2:13:36.940
 And our labs are working on this with David Spiegel's lab.

2:13:36.940 --> 2:13:39.340
 I really encourage people to explore NSDR.

2:13:39.340 --> 2:13:41.560
 And if this feels a little too wacky and out there,

2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:44.620
 then I would just put in NSDR into YouTube

2:13:44.620 --> 2:13:46.500
 and there's some good NSDR scripts.

2:13:46.500 --> 2:13:49.740
 Yeah, by the way, Sondar is a fan of your podcast.

2:13:49.740 --> 2:13:50.940
 No, it's okay, we don't need to play it.

2:13:50.940 --> 2:13:52.340
 Yeah, so I don't know him.

2:13:53.780 --> 2:13:56.700
 But I get a lot of media outlets picked up

2:13:56.700 --> 2:13:58.860
 on his love of NSDR.

2:13:58.860 --> 2:14:01.680
 And I have to imagine running Google involves a lot of,

2:14:01.680 --> 2:14:02.860
 juggling a lot of.

2:14:02.860 --> 2:14:05.540
 He's one of the great CEOs because everybody loves him.

2:14:05.540 --> 2:14:06.500
 Everybody loves him.

2:14:06.500 --> 2:14:07.520
 Have you interviewed him?

2:14:07.520 --> 2:14:10.300
 No, but we'll do the interview eventually.

2:14:10.300 --> 2:14:13.660
 So it's this annoying thing about me being a stickler

2:14:13.660 --> 2:14:17.440
 for three hours, CEOs don't seem to understand.

2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:20.360
 Like, not understand, but it's scheduling.

2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:23.580
 So what happens is Sondar said, yes, definitely, let's do it.

2:14:23.580 --> 2:14:26.020
 I'm a fan of podcasts, is a fan of yours.

2:14:26.020 --> 2:14:30.140
 And then he goes to his executive assistant like,

2:14:30.140 --> 2:14:32.100
 oh, let's find a slot.

2:14:32.100 --> 2:14:34.020
 And then they immediately think, all right,

2:14:34.020 --> 2:14:35.380
 well, one hour is good.

2:14:35.380 --> 2:14:36.340
 45 minutes.

2:14:36.340 --> 2:14:37.180
 90 minutes.

2:14:37.180 --> 2:14:38.000
 By Zoom.

2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:39.260
 90 minutes, yeah, right.

2:14:39.260 --> 2:14:42.140
 Well, no, they know in person that I'm a stickler on that.

2:14:42.140 --> 2:14:45.140
 But like, it's like, no, we need more.

2:14:45.140 --> 2:14:47.500
 And it's so hard to.

2:14:47.500 --> 2:14:49.540
 Do you still travel to do your podcast or generally?

2:14:49.540 --> 2:14:50.820
 No, most people come down here.

2:14:50.820 --> 2:14:55.820
 Most people, but for certain situations, obviously,

2:14:55.980 --> 2:14:57.660
 like if you're in prison.

2:14:57.660 --> 2:14:59.300
 Right.

2:14:59.300 --> 2:15:00.140
 Or you're ahead of.

2:15:00.140 --> 2:15:02.020
 Imagine if you get out on work for a lot of people

2:15:02.020 --> 2:15:04.540
 that have anklets so that they can go to an Alex Friedman

2:15:04.540 --> 2:15:05.740
 podcast, it'll probably happen.

2:15:05.740 --> 2:15:07.340
 Have you ever been in a prison?

2:15:07.340 --> 2:15:12.340
 No, you know, either a visitation or on the inside.

2:15:13.180 --> 2:15:15.420
 From my hike, I can see San Quentin.

2:15:15.420 --> 2:15:17.180
 It's really weird that San Quentin and Alcatraz,

2:15:17.180 --> 2:15:18.700
 you know, Bay Area, beautiful, everyone thinks like,

2:15:18.700 --> 2:15:21.220
 you know, like there's the Bay and there's Alcatraz

2:15:21.220 --> 2:15:22.060
 and San Quentin sitting right there.

2:15:22.060 --> 2:15:23.440
 Does that make you feel?

2:15:24.860 --> 2:15:27.100
 You know, it's amazing how easy it is to overlook

2:15:27.100 --> 2:15:28.500
 that they're there and forget that they're there.

2:15:28.500 --> 2:15:31.720
 But when I drive by San Quentin, I think about it.

2:15:31.720 --> 2:15:33.060
 I also think about the people who are in there

2:15:33.060 --> 2:15:34.740
 who might be innocent.

2:15:34.740 --> 2:15:37.220
 I've seen some of those episodes on Rogan and elsewhere.

2:15:37.220 --> 2:15:40.140
 And Amanda Knox talks a lot about this, right?

2:15:40.140 --> 2:15:42.560
 Whether or not you believe her story or not,

2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:44.820
 I happen to believe her story, personally,

2:15:44.820 --> 2:15:47.300
 based on what I know, what, you know,

2:15:47.300 --> 2:15:48.820
 I'm sure there are people disagree with me.

2:15:48.820 --> 2:15:52.780
 I think to myself, what it must be like to be in a cell

2:15:52.780 --> 2:15:57.260
 and know in your heart's heart, you didn't do it, you know?

2:15:57.260 --> 2:16:01.100
 I mean, I can't think of many things worse.

2:16:01.100 --> 2:16:02.760
 I can't think of many things worse.

2:16:02.760 --> 2:16:07.760
 That's so clearly unjust, but life is full of unjust things

2:16:08.020 --> 2:16:12.500
 like this, cruel things happen all the time.

2:16:12.500 --> 2:16:16.620
 You lose a loved one for no good reason.

2:16:16.620 --> 2:16:17.860
 You lose your job.

2:16:20.420 --> 2:16:21.660
 You lose your home.

2:16:22.660 --> 2:16:24.500
 Yeah, I've been talking to a lot of refugees now,

2:16:24.500 --> 2:16:27.000
 and the war in Ukraine has really focused my mind

2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:29.220
 to how much suffering there is in the world.

2:16:29.220 --> 2:16:32.180
 And so just cruel things happen all the time.

2:16:32.180 --> 2:16:36.420
 And people kind of, there's this suffering,

2:16:36.420 --> 2:16:38.740
 and you kind of go on.

2:16:38.740 --> 2:16:41.180
 You stick to the people really close to you.

2:16:41.180 --> 2:16:44.420
 There's still love all around you.

2:16:44.420 --> 2:16:47.420
 Traumatic events kind of focus your mind on the,

2:16:47.420 --> 2:16:50.780
 like, very practical, like, okay,

2:16:50.780 --> 2:16:51.900
 how do we solve the problem?

2:16:51.900 --> 2:16:52.780
 How do we escape?

2:16:52.780 --> 2:16:56.900
 Let's solve, like, survival, food, shelter, focus.

2:16:56.900 --> 2:16:58.760
 Remember that book,

2:16:58.760 --> 2:17:01.000
 "'All's Quiet on the Western Front," by World War I?

2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:01.840
 There's this line in there.

2:17:01.840 --> 2:17:02.680
 I forget what it is,

2:17:02.680 --> 2:17:06.100
 about how war is like the smell of a skunk.

2:17:06.100 --> 2:17:09.820
 Like a little bit is actually a little bit is slightly,

2:17:10.900 --> 2:17:12.720
 there's something slightly delicious of it,

2:17:12.720 --> 2:17:14.860
 is what it says in the book.

2:17:14.860 --> 2:17:17.700
 I happen to like the smell of ferrets and skunks and things.

2:17:17.700 --> 2:17:19.420
 I had a pet ferret when I was a kid,

2:17:19.420 --> 2:17:21.900
 and I like that musky scent.

2:17:21.900 --> 2:17:23.740
 Most people, just it's repulsive to them.

2:17:23.740 --> 2:17:25.580
 It's actually a gene, believe it or not.

2:17:25.580 --> 2:17:26.540
 Some people have the gene

2:17:26.540 --> 2:17:29.340
 that makes the musky scent repulsive.

2:17:29.340 --> 2:17:32.740
 Some people love it. Let me ask you this.

2:17:32.740 --> 2:17:34.860
 There's another gene, this is a fun one.

2:17:34.860 --> 2:17:37.260
 Microwave popcorn, smells good, neutral,

2:17:37.260 --> 2:17:38.180
 or disgusting to you?

2:17:38.180 --> 2:17:39.260
 Good, very good.

2:17:39.260 --> 2:17:40.460
 There are people who have a gene

2:17:40.460 --> 2:17:43.060
 that leads them to the perception

2:17:43.060 --> 2:17:46.100
 that the smell of microwave popcorn that you find is good,

2:17:46.100 --> 2:17:48.340
 it smells like putrid vomit to them.

2:17:48.340 --> 2:17:51.140
 It's a particular gene variant,

2:17:51.140 --> 2:17:52.520
 and they can smell certain elements

2:17:52.520 --> 2:17:54.580
 within the microwave popcorn.

2:17:55.660 --> 2:17:58.780
 It's pretty, it's prominent in France.

2:17:58.780 --> 2:18:01.580
 This gene, and so in laboratories

2:18:01.580 --> 2:18:04.300
 where you have a lot of French people,

2:18:04.300 --> 2:18:05.620
 it's often said like you're not allowed

2:18:05.620 --> 2:18:06.580
 to make microwave popcorn.

2:18:06.580 --> 2:18:09.400
 It smells putrid, disgusting, you know?

2:18:09.400 --> 2:18:12.860
 So a lot of it's in the perception of the beholder, right?

2:18:14.580 --> 2:18:18.080
 But okay, before I leave the NSDR,

2:18:18.080 --> 2:18:23.080
 focus in general, as you said, it's for shifting mind states.

2:18:23.600 --> 2:18:28.140
 Is there advice you have for how to achieve focus

2:18:28.140 --> 2:18:29.800
 on a task?

2:18:29.800 --> 2:18:31.200
 Yes.

2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:32.520
 First of all, we have to distinguish

2:18:32.520 --> 2:18:34.780
 between modulators and mediators,

2:18:34.780 --> 2:18:36.700
 and I'll do this very briefly.

2:18:36.700 --> 2:18:37.580
 There are a lot of things

2:18:37.580 --> 2:18:39.200
 that will modulate your state of focus,

2:18:39.200 --> 2:18:42.140
 but they don't directly mediate your sense of focus.

2:18:42.140 --> 2:18:44.960
 So for instance, if right now a fire alarm went off

2:18:44.960 --> 2:18:48.060
 in this building, it would modulate our attention.

2:18:48.060 --> 2:18:49.020
 We would get up and leave.

2:18:49.020 --> 2:18:50.460
 It would be very hard to do what we're doing

2:18:50.460 --> 2:18:53.220
 with that banging in the background, at least at first.

2:18:53.220 --> 2:18:58.220
 So it's modulating focus, but it's not really involved

2:18:58.300 --> 2:19:00.120
 in the mechanisms of focus, right?

2:19:01.020 --> 2:19:04.440
 In the same way, being well rested when you sleep,

2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:06.560
 your autonomic nervous system that adjusts states

2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:09.100
 of alertness and focus and calm works better

2:19:09.100 --> 2:19:10.560
 than when you're sleep deprived.

2:19:10.560 --> 2:19:12.560
 So if you're sleeping better, you're gonna focus better.

2:19:12.560 --> 2:19:15.740
 So I always answer this way to a question like this,

2:19:15.740 --> 2:19:18.440
 because the best thing that anyone can do

2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:20.640
 for their mental health, physical health, and performance

2:19:20.640 --> 2:19:23.340
 in athletic or cognitive endeavors or creative endeavors

2:19:23.340 --> 2:19:26.880
 is to make sure that you're getting enough quality sleep,

2:19:26.880 --> 2:19:28.340
 enough of the time for you.

2:19:28.340 --> 2:19:29.180
 And that's gonna differ.

2:19:29.180 --> 2:19:30.380
 We could talk about what that means.

2:19:30.380 --> 2:19:33.380
 Now, in terms of things that mediate focus

2:19:33.380 --> 2:19:35.100
 without getting into the description of mechanisms,

2:19:35.100 --> 2:19:36.800
 cause we have podcasts about that.

2:19:37.980 --> 2:19:42.060
 It's very clear that mental focus follows visual focus,

2:19:42.060 --> 2:19:44.020
 provided that you're a sighted person.

2:19:45.180 --> 2:19:47.660
 Much of the training that's being done now in China

2:19:47.660 --> 2:19:49.540
 to teach kids to focus better,

2:19:49.540 --> 2:19:52.980
 literally has them stare at a target,

2:19:52.980 --> 2:19:55.720
 blinking every so often, but really training themselves

2:19:55.720 --> 2:19:59.480
 to breathe calmly and maintain a tight visual aperture.

2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:02.200
 When you read, you have to maintain

2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:03.220
 a tight visual aperture.

2:20:03.220 --> 2:20:04.940
 You're literally scrolling like a highlighter

2:20:04.940 --> 2:20:06.580
 in your mind's eye, right?

2:20:06.580 --> 2:20:08.140
 It's kind of obvious once you hear it.

2:20:08.140 --> 2:20:10.900
 So for people that have problems focusing sleep well,

2:20:12.740 --> 2:20:17.020
 learn to dilate and contract your visual field consciously.

2:20:17.020 --> 2:20:19.660
 This can be done if you practice it a little bit.

2:20:19.660 --> 2:20:21.420
 And then as I said before,

2:20:21.420 --> 2:20:23.340
 it is very hard to get into a state of focus,

2:20:23.340 --> 2:20:26.020
 like a step function immediately, like snapping your fingers.

2:20:26.020 --> 2:20:28.260
 What you can do is you can pick any object,

2:20:28.260 --> 2:20:31.540
 but ideally an object at roughly the same distance,

2:20:31.540 --> 2:20:32.920
 placed at roughly the same distance

2:20:32.920 --> 2:20:35.820
 to which you're going to do that work and stare at it.

2:20:35.820 --> 2:20:36.940
 You're allowed to blink.

2:20:36.940 --> 2:20:39.460
 And as your mind starts to drift every once in a while

2:20:39.460 --> 2:20:40.940
 to understand that's normal,

2:20:40.940 --> 2:20:43.380
 but try and narrow your visual aperture

2:20:43.380 --> 2:20:45.980
 and bring that into your visual field

2:20:45.980 --> 2:20:47.420
 so that that's the most prominent thing,

2:20:47.420 --> 2:20:49.300
 kind of like portrait mode in your phone.

2:20:49.300 --> 2:20:51.000
 This would look very different in portrait mode

2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:53.540
 than it would in just a standard photograph mode.

2:20:53.540 --> 2:20:57.140
 And then after doing that for 30 to 60 seconds,

2:20:57.140 --> 2:20:58.860
 moving into the work that you're about to do

2:20:58.860 --> 2:21:01.280
 and really encourage yourself to do that.

2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:03.500
 If you're somebody who's low vision or no vision,

2:21:03.500 --> 2:21:05.160
 you're going to use your ears to do this.

2:21:05.160 --> 2:21:08.380
 Braille readers have trouble focusing sometimes

2:21:08.380 --> 2:21:11.660
 because they feel other stuff and they hear other stuff.

2:21:11.660 --> 2:21:15.180
 So you learn to adjust that aperture consciously.

2:21:15.180 --> 2:21:17.480
 And then of course the pharmacologic tools,

2:21:17.480 --> 2:21:20.780
 just enough caffeine, but not too much, right?

2:21:20.780 --> 2:21:22.460
 We talked about white noise, brown noise,

2:21:22.460 --> 2:21:24.720
 music or no music, really varies,

2:21:24.720 --> 2:21:28.860
 but it's very clear that binaural beats of 40 Hertz

2:21:28.860 --> 2:21:31.320
 can shift the brain into a heightened state

2:21:31.320 --> 2:21:32.600
 of focus and cognition.

2:21:32.600 --> 2:21:34.060
 So if you're going to use binaural beats,

2:21:34.060 --> 2:21:37.100
 which should definitely be used with headphones,

2:21:37.100 --> 2:21:39.980
 and there are a number of free apps out there and sources,

2:21:39.980 --> 2:21:43.220
 40 Hertz seems to be the frequency

2:21:43.220 --> 2:21:45.740
 that best supports the brain shifting

2:21:45.740 --> 2:21:46.580
 into a particular mode of focus.

2:21:46.580 --> 2:21:49.620
 Sorry, can you give us some binaural beats?

2:21:49.620 --> 2:21:51.060
 Yeah, so you're going to look for,

2:21:51.060 --> 2:21:54.920
 you'd want to find an app that offers 40 Hertz.

2:21:54.920 --> 2:21:59.920
 I think Brainwave allows you to slide bar

2:21:59.960 --> 2:22:02.460
 up to the particular frequency that you want.

2:22:02.460 --> 2:22:05.220
 And I should say that there are other frequencies

2:22:05.220 --> 2:22:07.980
 that are interesting, but 40 Hertz binaural beats

2:22:07.980 --> 2:22:09.060
 seems to be the one

2:22:09.060 --> 2:22:11.100
 that there's the most quality research on.

2:22:11.100 --> 2:22:14.900
 So it's like a beat, but you're saying

2:22:14.900 --> 2:22:16.300
 there's a lot of mixed science

2:22:16.300 --> 2:22:19.340
 on the white noise and brown noise.

2:22:19.340 --> 2:22:21.500
 You really should be doing this with headphones

2:22:21.500 --> 2:22:23.140
 because binaural beats are best accomplished

2:22:23.140 --> 2:22:26.020
 by feeding two different frequencies to the two ears.

2:22:26.020 --> 2:22:28.180
 And then you have what's called this brainstem area

2:22:28.180 --> 2:22:30.240
 that reads out what are called interaural time differences.

2:22:30.240 --> 2:22:33.100
 And then it extracts the delta essentially.

2:22:33.100 --> 2:22:33.940
 Turn it up.

2:22:33.940 --> 2:22:38.940
 And then in other things that can enhance focus.

2:22:41.240 --> 2:22:43.280
 So, you know, the pharmacology around this

2:22:43.280 --> 2:22:44.120
 is pretty interesting.

2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:45.600
 Things that tickle the dopamine pathway

2:22:45.600 --> 2:22:47.540
 and the acetylcholine pathway, they work.

2:22:47.540 --> 2:22:48.680
 Yeah.

2:22:48.680 --> 2:22:50.080
 There's your Ritalin, your Adderals,

2:22:50.080 --> 2:22:51.840
 your Modafinils, which are prescription.

2:22:51.840 --> 2:22:54.120
 And there's a lot of non prescription use

2:22:54.120 --> 2:22:55.680
 of those prescription drugs.

2:22:55.680 --> 2:22:57.400
 Not so much in my generation,

2:22:57.400 --> 2:23:00.600
 but in people 35 and younger, you know,

2:23:00.600 --> 2:23:02.420
 I hear all the time from day traders

2:23:02.420 --> 2:23:04.720
 and programmers and stuff and kids that play video games,

2:23:04.720 --> 2:23:07.000
 a lot of Ritalin Adderall use.

2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:08.920
 I think that unless it's prescribed by a doctor

2:23:08.920 --> 2:23:10.820
 for a specific purpose of ADHD,

2:23:10.820 --> 2:23:12.960
 I don't think people should go that route, frankly.

2:23:12.960 --> 2:23:15.000
 Hits the dopamine system way too hard.

2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:19.600
 Also has a number of negative effects on sexual side effects,

2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:21.520
 all sorts of things that you just wouldn't want.

2:23:21.520 --> 2:23:25.000
 There are a few compounds like alpha GPC,

2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:27.760
 300 milligrams to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC

2:23:27.760 --> 2:23:28.960
 with a cup of espresso.

2:23:28.960 --> 2:23:32.720
 If you're well rested, you're like a laser for 90 minutes,

2:23:32.720 --> 2:23:35.240
 maybe two hours, but then it's going to taper off

2:23:35.240 --> 2:23:37.080
 and you have to just recognize that.

2:23:37.080 --> 2:23:39.800
 And then there's this whole world of nootropics now

2:23:39.800 --> 2:23:42.280
 and people trying to figure out the racetams,

2:23:42.280 --> 2:23:45.560
 paracetams and phenol ethylamine combined with this.

2:23:45.560 --> 2:23:47.200
 And, you know, it's not quite in the place

2:23:47.200 --> 2:23:48.360
 where you'd like it to be.

2:23:48.360 --> 2:23:49.200
 There are a few companies

2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:50.480
 that are doing this better than others.

2:23:50.480 --> 2:23:51.960
 We talk about some of these on the podcast,

2:23:51.960 --> 2:23:55.240
 but I would always start with behavioral tools

2:23:55.240 --> 2:23:57.400
 and then consider pharmacology.

2:23:57.400 --> 2:24:00.600
 And then I suppose the other thing for focus

2:24:00.600 --> 2:24:03.120
 is there are these, this is a little more esoteric,

2:24:03.120 --> 2:24:06.240
 but we cover this in an episode on workplace optimization.

2:24:07.100 --> 2:24:09.960
 Where you place your screen is important.

2:24:09.960 --> 2:24:12.840
 Staring down at a screen is not going to be as effective

2:24:12.840 --> 2:24:15.120
 as placing it at eye level or above you.

2:24:15.120 --> 2:24:16.200
 When the eyes are up,

2:24:16.200 --> 2:24:18.660
 literally when your eyes are directed forward or up,

2:24:18.660 --> 2:24:21.040
 the brainstem centers for alertness are activated.

2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:24.200
 When your eyes are down, it's actually you're sort of,

2:24:24.200 --> 2:24:25.880
 it's like being pulled under water a little bit

2:24:25.880 --> 2:24:27.760
 in the autonomic arousal sense.

2:24:27.760 --> 2:24:32.480
 It's your closing your eyes is one,

2:24:32.480 --> 2:24:34.440
 it reflects the brainstem centers

2:24:34.440 --> 2:24:36.200
 that are active becoming less,

2:24:36.200 --> 2:24:39.840
 or for alertness, excuse me, becoming less active.

2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:41.020
 But there's a really cool effect

2:24:41.020 --> 2:24:42.560
 that's active in this room right now,

2:24:42.560 --> 2:24:45.280
 which is that there've been some really interesting studies

2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:48.160
 that when people work in small compact spaces

2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:49.760
 or wear a hoodie or a hat,

2:24:49.760 --> 2:24:53.320
 that can also improve focus like blinders on a horse

2:24:53.320 --> 2:24:55.640
 for obvious reasons now, based on what I said before,

2:24:55.640 --> 2:24:59.640
 but also analytic work or the kind of work

2:24:59.640 --> 2:25:02.240
 where there's a correct answer that you're seeking

2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:05.460
 is best supported by these kind of low ceiling environments.

2:25:05.460 --> 2:25:07.920
 Whereas there's something called the cathedral effect,

2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:09.800
 which is when you work in an outdoor environment

2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:11.140
 or a high ceiling environment,

2:25:11.140 --> 2:25:14.640
 it lends itself to kind of pun intended,

2:25:14.640 --> 2:25:17.600
 kind of loftier ideas and more creativity.

2:25:17.600 --> 2:25:19.160
 And that probably has to do with the fact

2:25:19.160 --> 2:25:21.280
 that there's a natural tendency, a reflex

2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:23.220
 to expand your visual field

2:25:23.220 --> 2:25:25.660
 in these high ceiling environments.

2:25:25.660 --> 2:25:28.480
 Expansion of the visual field

2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:31.820
 changes the way the brain works in the time domain.

2:25:31.820 --> 2:25:35.100
 Your engineering and biology oriented listeners

2:25:35.100 --> 2:25:37.700
 will understand this and music.

2:25:37.700 --> 2:25:39.940
 For those that don't, the best way to think about it

2:25:39.940 --> 2:25:42.800
 is when you have a narrow focus portrait mode on your phone

2:25:42.800 --> 2:25:47.540
 or you're very alert, you are fine slicing life in time.

2:25:47.540 --> 2:25:50.680
 It's like a, think of it as a high frame rate,

2:25:50.680 --> 2:25:52.760
 like you're shooting in slow motion.

2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:56.000
 When you have a, when you dilate your view,

2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:58.000
 you're taking bigger time bins.

2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:01.000
 And that one way to just let this hopefully land home

2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:04.560
 is that if you've ever had a really exciting day

2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:08.280
 or podcast interview or experience of any kind,

2:26:08.280 --> 2:26:11.500
 your system is flooded with dopamine and norepinephrine,

2:26:11.500 --> 2:26:13.800
 alertness and motivation, all this excitement.

2:26:13.800 --> 2:26:15.880
 It seems like it goes by very, very fast.

2:26:15.880 --> 2:26:17.560
 And yet when you think back to that,

2:26:17.560 --> 2:26:19.840
 it seems like a lot happened.

2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:20.840
 This happened and that happened.

2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:23.160
 Now think about waiting in the doctor's office

2:26:23.160 --> 2:26:24.440
 in a blank waiting room

2:26:24.440 --> 2:26:26.720
 with no interesting art on the walls.

2:26:26.720 --> 2:26:29.040
 It feels like it goes by very, very slow.

2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:31.840
 Dopamine and norepinephrine are at all time low.

2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:33.920
 And yet when you think back on that experience,

2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:35.400
 it's as if nothing happened

2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:39.240
 because you were parsing time differently.

2:26:39.240 --> 2:26:41.240
 So those are the roughly the tools

2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:43.720
 and the neurochemicals around time perception

2:26:43.720 --> 2:26:44.920
 and the time domain.

2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:46.760
 There's a wonderful book, I'm forgetting the title,

2:26:46.760 --> 2:26:48.200
 so wonderful I forget the title,

2:26:48.200 --> 2:26:50.960
 by Dean Bodo Mano from UCLA,

2:26:50.960 --> 2:26:53.480
 but I think it's called The Brain is a Time Machine

2:26:53.480 --> 2:26:56.120
 that talks about this expansion and contraction

2:26:56.120 --> 2:26:58.280
 of the time domain and what you can do

2:26:58.280 --> 2:27:01.040
 to leverage it for work and creativity focus and so on.

2:27:01.040 --> 2:27:03.760
 Yeah, it's fascinating that I think one way

2:27:03.760 --> 2:27:07.720
 to define focus for me is the experience,

2:27:07.720 --> 2:27:11.520
 the feeling of focus is losing track of time,

2:27:11.520 --> 2:27:13.860
 is getting to a place where you're no longer

2:27:15.720 --> 2:27:17.960
 operating in time.

2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:21.960
 Well, and you mentioned being kind of cramming for something

2:27:21.960 --> 2:27:24.120
 where you'll release a lot of adrenaline.

2:27:24.120 --> 2:27:27.660
 And it is true, you can get a lot done under pressure

2:27:27.660 --> 2:27:29.960
 because of the way that you're slicing time.

2:27:29.960 --> 2:27:32.040
 You don't actually have more time.

2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:34.020
 It's that you're finally in a brain state

2:27:34.020 --> 2:27:37.480
 that lends itself well to parsing information really quickly.

2:27:37.480 --> 2:27:40.100
 Now, if we ramp up your level of stress enough,

2:27:40.100 --> 2:27:44.400
 it's definitely, it's a more or less normal distribution.

2:27:44.400 --> 2:27:45.440
 We get you stressed enough,

2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:46.480
 it's hard to remember anything,

2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:47.560
 you're not parsing time well.

2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:50.160
 But in that middle range, almost every study shows

2:27:50.160 --> 2:27:51.840
 that the higher levels of autonomic arousal,

2:27:51.840 --> 2:27:54.720
 meaning norepinephrine, adrenaline in your system,

2:27:54.720 --> 2:27:57.560
 the more effective you are at things.

2:27:57.560 --> 2:27:59.700
 And we always hear stress and adrenaline,

2:27:59.700 --> 2:28:00.760
 it's just bad, bad, bad.

2:28:00.760 --> 2:28:02.520
 But my colleague, Ali Krom at Stanford

2:28:02.520 --> 2:28:03.720
 has done these beautiful studies

2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:05.880
 where if you just educate people

2:28:05.880 --> 2:28:10.060
 on how adrenaline makes them sharper thinkers,

2:28:10.060 --> 2:28:11.440
 they become sharper thinkers.

2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:13.240
 If you educate them on the fact that stress

2:28:13.240 --> 2:28:16.680
 makes your cognition worse, their cognition gets worse.

2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:18.280
 This is why I don't wear a sleep tracker.

2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:19.720
 If you tell people they slept poorly,

2:28:19.720 --> 2:28:21.360
 your recovery score sucks,

2:28:21.360 --> 2:28:23.880
 they naturally perform less well the next day

2:28:23.880 --> 2:28:26.680
 than if you tell them your recovery score is high.

2:28:26.680 --> 2:28:28.720
 And so I don't have anything against those companies,

2:28:28.720 --> 2:28:31.440
 but in fact, we use some of their technology,

2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:33.000
 can be very useful in certain contexts,

2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:37.760
 but you want to determine your mindset around these things.

2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:38.600
 And if you tell yourself,

2:28:38.600 --> 2:28:41.880
 hey, deadlines make me sharp, pressure makes me sharp,

2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:43.400
 you will perform better.

2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:48.400
 So stress and anxiety, what is that?

2:28:48.540 --> 2:28:51.180
 And can it be leveraged for good?

2:28:51.180 --> 2:28:55.000
 Absolutely, look, whether or not you get into a cold ice bath

2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:58.040
 or a hot sauna so hot you want to get out,

2:28:58.040 --> 2:29:02.600
 or you get hit square in the face with something over text

2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:06.680
 that you really didn't want to hear or see, it's adrenaline.

2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:07.800
 It's just adrenaline.

2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:09.680
 And so your subjective readout of that

2:29:09.680 --> 2:29:11.600
 and what it means is really important.

2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:13.040
 And you can just channel that.

2:29:13.040 --> 2:29:17.120
 Well, you can, if you agree with the following statement,

2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:20.040
 which I do, and many people do because the data support it,

2:29:20.040 --> 2:29:22.320
 which is Allie Crum's statement, not mine,

2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:24.760
 which is she directs the mind body lab at Stanford.

2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:27.280
 She's brilliant, by the way, brilliant Harvard trained,

2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:30.280
 Yale trained, trained licensed clinical psychologist,

2:29:30.280 --> 2:29:31.520
 also a tenured professor at Stanford.

2:29:31.520 --> 2:29:34.920
 She's a Olympian, no, excuse me,

2:29:34.920 --> 2:29:39.500
 a division one athlete in gymnastics and martial arts.

2:29:39.500 --> 2:29:42.320
 And her dad is a long time martial arts trainer,

2:29:42.320 --> 2:29:43.600
 who's done work with special forces

2:29:43.600 --> 2:29:45.680
 and he's an amazing human being and very humble,

2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:50.320
 very kind, lovely woman and professor scientist.

2:29:50.320 --> 2:29:53.320
 She says, anything that you do and experience,

2:29:53.320 --> 2:29:58.320
 but especially stress is the consequence of that thing

2:29:58.360 --> 2:30:01.040
 and what you believe about that thing.

2:30:01.040 --> 2:30:04.160
 And so if you consume a lot of information

2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:07.720
 about the powers of stressful states to bring out your best,

2:30:07.720 --> 2:30:09.160
 you will perform better.

2:30:09.160 --> 2:30:10.640
 If you consume a lot of information

2:30:10.640 --> 2:30:13.120
 about the power of stress to cripple you,

2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:15.240
 you will perform worse.

2:30:15.240 --> 2:30:18.460
 There's absolutely no question, the data are striking.

2:30:18.460 --> 2:30:20.500
 And this is not growth mindset.

2:30:20.500 --> 2:30:24.140
 This is just simply what do you believe about stress

2:30:24.140 --> 2:30:27.800
 based on the dominant knowledge

2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:28.920
 that you're consuming about it.

2:30:28.920 --> 2:30:31.640
 So that's why it's fun to watch David Goggins,

2:30:31.640 --> 2:30:35.060
 here we go again, David or Jocko or Joe or someone put,

2:30:35.060 --> 2:30:37.680
 or Cam Haynes put out this information about,

2:30:37.680 --> 2:30:39.580
 or Ryan Hall who ran for Stanford

2:30:39.580 --> 2:30:41.480
 and then now is like into the power lifting thing

2:30:41.480 --> 2:30:42.320
 and running.

2:30:43.280 --> 2:30:45.040
 And there are others too, of course.

2:30:45.040 --> 2:30:48.320
 When you start to consume a lot of that information,

2:30:48.320 --> 2:30:49.560
 it's not just inspiring,

2:30:49.560 --> 2:30:51.580
 it actually changes your perception

2:30:51.580 --> 2:30:53.740
 of what your own stressful states mean.

2:30:54.940 --> 2:30:56.880
 You can actually get better from stress

2:30:56.880 --> 2:31:00.980
 if you're in the ocean of knowledge that stress grows you.

2:31:00.980 --> 2:31:03.800
 If you're living in the ocean of knowledge,

2:31:03.800 --> 2:31:05.560
 I was seeing like a pool in the summer,

2:31:05.560 --> 2:31:06.600
 you got the kiddie pool,

2:31:06.600 --> 2:31:08.800
 the kids all peeing in it, presumably.

2:31:08.800 --> 2:31:09.640
 And you got the diving thing,

2:31:09.640 --> 2:31:10.640
 you got the high dive and all that.

2:31:10.640 --> 2:31:13.960
 If you believe that the experience of belly flopping

2:31:13.960 --> 2:31:17.080
 off the high dive is gonna make you a better diver,

2:31:17.080 --> 2:31:20.640
 in some sense, at least in this analogy, it will.

2:31:20.640 --> 2:31:22.960
 Whereas if you feel that it's just the most embarrassing

2:31:22.960 --> 2:31:25.480
 thing ever, and it's gonna cripple your ability

2:31:25.480 --> 2:31:28.780
 to get out in the dive in front of anybody ever again,

2:31:28.780 --> 2:31:31.160
 well, you're right about that too.

2:31:31.160 --> 2:31:34.200
 Yeah, we actually talked with Carl about depression,

2:31:34.200 --> 2:31:37.440
 all those kinds of things that there could be

2:31:37.440 --> 2:31:41.600
 these, what are commonly seen as negative journeys,

2:31:41.600 --> 2:31:46.040
 they could be, when reframed, can be used.

2:31:46.040 --> 2:31:48.160
 You know, one of the reasons I enjoy our friendship so much

2:31:48.160 --> 2:31:50.480
 is that you bring this Russian thing,

2:31:50.480 --> 2:31:52.840
 which I don't really understand it at a deep level,

2:31:52.840 --> 2:31:53.960
 how could I, I'm not Russian,

2:31:53.960 --> 2:31:58.680
 but this mindset like that there's pain in life.

2:31:58.680 --> 2:32:02.200
 When I watched that Hedgehog in the Fog cartoon,

2:32:02.200 --> 2:32:05.100
 I thought, no wonder Russians call it the way they do.

2:32:05.100 --> 2:32:06.840
 This is the most, it's so sad,

2:32:06.840 --> 2:32:08.760
 it's beautiful in Sabbath, it's so sad.

2:32:08.760 --> 2:32:11.080
 Whereas out here, it's like Sesame Street,

2:32:11.080 --> 2:32:13.920
 and my mother would not let me watch Sesame Street

2:32:13.920 --> 2:32:15.000
 when I was a kid.

2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:17.080
 She thought it was too chaotic.

2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:18.320
 Too chaotic. Too chaotic.

2:32:18.320 --> 2:32:19.680
 She was like, it's too chaotic.

2:32:19.680 --> 2:32:20.520
 Too many things going on.

2:32:20.520 --> 2:32:22.160
 Captain Kangaroo, we were allowed,

2:32:22.160 --> 2:32:24.280
 and then Mr. Rogers, we were allowed.

2:32:24.280 --> 2:32:25.420
 I never really liked shows,

2:32:25.420 --> 2:32:28.340
 I liked doing things outside in the yard.

2:32:29.360 --> 2:32:30.680
 I was trying to trap all the animals,

2:32:30.680 --> 2:32:32.080
 I didn't wanna watch stuff on TV.

2:32:32.080 --> 2:32:35.440
 But Hedgehog in the Fog is enough to turn any kid

2:32:35.440 --> 2:32:38.840
 into a thinker and a philosopher and a poet.

2:32:38.840 --> 2:32:40.280
 Here we go.

2:32:40.280 --> 2:32:42.240
 I fell in love with this when you showed,

2:32:42.240 --> 2:32:44.520
 look, it even walks with its arms behind its back.

2:32:44.520 --> 2:32:45.800
 So for people who don't know,

2:32:45.800 --> 2:32:48.820
 and we're watching little clips here to get into,

2:32:48.820 --> 2:32:53.820
 and it's a hedgehog that is wandering about

2:32:54.200 --> 2:32:57.800
 in this fog at night, and.

2:32:57.800 --> 2:32:59.340
 Can't even see a lamp.

2:32:59.340 --> 2:33:00.880
 The fog is so dense.

2:33:00.880 --> 2:33:03.400
 There's a feeling of searching.

2:33:03.400 --> 2:33:08.160
 And then there's a horse that speaks from a distance.

2:33:08.160 --> 2:33:09.080
 Words of wisdom.

2:33:09.080 --> 2:33:12.560
 Some people actually told me that they believe that's God.

2:33:12.560 --> 2:33:15.040
 That's supposed to represent God.

2:33:15.040 --> 2:33:18.840
 I always thought it was a motherly voice, or a voice.

2:33:18.840 --> 2:33:23.160
 A voice of conformity that wants you to return to safety.

2:33:23.160 --> 2:33:27.120
 And here's the hedgehog is searching

2:33:27.120 --> 2:33:31.020
 for something that's in him for the unknown,

2:33:31.020 --> 2:33:32.800
 to explore the unknown.

2:33:32.800 --> 2:33:37.800
 And ultimately, as it, as the cartoon unrolls,

2:33:38.520 --> 2:33:43.440
 it's, he discovers a friend in a bear.

2:33:43.440 --> 2:33:46.120
 And he also discovers a lifetime passion

2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:47.800
 for looking up at the stars,

2:33:47.800 --> 2:33:50.760
 and the curiosity of exploring what is up there.

2:33:50.760 --> 2:33:55.420
 And I see that as science, as exploring the mystery.

2:33:55.420 --> 2:33:59.040
 And also I see that as brave to explore the mystery

2:33:59.040 --> 2:34:01.840
 given all the uncertainty all around you.

2:34:01.840 --> 2:34:04.480
 But there is a melancholy, the whole sound of it,

2:34:04.480 --> 2:34:06.320
 the feel of it, the look of it.

2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:11.320
 It was, it just captures both the melancholy

2:34:12.120 --> 2:34:14.640
 and the wonder of childhood.

2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:17.680
 Which is like, there's a loneliness to it.

2:34:17.680 --> 2:34:19.720
 Like, nobody understands me.

2:34:21.800 --> 2:34:25.720
 That's there, that children can feel.

2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:27.120
 Because you're trying to figure out.

2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:28.560
 That's my favorite character right there.

2:34:28.560 --> 2:34:29.560
 I love the owl.

2:34:29.560 --> 2:34:30.960
 I love the owl.

2:34:30.960 --> 2:34:32.200
 The owl shows up every once in a while.

2:34:32.200 --> 2:34:33.040
 I love the owl.

2:34:33.040 --> 2:34:35.160
 Sorry, I interrupted you.

2:34:35.160 --> 2:34:36.000
 Again.

2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:37.060
 There's non sequitur.

2:34:37.060 --> 2:34:39.520
 It means you're interested 70% of the time.

2:34:39.520 --> 2:34:41.720
 The other 30%, you're just an asshole.

2:34:41.720 --> 2:34:43.080
 So you have to figure out which.

2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:44.000
 So I'm told.

2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:47.480
 There's non sequitur parts in this cartoon.

2:34:47.480 --> 2:34:49.940
 It's voted as one of the greatest cartoons of all time.

2:34:49.940 --> 2:34:52.800
 Short, short little films, documentary filmmakers.

2:34:52.800 --> 2:34:56.440
 So it is, you know, in the Soviet Union,

2:34:56.440 --> 2:35:01.240
 in a lot of sort of authoritarian regimes,

2:35:02.120 --> 2:35:07.120
 there's channels to communicate difficult ideas to people.

2:35:07.120 --> 2:35:08.480
 And you figure out those channels.

2:35:08.480 --> 2:35:09.840
 And in the Soviet Union,

2:35:09.840 --> 2:35:13.480
 one of those channels was children's cartoons.

2:35:13.480 --> 2:35:16.360
 So you're actually, they're very much for adults.

2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:19.600
 Yeah, I like that in some countries,

2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:21.000
 not so much in the US,

2:35:22.300 --> 2:35:24.440
 children are treated with more respect

2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:27.480
 for their intelligence, you know,

2:35:27.480 --> 2:35:29.840
 and not constantly getting this drivel

2:35:29.840 --> 2:35:34.040
 of just kind of moronic explosions and whistles and bells

2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:37.260
 and the voices that just kind of, you know,

2:35:37.260 --> 2:35:39.680
 children, obviously are children and need to be,

2:35:39.680 --> 2:35:41.200
 their brains are young and plastic

2:35:41.200 --> 2:35:45.220
 and need to be treated and nurtured as such.

2:35:45.220 --> 2:35:48.600
 But they have an intelligence.

2:35:48.600 --> 2:35:51.600
 And I think that you treat them like morons

2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:53.840
 and they're gonna behave like morons.

2:35:53.840 --> 2:35:55.120
 You treat them as, you know,

2:35:55.120 --> 2:35:58.560
 people who can consume information

2:35:58.560 --> 2:36:00.680
 and make sense of it in their own way.

2:36:00.680 --> 2:36:02.560
 And that's what they're gonna do.

2:36:02.560 --> 2:36:05.280
 They have a seriousness of looking at the world.

2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:10.080
 I love people that talk with children like they're adults.

2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:13.640
 Well, like, here's if you're talking to a mini Einstein,

2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:15.980
 because you're like really,

2:36:15.980 --> 2:36:17.880
 they're asking some big questions.

2:36:17.880 --> 2:36:19.880
 And I think, I mean, people sometimes

2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:23.240
 speak of me in this way.

2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:26.200
 Like, how dumb is this childlike person?

2:36:26.200 --> 2:36:28.280
 But like, no, there's intelligence

2:36:28.280 --> 2:36:32.320
 in these dumb, simple questions that a child asks.

2:36:32.320 --> 2:36:35.440
 And I always love those questions, the simplicity,

2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:39.460
 but also the depth of those questions.

2:36:39.460 --> 2:36:40.300
 Why?

2:36:40.300 --> 2:36:41.920
 The reason I started watching your podcast

2:36:41.920 --> 2:36:44.720
 was you did an episode early on with Ray Dalio.

2:36:44.720 --> 2:36:45.560
 Yeah.

2:36:45.560 --> 2:36:47.860
 And the first, maybe the first,

2:36:47.860 --> 2:36:50.000
 but a question that you definitely asked him

2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:53.320
 was you just said, what is money?

2:36:53.320 --> 2:36:55.040
 And his answer was fantastic.

2:36:55.040 --> 2:36:58.800
 It's a superb question and he gave a superb answer.

2:36:58.800 --> 2:37:02.520
 And I never would have thought to ask that question.

2:37:02.520 --> 2:37:04.160
 And it's the question.

2:37:04.160 --> 2:37:06.460
 And it was the question to tee things off with.

2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:10.840
 So simple questions that get right

2:37:10.840 --> 2:37:12.960
 to the heart of the matter, you know,

2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:17.060
 and kids aren't often putting the same cultural filters

2:37:17.060 --> 2:37:21.440
 and you know, kids generally aren't concerned

2:37:21.440 --> 2:37:23.680
 about getting canceled either.

2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:25.160
 So they'll ask the question

2:37:25.160 --> 2:37:26.400
 that no one else is willing to ask.

2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:27.840
 And they're not concerned about

2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:30.640
 how dumb the question sounds.

2:37:30.640 --> 2:37:32.160
 I find the most fascinating questions

2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:33.920
 are just really, really simple.

2:37:33.920 --> 2:37:37.820
 And it is a bit embarrassing to ask those simple questions

2:37:37.820 --> 2:37:40.480
 of like, what is anything?

2:37:40.480 --> 2:37:43.800
 You're asking them for all of us, so please ask them.

2:37:43.800 --> 2:37:46.800
 I think that question, what is money, is crucial.

2:37:46.800 --> 2:37:49.960
 And I think the simple questions are the most,

2:37:49.960 --> 2:37:51.120
 obviously the most interesting.

2:37:51.120 --> 2:37:53.520
 I'm gonna ask you about, you had awesome podcasts.

2:37:53.520 --> 2:37:55.280
 I mean, I can ask you questions about basically

2:37:55.280 --> 2:37:56.120
 all your podcasts.

2:37:56.120 --> 2:37:57.480
 People should definitely listen to the Huberman Lab,

2:37:57.480 --> 2:38:00.960
 but with Andy Gap and the conversation,

2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:02.680
 you talked about strength and muscle building

2:38:02.680 --> 2:38:03.600
 and all that kind of stuff.

2:38:03.600 --> 2:38:04.800
 He's an encyclopedia.

2:38:04.800 --> 2:38:05.640
 Yeah.

2:38:05.640 --> 2:38:08.420
 And he also works with a lot of UFC fighters

2:38:08.420 --> 2:38:11.720
 and he works with, he has a lab that includes a gym.

2:38:11.720 --> 2:38:14.520
 And so he works on endurance and powerlifting

2:38:14.520 --> 2:38:16.380
 and also hypertrophy training, et cetera.

2:38:16.380 --> 2:38:19.160
 But he also does muscle biopsy.

2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:21.360
 So he runs the full spectrum

2:38:21.360 --> 2:38:23.800
 and he's a full tenured professor

2:38:23.800 --> 2:38:25.680
 and he does all this stuff.

2:38:25.680 --> 2:38:29.080
 So he's a really unique person

2:38:29.080 --> 2:38:31.120
 in this whole fitness landscape

2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:33.000
 because there are a lot of PTs out there.

2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:34.480
 There are a lot of kinesiologists.

2:38:34.480 --> 2:38:36.640
 There are a lot of people studying nutrition

2:38:36.640 --> 2:38:37.480
 and sports training.

2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:40.280
 But I think he has the, among the people out there,

2:38:40.280 --> 2:38:42.720
 he's at least in the top five,

2:38:42.720 --> 2:38:45.160
 probably within the top three of people

2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:47.920
 that really have their arms around the full extent

2:38:47.920 --> 2:38:50.600
 of what's possible with training.

2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:53.480
 And he works with the UFC Performance Center.

2:38:53.480 --> 2:38:55.640
 Well, I mean, he just said a very systematic way

2:38:55.640 --> 2:38:58.000
 of describing things that was really nice.

2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:02.080
 You know, skill, speed, power, strength,

2:39:02.080 --> 2:39:05.400
 hypertrophy, so muscle mass, right?

2:39:05.400 --> 2:39:06.640
 Endurance, all kinds of,

2:39:06.640 --> 2:39:08.920
 and then the philosophical of like adaptation,

2:39:08.920 --> 2:39:11.000
 how to overload stuff, all that very,

2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:14.660
 is there stuff, I'll ask you about ice bath and sauna,

2:39:14.660 --> 2:39:16.680
 which was surprising to me there.

2:39:16.680 --> 2:39:20.260
 Is there stuff you took away from that conversation,

2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:25.960
 like principles about how to get strong,

2:39:25.960 --> 2:39:28.080
 how to build muscle mass,

2:39:28.080 --> 2:39:31.320
 that like broadened and deepened your understanding

2:39:31.320 --> 2:39:32.400
 of that task?

2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:33.240
 Definitely.

2:39:33.240 --> 2:39:34.320
 And I'll do these in bullet points

2:39:34.320 --> 2:39:36.160
 because if people want the logic behind them

2:39:36.160 --> 2:39:38.000
 and the mechanism, they can listen to that episode.

2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:39.240
 It's a really good episode.

2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:40.840
 I'll start with heat and cold really quickly

2:39:40.840 --> 2:39:44.060
 and just say that avoid cold immersion.

2:39:44.060 --> 2:39:47.800
 So ice baths and being in cold water up to the neck,

2:39:47.800 --> 2:39:50.180
 uncomfortably cold within the four hours

2:39:50.180 --> 2:39:53.800
 after a training session that's designed

2:39:53.800 --> 2:39:55.080
 to evoke an adaptation,

2:39:55.080 --> 2:39:57.500
 either endurance, hypertrophy, or strength,

2:39:57.500 --> 2:39:59.920
 because the inflammation that you experienced

2:39:59.920 --> 2:40:02.400
 from a hard endurance workout or from a hard strength

2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:05.640
 or a hard hypertrophy workout is the stimulus

2:40:05.640 --> 2:40:07.200
 that you're going to adapt to.

2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:10.120
 The cold water immersion reduces inflammation

2:40:10.120 --> 2:40:12.880
 and can short circuit some of that.

2:40:12.880 --> 2:40:14.600
 After four hours, you're probably okay,

2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:16.280
 but if you can do it a different day

2:40:16.280 --> 2:40:18.840
 or you can do it before those sessions, that's better.

2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:21.920
 Heat, however, can be done immediately after training

2:40:21.920 --> 2:40:22.880
 and it's probably beneficial

2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:25.280
 because of the way that it dilates the vascular system

2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:28.840
 and perfuses the muscles and ligaments, et cetera,

2:40:28.840 --> 2:40:29.800
 with more nutrients.

2:40:29.800 --> 2:40:31.000
 And I should just mention

2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:33.520
 that was a crucial piece of information.

2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:34.900
 It's a little bit surprising.

2:40:34.900 --> 2:40:36.080
 Was it surprising to you?

2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:36.900
 Absolutely.

2:40:36.900 --> 2:40:37.740
 Because I actually,

2:40:37.740 --> 2:40:39.600
 the way I posed the question to him about cold

2:40:39.600 --> 2:40:41.720
 was I hear that getting into an ice bath

2:40:41.720 --> 2:40:43.280
 or a cold water immersion after training

2:40:43.280 --> 2:40:44.200
 can reduce hypertrophy,

2:40:44.200 --> 2:40:45.740
 but I'm guessing it's not that big of a deal.

2:40:45.740 --> 2:40:47.120
 And he said, no, it is a big deal.

2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:48.900
 It will short circuit your progress.

2:40:48.900 --> 2:40:51.420
 Now, for people that are only interested in performance,

2:40:51.420 --> 2:40:53.220
 who are doing a lot of workouts and trying to recover,

2:40:53.220 --> 2:40:54.760
 but not trying to grow muscle, get stronger,

2:40:54.760 --> 2:40:57.680
 or build endurance, then it makes sense to do cold.

2:40:57.680 --> 2:40:58.840
 Like skill development or something.

2:40:58.840 --> 2:41:01.960
 Skill development, or you're an athlete in season.

2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:04.060
 So you have to, what's so great about Andy

2:41:04.060 --> 2:41:06.880
 is he really points out the specific ways to train

2:41:06.880 --> 2:41:08.120
 given your specific goals.

2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:09.480
 So if we're getting swole,

2:41:09.480 --> 2:41:12.440
 stay out of the ice bath after a workout, there you go.

2:41:12.440 --> 2:41:14.600
 Lex is always making fun of the meatheads.

2:41:14.600 --> 2:41:15.640
 I love it.

2:41:15.640 --> 2:41:17.000
 I put myself in the meathead category

2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:19.360
 only because I don't do a real sport now.

2:41:19.360 --> 2:41:21.520
 I work out and I run, which is working out.

2:41:21.520 --> 2:41:24.040
 I'm an aspiring meathead, okay, so.

2:41:24.040 --> 2:41:25.720
 One of these days I'm going to get back to Jiu Jitsu,

2:41:25.720 --> 2:41:27.200
 or I'm going to get to Jiu Jitsu.

2:41:27.200 --> 2:41:28.360
 Now, in terms of training,

2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:31.700
 he has this beautiful three by five concept for strength.

2:41:31.700 --> 2:41:34.000
 Pick three exercises, compound exercises,

2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:37.680
 multi joint movements, do them for,

2:41:37.680 --> 2:41:40.480
 do three to five exercises

2:41:40.480 --> 2:41:45.280
 for three to five repetitions per set,

2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:47.000
 rest three to five minutes,

2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:49.000
 and do that three to five times per week.

2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:51.060
 And for details, you can, again, look to the episode.

2:41:51.060 --> 2:41:51.900
 It's timestamped.

2:41:51.900 --> 2:41:53.280
 But what's interesting about this is

2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:55.400
 three to five times a week is a lot for a muscle group.

2:41:55.400 --> 2:41:58.080
 Squatting five times a week for five reps,

2:41:58.080 --> 2:42:00.240
 meaning you're working pretty heavy,

2:42:00.240 --> 2:42:01.520
 meaning you're close to failure,

2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:03.640
 but not failure for strength generally.

2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:08.080
 What Andy taught me is that people

2:42:08.080 --> 2:42:10.280
 who are training mostly for strength

2:42:10.280 --> 2:42:13.880
 can do these low rep type regimens frequently

2:42:13.880 --> 2:42:16.640
 because most of the adaptation is neural.

2:42:16.640 --> 2:42:18.600
 And because you're not pushing to failure,

2:42:18.600 --> 2:42:21.800
 in most cases, you don't get that sore.

2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:25.800
 And so it's the motor neurons getting the muscle fibers

2:42:25.800 --> 2:42:29.820
 to contract more intensely or with more efficiency

2:42:29.820 --> 2:42:32.340
 in other ways that's leading to these strength gains.

2:42:32.340 --> 2:42:34.600
 And this is why power lifters can train every day

2:42:34.600 --> 2:42:37.280
 or five days a week or four days a week.

2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:41.000
 For hypertrophy, I learned from Andy

2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:44.220
 that the repetition range can be pretty broad.

2:42:44.220 --> 2:42:47.820
 You're thinking anywhere from six to 30 repetitions.

2:42:48.880 --> 2:42:52.280
 You should do 10 sets per muscle group per week,

2:42:52.280 --> 2:42:53.640
 maybe even a bit more.

2:42:53.640 --> 2:42:54.480
 So high volume.

2:42:54.480 --> 2:42:59.120
 High volume, but you have to go to failure

2:42:59.120 --> 2:43:01.380
 or beyond in order to stimulate growth.

2:43:01.380 --> 2:43:03.760
 Why does it work at such a great range of repetitions?

2:43:03.760 --> 2:43:06.240
 Well, there apparently are three ways

2:43:06.240 --> 2:43:08.480
 that you stimulate hypertrophy and maybe more.

2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:11.380
 One is tissue micro damage to the tissue.

2:43:11.380 --> 2:43:14.640
 The other is through some sort of tension based changes

2:43:14.640 --> 2:43:17.400
 in the molecular gene programs of cells

2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:19.080
 that lead to protein synthesis

2:43:19.080 --> 2:43:21.040
 that are distinct from damage.

2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:22.560
 And the other are metabolic effects

2:43:22.560 --> 2:43:23.760
 of like high repetition work

2:43:23.760 --> 2:43:26.020
 of super fusion of the muscle with blood.

2:43:26.020 --> 2:43:27.700
 We know that third category exists

2:43:27.700 --> 2:43:29.960
 because people are now doing this blood restriction training

2:43:29.960 --> 2:43:31.120
 where they cuff off a muscle

2:43:31.120 --> 2:43:32.640
 and they'll use a really lightweight.

2:43:32.640 --> 2:43:33.460
 I've done these before.

2:43:33.460 --> 2:43:35.500
 You can use a five pound weight and do curls with this

2:43:35.500 --> 2:43:38.280
 and you are in pain and the muscles are swelling up

2:43:38.280 --> 2:43:39.120
 with blood.

2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:40.360
 It does lead to hypertrophy,

2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:42.940
 but in general, you're not sore.

2:43:42.940 --> 2:43:44.680
 You're not doing tissue damage.

2:43:44.680 --> 2:43:46.680
 And by the way, don't just turn to get off a muscle

2:43:46.680 --> 2:43:48.780
 cause you have to use the proper cuffs

2:43:48.780 --> 2:43:50.760
 because you need the blood still to flow in one direction.

2:43:50.760 --> 2:43:52.000
 You can't just cinch it off

2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:53.740
 or you'll potentially kill yourself

2:43:53.740 --> 2:43:56.840
 if you get a clot or you do it wrong.

2:43:56.840 --> 2:43:59.440
 So get the appropriate cuffs, they're out there.

2:43:59.440 --> 2:44:01.600
 And then for endurance, I learned something really cool.

2:44:01.600 --> 2:44:02.920
 So I work out basically,

2:44:02.920 --> 2:44:06.320
 I go to the gym every other day on average,

2:44:06.320 --> 2:44:07.520
 three or four days a week I do that,

2:44:07.520 --> 2:44:09.800
 but generally not two days in a row to work out.

2:44:09.800 --> 2:44:11.200
 Next day I'll do cardio next day.

2:44:11.200 --> 2:44:14.200
 And the cardio for me is always a 30 to 45 minute jog

2:44:14.200 --> 2:44:15.540
 kind of zone two cardio.

2:44:16.640 --> 2:44:18.800
 Andy informed me that to build endurance

2:44:18.800 --> 2:44:22.200
 while building strength and maintaining some muscle size

2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:23.640
 or even building muscle size,

2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:27.000
 I would be wise to take one day a week

2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:32.000
 and add to that all out max heart rate work

2:44:32.320 --> 2:44:34.560
 for 90 seconds at least.

2:44:34.560 --> 2:44:36.120
 So do 90 seconds then rest

2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:38.760
 and then maybe do another 90 second all out sprint.

2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:41.480
 I almost missed my flight going from Los Angeles to Austin.

2:44:41.480 --> 2:44:44.800
 I did that all out sprint in the airport yesterday.

2:44:44.800 --> 2:44:47.600
 So I actually can think it's done for me.

2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:51.840
 So there was a sprinting Dr. Huberman throughout.

2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:52.840
 With three bags.

2:44:52.840 --> 2:44:53.680
 That's awesome.

2:44:53.680 --> 2:44:55.520
 Cause I travel, generally I'll travel

2:44:55.520 --> 2:44:57.780
 with too much stuff.

2:44:57.780 --> 2:45:00.200
 I love how you were probably running late for a flight

2:45:00.200 --> 2:45:02.080
 and use that as an opportunity to explore.

2:45:02.080 --> 2:45:02.960
 Well, I was doing it.

2:45:02.960 --> 2:45:03.800
 I was thinking to myself,

2:45:03.800 --> 2:45:05.880
 okay, Andy, that's a 90 second sprint.

2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:07.780
 Cause I got to the security line.

2:45:07.780 --> 2:45:08.620
 I finally got TSC.

2:45:08.620 --> 2:45:11.360
 But that's for better, that's for extending endurance?

2:45:11.360 --> 2:45:12.360
 That's for, yeah.

2:45:12.360 --> 2:45:15.120
 It actually has some carry over effects on endurance

2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:16.120
 if you're doing the other stuff.

2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:18.280
 And then he also said one day a week to do this workout

2:45:18.280 --> 2:45:19.120
 and I haven't done it yet.

2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:19.960
 Maybe we do it tomorrow.

2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:20.780
 It'd be fun.

2:45:20.780 --> 2:45:22.740
 Which is you run a mile,

2:45:22.740 --> 2:45:26.460
 you ask yourself, how long did that take?

2:45:26.460 --> 2:45:28.420
 Let's say it took eight minutes.

2:45:28.420 --> 2:45:30.660
 Then you walk or rest for eight minutes.

2:45:30.660 --> 2:45:33.380
 Then you run another mile as fast as you can.

2:45:33.380 --> 2:45:34.860
 And then you rest for the equivalent period.

2:45:34.860 --> 2:45:38.020
 And you do that one to three times once per week.

2:45:38.020 --> 2:45:38.900
 So you do.

2:45:38.900 --> 2:45:41.620
 And so as an all around fitness program,

2:45:41.620 --> 2:45:43.820
 it make, you could collapse this into something

2:45:43.820 --> 2:45:44.660
 where you say, okay,

2:45:44.660 --> 2:45:45.680
 you're gonna work out with the weights

2:45:45.680 --> 2:45:48.000
 for about an hour every other day.

2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:49.480
 Maybe take two days off every once in a while.

2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:50.320
 Maybe not.

2:45:50.320 --> 2:45:53.460
 You're going to do six to 15 repetitions.

2:45:53.460 --> 2:45:56.020
 You're gonna push to failure on some of those, not all,

2:45:56.020 --> 2:45:58.700
 because some of those are designed to build more strength.

2:45:58.700 --> 2:46:00.180
 You're not going to failure in heavier.

2:46:00.180 --> 2:46:02.340
 Some are designed for hypertrophy, higher rep

2:46:02.340 --> 2:46:03.820
 and going to failure.

2:46:03.820 --> 2:46:04.900
 And then on off days,

2:46:04.900 --> 2:46:07.380
 you're gonna jog for 30 to 45 minutes.

2:46:07.380 --> 2:46:09.180
 But for two days a week,

2:46:09.180 --> 2:46:12.580
 you're either at the end of your jog or whatever,

2:46:12.580 --> 2:46:15.480
 you're gonna do some all out sprints for 90 seconds

2:46:15.480 --> 2:46:17.580
 and then rest and repeat.

2:46:17.580 --> 2:46:22.580
 And for another day, you're going to do these mile repeats.

2:46:22.720 --> 2:46:27.120
 That's a pretty large chunk of exercise movement.

2:46:27.120 --> 2:46:30.120
 But if you kind of thread through the middle of all that,

2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:32.340
 what you end up with is some decent strength,

2:46:32.340 --> 2:46:34.820
 building protocols, some decent hypertrophy,

2:46:34.820 --> 2:46:36.700
 some cardiovascular training

2:46:36.700 --> 2:46:40.060
 that establishes the so called A base or a so called base.

2:46:40.060 --> 2:46:42.040
 So you're not gonna get really good at anything.

2:46:42.040 --> 2:46:44.040
 You're not gonna become a marathoner this way,

2:46:44.040 --> 2:46:45.660
 an optimizing marathon.

2:46:45.660 --> 2:46:47.100
 You're not gonna optimize powerlifting.

2:46:47.100 --> 2:46:48.720
 You're not gonna optimize hypertrophy.

2:46:48.720 --> 2:46:52.500
 But for the typical person, 75% of people, 75% of the time,

2:46:52.500 --> 2:46:53.940
 they want some muscle, they want some strength,

2:46:53.940 --> 2:46:54.940
 they want some endurance,

2:46:54.940 --> 2:46:58.260
 and they want the capacity to sprint to the security gate

2:46:58.260 --> 2:47:01.340
 without leaving a lung in the terminal.

2:47:01.340 --> 2:47:03.140
 So it's like functional stuff,

2:47:03.140 --> 2:47:05.820
 like your life going up the stairs is easier,

2:47:05.820 --> 2:47:08.180
 moving about, all that kind of just regular life.

2:47:08.180 --> 2:47:12.020
 And I should mention that cold showers after training

2:47:12.020 --> 2:47:17.020
 don't seem to short circuit the training effect

2:47:17.140 --> 2:47:19.540
 to the same extent that immersion in cold water does.

2:47:19.540 --> 2:47:21.640
 And that really speaks to the fact that cold showers,

2:47:21.640 --> 2:47:23.620
 even though they can provide some of the adrenaline

2:47:23.620 --> 2:47:25.060
 for the mental effects of like,

2:47:25.060 --> 2:47:26.460
 oh, I have a lot of adrenaline in my system

2:47:26.460 --> 2:47:28.220
 from a cold shower and I can remain calm.

2:47:28.220 --> 2:47:30.080
 There's utility to that.

2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:32.840
 It's not going to have the same metabolic effects

2:47:32.840 --> 2:47:35.060
 or other positive effects that cold water exposure

2:47:35.060 --> 2:47:36.540
 has been shown to have.

2:47:36.540 --> 2:47:39.020
 And that's unfortunate because most people

2:47:39.020 --> 2:47:40.120
 have access to cold showers,

2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:41.900
 not everyone has access to a cold dunker.

2:47:41.900 --> 2:47:42.900
 Or an ice dunk.

2:47:42.900 --> 2:47:45.900
 But here in Austin, you have this place,

2:47:45.900 --> 2:47:47.060
 and no, they don't pay me to say this,

2:47:47.060 --> 2:47:48.560
 but I always like going to this place

2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:50.180
 whenever I'm in town, this place, Kuya.

2:47:50.180 --> 2:47:52.580
 And they've got a sauna and a couple ice baths.

2:47:52.580 --> 2:47:53.980
 And they even have those salt tanks

2:47:53.980 --> 2:47:54.820
 that you can float on the surface.

2:47:54.820 --> 2:47:55.940
 Do they have ice baths there?

2:47:55.940 --> 2:47:59.300
 They have cold water immersion, it's pretty cold.

2:47:59.300 --> 2:48:00.640
 Still haven't done an ice bath.

2:48:00.640 --> 2:48:02.100
 Really? I need to, yeah, I need to.

2:48:02.100 --> 2:48:03.500
 You're Russian, you'll probably get in

2:48:03.500 --> 2:48:04.500
 and you won't even know.

2:48:04.500 --> 2:48:05.340
 Yeah, what is this?

2:48:05.340 --> 2:48:06.180
 What's the big deal here?

2:48:06.180 --> 2:48:07.540
 Exactly, or people pay for this.

2:48:08.500 --> 2:48:10.300
 I did a post, right, of you as a baby.

2:48:10.300 --> 2:48:11.140
 Yeah.

2:48:11.140 --> 2:48:14.540
 You know, I had to go deep to get that photo of Lex

2:48:14.540 --> 2:48:16.620
 in a bassinet, in the snow.

2:48:16.620 --> 2:48:17.580
 Yeah.

2:48:17.580 --> 2:48:20.740
 Because in Russia, they actually did this for a long time.

2:48:20.740 --> 2:48:21.620
 They thought that it would,

2:48:21.620 --> 2:48:23.580
 and indeed it does build the immune system

2:48:23.580 --> 2:48:25.780
 to expose babies to the cold.

2:48:25.780 --> 2:48:27.820
 I still don't know where you got that photo.

2:48:27.820 --> 2:48:29.820
 I didn't know you were able to find exactly the right,

2:48:29.820 --> 2:48:31.540
 it was great.

2:48:31.540 --> 2:48:32.380
 It was great research.

2:48:32.380 --> 2:48:33.200
 You didn't have a tie on,

2:48:33.200 --> 2:48:36.260
 but you had all the look and seriousness that you do now.

2:48:36.260 --> 2:48:37.860
 So it's clearly nature nurture,

2:48:37.860 --> 2:48:39.260
 clearly you were born with that.

2:48:39.260 --> 2:48:40.300
 What about sauna?

2:48:40.300 --> 2:48:42.500
 He does say that it's good to do heat.

2:48:42.500 --> 2:48:44.020
 So there are three ways you can do sauna

2:48:44.020 --> 2:48:46.060
 that I can just toss out as like briefings.

2:48:46.060 --> 2:48:48.740
 If you want to get a really big growth hormone release

2:48:48.740 --> 2:48:50.780
 for sake of metabolism, fat loss,

2:48:50.780 --> 2:48:52.680
 you're training really, really hard in jujitsu

2:48:52.680 --> 2:48:54.260
 and you want to recover,

2:48:54.260 --> 2:48:56.380
 you don't want to sauna too often

2:48:56.380 --> 2:48:59.920
 because the study that identified this massive

2:48:59.920 --> 2:49:02.360
 16 fold increase in growth hormone,

2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:04.560
 they had people do this, it's crazy.

2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:07.560
 They got into, okay, temperatures are 80

2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:09.480
 to 100 degrees centigrade.

2:49:09.480 --> 2:49:11.500
 So that's 176 degrees Fahrenheit

2:49:11.500 --> 2:49:15.700
 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit for five to 30 minutes

2:49:15.700 --> 2:49:17.740
 is the typical ranges that people work in

2:49:17.740 --> 2:49:19.080
 in these research studies.

2:49:20.300 --> 2:49:22.780
 For maximum growth hormone release,

2:49:22.780 --> 2:49:24.960
 don't do sauna more than once a week,

2:49:24.960 --> 2:49:27.980
 but get into the sauna for 30 minutes,

2:49:27.980 --> 2:49:29.980
 as hot as you can safely tolerate.

2:49:29.980 --> 2:49:31.620
 So probably for you, that'll be 210

2:49:31.620 --> 2:49:34.900
 because I suspect you'll be on the high end of things.

2:49:34.900 --> 2:49:38.580
 Then get out for five to 10 minutes, no cold exposure,

2:49:38.580 --> 2:49:40.460
 get back in the sauna for 30 minutes.

2:49:40.460 --> 2:49:41.880
 Then they had them do it again,

2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:44.240
 out for five minutes, back for 30 minutes,

2:49:44.240 --> 2:49:45.700
 out for five minutes, back for three minutes.

2:49:45.700 --> 2:49:48.640
 They had them do two hours of sauna exposure

2:49:48.640 --> 2:49:51.220
 to get that growth hormone release.

2:49:51.220 --> 2:49:54.040
 Now for the reduction in likelihood

2:49:54.040 --> 2:49:57.060
 of dying of a cardiovascular event stroke or otherwise,

2:49:57.060 --> 2:49:59.240
 the more often you do sauna, the better.

2:49:59.240 --> 2:50:01.860
 So if you look at all cause mortality

2:50:01.860 --> 2:50:03.940
 or death due to cardiovascular events,

2:50:03.940 --> 2:50:06.140
 and you look at sauna use frequencies

2:50:06.140 --> 2:50:09.220
 using the same parameters, 80 to 100 degrees centigrade,

2:50:09.220 --> 2:50:10.900
 one to seven times per week,

2:50:10.900 --> 2:50:12.780
 basically the more often you get into the sauna

2:50:12.780 --> 2:50:15.260
 for 30 minutes across the week,

2:50:15.260 --> 2:50:17.920
 so 30 minutes a day is better than four times a week.

2:50:17.920 --> 2:50:19.740
 Four times a week is better than two times a week

2:50:19.740 --> 2:50:21.400
 and two times a week is better than one.

2:50:21.400 --> 2:50:25.180
 And the reductions in mortality are really impressive.

2:50:25.180 --> 2:50:29.180
 27, if you get into the sauna the way I just described,

2:50:29.180 --> 2:50:32.940
 not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes twice a week

2:50:32.940 --> 2:50:33.980
 or three times per week,

2:50:33.980 --> 2:50:35.980
 you reduce the likelihood of dying

2:50:35.980 --> 2:50:38.980
 of a cardiovascular event by 27%.

2:50:38.980 --> 2:50:41.240
 If you do it four or more times per week,

2:50:41.240 --> 2:50:44.660
 you reduce the probability of dying by 50%

2:50:44.660 --> 2:50:46.180
 of a cardiovascular event.

2:50:46.180 --> 2:50:47.020
 And in these studies,

2:50:47.020 --> 2:50:50.300
 they rule out other things that people are doing, smoking.

2:50:50.300 --> 2:50:52.480
 They even ask them, do you live in an apartment?

2:50:52.480 --> 2:50:53.820
 Are you in a happy relationship?

2:50:53.820 --> 2:50:57.100
 Like they evaluate other potentially confounding variables.

2:50:57.100 --> 2:50:59.200
 Now for people that don't have access to a sauna,

2:50:59.200 --> 2:51:03.020
 a hot water bath or hot tub is gonna be your next best bet.

2:51:03.020 --> 2:51:04.260
 And if you don't have access to that,

2:51:04.260 --> 2:51:05.660
 do like the wrestlers do,

2:51:05.660 --> 2:51:09.500
 which is put on two sets of sweats and a hoodie

2:51:09.500 --> 2:51:12.780
 and a stocking cap and wrap yourself in plastics

2:51:12.780 --> 2:51:14.480
 underneath all that and go for a run,

2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:16.820
 but please nobody die of hyperthermia.

2:51:16.820 --> 2:51:18.760
 I mean, you can die of warming up too much.

2:51:18.760 --> 2:51:23.760
 Is this experience pleasant or stressful in the way,

2:51:25.180 --> 2:51:27.380
 so is it as stressful as an ice bath, for example?

2:51:27.380 --> 2:51:28.960
 Great question.

2:51:28.960 --> 2:51:31.300
 People always ask how cold to make the ice bath

2:51:31.300 --> 2:51:33.140
 or the cold water or the shower.

2:51:33.140 --> 2:51:35.460
 You want it to be uncomfortably cold,

2:51:35.460 --> 2:51:38.220
 meaning you want to feel like I really wanna get out,

2:51:38.220 --> 2:51:39.300
 but you can safely stay in.

2:51:39.300 --> 2:51:42.380
 And that's gonna vary by person and experience with it.

2:51:42.380 --> 2:51:43.520
 Experience, yeah.

2:51:43.520 --> 2:51:45.660
 With the sauna, it's the same thing.

2:51:46.540 --> 2:51:47.620
 How hot to make it?

2:51:47.620 --> 2:51:50.840
 Well, don't kill yourself, obviously be smart.

2:51:50.840 --> 2:51:53.980
 If you're pregnant, you shouldn't be doing this anyway,

2:51:53.980 --> 2:51:56.300
 but it's very clear that what you need

2:51:56.300 --> 2:51:58.580
 is the release of something called dinorphin.

2:51:58.580 --> 2:52:00.740
 We have endorphin, which makes us feel good.

2:52:00.740 --> 2:52:04.280
 It binds to these mu opioid receptors in the body.

2:52:04.280 --> 2:52:07.120
 You have dinorphin, which is the terrible feeling

2:52:07.120 --> 2:52:09.420
 that you get when you're in really hot temperatures.

2:52:09.420 --> 2:52:12.300
 It's also the terrible effect that alcoholics feel

2:52:12.300 --> 2:52:14.180
 when they are in withdrawal.

2:52:14.180 --> 2:52:15.900
 You feel agitated, you wanna get out,

2:52:15.900 --> 2:52:16.740
 it's really unpleasant.

2:52:16.740 --> 2:52:18.500
 It's dinorphin binding to the so called

2:52:18.500 --> 2:52:22.300
 kappa opioid receptor, that's what you're trying to trigger.

2:52:22.300 --> 2:52:24.260
 When you do that, a number of things happen.

2:52:24.260 --> 2:52:27.060
 You set off heat shock proteins that go repair

2:52:27.060 --> 2:52:29.660
 broken proteins and misfolded proteins.

2:52:29.660 --> 2:52:33.780
 It also makes it so that later endorphin binds its receptor

2:52:33.780 --> 2:52:34.620
 more strongly.

2:52:34.620 --> 2:52:38.180
 So when you have this uncomfortable experience in the heat,

2:52:38.180 --> 2:52:40.460
 you literally feel better in real life

2:52:40.460 --> 2:52:42.900
 when pleasurable events come on,

2:52:42.900 --> 2:52:44.340
 when you experience them.

2:52:44.340 --> 2:52:45.840
 In the same way, I like to say this,

2:52:45.840 --> 2:52:48.640
 that when you get into a cold ice bath or cold shower,

2:52:48.640 --> 2:52:53.640
 the increase in epinephrine and dopamine is two to 300%.

2:52:54.580 --> 2:52:57.140
 These are huge increases and they last many hours.

2:52:57.140 --> 2:53:00.420
 This is shown, because lately I've gotten a little bit

2:53:00.420 --> 2:53:04.900
 of pushback on Twitter, which is interesting place.

2:53:06.180 --> 2:53:07.460
 People say, well, that's just in mice.

2:53:07.460 --> 2:53:08.980
 No, all the studies I just referred to

2:53:08.980 --> 2:53:11.300
 are all done in humans, men and women,

2:53:11.300 --> 2:53:12.940
 fairly broad age ranges.

2:53:12.940 --> 2:53:15.300
 So you want to be uncomfortable in the cold.

2:53:15.300 --> 2:53:17.140
 You wanna be uncomfortable in the heat.

2:53:17.140 --> 2:53:19.460
 This is why I'm not a big fan of infrared saunas

2:53:19.460 --> 2:53:22.860
 because they only go up to about 160, 170 degrees.

2:53:22.860 --> 2:53:26.040
 Infrared light and far red light of all kinds

2:53:26.040 --> 2:53:27.980
 has been shown to be beneficial for wound healing,

2:53:27.980 --> 2:53:29.780
 acne, skin, eyes.

2:53:29.780 --> 2:53:31.500
 There are even guys now putting on their testicles

2:53:31.500 --> 2:53:34.780
 because it can increase testosterone and sperm production.

2:53:34.780 --> 2:53:36.100
 Yeah, hormone release.

2:53:36.100 --> 2:53:37.100
 Hormone release.

2:53:37.100 --> 2:53:39.020
 But in terms of the sauna,

2:53:39.020 --> 2:53:41.540
 you want that strong heat stimulus.

2:53:41.540 --> 2:53:44.900
 Yeah, and that's when you crawl up to the 200 mark

2:53:44.900 --> 2:53:45.740
 and so on.

2:53:45.740 --> 2:53:46.560
 Whenever I'm in New York,

2:53:46.560 --> 2:53:47.740
 and there's also one in San Francisco,

2:53:47.740 --> 2:53:49.960
 although the one in San Francisco is clothing optional,

2:53:49.960 --> 2:53:52.940
 just to warn people, there's a place called Archimedes Banya.

2:53:52.940 --> 2:53:55.620
 Is there any scientific evidence that being naked

2:53:55.620 --> 2:53:57.460
 is beneficial in the sauna?

2:53:57.460 --> 2:53:58.780
 Well, in certain contexts,

2:53:58.780 --> 2:54:01.060
 it leads to childbirth.

2:54:01.060 --> 2:54:03.020
 Okay, well, I'll have to read up on that.

2:54:03.020 --> 2:54:04.700
 I read that somewhere.

2:54:04.700 --> 2:54:07.460
 I suppose it's not required for childbirth,

2:54:07.460 --> 2:54:10.100
 but in all seriousness,

2:54:10.100 --> 2:54:12.340
 in New York, I'll go to a place called Spa 88,

2:54:12.340 --> 2:54:14.580
 and actually, Khabib's picture is on the wall.

2:54:14.580 --> 2:54:15.420
 He goes there.

2:54:15.420 --> 2:54:18.100
 And that one, it's clothing.

2:54:18.100 --> 2:54:19.180
 They require clothing.

2:54:19.180 --> 2:54:20.020
 I only just say that

2:54:20.020 --> 2:54:21.900
 because it can be a little bit of a shock to people sometimes

2:54:21.900 --> 2:54:22.740
 if they kind of walk in there,

2:54:22.740 --> 2:54:25.380
 a bunch of naked people, the one in San Francisco.

2:54:25.380 --> 2:54:26.500
 If I go, I'm clothed,

2:54:26.500 --> 2:54:29.420
 mostly because I run into coworkers or things like that.

2:54:29.420 --> 2:54:33.040
 You know, I'm sort of more old fashioned in that way,

2:54:33.040 --> 2:54:33.880
 I suppose.

2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:34.700
 But...

2:54:34.700 --> 2:54:36.440
 Do you like to wear clothes around coworkers?

2:54:36.440 --> 2:54:37.280
 Yes.

2:54:37.280 --> 2:54:38.100
 Yeah, in general. Very old fashioned.

2:54:38.100 --> 2:54:40.180
 Yeah, I mean, to me, it just seems like, you know,

2:54:40.180 --> 2:54:41.020
 just be aware.

2:54:41.020 --> 2:54:44.400
 But nonetheless, the Banyas have very hot saunas

2:54:44.400 --> 2:54:46.180
 because they're Russian owned.

2:54:46.180 --> 2:54:48.040
 And in New York, there's one on the Lower East Side,

2:54:48.040 --> 2:54:51.220
 but the Spa 88 place, they have some saunas

2:54:51.220 --> 2:54:53.940
 that the moment I get into those,

2:54:53.940 --> 2:54:55.580
 I have a hard time catching a full breath.

2:54:55.580 --> 2:54:56.720
 It burns.

2:54:56.720 --> 2:54:59.340
 They've got a cold dunk that's like a shock.

2:54:59.340 --> 2:55:01.460
 And then they've got a sauna, a wet sauna steam room

2:55:01.460 --> 2:55:02.700
 that's a little mellower.

2:55:02.700 --> 2:55:03.940
 So the nice thing about a Banya

2:55:03.940 --> 2:55:05.760
 is you can kind of find your place.

2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:06.820
 And then they do the plaza

2:55:06.820 --> 2:55:08.900
 where they take the eucalyptus leaves

2:55:08.900 --> 2:55:10.440
 and you can pay someone.

2:55:10.440 --> 2:55:12.180
 And you basically, you cover your groin

2:55:12.180 --> 2:55:15.700
 and then they beat you with the leaves.

2:55:15.700 --> 2:55:17.640
 And it's supposed to bring the vasculature to the surface.

2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:18.780
 I've only done it once.

2:55:18.780 --> 2:55:22.380
 And frankly, I found it to be a little bit unnerving.

2:55:22.380 --> 2:55:24.140
 I didn't really like the experience,

2:55:24.140 --> 2:55:26.060
 but I'll try and get into a sauna

2:55:26.060 --> 2:55:28.040
 as often as I possibly can,

2:55:28.040 --> 2:55:30.380
 which is once or three times per week.

2:55:30.380 --> 2:55:34.860
 And I try and do the cold exposure shower or immersion,

2:55:34.860 --> 2:55:37.780
 but early in the day, cause it really wakes you up.

2:55:37.780 --> 2:55:40.340
 One of my favorite things I've listened to,

2:55:40.340 --> 2:55:42.100
 I wish there was a video,

2:55:42.100 --> 2:55:45.140
 is listening to a bunch of stuff with Rick Rubin.

2:55:45.140 --> 2:55:47.780
 And he did a thing with Tim Ferriss,

2:55:47.780 --> 2:55:49.060
 like the Tim Ferriss podcast.

2:55:49.060 --> 2:55:50.540
 I don't know if you've ever heard it,

2:55:50.540 --> 2:55:55.540
 but he forced them to do, they did the podcast in a sauna.

2:55:56.660 --> 2:56:01.020
 And I don't think at the time Tim Ferriss was adapted.

2:56:01.020 --> 2:56:03.180
 If you're not heat adapted, it can be pretty stressful.

2:56:03.180 --> 2:56:05.740
 And I mean, obviously the whole experience is stressful

2:56:05.740 --> 2:56:09.340
 as somebody with microphones, like what is happening?

2:56:09.340 --> 2:56:12.940
 But I just love that Tim was vulnerable enough

2:56:12.940 --> 2:56:15.540
 to kind of give themself over

2:56:15.540 --> 2:56:17.260
 to whatever the hell this experience is.

2:56:17.260 --> 2:56:22.140
 And I am just so happy that Rick like pushed

2:56:22.140 --> 2:56:25.740
 that kind of idea and just let's do it.

2:56:25.740 --> 2:56:27.740
 That's a very Rick Rubin kind of thing to do.

2:56:27.740 --> 2:56:31.620
 And we must, like we must do this, this has to be done.

2:56:31.620 --> 2:56:34.740
 A podcast that was done from a sauna continuously

2:56:34.740 --> 2:56:35.680
 would be really interesting.

2:56:35.680 --> 2:56:37.180
 Like you could call it like the pressure cooker

2:56:37.180 --> 2:56:38.020
 or something.

2:56:38.020 --> 2:56:38.940
 Oh, I mean like a regular podcast.

2:56:38.940 --> 2:56:42.140
 Yeah, like you have to sit with your guests in the sauna

2:56:42.140 --> 2:56:43.700
 or they have to sit in the sauna.

2:56:43.700 --> 2:56:45.260
 That was one of the interesting things

2:56:45.260 --> 2:56:48.940
 is it was a sad thing because I believe there's no video

2:56:48.940 --> 2:56:53.740
 of that podcast, but you could tell there was a kind of,

2:56:53.740 --> 2:56:56.700
 there was suffering and especially on Tim's part.

2:56:56.700 --> 2:56:58.260
 It was like a degradation.

2:56:58.260 --> 2:57:01.380
 He started over time not being able

2:57:01.380 --> 2:57:05.600
 to put words together correctly, which he's very eloquent.

2:57:05.600 --> 2:57:10.540
 And so you could see there's like, there's a struggle.

2:57:10.540 --> 2:57:12.760
 Heat and cold pull you down from the inside.

2:57:12.760 --> 2:57:14.140
 You have to, I mean, there's a reason why

2:57:14.140 --> 2:57:18.820
 the screening process for, they call it SEAL training,

2:57:18.820 --> 2:57:21.420
 but it's really screening and training involves cold waters.

2:57:21.420 --> 2:57:23.300
 Cause if you're in the heat too long,

2:57:23.300 --> 2:57:25.060
 you'll die or damage tissue.

2:57:25.060 --> 2:57:27.160
 In cold, you can do it quite extensively

2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:30.220
 before you die or damage tissue, but it is stressful.

2:57:30.220 --> 2:57:33.620
 I was going to say one thing that I sometimes enjoy seeing

2:57:33.620 --> 2:57:35.740
 these social media posts where people will get

2:57:35.740 --> 2:57:37.880
 into the ice bath and they'll look really stoic.

2:57:37.880 --> 2:57:39.180
 Like they're really tough,

2:57:39.180 --> 2:57:43.300
 but actually that's the wimpy way to go through it.

2:57:43.300 --> 2:57:47.380
 When you get into cold water, if you stay very still,

2:57:47.380 --> 2:57:51.380
 you develop a thermal sheath around you

2:57:51.380 --> 2:57:53.300
 that you're warming yourself.

2:57:53.300 --> 2:57:56.300
 The really bold way is to get in and continue

2:57:56.300 --> 2:57:57.740
 to sift your arms and legs.

2:57:57.740 --> 2:58:00.940
 And it ends up feeling miserably colder.

2:58:00.940 --> 2:58:02.020
 And then there's no sheath

2:58:02.020 --> 2:58:04.580
 cause you're breaking up that thermal layer.

2:58:04.580 --> 2:58:06.500
 And then when you get out, you'll notice a lot

2:58:06.500 --> 2:58:09.620
 of people huddle or they'll put, or they'll grab the towel.

2:58:09.620 --> 2:58:10.500
 In general, that's me.

2:58:10.500 --> 2:58:12.580
 I'll get back, I'll get into the sauna.

2:58:12.580 --> 2:58:15.100
 But if you really want to stimulate the big increases

2:58:15.100 --> 2:58:18.080
 in metabolism, you stand out there and you dry off

2:58:18.080 --> 2:58:20.780
 with arms extended in open air.

2:58:20.780 --> 2:58:23.660
 And as that water evaporates off you, it is really cold,

2:58:23.660 --> 2:58:25.820
 but your body is forced to activate a number

2:58:25.820 --> 2:58:28.480
 of the warming programs related to metabolism.

2:58:28.480 --> 2:58:31.100
 This is the beautiful work of a woman named Susanna Soberg,

2:58:31.100 --> 2:58:32.420
 who's Scandinavian.

2:58:32.420 --> 2:58:34.980
 She published this paper last year in Cell Reports Medicine.

2:58:34.980 --> 2:58:36.820
 And so I call this the Soberg principle,

2:58:36.820 --> 2:58:40.300
 which is if you're doing ice and heat for whatever reason,

2:58:40.300 --> 2:58:41.900
 it doesn't matter if you end on heat or cold,

2:58:41.900 --> 2:58:44.140
 but if you're using cold specifically

2:58:44.140 --> 2:58:47.820
 to stimulate an increase in metabolism, end with cold.

2:58:47.820 --> 2:58:49.960
 That's the Soberg principle.

2:58:49.960 --> 2:58:52.340
 And with cold, if you're alternating,

2:58:52.340 --> 2:58:55.400
 and then if you want to do it the tough way,

2:58:55.400 --> 2:58:57.940
 you let the shivering, so you just stand out

2:58:57.940 --> 2:58:59.220
 and let the water evaporate.

2:58:59.220 --> 2:59:01.620
 Yeah, I mean, if you ever waded into a cold ocean,

2:59:01.620 --> 2:59:04.140
 everybody's kind of like holding themselves in,

2:59:04.140 --> 2:59:06.900
 if you really just, if you let yourself extend your limbs

2:59:06.900 --> 2:59:08.420
 and move them around a bit so you break up

2:59:08.420 --> 2:59:12.020
 that thermal layer, that's the tough way to do it.

2:59:12.020 --> 2:59:13.580
 So when I see people on social media getting in

2:59:13.580 --> 2:59:16.420
 and they're like really tough and trying to look hard.

2:59:16.420 --> 2:59:17.820
 Yeah, you want to be moving around.

2:59:17.820 --> 2:59:22.620
 Yeah, smiling, talking, moving around is way, way colder.

2:59:22.620 --> 2:59:23.780
 Are you able to talk?

2:59:23.780 --> 2:59:27.860
 Can you do, so you suggest the podcast in the sauna.

2:59:27.860 --> 2:59:28.700
 How about this?

2:59:28.700 --> 2:59:29.700
 I proposed this since I got choked.

2:59:29.700 --> 2:59:31.260
 You want to do the next podcast?

2:59:31.260 --> 2:59:33.980
 I'll get to, so the folks from The Plunge,

2:59:33.980 --> 2:59:35.780
 maybe you could bring Lex a plunge.

2:59:35.780 --> 2:59:37.740
 He certainly deserves one.

2:59:37.740 --> 2:59:40.180
 And we can go side by side coffin style,

2:59:40.180 --> 2:59:42.180
 or we can face one another when we're doing it.

2:59:42.180 --> 2:59:44.060
 Well, we said we should do each other's podcast.

2:59:44.060 --> 2:59:44.980
 I mean, it'd be next.

2:59:44.980 --> 2:59:46.280
 Well, I can't wait to have you back on.

2:59:46.280 --> 2:59:47.500
 I mean, we only scratched the surface.

2:59:47.500 --> 2:59:49.060
 Well, let's do at least part of the next

2:59:49.060 --> 2:59:51.380
 Human Lab podcast either in the.

2:59:51.380 --> 2:59:53.580
 I have a sauna and a cold plunge, so we could do it.

2:59:53.580 --> 2:59:55.020
 Yeah, we could do.

2:59:55.020 --> 2:59:57.140
 We do a sauna and a cold plunge version.

2:59:57.140 --> 2:59:59.580
 I wonder how the recording works,

2:59:59.580 --> 3:00:01.460
 if the recording. A bit of an echo in the sauna,

3:00:01.460 --> 3:00:04.060
 but I'm sure we can take out the reverb.

3:00:04.060 --> 3:00:08.720
 So Sergey wants to ask you about sex performance.

3:00:09.820 --> 3:00:12.340
 Very journalistic, very hardcore hitting questions

3:00:12.340 --> 3:00:13.180
 that we have here on the.

3:00:13.180 --> 3:00:15.140
 Generally, or a specific.

3:00:15.140 --> 3:00:18.260
 No, he has a certain problem he needs help with, no.

3:00:18.260 --> 3:00:21.580
 Generally, you haven't done an episode on sex.

3:00:21.580 --> 3:00:24.940
 Well, we did an episode early on, on sexual development.

3:00:24.940 --> 3:00:25.760
 Yes.

3:00:25.760 --> 3:00:27.660
 We've done them on optimizing testosterone and estrogen.

3:00:27.660 --> 3:00:31.300
 And we touched a little bit on the, on libido

3:00:31.300 --> 3:00:34.900
 and somewhat on sex performance, but not much.

3:00:34.900 --> 3:00:38.420
 We did an episode on relationships, love and desire,

3:00:38.420 --> 3:00:40.740
 where we touched on libido specifically.

3:00:40.740 --> 3:00:43.060
 So just as a quick mention of something,

3:00:43.060 --> 3:00:46.060
 a lot of people take SSRIs or antidepressants

3:00:46.060 --> 3:00:47.860
 that can disrupt sexual function.

3:00:47.860 --> 3:00:51.720
 There are a few compounds like maca root and punga ali

3:00:51.720 --> 3:00:53.680
 and things like that, that at least in a few studies

3:00:53.680 --> 3:00:55.180
 in humans have been shown to offset

3:00:55.180 --> 3:00:57.260
 some of the sexual side effects.

3:00:57.260 --> 3:01:01.300
 Now, in terms of sexual, and then the, sorry,

3:01:01.300 --> 3:01:04.220
 the episode on sexual development was about how the brain

3:01:04.220 --> 3:01:06.340
 and body become organized in certain ways,

3:01:06.340 --> 3:01:09.380
 how the brain becomes organized if you have X chromosomes

3:01:09.380 --> 3:01:11.060
 or Y chromosomes or et cetera.

3:01:11.060 --> 3:01:12.100
 So early, early development.

3:01:12.100 --> 3:01:13.220
 Early development mainly.

3:01:13.220 --> 3:01:16.540
 And the effects of hormones later on that template.

3:01:16.540 --> 3:01:21.000
 We will be doing a, I'm actually putting together a series

3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:26.000
 on sexual health, everything from the menstrual cycle,

3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:28.940
 which both men and women should understand, of course,

3:01:28.940 --> 3:01:32.060
 understanding arousal, understanding, for instance,

3:01:32.060 --> 3:01:33.140
 a lot of people don't realize this,

3:01:33.140 --> 3:01:37.000
 but that orgasm is actually the consequence of activity

3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:40.220
 in the sympathetic, meaning the stress arm

3:01:40.220 --> 3:01:42.580
 of the autonomic nervous system.

3:01:42.580 --> 3:01:46.680
 Whereas arousal is the consequence of the activity

3:01:46.680 --> 3:01:49.220
 of the parasympathetic, the calming aspect

3:01:49.220 --> 3:01:51.300
 of the autonomic nervous system.

3:01:51.300 --> 3:01:52.700
 That's counterintuitive, right?

3:01:52.700 --> 3:01:55.020
 It's counterintuitive and it kind of works like a seesaw.

3:01:55.020 --> 3:01:56.860
 I mean, there's arousal, then there's relaxation,

3:01:56.860 --> 3:02:01.620
 then there's arousal, and then immediately after orgasm

3:02:01.620 --> 3:02:03.540
 and in males ejaculation, what ends up happening

3:02:03.540 --> 3:02:07.020
 is there's a rebounding of the parasympathetic nervous system

3:02:07.020 --> 3:02:09.580
 which it leads to oftentimes people feeling very relaxed

3:02:09.580 --> 3:02:11.380
 or falling asleep.

3:02:11.380 --> 3:02:15.100
 So I'm going to do a short series on sexual health

3:02:15.100 --> 3:02:17.980
 that will include stuff about sexual performance,

3:02:17.980 --> 3:02:22.980
 but also some, I'm working on getting an expert guest

3:02:22.980 --> 3:02:26.820
 who can talk about some of the neurologic changes

3:02:26.820 --> 3:02:30.380
 that happen as a consequence of sexual activity.

3:02:30.380 --> 3:02:33.900
 And we did an episode with a guy from UT Austin here,

3:02:33.900 --> 3:02:36.320
 David Buss, who's an evolutionary psychologist,

3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:41.240
 talking about, it went pretty deep into some of the typical

3:02:41.240 --> 3:02:44.900
 and unusual dynamics of mating relation,

3:02:44.900 --> 3:02:46.940
 whether or not people have kids or not and what impacts that,

3:02:46.940 --> 3:02:49.620
 but we're going to do an episode on menopause, andropause.

3:02:49.620 --> 3:02:52.500
 What's very surprising is I get a lot of questions

3:02:52.500 --> 3:02:55.460
 about sexual health from the young male audience,

3:02:56.780 --> 3:03:00.240
 which tells me that, well, here's what I think it reflects.

3:03:00.240 --> 3:03:03.460
 I think that women, because of their menstrual cycles,

3:03:03.460 --> 3:03:06.540
 early on start to talk to one another about changes

3:03:06.540 --> 3:03:08.540
 in physiology and psychology as a function

3:03:08.540 --> 3:03:10.500
 of this 28 day cycle that they all experience

3:03:10.500 --> 3:03:11.820
 sooner or later.

3:03:11.820 --> 3:03:14.120
 Males, there's less of a conversation

3:03:14.120 --> 3:03:15.700
 and it usually arrives in code.

3:03:15.700 --> 3:03:16.900
 People will say, hey, what should I take

3:03:16.900 --> 3:03:18.220
 to increase my testosterone?

3:03:18.220 --> 3:03:20.500
 And I'll say, well, maybe nothing.

3:03:20.500 --> 3:03:23.580
 You know, what are you specifically concerned about?

3:03:23.580 --> 3:03:25.340
 And then over time, if you pull on those threads

3:03:25.340 --> 3:03:28.200
 a little bit, you know, you get your answer.

3:03:28.200 --> 3:03:30.720
 Sometimes I'll just get a direct question.

3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:33.500
 But I think that the psychology of all this

3:03:33.500 --> 3:03:36.860
 and in terms of jealousy and the terms of notions

3:03:36.860 --> 3:03:40.500
 of roles and relationships is very dynamic right now.

3:03:40.500 --> 3:03:41.660
 And I'm fascinated by this.

3:03:41.660 --> 3:03:43.740
 So we're going to do a four episode series.

3:03:43.740 --> 3:03:45.180
 What about sexual fantasy?

3:03:46.500 --> 3:03:48.860
 What, to get Freudian for a second,

3:03:48.860 --> 3:03:52.820
 what role does sexual fantasy have in the human condition?

3:03:52.820 --> 3:03:56.060
 There's a book called The Erotic Imagination.

3:03:56.060 --> 3:03:57.500
 It's a very psychoanalytic book written

3:03:57.500 --> 3:04:01.220
 by a psychoanalyst that talks about how,

3:04:01.220 --> 3:04:03.180
 well, here's the uncomfortable reality.

3:04:03.180 --> 3:04:05.260
 Freud was at least right about one thing,

3:04:05.260 --> 3:04:09.020
 which is that the brain circuitry that you used

3:04:09.020 --> 3:04:11.180
 to develop attachments to your caregivers,

3:04:11.180 --> 3:04:13.340
 mother and father or other caregivers,

3:04:14.300 --> 3:04:16.700
 do not disappear when you hit puberty.

3:04:16.700 --> 3:04:20.380
 They are repurposed for romantic and sexual relations.

3:04:20.380 --> 3:04:23.780
 And so this is why the whole notion of anxious attached

3:04:23.780 --> 3:04:26.300
 and secure attached, you know, stems from childhood

3:04:26.300 --> 3:04:27.940
 attachment patterns, but it carries over

3:04:27.940 --> 3:04:29.820
 to romantic relationships.

3:04:29.820 --> 3:04:32.580
 So that the relationship with your mother has.

3:04:32.580 --> 3:04:33.420
 And father.

3:04:33.420 --> 3:04:36.980
 And father has a, and probably other close people to you

3:04:36.980 --> 3:04:41.340
 in your young age has a secondary, tertiary,

3:04:41.340 --> 3:04:44.420
 some kind of ripple effect on how your sexuality developed.

3:04:44.420 --> 3:04:46.180
 Like what fantasies you might have, all that.

3:04:46.180 --> 3:04:47.220
 No, without question.

3:04:47.220 --> 3:04:48.980
 And of course, early experiences too,

3:04:48.980 --> 3:04:51.780
 and traumatic or positive or neutral.

3:04:51.780 --> 3:04:53.580
 The thing that's really important to remember though,

3:04:53.580 --> 3:04:57.180
 in this transfer of circuitry from one role to another

3:04:57.180 --> 3:05:00.860
 is that, and it's certainly consistent with psychoanalysis

3:05:00.860 --> 3:05:04.820
 that gender is interchangeable, sex is interchangeable.

3:05:04.820 --> 3:05:07.660
 So for instance, let's say you had a wonderful relationship.

3:05:07.660 --> 3:05:10.860
 Let's say this, let's take a hypothetical person, okay?

3:05:10.860 --> 3:05:12.220
 I'm truly not referring to myself.

3:05:12.220 --> 3:05:15.700
 Let's take a young woman who has a wonderful relationship

3:05:15.700 --> 3:05:18.660
 with her father and a just absolutely terrible

3:05:18.660 --> 3:05:20.340
 abusive relationship to her mother.

3:05:20.340 --> 3:05:21.620
 Just for sake of example.

3:05:22.620 --> 3:05:26.420
 She then goes into adulthood and she is drawn

3:05:26.420 --> 3:05:28.980
 to very abusive men.

3:05:28.980 --> 3:05:31.260
 Not always, but let's just use in this example.

3:05:32.180 --> 3:05:34.260
 And the dynamic is exactly the same

3:05:34.260 --> 3:05:36.100
 as the dynamic she had with her mother.

3:05:36.100 --> 3:05:37.900
 That's actually a common occurrence.

3:05:37.900 --> 3:05:40.580
 Even though in this context, she's heterosexual,

3:05:40.580 --> 3:05:41.980
 she's romantically attracted to men.

3:05:41.980 --> 3:05:44.660
 What is seen over and over again is that the dynamic

3:05:44.660 --> 3:05:47.620
 with one parent can be transferred onto a romantic dynamic,

3:05:47.620 --> 3:05:49.540
 but it doesn't have to be, you know,

3:05:49.540 --> 3:05:51.100
 that if it was with the mother,

3:05:51.100 --> 3:05:53.380
 then it only has to do with relationships to women.

3:05:53.380 --> 3:05:54.940
 So gender is interchangeable

3:05:54.940 --> 3:05:58.300
 because these circuitries are presexual.

3:05:58.300 --> 3:06:00.020
 They're laid down in our brain

3:06:00.020 --> 3:06:04.220
 before the brain has any concept of sexual interactions.

3:06:04.220 --> 3:06:06.620
 It's preverbal, excuse me.

3:06:06.620 --> 3:06:09.860
 And so there are a lot of interesting examples

3:06:09.860 --> 3:06:11.100
 and data to support this.

3:06:11.100 --> 3:06:14.700
 The book Attached is a pretty interesting book

3:06:14.700 --> 3:06:16.260
 by two psychologists.

3:06:16.260 --> 3:06:18.140
 One I think is at Columbia University

3:06:19.140 --> 3:06:22.700
 that talks about how childhood dynamics carry over

3:06:22.700 --> 3:06:25.620
 to adult romantic attachment.

3:06:25.620 --> 3:06:27.820
 So as you can tell, I get pretty alert

3:06:27.820 --> 3:06:29.140
 in response to these questions.

3:06:29.140 --> 3:06:32.140
 I get a lot of them relate in this domain.

3:06:32.140 --> 3:06:33.620
 They have a lot of impact on people

3:06:33.620 --> 3:06:35.380
 and they're wondering about, they wanna learn.

3:06:35.380 --> 3:06:37.060
 And no one knows what other people are doing

3:06:37.060 --> 3:06:37.900
 or what's normal.

3:06:37.900 --> 3:06:39.220
 We kind of know deviancy.

3:06:39.220 --> 3:06:40.100
 We know perversion.

3:06:40.100 --> 3:06:42.100
 We know the extremes.

3:06:42.100 --> 3:06:43.100
 We know the rules.

3:06:43.100 --> 3:06:44.460
 Hopefully people know the rules,

3:06:44.460 --> 3:06:47.660
 but let's just be,

3:06:47.660 --> 3:06:51.660
 there are a lot of people in the academic community,

3:06:51.660 --> 3:06:54.780
 in particular at certain East Coast schools not to be named

3:06:54.780 --> 3:06:57.580
 that are in open relationships.

3:06:57.580 --> 3:06:58.880
 This is more common now.

3:06:59.940 --> 3:07:03.340
 It's not very common, but it's more common.

3:07:03.340 --> 3:07:06.900
 And obviously that's a way of bypassing

3:07:06.900 --> 3:07:08.540
 some of these more primitive emotions

3:07:08.540 --> 3:07:10.220
 about jealousy, et cetera,

3:07:10.220 --> 3:07:12.300
 and leveraging them towards

3:07:12.300 --> 3:07:13.920
 maybe even ongoing relationships.

3:07:13.920 --> 3:07:16.060
 I'm not passing judgment one way or the other.

3:07:16.060 --> 3:07:18.420
 I always say four conditions have to be met

3:07:18.420 --> 3:07:21.020
 for any discussion about sex and sexuality

3:07:21.020 --> 3:07:21.980
 or sexual health.

3:07:21.980 --> 3:07:25.060
 Age appropriate, context appropriate,

3:07:25.060 --> 3:07:27.340
 consensual and species appropriate.

3:07:28.300 --> 3:07:31.600
 Well, that's weird because the thing I'm trying to figure out

3:07:31.600 --> 3:07:36.600
 is why my sexual fantasy is to go to furry orgies

3:07:36.600 --> 3:07:41.180
 and have sex with others dressed as squirrels

3:07:41.180 --> 3:07:43.340
 and me, the other animals.

3:07:43.340 --> 3:07:48.100
 So that could be, I'll see a therapist about that one.

3:07:48.100 --> 3:07:48.940
 Can I ask you?

3:07:48.940 --> 3:07:52.260
 I'm not gonna respond to that except to say that

3:07:52.260 --> 3:07:54.580
 as long as those four conditions are met.

3:07:54.580 --> 3:07:55.420
 Yeah.

3:07:55.420 --> 3:07:56.260
 Consensual, age appropriate,

3:07:56.260 --> 3:07:57.860
 context appropriate, species appropriate.

3:07:57.860 --> 3:08:00.860
 So there's a bunch of questions on Instagram.

3:08:00.860 --> 3:08:05.260
 One of them on this topic, on relationships,

3:08:05.260 --> 3:08:08.540
 somebody suggested to do a part three of why Lex is single.

3:08:08.540 --> 3:08:11.420
 There's a running joke about this.

3:08:11.420 --> 3:08:12.260
 So.

3:08:12.260 --> 3:08:14.620
 But I can answer it in part, right?

3:08:14.620 --> 3:08:17.340
 Because, well, partially because you're very busy,

3:08:17.340 --> 3:08:22.340
 partially because you've decided that until it's time,

3:08:22.980 --> 3:08:26.680
 you're gonna wait until it's time, it's time, right?

3:08:26.680 --> 3:08:28.140
 I mean, until it's time, you're waiting.

3:08:28.140 --> 3:08:31.060
 And then, I mean, not saving yourself for marriage,

3:08:31.060 --> 3:08:34.420
 I don't think, but in some sense,

3:08:34.420 --> 3:08:37.700
 yeah, your future wife is out there.

3:08:37.700 --> 3:08:38.540
 Oh yeah, yeah.

3:08:38.540 --> 3:08:39.820
 She's being programmed.

3:08:39.820 --> 3:08:43.100
 No, I mean, I definitely believe that.

3:08:43.100 --> 3:08:45.140
 I mean, first of all, I just love people

3:08:45.140 --> 3:08:47.060
 and I fall in love very easily with people,

3:08:47.060 --> 3:08:50.140
 with objects, with things, with life, with every moment.

3:08:50.140 --> 3:08:51.940
 And that way you're like Oliver Sacks,

3:08:51.940 --> 3:08:53.580
 he would fall in love with minerals

3:08:54.800 --> 3:08:56.540
 and concepts and things like that.

3:08:56.540 --> 3:08:58.740
 And so like to me, this kind of,

3:08:58.740 --> 3:09:03.740
 so relationship is more like a commitment

3:09:04.020 --> 3:09:09.020
 to one particular kind of object of your love.

3:09:10.380 --> 3:09:12.800
 Like it's almost like a,

3:09:12.800 --> 3:09:14.940
 it's like a journey that you take on together

3:09:14.940 --> 3:09:18.020
 because also the interesting thing about humans

3:09:18.020 --> 3:09:20.900
 is they're moment by moment a different person,

3:09:20.900 --> 3:09:23.260
 day by day, week by week, month by month,

3:09:23.260 --> 3:09:24.820
 they change, they evolve.

3:09:24.820 --> 3:09:26.720
 There's an ups and downs and stuff like that.

3:09:26.720 --> 3:09:29.140
 So what you're doing is you're saying,

3:09:29.140 --> 3:09:31.380
 well, I'm going to explore all the ways

3:09:31.380 --> 3:09:34.460
 that this human gets morphed and changed

3:09:34.460 --> 3:09:38.500
 and what makes them cry, what makes them excited,

3:09:38.500 --> 3:09:43.500
 what makes them lonely, like the habits,

3:09:44.460 --> 3:09:47.180
 like when they form certain habits,

3:09:47.180 --> 3:09:49.260
 how they feel when those habits are broken,

3:09:49.260 --> 3:09:52.740
 like the stupid minute things that make everyday life,

3:09:52.740 --> 3:09:54.900
 you're gonna be on that journey together

3:09:54.900 --> 3:09:56.940
 figuring that out, just the way we're trying to figure

3:09:56.940 --> 3:10:00.020
 ourselves out when we're like optimizing these things

3:10:00.020 --> 3:10:01.460
 about diet and health and so on,

3:10:01.460 --> 3:10:04.380
 you're kind of doing this computation together

3:10:04.380 --> 3:10:06.980
 because neither person really understands themselves

3:10:08.260 --> 3:10:11.260
 at all and you're together both confused about each other

3:10:11.260 --> 3:10:15.620
 and you get to almost like a relationship is a chance

3:10:16.620 --> 3:10:21.620
 to understand yourself and to understand another person,

3:10:21.620 --> 3:10:25.860
 like together, that process is somewhat iterative.

3:10:25.860 --> 3:10:27.180
 You know the dynamics, right?

3:10:27.180 --> 3:10:29.300
 I mean, you're merging two nervous systems.

3:10:29.300 --> 3:10:32.100
 This was once described to me very well by an ex girlfriend

3:10:32.100 --> 3:10:35.320
 who's truly brilliant, she's really brilliant.

3:10:36.980 --> 3:10:39.500
 She said, you know, there's four arrows.

3:10:39.500 --> 3:10:42.980
 This is maybe to an engineer or like a, so it makes sense.

3:10:42.980 --> 3:10:45.340
 There's how you feel towards the other person.

3:10:45.340 --> 3:10:47.420
 There's how they feel towards you,

3:10:47.420 --> 3:10:51.020
 but then there's an arrow that comes back to you,

3:10:51.020 --> 3:10:54.940
 which is how you feel about how they feel.

3:10:54.940 --> 3:10:56.720
 And then they have an arrow of how they feel

3:10:56.720 --> 3:10:57.940
 about how you feel, right?

3:10:57.940 --> 3:10:59.460
 This is why if someone else is moody

3:10:59.460 --> 3:11:00.780
 or somebody else is upset,

3:11:01.900 --> 3:11:05.020
 there's one version of ourselves where we respond to that

3:11:05.020 --> 3:11:06.340
 or they respond to us,

3:11:06.340 --> 3:11:09.580
 but there's another version where we respond to that,

3:11:09.580 --> 3:11:12.660
 but it's also, there's a processing of what it means for us

3:11:12.660 --> 3:11:15.460
 that they're behaving that way or feeling that way.

3:11:15.460 --> 3:11:17.780
 And this again leads us back

3:11:17.780 --> 3:11:19.300
 to that early attachment circuitry

3:11:19.300 --> 3:11:22.900
 because if a parent was stressed,

3:11:22.900 --> 3:11:25.860
 the child's role is not to soothe the parent.

3:11:25.860 --> 3:11:27.500
 In fact, healthy models of parenting say

3:11:27.500 --> 3:11:30.840
 that children shouldn't actually know how their parents feel

3:11:30.840 --> 3:11:32.860
 for like the first eight years of their life.

3:11:32.860 --> 3:11:34.420
 They're not supposed to be in that mindset

3:11:34.420 --> 3:11:35.900
 of empathizing for the parent.

3:11:35.900 --> 3:11:37.780
 This is often not the case,

3:11:37.780 --> 3:11:40.080
 but maybe the cutoff isn't exactly eight,

3:11:40.080 --> 3:11:41.240
 but you get the idea.

3:11:41.240 --> 3:11:44.060
 So the dynamics of relationship are where the learning is

3:11:44.060 --> 3:11:46.660
 because we learn how we react to other people reacting.

3:11:46.660 --> 3:11:49.060
 It's not just a two arrow system.

3:11:49.060 --> 3:11:51.140
 It's at least this four arrow thing.

3:11:52.320 --> 3:11:54.900
 But there's also the element of nurturing, right?

3:11:54.900 --> 3:11:57.860
 I mean, I think that going through life with somebody

3:11:57.860 --> 3:12:00.140
 is so much better than going through it alone.

3:12:00.140 --> 3:12:02.700
 And I'd never thought I'd make that statement.

3:12:04.180 --> 3:12:05.860
 So it wasn't always obvious to you?

3:12:05.860 --> 3:12:07.340
 No, it wasn't always obvious to me.

3:12:07.340 --> 3:12:10.380
 I mean, I've really enjoyed wonderful relationships

3:12:11.260 --> 3:12:12.540
 and some have been hard

3:12:12.540 --> 3:12:14.500
 and there's certainly been a lot of growth.

3:12:14.500 --> 3:12:18.940
 I'm on good terms with almost all my former girlfriends

3:12:18.940 --> 3:12:21.960
 and close with some enough that I know their spouses

3:12:21.960 --> 3:12:23.620
 and I'm close with their families.

3:12:24.700 --> 3:12:25.740
 But no, it wasn't.

3:12:25.740 --> 3:12:29.680
 And I think that when people say relationship is hard,

3:12:29.680 --> 3:12:32.960
 the only really hard part of a good relationship

3:12:32.960 --> 3:12:34.340
 is just dealing with oneself

3:12:34.340 --> 3:12:35.540
 and making sure that you're staying

3:12:35.540 --> 3:12:38.000
 in that mode of caretaking.

3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:40.800
 Because I do believe that if one is mainly focused

3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:42.700
 on taking good care of the other person,

3:12:42.700 --> 3:12:46.400
 provided they're also focused on taking good care of you,

3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:49.040
 to some extent, and we're good at taking care of ourselves,

3:12:49.040 --> 3:12:51.040
 everybody flourishes, everything gets better.

3:12:51.040 --> 3:12:52.940
 But no, I don't think I experienced that

3:12:52.940 --> 3:12:54.880
 until fairly recently.

3:12:54.880 --> 3:12:58.380
 What do you think is the secret

3:12:58.380 --> 3:12:59.920
 to a successful relationship?

3:13:02.900 --> 3:13:07.360
 There isn't just one, but at least in the top five

3:13:07.360 --> 3:13:12.360
 is master or at least be good at autonomic self regulation.

3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:16.300
 Be good at autonomic self regulation.

3:13:16.300 --> 3:13:18.700
 Know how to calm yourself down.

3:13:18.700 --> 3:13:21.700
 Don't expect the, like looking to anything external

3:13:21.700 --> 3:13:24.720
 to soothe yourself is it puts you in a terrible position

3:13:24.720 --> 3:13:27.700
 to be a caretaker of yourself and other people, right?

3:13:27.700 --> 3:13:29.200
 So learn how to self soothe, right?

3:13:29.200 --> 3:13:32.460
 Learn how to calm your mind, steady your actions,

3:13:32.460 --> 3:13:33.500
 steady your voice.

3:13:33.500 --> 3:13:34.420
 There are tools to do that.

3:13:34.420 --> 3:13:35.900
 We talk about on the podcast, but elsewhere,

3:13:35.900 --> 3:13:36.900
 have that in place.

3:13:36.900 --> 3:13:41.900
 I also think that if your main focus is on,

3:13:41.900 --> 3:13:43.860
 you want to have a good boundaries, et cetera,

3:13:43.860 --> 3:13:46.420
 but on tending to the relationship,

3:13:46.420 --> 3:13:48.540
 doing a little bit more than you think you ought to do,

3:13:48.540 --> 3:13:50.740
 if everyone does that, it goes great.

3:13:50.740 --> 3:13:52.880
 I mean, I'm sometimes so positively struck

3:13:52.880 --> 3:13:57.840
 by how supported I feel because for many years,

3:13:57.840 --> 3:13:59.620
 I was just kind of doing everything on my own.

3:13:59.620 --> 3:14:01.180
 So any little thing, I'm like, oh my goodness,

3:14:01.180 --> 3:14:02.780
 this feels huge.

3:14:02.780 --> 3:14:04.980
 And also I think the dynamics have to be right.

3:14:04.980 --> 3:14:05.860
 Let's be really honest.

3:14:05.860 --> 3:14:07.500
 This is a little bit of a tricky topic,

3:14:07.500 --> 3:14:12.500
 but there is a power dynamic in relationships.

3:14:13.460 --> 3:14:16.400
 Sometimes, not all, but in some relationships,

3:14:16.400 --> 3:14:18.500
 it works much better if one person leads

3:14:18.500 --> 3:14:21.100
 and the other person follows.

3:14:21.100 --> 3:14:24.820
 In other relationships, it's more mutuality, works best.

3:14:24.820 --> 3:14:26.880
 People need to know what they need.

3:14:26.880 --> 3:14:29.300
 And so knowing what you need and what you crave

3:14:29.300 --> 3:14:30.260
 is really important.

3:14:30.260 --> 3:14:31.100
 And then once you do that,

3:14:31.100 --> 3:14:33.400
 you can create the relationship you want.

3:14:33.400 --> 3:14:34.760
 I've seen that over and over again.

3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:36.020
 And people are different.

3:14:36.020 --> 3:14:41.020
 But I think that ultimately, I mean, right,

3:14:41.300 --> 3:14:44.740
 there's the dopamine phase of a relationship.

3:14:44.740 --> 3:14:46.140
 And then there's the serotonin phase,

3:14:46.140 --> 3:14:49.020
 the kind of more mutuality, coziness and sweetness.

3:14:49.020 --> 3:14:52.220
 There's a great book about how to make sure

3:14:52.220 --> 3:14:56.460
 that the dopamine component and the serotonin component,

3:14:56.460 --> 3:14:58.540
 so to speak, go on forever.

3:14:58.540 --> 3:14:59.780
 And it has to do with, you know,

3:14:59.780 --> 3:15:01.400
 when you first meet someone and you're attracted to them,

3:15:01.400 --> 3:15:04.500
 you're essentially objectifying them,

3:15:04.500 --> 3:15:07.100
 meaning not in the way people might think,

3:15:07.100 --> 3:15:09.500
 you are not dependent on them

3:15:09.500 --> 3:15:11.700
 for emotional stability or survival.

3:15:11.700 --> 3:15:12.860
 As you get close to somebody,

3:15:12.860 --> 3:15:14.820
 you really come to depend on them

3:15:14.820 --> 3:15:16.500
 and then you tend to objectify them less.

3:15:16.500 --> 3:15:18.820
 And so this book, the name is kind of corny,

3:15:18.820 --> 3:15:20.280
 but it's written by an analyst again,

3:15:20.280 --> 3:15:21.620
 it's called Can Love Last?

3:15:21.620 --> 3:15:26.260
 And it's a book about how really good, strong relationships

3:15:26.260 --> 3:15:28.560
 are the consequence of people constantly moving

3:15:28.560 --> 3:15:33.260
 through this dependency objectification dynamic.

3:15:33.260 --> 3:15:37.060
 And I use those words in the psychological sense,

3:15:37.060 --> 3:15:39.100
 not in the way they're typically thrown around nowadays.

3:15:39.100 --> 3:15:41.940
 So in some cultures,

3:15:41.940 --> 3:15:45.020
 men and women will only touch

3:15:45.020 --> 3:15:46.900
 for two weeks out of the month.

3:15:46.900 --> 3:15:48.580
 And then for the other two weeks,

3:15:49.500 --> 3:15:52.540
 the excitement and the sensuality and all,

3:15:52.540 --> 3:15:54.660
 and the sexuality is very heightened.

3:15:54.660 --> 3:15:56.460
 And then they go back to this kind of distancing.

3:15:56.460 --> 3:15:58.660
 Now, I don't think that's feasible for most people,

3:15:58.660 --> 3:16:00.200
 but if you look statistically,

3:16:00.200 --> 3:16:02.900
 those relationships tend to last a very long time

3:16:02.900 --> 3:16:05.940
 with at least reported mutual feelings

3:16:05.940 --> 3:16:10.500
 of intense attraction for many, many, many decades.

3:16:10.500 --> 3:16:14.660
 So human beings need to learn how to at least understand

3:16:14.660 --> 3:16:16.060
 and control these dynamics.

3:16:16.060 --> 3:16:17.860
 And there's a lot of divorce, there's a lot of cheating,

3:16:17.860 --> 3:16:18.860
 there's a lot of stuff out there.

3:16:18.860 --> 3:16:20.900
 It'd be great if people could resolve some of this stuff

3:16:20.900 --> 3:16:23.060
 inside of the relationship, in my opinion.

3:16:24.260 --> 3:16:26.860
 Yeah, and this kind of intense attraction,

3:16:26.860 --> 3:16:31.860
 there's actually one of the poems

3:16:32.900 --> 3:16:36.020
 that Karl Deisseroth introduced me to.

3:16:36.020 --> 3:16:38.340
 I think it's Two English Poems is the name.

3:16:38.340 --> 3:16:41.960
 But one of the things I find myself

3:16:41.960 --> 3:16:45.020
 for prolonged periods being attracted to

3:16:45.900 --> 3:16:49.780
 is you notice some kind of magic

3:16:50.640 --> 3:16:55.640
 and you keep wanting to dig to the depths of that magic.

3:16:55.640 --> 3:16:57.800
 You need to really know that person.

3:16:57.800 --> 3:17:00.360
 To really know a person deeply, yeah.

3:17:00.360 --> 3:17:03.400
 You notice something early on.

3:17:03.400 --> 3:17:04.500
 I don't know what that is,

3:17:04.500 --> 3:17:06.640
 but you just notice something special

3:17:06.640 --> 3:17:09.080
 and you want to keep pulling at that thread

3:17:09.080 --> 3:17:10.640
 and you never really do.

3:17:10.640 --> 3:17:12.040
 Well, you also have to be careful.

3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:13.600
 I get a lot of questions from guys.

3:17:13.600 --> 3:17:15.060
 You have to be careful the questions you ask

3:17:15.060 --> 3:17:16.400
 in a relationship too.

3:17:16.400 --> 3:17:18.400
 You have to make sure you really want that information.

3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:20.080
 And it's not just about people's past, right?

3:17:20.080 --> 3:17:21.800
 If you ask somebody how they really feel

3:17:21.800 --> 3:17:24.680
 about something about you and they tell you,

3:17:24.680 --> 3:17:25.960
 that may be soothing.

3:17:25.960 --> 3:17:27.900
 It may be intensely stressful.

3:17:27.900 --> 3:17:31.240
 You have to be, here's one thing I know for sure.

3:17:31.240 --> 3:17:34.020
 For a relationship to work, you have to be brave.

3:17:34.900 --> 3:17:37.480
 You can't go in there fully protected.

3:17:37.480 --> 3:17:39.680
 And yet you also can't go in there with no boundaries

3:17:39.680 --> 3:17:42.240
 because you'll end up beat up.

3:17:42.240 --> 3:17:43.260
 What's that quote?

3:17:43.260 --> 3:17:45.160
 If you want to be a warrior, prepare to get hurt.

3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:47.280
 If you want to be an explorer, prepare to get lost.

3:17:47.280 --> 3:17:49.440
 And if you want to be both, you know,

3:17:49.440 --> 3:17:52.080
 if you become a lover, prepare to be both or something.

3:17:52.080 --> 3:17:52.920
 Something like that.

3:17:52.920 --> 3:17:55.080
 I forget, this is one of these Instagram type things

3:17:55.080 --> 3:17:56.880
 that you see passing by and you go, oh, that's pretty true.

3:17:56.880 --> 3:17:59.920
 Love is scary because it takes us back

3:17:59.920 --> 3:18:03.000
 to that primitive circuitry that is as primitive

3:18:03.000 --> 3:18:05.820
 and basic as hunger, thirst, the desire for heat

3:18:05.820 --> 3:18:10.040
 when we're cold, the desire for cold when we're overly warm.

3:18:10.040 --> 3:18:11.940
 It's a, it's Dynorphin.

3:18:11.940 --> 3:18:14.600
 I mean, when somebody leaves, like the, you know,

3:18:14.600 --> 3:18:17.880
 when somebody you are attached to leaves by death

3:18:17.880 --> 3:18:20.680
 or by decision or you're forced apart,

3:18:20.680 --> 3:18:23.160
 the Dynorphin release is massive.

3:18:23.160 --> 3:18:24.520
 It is true discomfort.

3:18:24.520 --> 3:18:27.760
 People feel anxiety and discomfort.

3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:30.240
 And moving through that is a hell of a process.

3:18:30.240 --> 3:18:32.820
 I mean, if I knew how to best break up

3:18:32.820 --> 3:18:34.520
 at a neurological level,

3:18:34.520 --> 3:18:37.200
 or if you could just plug yourself into a wall and reset,

3:18:37.200 --> 3:18:39.400
 I mean, I'd do that episode tomorrow,

3:18:39.400 --> 3:18:41.360
 but we don't have that knowledge.

3:18:41.360 --> 3:18:44.100
 Come on, I think we've covered this before

3:18:44.100 --> 3:18:45.840
 and it's even been memeified.

3:18:45.840 --> 3:18:49.560
 I think losing love is part of the magic of love.

3:18:49.560 --> 3:18:51.480
 It means you've felt something.

3:18:51.480 --> 3:18:52.880
 I agree, but at some point,

3:18:52.880 --> 3:18:54.720
 like if you've done it enough times,

3:18:54.720 --> 3:18:57.480
 you know, life is finite, you know.

3:18:57.480 --> 3:18:59.840
 It is beautiful to see these couples

3:18:59.840 --> 3:19:04.840
 that seem very much in love despite many years,

3:19:04.960 --> 3:19:06.640
 despite having been together many years.

3:19:06.640 --> 3:19:08.400
 Yeah, the way they look at each other.

3:19:08.400 --> 3:19:09.240
 Yeah, they'll say.

3:19:09.240 --> 3:19:10.200
 They still see the magic.

3:19:10.200 --> 3:19:11.920
 Yeah, and they'll say, we got lucky

3:19:11.920 --> 3:19:14.120
 or it was, it's been hard or this and that.

3:19:14.120 --> 3:19:18.560
 I think external conditions being a little tougher

3:19:18.560 --> 3:19:20.640
 is helpful for a couple.

3:19:20.640 --> 3:19:21.480
 Hardship.

3:19:21.480 --> 3:19:24.720
 I do, I do, because I think that you rally, you know,

3:19:24.720 --> 3:19:26.560
 and you bond with people, you know,

3:19:26.560 --> 3:19:29.200
 obviously you want to survive those conditions,

3:19:29.200 --> 3:19:31.640
 but yeah, I do.

3:19:31.640 --> 3:19:32.480
 I think that it helps.

3:19:32.480 --> 3:19:33.760
 Bonnie and Clyde.

3:19:33.760 --> 3:19:34.600
 So any.

3:19:34.600 --> 3:19:35.760
 Well, they were a little.

3:19:35.760 --> 3:19:37.480
 Oh, a little too much.

3:19:37.480 --> 3:19:38.800
 Well, a little too much.

3:19:38.800 --> 3:19:41.080
 They were sociopaths, but the,

3:19:41.080 --> 3:19:42.720
 well, when two sociopaths find one.

3:19:42.720 --> 3:19:44.120
 Love can make you do crazy things.

3:19:44.120 --> 3:19:45.060
 Normally, it's interesting,

3:19:45.060 --> 3:19:47.560
 normally sociopaths don't team up

3:19:47.560 --> 3:19:50.080
 because they manipulate each other.

3:19:50.080 --> 3:19:53.500
 Sociopaths sadly are usually only interested

3:19:53.500 --> 3:19:56.920
 in manipulating the highly pliable or unsuspecting,

3:19:58.480 --> 3:20:01.860
 but when romantic attraction is woven in,

3:20:01.860 --> 3:20:05.440
 then it gets really diabolical.

3:20:05.440 --> 3:20:09.440
 Any advice on finding the love of your life, of my life?

3:20:09.440 --> 3:20:12.360
 This is, why Lexus single response?

3:20:12.360 --> 3:20:13.640
 Why, any advice?

3:20:15.460 --> 3:20:17.320
 Yeah, actually this comes from a friend of mine

3:20:17.320 --> 3:20:19.680
 who's in a really excellent marriage

3:20:19.680 --> 3:20:23.360
 with great kids and family and high demand life.

3:20:24.440 --> 3:20:25.600
 It's a decision.

3:20:25.600 --> 3:20:28.600
 Like at some point you just prioritize it as,

3:20:28.600 --> 3:20:33.340
 okay, I'm going to make this happen one way or another.

3:20:33.340 --> 3:20:36.560
 And you don't force the discovery of that person.

3:20:36.560 --> 3:20:38.800
 But I mean, I've occasionally said,

3:20:38.800 --> 3:20:41.020
 hey, I think you should meet this person or that person.

3:20:41.020 --> 3:20:44.520
 And well, it wasn't, maybe my judgment

3:20:44.520 --> 3:20:47.160
 might've been off, but the timing wasn't right or something.

3:20:47.160 --> 3:20:49.960
 But I think that, yeah, it's a decision.

3:20:49.960 --> 3:20:52.160
 And it also has to do with life structure.

3:20:52.160 --> 3:20:53.000
 I mean, there were years.

3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:54.880
 So when I was in graduate school,

3:20:54.880 --> 3:20:56.360
 I didn't want a girlfriend.

3:20:56.360 --> 3:20:57.600
 I just wanted to be in lab.

3:20:57.600 --> 3:21:00.620
 And I, sure I had romantic dating interests,

3:21:00.620 --> 3:21:02.800
 but I wasn't going to meet them through a committed,

3:21:02.800 --> 3:21:04.400
 live together situation.

3:21:04.400 --> 3:21:05.720
 It wasn't where I was at.

3:21:05.720 --> 3:21:07.360
 And as a postdoc, things were a little different,

3:21:07.360 --> 3:21:08.200
 et cetera, et cetera.

3:21:08.200 --> 3:21:09.880
 So, but at some point it's sort of like,

3:21:09.880 --> 3:21:12.440
 what do I want my daily routine to look like?

3:21:12.440 --> 3:21:16.240
 Because ultimately a relationship, however one structures,

3:21:16.240 --> 3:21:18.120
 is going to be part of your daily routine.

3:21:18.120 --> 3:21:19.400
 So at the point where you're like,

3:21:19.400 --> 3:21:21.720
 I'd really love to wake up next to somebody

3:21:21.720 --> 3:21:23.960
 and do blank and blank together.

3:21:23.960 --> 3:21:27.620
 And then I'd love to work and then we meet for dinner.

3:21:27.620 --> 3:21:30.080
 And then we take the dog for a walk or take kids out

3:21:30.080 --> 3:21:32.960
 or whatever it happens to be, take a trip.

3:21:32.960 --> 3:21:35.680
 You have to be, one has to be in the mindset

3:21:35.680 --> 3:21:38.760
 of wanting to do couple like things.

3:21:38.760 --> 3:21:40.480
 And a lot of people don't think about it that way.

3:21:40.480 --> 3:21:43.200
 They either fall into something

3:21:43.200 --> 3:21:48.200
 or they don't see the benefits of coupling up.

3:21:48.400 --> 3:21:52.240
 I think that the pandemic tuned people's awareness

3:21:52.240 --> 3:21:57.000
 to the fact that some things are indeed easier on your own,

3:21:57.920 --> 3:21:59.680
 depends on finances, et cetera, et cetera.

3:21:59.680 --> 3:22:04.680
 But a lot of things are made better done with other people.

3:22:05.680 --> 3:22:10.560
 100%, but I also, so I was very deliberately,

3:22:10.560 --> 3:22:13.320
 it's an interesting way to put it,

3:22:13.320 --> 3:22:15.400
 but what do you want your day to look like?

3:22:15.400 --> 3:22:17.240
 I think what do you want your day to look like?

3:22:17.240 --> 3:22:18.680
 What do you want your life to be?

3:22:18.680 --> 3:22:23.000
 I was very deliberately always, first of all,

3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:27.280
 happy to be alone, like a conscious thinking.

3:22:27.280 --> 3:22:31.200
 I know a lot of friends were just unable to be alone.

3:22:31.200 --> 3:22:34.340
 I'm able to be alone, but I'm much happier

3:22:34.340 --> 3:22:35.760
 with another person.

3:22:35.760 --> 3:22:39.600
 Like I'm able to share joy with other humans.

3:22:39.600 --> 3:22:43.520
 I look forward to the day that our kids are rolling jiu jitsu

3:22:43.520 --> 3:22:47.120
 and my kids are hanging out with your kids.

3:22:47.120 --> 3:22:52.120
 And if that notion sounds even remotely interesting

3:22:53.440 --> 3:22:56.200
 and fun, then it's sort of like you kind of backpedal

3:22:56.200 --> 3:22:57.680
 from that and you go, well, it has to happen.

3:22:57.680 --> 3:23:00.760
 How do you get to reverse engineer

3:23:00.760 --> 3:23:03.920
 and think from first principles about love?

3:23:03.920 --> 3:23:06.960
 Andrew, thank you for being my friend.

3:23:06.960 --> 3:23:08.560
 Thank you for being an amazing human being

3:23:08.560 --> 3:23:11.640
 who's so inspiring to so many people for constantly.

3:23:11.640 --> 3:23:13.600
 I told this to Carl, like one of the things

3:23:13.600 --> 3:23:18.600
 that was really refreshing about you is that

3:23:21.800 --> 3:23:23.960
 when I tell you an idea and I tell you a thought,

3:23:23.960 --> 3:23:25.760
 when I tell you something,

3:23:25.760 --> 3:23:29.120
 you don't shut it down as a first step.

3:23:29.120 --> 3:23:31.320
 I was saying that that's common in the scientific community.

3:23:31.320 --> 3:23:32.960
 That's common in people around you.

3:23:32.960 --> 3:23:34.720
 You're seeing what's the goal there.

3:23:34.720 --> 3:23:37.000
 You get excited, get excited together.

3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:40.520
 And that's how you can really have a great friendship

3:23:40.520 --> 3:23:43.520
 and do great stuff together.

3:23:43.520 --> 3:23:45.320
 So I'm deeply grateful for that.

3:23:45.320 --> 3:23:50.200
 And just for connecting so many interesting people together.

3:23:50.200 --> 3:23:51.840
 You're doing an amazing job, man.

3:23:51.840 --> 3:23:53.720
 And thank you for existing.

3:23:53.720 --> 3:23:54.920
 Thank you for being you.

3:23:54.920 --> 3:23:56.280
 Thank you for talking today.

3:23:56.280 --> 3:23:59.960
 And next time I'll see you in the sauna and ice bath.

3:23:59.960 --> 3:24:01.200
 Well, I wanna say several things.

3:24:01.200 --> 3:24:03.040
 First of all, thank you for having me on again.

3:24:03.040 --> 3:24:04.520
 It's an honor and a pleasure.

3:24:04.520 --> 3:24:07.640
 And I don't say that formally, I really truly mean it.

3:24:07.640 --> 3:24:10.120
 I only, the Huberman Lab Podcast, as I always say,

3:24:10.120 --> 3:24:12.640
 only exists because you gave me the suggestion

3:24:12.640 --> 3:24:14.920
 and I'm so grateful that you did.

3:24:14.920 --> 3:24:15.960
 So thank you.

3:24:15.960 --> 3:24:19.440
 And for doing what you do, like you are brave

3:24:19.440 --> 3:24:20.760
 and you were first man in

3:24:20.760 --> 3:24:22.680
 and you're just continuing to do it.

3:24:22.680 --> 3:24:24.720
 As my postdoc advisor used to say,

3:24:24.720 --> 3:24:27.480
 whatever you're doing, just keep going.

3:24:27.480 --> 3:24:28.880
 And then in terms of our friendship,

3:24:28.880 --> 3:24:32.960
 I mean, I think you know, and if you don't,

3:24:32.960 --> 3:24:34.280
 I'm gonna just keep telling you anyway,

3:24:34.280 --> 3:24:37.240
 by texting in person, you're an amazing friend.

3:24:37.240 --> 3:24:40.560
 There's deep trust, there's immense respect

3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:42.920
 and I love you, brother.

3:24:42.920 --> 3:24:44.480
 I love you too, man.

3:24:44.480 --> 3:24:46.040
 We did it.

3:24:46.040 --> 3:24:47.440
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

3:24:47.440 --> 3:24:48.720
 with Andrew Huberman.

3:24:48.720 --> 3:24:50.000
 To support this podcast,

3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:52.560
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:54.400
 And now let me leave you with some words

3:24:54.400 --> 3:24:57.000
 from Ralph Waldo Emerson.

3:24:57.000 --> 3:24:59.600
 It is one of the blessings of old friends.

3:24:59.600 --> 3:25:02.440
 You can afford to be stupid with them.

3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:04.840
 I look forward to doing just that

3:25:04.840 --> 3:25:06.640
 in the many years to come

3:25:06.640 --> 3:25:09.680
 of friendship and fun conversations with Andrew.

3:25:09.680 --> 3:25:32.680
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
