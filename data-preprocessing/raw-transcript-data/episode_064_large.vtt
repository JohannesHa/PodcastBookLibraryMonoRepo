00:00.000 --> 00:03.060
 The following is a conversation with Grant Sanderson.

00:03.060 --> 00:06.620
 He's a math educator and creator of 3Blue1Brown,

00:06.620 --> 00:07.980
 a popular YouTube channel

00:07.980 --> 00:11.020
 that uses programmatically animated visualizations

00:11.020 --> 00:14.260
 to explain concepts in linear algebra, calculus,

00:14.260 --> 00:16.980
 and other fields of mathematics.

00:16.980 --> 00:19.820
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.100
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

00:22.100 --> 00:23.960
 give us five stars on Apple Podcast,

00:23.960 --> 00:26.340
 follow on Spotify, support on Patreon,

00:26.340 --> 00:28.340
 or simply connect with me on Twitter

00:28.340 --> 00:32.180
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

00:32.180 --> 00:34.020
 I recently started doing ads

00:34.020 --> 00:35.700
 at the end of the introduction.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.500
 I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode

00:38.500 --> 00:40.020
 and never any ads in the middle

00:40.020 --> 00:42.160
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.580
 I hope that works for you

00:43.580 --> 00:46.240
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

00:47.300 --> 00:49.660
 This show is presented by Cash App,

00:49.660 --> 00:52.020
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

00:52.020 --> 00:54.820
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,

00:54.820 --> 00:56.520
 but you can also use it to buy, sell,

00:56.520 --> 00:58.940
 and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.

00:58.940 --> 01:01.500
 Cash App also has an investing feature.

01:01.500 --> 01:04.540
 You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,

01:04.540 --> 01:06.780
 no matter what the stock price is.

01:06.780 --> 01:09.580
 Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,

01:09.580 --> 01:13.460
 a subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.

01:13.460 --> 01:15.460
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App

01:15.460 --> 01:18.580
 to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST,

01:18.580 --> 01:22.020
 best known for their FIRST Robotics and LEGO competitions.

01:22.020 --> 01:25.340
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students

01:25.340 --> 01:27.060
 in over 110 countries

01:27.060 --> 01:29.680
 and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,

01:29.680 --> 01:31.660
 which means the donated money is used

01:31.660 --> 01:34.020
 to maximum effectiveness.

01:34.020 --> 01:36.900
 When you get Cash App from the App Store at Google Play

01:36.900 --> 01:40.140
 and use code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10,

01:40.140 --> 01:42.820
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

01:42.820 --> 01:44.920
 which again is an organization

01:44.920 --> 01:47.640
 that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys

01:47.640 --> 01:51.400
 to dream of engineering a better world.

01:51.400 --> 01:56.220
 And now, here's my conversation with Grant Sanderson.

01:56.220 --> 01:59.100
 If there's intelligent life out there in the universe,

01:59.100 --> 02:02.300
 do you think their mathematics is different than ours?

02:03.260 --> 02:04.300
 Jumping right in.

02:04.300 --> 02:08.340
 I think it's probably very different.

02:08.340 --> 02:11.220
 There's an obvious sense the notation is different, right?

02:11.220 --> 02:14.500
 I think notation can guide what the math itself is.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.020
 I think it has everything to do with the form

02:17.020 --> 02:19.180
 of their existence, right?

02:19.180 --> 02:20.760
 Do you think they have basic arithmetic?

02:20.760 --> 02:21.600
 Sorry, I interrupted.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.220
 Yeah, so I think they count, right?

02:23.220 --> 02:24.580
 I think notions like one, two, three,

02:24.580 --> 02:27.200
 the natural numbers, that's extremely, well, natural.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.460
 That's almost why we put that name to it.

02:30.460 --> 02:31.760
 As soon as you can count,

02:31.760 --> 02:34.020
 you have a notion of repetition, right?

02:34.020 --> 02:37.340
 Because you can count by two, two times or three times.

02:37.340 --> 02:39.800
 And so you have this notion of repeating

02:39.800 --> 02:42.180
 the idea of counting, which brings you addition

02:42.180 --> 02:43.780
 and multiplication.

02:43.780 --> 02:47.540
 I think the way that we extend it to the real numbers,

02:47.540 --> 02:49.280
 there's a little bit of choice in that.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.820
 So there's this funny number system

02:50.820 --> 02:52.220
 called the servial numbers

02:52.220 --> 02:55.660
 that it captures the idea of continuity.

02:55.660 --> 02:57.580
 It's a distinct mathematical object.

02:57.580 --> 03:00.420
 You could very well model the universe

03:00.420 --> 03:02.020
 and motion of planets with that

03:02.020 --> 03:04.820
 as the back end of your math, right?

03:04.820 --> 03:06.500
 And you still have kind of the same interface

03:06.500 --> 03:10.620
 with the front end of what physical laws you're trying to,

03:10.620 --> 03:12.420
 or what physical phenomena you're trying

03:12.420 --> 03:13.780
 to describe with math.

03:13.780 --> 03:15.900
 And I wonder if the little glimpses that we have

03:15.900 --> 03:17.700
 of what choices you can make along the way

03:17.700 --> 03:19.320
 based on what different mathematicians

03:19.320 --> 03:20.440
 I've brought to the table

03:20.440 --> 03:22.300
 is just scratching the surface

03:22.300 --> 03:24.540
 of what the different possibilities are

03:24.540 --> 03:27.540
 if you have a completely different mode of thought, right?

03:27.540 --> 03:29.700
 Or a mode of interacting with the universe.

03:29.700 --> 03:32.540
 And you think notation is a key part of the journey

03:32.540 --> 03:33.860
 that we've taken through math.

03:33.860 --> 03:35.140
 I think that's the most salient part

03:35.140 --> 03:36.420
 that you'd notice at first.

03:36.420 --> 03:38.880
 I think the mode of thought is gonna influence things

03:38.880 --> 03:40.400
 more than like the notation itself.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.700
 But notation actually carries a lot of weight

03:42.700 --> 03:44.620
 when it comes to how we think about things,

03:44.620 --> 03:47.100
 more so than we usually give it credit for.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.900
 I would be comfortable saying.

03:48.900 --> 03:52.020
 Do you have a favorite or least favorite piece of notation

03:52.020 --> 03:53.260
 in terms of its effectiveness?

03:53.260 --> 03:54.860
 Yeah, yeah, well, so least favorite,

03:54.860 --> 03:56.140
 one that I've been thinking a lot about

03:56.140 --> 03:58.940
 that will be a video I don't know when, but we'll see.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.420
 The number e, we write the function e to the x,

04:02.420 --> 04:04.140
 this general exponential function

04:04.140 --> 04:06.260
 with a notation e to the x

04:06.260 --> 04:08.380
 that implies you should think about a particular number,

04:08.380 --> 04:09.380
 this constant of nature,

04:09.380 --> 04:11.740
 and you repeatedly multiply it by itself.

04:11.740 --> 04:14.100
 And then you say, oh, what's e to the square root of two?

04:14.100 --> 04:15.700
 And you're like, oh, well, we've extended the idea

04:15.700 --> 04:17.020
 of repeated multiplication.

04:17.020 --> 04:19.460
 That's all nice, that's all nice and well.

04:19.460 --> 04:22.660
 But very famously, you have like e to the pi i,

04:22.660 --> 04:24.420
 and you're like, well, we're extending the idea

04:24.420 --> 04:27.060
 of repeated multiplication into the complex numbers.

04:27.060 --> 04:28.780
 Yeah, you can think about it that way.

04:28.780 --> 04:31.820
 In reality, I think that it's just the wrong way

04:31.820 --> 04:34.740
 of notationally representing this function,

04:34.740 --> 04:36.180
 the exponential function,

04:36.180 --> 04:37.820
 which itself could be represented

04:37.820 --> 04:38.780
 a number of different ways.

04:38.780 --> 04:41.300
 You can think about it in terms of the problem it solves,

04:41.300 --> 04:43.260
 a certain very simple differential equation,

04:43.260 --> 04:45.620
 which often yields way more insight

04:45.620 --> 04:48.820
 than trying to twist the idea of repeated multiplication,

04:48.820 --> 04:50.740
 like take its arm and put it behind its back

04:50.740 --> 04:51.940
 and throw it on the desk and be like,

04:51.940 --> 04:53.620
 you will apply to complex numbers, right?

04:53.620 --> 04:56.420
 That's not, I don't think that's pedagogically helpful.

04:57.420 --> 04:59.740
 So the repeated multiplication is actually missing

04:59.740 --> 05:03.020
 the main point, the power of e to the x.

05:03.020 --> 05:05.900
 I mean, what it addresses is things where the rate

05:05.900 --> 05:10.140
 at which something changes depends on its own value,

05:10.140 --> 05:12.500
 but more specifically, it depends on it linearly.

05:12.500 --> 05:15.100
 So for example, if you have like a population

05:15.100 --> 05:16.660
 that's growing and the rate at which it grows

05:16.660 --> 05:18.420
 depends on how many members of the population

05:18.420 --> 05:19.260
 are already there,

05:19.260 --> 05:21.300
 it looks like this nice exponential curve.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.300
 It makes sense to talk about repeated multiplication

05:23.300 --> 05:25.140
 because you say, how much is there after one year,

05:25.140 --> 05:27.420
 two years, three years, you're multiplying by something.

05:27.420 --> 05:29.460
 The relationship can be a little bit different sometimes

05:29.460 --> 05:33.940
 where let's say you've got a ball on a string,

05:33.940 --> 05:37.540
 like a game of tetherball going around a rope, right?

05:37.540 --> 05:40.780
 And you say, its velocity is always perpendicular

05:40.780 --> 05:42.220
 to its position.

05:42.220 --> 05:44.140
 That's another way of describing its rate of change

05:44.140 --> 05:47.100
 is being related to where it is,

05:47.100 --> 05:48.220
 but it's a different operation.

05:48.220 --> 05:49.740
 You're not scaling it, it's a rotation.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.420
 It's this 90 degree rotation.

05:51.420 --> 05:54.580
 That's what the whole idea of like complex exponentiation

05:54.580 --> 05:55.740
 is trying to capture,

05:55.740 --> 05:57.660
 but it's obfuscated in the notation

05:57.660 --> 05:59.060
 when what it's actually saying,

05:59.060 --> 06:01.460
 like if you really parse something like e to the pi i,

06:01.460 --> 06:03.900
 what it's saying is choose an origin,

06:03.900 --> 06:06.500
 always move perpendicular to the vector

06:06.500 --> 06:08.340
 from that origin to you, okay?

06:09.380 --> 06:12.460
 Then when you walk pi times that radius,

06:12.460 --> 06:14.180
 you'll be halfway around.

06:14.180 --> 06:15.860
 Like that's what it's saying.

06:15.860 --> 06:18.620
 It's kind of the, you turn 90 degrees and you walk,

06:18.620 --> 06:19.940
 you'll be going in a circle.

06:19.940 --> 06:22.460
 That's the phenomenon that it's describing,

06:22.460 --> 06:24.380
 but trying to twist the idea

06:24.380 --> 06:26.820
 of repeatedly multiplying a constant into that.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.740
 Like I can't even think of the number of human hours

06:30.740 --> 06:33.420
 of like intelligent human hours that have been wasted

06:33.420 --> 06:36.820
 trying to parse that to their own liking and desire

06:36.820 --> 06:39.500
 among like scientists or electrical engineers

06:39.500 --> 06:40.660
 or students everywhere,

06:40.660 --> 06:42.740
 which if the notation were a little different

06:42.740 --> 06:45.620
 or the way that this whole function was introduced

06:45.620 --> 06:47.620
 from the get go were framed differently,

06:47.620 --> 06:49.980
 I think could have been avoided, right?

06:49.980 --> 06:51.020
 And you're talking about

06:51.020 --> 06:53.420
 the most beautiful equation in mathematics,

06:53.420 --> 06:55.100
 but it's still pretty mysterious, isn't it?

06:55.100 --> 06:58.660
 Like you're making it seem like it's a notational.

06:58.660 --> 06:59.740
 It's not mysterious.

06:59.740 --> 07:01.940
 I think the notation makes it mysterious.

07:01.940 --> 07:04.620
 I don't think it's, I think the fact that it represents,

07:04.620 --> 07:06.340
 it's pretty, it's not like the most beautiful thing

07:06.340 --> 07:07.940
 in the world, but it's quite pretty.

07:07.940 --> 07:10.620
 The idea that if you take the linear operation

07:10.620 --> 07:12.500
 of a 90 degree rotation,

07:12.500 --> 07:15.700
 and then you do this general exponentiation thing to it,

07:15.700 --> 07:18.460
 that what you get are all the other kinds of rotation,

07:19.460 --> 07:20.420
 which is basically to say,

07:20.420 --> 07:22.820
 if your velocity vector is perpendicular

07:22.820 --> 07:25.380
 to your position vector, you walk in a circle,

07:25.380 --> 07:26.340
 that's pretty.

07:26.340 --> 07:27.780
 It's not the most beautiful thing in the world,

07:27.780 --> 07:28.740
 but it's quite pretty.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.220
 The beauty of it, I think comes from perhaps

07:31.220 --> 07:33.060
 the awkwardness of the notation

07:33.060 --> 07:35.460
 somehow still nevertheless coming together nicely,

07:35.460 --> 07:38.780
 because you have like several disciplines coming together

07:38.780 --> 07:40.180
 in a single equation.

07:40.180 --> 07:41.020
 Well, I think.

07:41.020 --> 07:43.500
 In a sense, like historically speaking.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.340
 That's true.

07:44.340 --> 07:45.980
 You've got, so like the number E is significant.

07:45.980 --> 07:47.860
 Like it shows up in probability all the time.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.380
 It like shows up in calculus all the time.

07:49.380 --> 07:50.380
 It is significant.

07:50.380 --> 07:52.300
 You're seeing it sort of mated with pi,

07:52.300 --> 07:54.060
 this geometric constant and I,

07:54.060 --> 07:55.820
 like the imaginary number and such.

07:55.820 --> 07:57.660
 I think what's really happening there

07:57.660 --> 08:01.140
 is the way that E shows up is when you have things

08:01.140 --> 08:03.180
 like exponential growth and decay, right?

08:03.180 --> 08:06.100
 It's when this relation that something's rate of change

08:06.100 --> 08:10.500
 has to itself is a simple scaling, right?

08:10.500 --> 08:14.100
 A similar law also describes circular motion.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.340
 Because we have bad notation,

08:16.340 --> 08:19.100
 we use the residue of how it shows up

08:19.100 --> 08:21.060
 in the context of self reinforcing growth,

08:21.060 --> 08:23.660
 like a population growing or compound interest.

08:23.660 --> 08:25.300
 The constant associated with that

08:25.300 --> 08:27.660
 is awkwardly placed into the context

08:27.660 --> 08:29.740
 of how rotation comes about,

08:29.740 --> 08:32.300
 because they both come from pretty similar equations.

08:32.300 --> 08:36.220
 And so what we see is the E and the pi juxtaposed

08:36.220 --> 08:38.340
 a little bit closer than they would be

08:38.340 --> 08:41.020
 with a purely natural representation, I would think.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.380
 Here's how I would describe the relation between the two.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.820
 You've got a very important function we might call exp.

08:45.820 --> 08:47.780
 That's like the exponential function.

08:47.780 --> 08:49.340
 When you plug in one,

08:49.340 --> 08:50.980
 you get this nice constant called E

08:50.980 --> 08:53.340
 that shows up in like probability and calculus.

08:53.340 --> 08:55.340
 If you try to move in the imaginary direction,

08:55.340 --> 08:58.420
 it's periodic and the period is tau.

08:58.420 --> 08:59.620
 So those are these two constants

08:59.620 --> 09:02.180
 associated with the same central function,

09:02.180 --> 09:04.780
 but for kind of unrelated reasons, right?

09:04.780 --> 09:07.380
 And not unrelated, but like orthogonal reasons.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.340
 One of them is what happens

09:08.340 --> 09:09.700
 when you're moving in the real direction.

09:09.700 --> 09:12.580
 One's what happens when you move in the imaginary direction.

09:12.580 --> 09:14.180
 And like, yeah, those are related.

09:14.180 --> 09:17.180
 They're not as related as the famous equation

09:17.180 --> 09:18.540
 seems to think it is.

09:18.540 --> 09:20.540
 It's sort of putting all of the children in one bed

09:20.540 --> 09:22.500
 and they'd kind of like to sleep in separate beds

09:22.500 --> 09:24.580
 if they had the choice, but you see them all there

09:24.580 --> 09:28.380
 and there is a family resemblance, but it's not that close.

09:28.380 --> 09:31.740
 So actually thinking of it as a function

09:31.740 --> 09:34.740
 is the better idea.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.340
 And that's a notational idea.

09:36.340 --> 09:38.420
 And yeah, and like, here's the thing.

09:39.340 --> 09:41.220
 The constant E sort of stands

09:41.220 --> 09:44.700
 as this numerical representative of calculus, right?

09:44.700 --> 09:47.580
 Calculus is the like study of change.

09:47.580 --> 09:49.860
 So at the very least there's a little cognitive dissonance

09:49.860 --> 09:53.260
 using a constant to represent the science of change.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.140
 I never thought of it that way.

09:54.140 --> 09:54.980
 Yeah.

09:54.980 --> 09:55.820
 Right?

09:55.820 --> 09:56.660
 Yeah.

09:56.660 --> 10:00.180
 It makes sense why the notation came about that way.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.100
 Because this is the first way that we saw it

10:02.100 --> 10:03.860
 in the context of things like population growth

10:03.860 --> 10:04.780
 or compound interest.

10:04.780 --> 10:07.060
 It is nicer to think about as repeated multiplication.

10:07.060 --> 10:08.700
 That's definitely nicer.

10:08.700 --> 10:11.020
 But it's more that that's the first application

10:11.020 --> 10:13.900
 of what turned out to be a much more general function

10:13.900 --> 10:15.220
 that maybe the intelligent life

10:15.220 --> 10:17.180
 your initial question asked about

10:17.180 --> 10:19.780
 would have come to recognize as being much more significant

10:19.780 --> 10:21.140
 than the single use case,

10:21.140 --> 10:24.300
 which lends itself to repeated multiplication notation.

10:24.300 --> 10:28.500
 But let me jump back for a second to aliens

10:28.500 --> 10:30.060
 and the nature of our universe.

10:30.060 --> 10:30.900
 Okay.

10:31.940 --> 10:35.100
 Do you think math is discovered or invented?

10:35.100 --> 10:37.620
 So we're talking about the different kind of mathematics

10:37.620 --> 10:40.620
 that could be developed by the alien species.

10:40.620 --> 10:42.380
 The implied question is,

10:44.300 --> 10:46.220
 yeah, is math discovered or invented?

10:46.220 --> 10:49.660
 Is fundamentally everybody going to discover

10:49.660 --> 10:53.140
 the same principles of mathematics?

10:53.140 --> 10:54.140
 So the way I think about it,

10:54.140 --> 10:55.380
 and everyone thinks about it differently,

10:55.380 --> 10:56.420
 but here's my take.

10:56.420 --> 10:57.940
 I think there's a cycle at play

10:57.940 --> 11:00.980
 where you discover things about the universe

11:00.980 --> 11:03.980
 that tell you what math will be useful.

11:03.980 --> 11:08.060
 And that math itself is invented in a sense,

11:08.060 --> 11:11.420
 but of all the possible maths that you could have invented,

11:11.420 --> 11:12.740
 it's discoveries about the world

11:12.740 --> 11:14.220
 that tell you which ones are.

11:14.220 --> 11:17.780
 So like a good example here is the Pythagorean theorem.

11:17.780 --> 11:18.620
 When you look at this,

11:18.620 --> 11:19.780
 do you think of that as a definition

11:19.780 --> 11:21.940
 or do you think of that as a discovery?

11:21.940 --> 11:24.300
 From the historical perspective, right, it's a discovery

11:24.300 --> 11:25.140
 because they were,

11:25.140 --> 11:29.620
 but that's probably because they were using physical object

11:29.620 --> 11:31.140
 to build their intuition.

11:32.260 --> 11:34.500
 And from that intuition came the mathematics.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.340
 So the mathematics wasn't in some abstract world

11:37.340 --> 11:39.060
 detached from physics,

11:39.060 --> 11:43.700
 but I think more and more math has become detached from,

11:43.700 --> 11:46.140
 you know, when you even look at modern physics

11:46.140 --> 11:49.580
 from string theory to even general relativity,

11:49.580 --> 11:53.580
 I mean, all math behind the 20th and 21st century physics

11:53.580 --> 11:58.460
 kind of takes a brisk walk outside of what our mind

11:58.460 --> 12:00.500
 can actually even comprehend

12:00.500 --> 12:02.380
 in multiple dimensions, for example,

12:02.380 --> 12:05.940
 anything beyond three dimensions, maybe four dimensions.

12:05.940 --> 12:07.300
 No, no, no, no, higher dimensions

12:07.300 --> 12:08.780
 can be highly, highly applicable.

12:08.780 --> 12:11.260
 I think this is a common misinterpretation

12:11.260 --> 12:13.380
 that if you're asking questions

12:13.380 --> 12:15.260
 about like a five dimensional manifold,

12:15.260 --> 12:16.740
 that the only way that that's connected

12:16.740 --> 12:20.220
 to the physical world is if the physical world is itself

12:20.220 --> 12:22.980
 a five dimensional manifold or includes them.

12:22.980 --> 12:25.260
 Well, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.220
 You're telling me you can imagine

12:28.940 --> 12:31.260
 a five dimensional manifold?

12:31.260 --> 12:33.380
 No, no, that's not what I said.

12:33.380 --> 12:35.020
 I would make the claim that it is useful

12:35.020 --> 12:37.260
 to a three dimensional physical universe,

12:37.260 --> 12:39.460
 despite itself not being three dimensional.

12:39.460 --> 12:41.220
 So it's useful meaning to even understand

12:41.220 --> 12:42.740
 a three dimensional world,

12:42.740 --> 12:44.940
 it'd be useful to have five dimensional manifolds.

12:44.940 --> 12:47.180
 Yes, absolutely, because of state spaces.

12:47.180 --> 12:50.540
 But you're saying there in some deep way for us humans,

12:50.540 --> 12:54.060
 it does always come back to that three dimensional world

12:54.060 --> 12:56.620
 for the usefulness that the dimensional world

12:56.620 --> 12:59.980
 and therefore it starts with a discovery,

12:59.980 --> 13:02.060
 but then we invent the mathematics

13:02.060 --> 13:06.260
 that helps us make sense of the discovery in a sense.

13:06.260 --> 13:07.900
 Yes, I mean, just to jump off

13:07.900 --> 13:09.820
 of the Pythagorean theorem example,

13:09.820 --> 13:11.220
 it feels like a discovery.

13:11.220 --> 13:12.900
 You've got these beautiful geometric proofs

13:12.900 --> 13:14.620
 where you've got squares and you're modifying the areas,

13:14.620 --> 13:16.740
 it feels like a discovery.

13:16.740 --> 13:19.620
 If you look at how we formalize the idea of 2D space

13:19.620 --> 13:23.100
 as being R2, right, all pairs of real numbers,

13:23.100 --> 13:25.740
 and how we define a metric on it and define distance,

13:25.740 --> 13:26.700
 you're like, hang on a second,

13:26.700 --> 13:28.100
 we've defined a distance

13:28.100 --> 13:30.100
 so that the Pythagorean theorem is true,

13:30.100 --> 13:32.460
 so that suddenly it doesn't feel that great.

13:32.460 --> 13:35.420
 But I think what's going on is the thing that informed us

13:35.420 --> 13:38.020
 what metric to put on R2,

13:38.020 --> 13:41.380
 to put on our abstract representation of 2D space,

13:41.380 --> 13:43.300
 came from physical observations.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.660
 And the thing is, there's other metrics

13:44.660 --> 13:45.500
 you could have put on it.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.180
 We could have consistent math

13:47.180 --> 13:49.140
 with other notions of distance,

13:49.140 --> 13:50.860
 it's just that those pieces of math

13:50.860 --> 13:53.660
 wouldn't be applicable to the physical world that we study

13:53.660 --> 13:54.580
 because they're not the ones

13:54.580 --> 13:56.180
 where the Pythagorean theorem holds.

13:56.180 --> 13:59.060
 So we have a discovery, a genuine bonafide discovery

13:59.060 --> 14:00.500
 that informed the invention,

14:00.500 --> 14:03.700
 the invention of an abstract representation of 2D space

14:03.700 --> 14:06.220
 that we call R2 and things like that.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.300
 And then from there,

14:07.300 --> 14:09.740
 you just study R2 as an abstract thing

14:09.740 --> 14:12.500
 that brings about more ideas and inventions and mysteries

14:12.500 --> 14:14.420
 which themselves might yield discoveries.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.980
 Those discoveries might give you insight

14:16.980 --> 14:19.380
 as to what else would be useful to invent

14:19.380 --> 14:20.980
 and it kind of feeds on itself that way.

14:20.980 --> 14:22.180
 That's how I think about it.

14:22.180 --> 14:24.140
 So it's not an either or.

14:24.140 --> 14:25.380
 It's not that math is one of these

14:25.380 --> 14:26.780
 or it's one of the others.

14:26.780 --> 14:29.180
 At different times, it's playing a different role.

14:29.180 --> 14:34.180
 So then let me ask the Richard Feynman question then,

14:34.460 --> 14:36.220
 along that thread,

14:36.220 --> 14:37.380
 is what do you think is the difference

14:37.380 --> 14:40.300
 between physics and math?

14:40.300 --> 14:43.060
 There's a giant overlap.

14:43.060 --> 14:45.940
 There's a kind of intuition that physicists have

14:45.940 --> 14:49.020
 about the world that's perhaps outside of mathematics.

14:49.020 --> 14:52.700
 It's this mysterious art that they seem to possess,

14:52.700 --> 14:54.220
 we humans generally possess.

14:54.220 --> 14:58.060
 And then there's the beautiful rigor of mathematics

14:58.060 --> 15:01.820
 that allows you to, I mean, just like as we were saying,

15:02.860 --> 15:07.860
 invent frameworks of understanding our physical world.

15:07.860 --> 15:10.180
 So what do you think is the difference there

15:10.180 --> 15:11.340
 and how big is it?

15:11.340 --> 15:12.980
 Well, I think of math as being the study

15:12.980 --> 15:16.860
 of abstractions over patterns and pure patterns in logic.

15:16.860 --> 15:19.300
 And then physics is obviously grounded in a desire

15:19.300 --> 15:22.180
 to understand the world that we live in.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.540
 I think you're gonna get very different answers

15:23.540 --> 15:25.060
 when you talk to different mathematicians

15:25.060 --> 15:27.620
 because there's a wide diversity in types of mathematicians.

15:27.620 --> 15:30.980
 There are some who are motivated very much by pure puzzles.

15:30.980 --> 15:33.540
 They might be turned on by things like combinatorics.

15:33.540 --> 15:35.860
 And they just love the idea of building up

15:35.860 --> 15:40.420
 a set of problem solving tools applying to pure patterns.

15:40.420 --> 15:42.820
 There are some who are very physically motivated,

15:42.820 --> 15:47.820
 who try to invent new math or discover math in veins

15:48.180 --> 15:50.500
 that they know will have applications to physics

15:50.500 --> 15:51.860
 or sometimes computer science.

15:51.860 --> 15:53.340
 And that's what drives them.

15:53.340 --> 15:55.100
 Like chaos theory is a good example of something

15:55.100 --> 15:57.180
 that's pure math, that's purely mathematical.

15:57.180 --> 15:58.700
 A lot of the statements being made,

15:58.700 --> 16:02.420
 but it's heavily motivated by specific applications

16:02.420 --> 16:04.860
 to largely physics.

16:04.860 --> 16:06.660
 And then you have a type of mathematician

16:06.660 --> 16:08.500
 who just loves abstraction.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.500
 They just love pulling it to the more and more abstract

16:10.500 --> 16:12.100
 things, the things that feel powerful.

16:12.100 --> 16:15.220
 These are the ones that initially invented like topology

16:15.220 --> 16:17.500
 and then later on get really into category theory

16:17.500 --> 16:20.380
 and go on about like infinite categories and whatnot.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.460
 These are the ones that love to have a system

16:23.460 --> 16:27.140
 that can describe truths about as many things as possible.

16:28.700 --> 16:31.300
 People from those three different veins of motivation

16:31.300 --> 16:32.860
 into math are gonna give you very different answers

16:32.860 --> 16:34.740
 about what the relation at play here is.

16:34.740 --> 16:37.660
 Cause someone like Vladimir Arnold,

16:37.660 --> 16:40.540
 who has written a lot of great books,

16:40.540 --> 16:42.500
 many about like differential equations and such,

16:42.500 --> 16:45.700
 he would say, math is a branch of physics.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.180
 That's how he would think about it.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.220
 And of course he was studying

16:48.220 --> 16:49.780
 like differential equations related things

16:49.780 --> 16:52.260
 because that is the motivator behind the study

16:52.260 --> 16:53.820
 of PDEs and things like that.

16:54.820 --> 16:56.500
 But you'll have others who,

16:56.500 --> 16:58.260
 like especially the category theorists

16:58.260 --> 17:01.380
 who aren't really thinking about physics necessarily.

17:01.380 --> 17:04.540
 It's all about abstraction and the power of generality.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.460
 And it's more of a happy coincidence

17:06.460 --> 17:08.340
 that that ends up being useful

17:08.340 --> 17:10.900
 for understanding the world we live in.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.860
 And then you can get into like, why is that the case?

17:12.860 --> 17:14.140
 It's sort of surprising

17:14.140 --> 17:17.820
 that that which is about pure puzzles and abstraction

17:17.820 --> 17:21.060
 also happens to describe the very fundamentals

17:21.060 --> 17:23.140
 of quarks and everything else.

17:24.180 --> 17:27.900
 So why do you think the fundamentals of quarks

17:28.820 --> 17:33.260
 and the nature of reality is so compressible

17:33.260 --> 17:35.380
 into clean, beautiful equations

17:35.380 --> 17:39.300
 that are for the most part simple, relatively speaking,

17:39.300 --> 17:41.740
 a lot simpler than they could be?

17:41.740 --> 17:45.380
 So you have, we mentioned somebody like Stephen Wolfram

17:45.380 --> 17:50.380
 who thinks that sort of there's incredibly simple rules

17:50.540 --> 17:51.940
 underlying our reality,

17:51.940 --> 17:54.940
 but it can create arbitrary complexity.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.780
 But there is simple equations.

17:56.780 --> 17:59.220
 What, I'm asking a million questions

17:59.220 --> 18:01.060
 that nobody knows the answer to, but.

18:01.060 --> 18:04.300
 I have no idea, why is it simple?

18:05.300 --> 18:07.100
 It could be the case that

18:07.100 --> 18:08.500
 there's like a filter iteration at play.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.660
 The only things that physicists find interesting

18:10.660 --> 18:11.700
 are the ones that are simple enough

18:11.700 --> 18:13.340
 they could describe it mathematically.

18:13.340 --> 18:15.180
 But as soon as it's a sufficiently complex system,

18:15.180 --> 18:16.940
 like, oh, that's outside the realm of physics,

18:16.940 --> 18:19.340
 that's biology or whatever have you.

18:19.340 --> 18:21.660
 And of course, that's true.

18:21.660 --> 18:22.740
 Maybe there's something where it's like,

18:22.740 --> 18:26.540
 of course there will always be something that is simple

18:26.540 --> 18:31.420
 when you wash away the like non important parts

18:31.420 --> 18:33.420
 of whatever it is that you're studying.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.180
 Just from like an information theory standpoint,

18:35.180 --> 18:36.660
 there might be some like,

18:36.660 --> 18:39.460
 you get to the lowest information component of it.

18:39.460 --> 18:40.900
 But I don't know, maybe I'm just having

18:40.900 --> 18:43.020
 a really hard time conceiving of what it would even mean

18:43.020 --> 18:46.580
 for the fundamental laws to be like intrinsically

18:46.580 --> 18:50.660
 complicated, like some set of equations

18:50.660 --> 18:52.580
 that you can't decouple from each other.

18:52.580 --> 18:56.820
 Well, no, it could be that sort of we take for granted

18:56.820 --> 18:59.980
 that the laws of physics, for example,

18:59.980 --> 19:03.500
 are for the most part the same everywhere

19:03.500 --> 19:05.340
 or something like that, right?

19:05.340 --> 19:10.340
 As opposed to the sort of an alternative could be

19:10.620 --> 19:15.420
 that the rules under which the world operates

19:15.420 --> 19:17.260
 is different everywhere.

19:17.260 --> 19:20.340
 It's like a deeply distributed system

19:20.340 --> 19:23.380
 where just everything is just chaos,

19:23.380 --> 19:25.540
 not in a strict definition of chaos,

19:25.540 --> 19:30.420
 but meaning like just it's impossible for equations

19:30.420 --> 19:34.020
 to capture, for to explicitly model the world

19:34.020 --> 19:36.020
 as cleanly as the physical does.

19:36.020 --> 19:39.100
 I mean, we almost take it for granted that we can describe,

19:39.100 --> 19:41.260
 we can have an equation for gravity,

19:41.260 --> 19:42.780
 for action at a distance.

19:42.780 --> 19:45.500
 We can have equations for some of these basic ways

19:45.500 --> 19:46.580
 the planet's moving.

19:46.580 --> 19:51.580
 Just the low level at the atomic scale,

19:52.060 --> 19:53.980
 how the materials operate,

19:53.980 --> 19:56.940
 at the high scale, how black holes operate.

19:56.940 --> 19:59.820
 But it doesn't, it seems like it could be,

19:59.820 --> 20:01.700
 there's infinite other possibilities

20:01.700 --> 20:05.020
 where none of it could be compressible into such equations.

20:05.020 --> 20:06.540
 So it just seems beautiful.

20:06.540 --> 20:10.900
 It's also weird, probably to the point you're making,

20:10.900 --> 20:15.140
 that it's very pleasant that this is true for our minds.

20:15.140 --> 20:17.140
 So it might be that our minds are biased

20:17.140 --> 20:19.660
 to just be looking at the parts of the universe

20:19.660 --> 20:21.740
 that are compressible.

20:21.740 --> 20:23.740
 And then we can publish papers on

20:23.740 --> 20:26.460
 and have nice E equals empty squared equations.

20:26.460 --> 20:29.260
 Right, well, I wonder would such a world

20:29.260 --> 20:33.580
 with uncompressible laws allow for the kind of beings

20:33.580 --> 20:35.940
 that can think about the kind of questions

20:35.940 --> 20:36.860
 that you're asking?

20:37.780 --> 20:38.620
 That's true.

20:38.620 --> 20:40.620
 Right, like an anthropic principle coming into play

20:40.620 --> 20:42.580
 in some weird way here?

20:42.580 --> 20:44.780
 I don't know, like I don't know what I'm talking about at all.

20:44.780 --> 20:47.980
 Maybe the universe is actually not so compressible,

20:47.980 --> 20:52.540
 but the way our brain, the way our brain evolved

20:52.540 --> 20:55.860
 we're only able to perceive the compressible parts.

20:55.860 --> 20:58.380
 I mean, we are, so this is the sort of Chomsky argument.

20:58.380 --> 20:59.860
 We are just descendants of apes

20:59.860 --> 21:03.580
 over like really limited biological systems.

21:03.580 --> 21:04.660
 So it totally makes sense

21:04.660 --> 21:08.580
 that we're really limited little computers, calculators,

21:08.580 --> 21:10.220
 that are able to perceive certain kinds of things

21:10.220 --> 21:13.100
 and the actual world is much more complicated.

21:13.100 --> 21:16.620
 Well, but we can do pretty awesome things, right?

21:16.620 --> 21:18.260
 Like we can fly spaceships

21:18.260 --> 21:21.540
 and we have to have some connection of reality

21:21.540 --> 21:25.260
 to be able to take our potentially oversimplified models

21:25.260 --> 21:27.740
 of the world, but then actually twist the world

21:27.740 --> 21:29.060
 to our will based on it.

21:29.060 --> 21:30.380
 So we have certain reality checks

21:30.380 --> 21:33.380
 that like physics isn't too far a field

21:33.380 --> 21:35.420
 simply based on what we can do.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.260
 Yeah, the fact that we can fly is pretty good.

21:37.260 --> 21:40.500
 It's great, yeah, like it's a proof of concept

21:40.500 --> 21:44.900
 that the laws we're working with are working well.

21:44.900 --> 21:47.740
 So I mentioned to the internet that I'm talking to you

21:47.740 --> 21:50.180
 and so the internet gave some questions.

21:50.180 --> 21:51.580
 So I apologize for these,

21:51.580 --> 21:54.540
 but do you think we're living in a simulation

21:54.540 --> 21:56.940
 that the universe is a computer

21:56.940 --> 22:00.020
 or the universe is a computation running on a computer?

22:01.260 --> 22:02.700
 It's conceivable.

22:02.700 --> 22:05.700
 What I don't buy is, you know, you'll have the argument

22:05.700 --> 22:07.900
 that, well, let's say that it was the case

22:07.900 --> 22:09.540
 that you can have simulations.

22:09.540 --> 22:12.580
 Then the simulated world would itself

22:12.580 --> 22:15.380
 eventually get to a point where it's running simulations.

22:15.380 --> 22:17.220
 And then the second layer down

22:17.220 --> 22:19.420
 would create a third layer down and on and on and on.

22:19.420 --> 22:21.620
 So probabilistically, you just throw a dart

22:21.620 --> 22:22.460
 at one of those layers,

22:22.460 --> 22:24.940
 we're probably in one of the simulated layers.

22:24.940 --> 22:27.060
 I think if there's some sort of limitations

22:27.060 --> 22:28.580
 on like the information processing

22:28.580 --> 22:31.420
 of whatever the physical world is,

22:31.420 --> 22:32.700
 like it quickly becomes the case

22:32.700 --> 22:35.620
 that you have a limit to the layers that could exist there

22:35.620 --> 22:38.100
 because like the resources necessary

22:38.100 --> 22:41.660
 to simulate a universe like ours clearly is a lot

22:41.660 --> 22:43.700
 just in terms of the number of bits at play.

22:43.700 --> 22:46.820
 And so then you can ask, well, what's more plausible?

22:46.820 --> 22:49.140
 That there's an unbounded capacity

22:49.140 --> 22:50.340
 of information processing

22:50.340 --> 22:53.620
 in whatever the like highest up level universe is,

22:53.620 --> 22:56.060
 or that there's some bound to that capacity,

22:56.060 --> 22:58.860
 which then limits like the number of levels available.

22:58.860 --> 23:00.820
 How do you play some kind of probability distribution

23:00.820 --> 23:02.580
 on like what the information capacity is?

23:02.580 --> 23:03.740
 I have no idea.

23:03.740 --> 23:06.860
 But I don't, like people almost assume

23:06.860 --> 23:08.340
 a certain uniform probability

23:08.340 --> 23:11.900
 over all of those meta layers that could conceivably exist

23:11.900 --> 23:15.180
 when it's a little bit like a Pascal's wager

23:15.180 --> 23:16.980
 on like you're not giving a low enough prior

23:16.980 --> 23:20.900
 to the mere existence of that infinite set of layers.

23:20.900 --> 23:21.740
 Yeah, that's true.

23:21.740 --> 23:25.060
 But it's also very difficult to contextualize the amount.

23:25.060 --> 23:28.260
 So the amount of information processing power

23:28.260 --> 23:31.380
 required to simulate like our universe

23:31.380 --> 23:34.260
 seems like amazingly huge.

23:34.260 --> 23:36.940
 But you can always raise two to the power of that.

23:36.940 --> 23:40.460
 Yeah, like numbers get big.

23:40.460 --> 23:41.780
 And we're easily humbled

23:41.780 --> 23:43.700
 by basically everything around us.

23:43.700 --> 23:48.700
 So it's very difficult to kind of make sense of anything

23:49.300 --> 23:50.980
 actually when you look up at the sky

23:50.980 --> 23:53.500
 and look at the stars and the immensity of it all,

23:53.500 --> 23:57.020
 to make sense of the smallness of us,

23:57.020 --> 23:58.780
 the unlikeliness of everything

23:58.780 --> 24:02.180
 that's on this earth coming to be,

24:02.180 --> 24:04.940
 then you could basically anything could be,

24:04.940 --> 24:09.100
 all laws of probability go out the window to me

24:09.100 --> 24:14.100
 because I guess because the amount of information

24:14.140 --> 24:17.540
 under which we're operating is very low.

24:17.540 --> 24:22.100
 We basically know nothing about the world around us,

24:22.100 --> 24:23.380
 relatively speaking.

24:23.380 --> 24:26.580
 And so when I think about the simulation hypothesis,

24:26.580 --> 24:29.220
 I think it's just fun to think about it.

24:29.220 --> 24:31.860
 But it's also, I think there is a thought experiment

24:31.860 --> 24:35.220
 kind of interesting to think of the power of computation,

24:35.220 --> 24:38.940
 whether the limits of a Turing machine,

24:38.940 --> 24:41.020
 sort of the limits of our current computers,

24:41.020 --> 24:44.060
 when you start to think about artificial intelligence,

24:44.060 --> 24:45.960
 how far can we get with computers?

24:46.820 --> 24:50.820
 And that's kind of where the simulation hypothesis

24:50.820 --> 24:52.820
 used with me as a thought experiment

24:52.820 --> 24:55.120
 is the universe just a computer?

24:56.660 --> 24:58.620
 Is it just a computation?

24:58.620 --> 25:00.500
 Is all of this just a computation?

25:00.500 --> 25:02.340
 And sort of the same kind of tools we apply

25:02.340 --> 25:05.100
 to analyzing algorithms, can that be applied?

25:05.100 --> 25:07.340
 If we scale further and further and further,

25:07.340 --> 25:09.620
 will the arbitrary power of those systems

25:09.620 --> 25:12.020
 start to create some interesting aspects

25:12.020 --> 25:13.880
 that we see in our universe?

25:13.880 --> 25:15.980
 Or is something fundamentally different

25:15.980 --> 25:17.500
 needs to be created?

25:17.500 --> 25:20.380
 Well, it's interesting that in our universe,

25:20.380 --> 25:22.700
 it's not arbitrarily large, the power,

25:22.700 --> 25:24.340
 that you can place limits on, for example,

25:24.340 --> 25:27.300
 how many bits of information can be stored per unit area.

25:27.300 --> 25:30.360
 Right, like all of the physical laws,

25:30.360 --> 25:32.680
 you've got general relativity and quantum coming together

25:32.680 --> 25:36.600
 to give you a certain limit on how many bits you can store

25:36.600 --> 25:40.440
 within a given range before it collapses into a black hole.

25:40.440 --> 25:42.760
 The idea that there even exists such a limit

25:42.760 --> 25:44.600
 is at the very least thought provoking,

25:44.600 --> 25:46.960
 when naively you might assume,

25:46.960 --> 25:49.240
 oh, well, technology could always get better and better,

25:49.240 --> 25:50.920
 we could get cleverer and cleverer,

25:50.920 --> 25:54.140
 and you could just cram as much information as you want

25:54.140 --> 25:59.140
 into like a small unit of space, that makes me think,

26:01.040 --> 26:06.040
 it's at least plausible that whatever the highest level

26:06.080 --> 26:10.440
 of existence is doesn't admit too many simulations

26:10.440 --> 26:12.200
 or ones that are at the scale of complexity

26:12.200 --> 26:13.400
 that we're looking at.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.360
 Obviously, it's just as conceivable that they do

26:15.360 --> 26:20.080
 and that there are many, but I guess what I'm channeling

26:20.080 --> 26:22.560
 is the surprise that I felt upon learning that fact,

26:22.560 --> 26:26.120
 that there are, that information is physical in this way.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.120
 There's a finiteness to it.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.420
 Okay, let me just even go off on that.

26:29.420 --> 26:31.320
 From a mathematics perspective

26:31.320 --> 26:35.040
 and a psychology perspective, how do you mix,

26:35.040 --> 26:38.200
 are you psychologically comfortable

26:38.200 --> 26:39.760
 with the concept of infinity?

26:40.800 --> 26:41.640
 I think so.

26:41.640 --> 26:42.460
 Are you okay with it?

26:42.460 --> 26:43.680
 I'm pretty okay, yeah.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.560
 Are you okay?

26:44.560 --> 26:47.180
 No, not really, it doesn't make any sense to me.

26:47.180 --> 26:50.040
 I don't know, like how many words,

26:50.040 --> 26:52.560
 how many possible words do you think could exist

26:53.480 --> 26:55.700
 that are just like strings of letters?

26:55.700 --> 26:59.600
 So that's a sort of mathematical statement as beautiful

26:59.600 --> 27:02.300
 and we use infinity in basically everything we do,

27:03.520 --> 27:06.880
 everything we do in science, math, and engineering, yes.

27:06.880 --> 27:11.880
 But you said exist, the question is,

27:12.040 --> 27:13.360
 you said letters or words?

27:13.360 --> 27:14.560
 I said words. Words.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.200
 To bring words into existence to me,

27:18.200 --> 27:20.920
 you have to start like saying them or like writing them

27:20.920 --> 27:22.040
 or like listing them.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.240
 That's an instantiation.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.800
 Okay, how many abstract words exist?

27:25.800 --> 27:28.080
 Well, the idea of an abstract.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.000
 The idea of abstract notions and ideas.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.120
 I think we should be clear on terminology.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.200
 I mean, you think about intelligence a lot,

27:35.200 --> 27:36.640
 like artificial intelligence.

27:37.860 --> 27:39.120
 Would you not say that what it's doing

27:39.120 --> 27:40.440
 is a kind of abstraction?

27:40.440 --> 27:42.280
 That like abstraction is key

27:42.280 --> 27:45.120
 to conceptualizing the universe?

27:45.120 --> 27:47.300
 You get this raw sensory data.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.240
 I need something that every time you move your face

27:49.240 --> 27:51.620
 a little bit and they're not pixels,

27:51.620 --> 27:55.200
 but like analog of pixels on my retina changed entirely,

27:55.200 --> 27:58.040
 that I can still have some coherent notion of this is Lex,

27:58.040 --> 27:59.720
 I'm talking to Lex, right?

27:59.720 --> 28:01.720
 What that requires is you have a disparate set

28:01.720 --> 28:03.580
 of possible images hitting me

28:03.580 --> 28:07.580
 that are unified in a notion of Lex, right?

28:07.580 --> 28:08.680
 That's a kind of abstraction.

28:08.680 --> 28:09.820
 It's a thing that could apply

28:09.820 --> 28:12.400
 to a lot of different images that I see

28:12.400 --> 28:15.280
 and it represents it in a much more compressed way

28:15.280 --> 28:17.440
 and one that's like much more resilient to that.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.360
 I think in the same way,

28:18.360 --> 28:21.080
 if I'm talking about infinity as an abstraction,

28:21.080 --> 28:23.820
 I don't mean nonphysical woo woo,

28:24.960 --> 28:26.360
 like ineffable or something.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.360
 What I mean is it's something that can apply

28:28.360 --> 28:30.160
 to a multiplicity of situations

28:30.160 --> 28:31.660
 that share a certain common attribute

28:31.660 --> 28:33.720
 in the same way that the images of like your face

28:33.720 --> 28:35.820
 on my retina share enough common attributes

28:35.820 --> 28:37.700
 that I can put the single notion to it.

28:37.700 --> 28:40.780
 Like in that way, infinity is an abstraction

28:40.780 --> 28:43.260
 and it's very powerful and it's only through

28:43.260 --> 28:45.680
 such abstractions that we can actually understand

28:45.680 --> 28:47.560
 like the world and logic and things.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.560
 And in the case of infinity,

28:48.560 --> 28:49.400
 the way I think about it,

28:49.400 --> 28:51.760
 the key entity is the property

28:51.760 --> 28:54.080
 of always being able to add one more.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.120
 Like no matter how many words you can list,

28:56.120 --> 28:57.720
 you just throw an A at the end of one

28:57.720 --> 28:59.760
 and you have another conceivable word.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.680
 You don't have to think of all the words at once.

29:01.680 --> 29:04.840
 It's that property, the oh, I could always add one more

29:04.840 --> 29:08.200
 that gives it this nature of infiniteness

29:08.200 --> 29:09.760
 in the same way that there's certain like properties

29:09.760 --> 29:13.720
 of your face that give it the Lexness, right?

29:13.720 --> 29:16.480
 So like infinity should be no more worrying

29:16.480 --> 29:19.760
 than the I can always add one more sentiment.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.600
 That's a really elegant,

29:21.600 --> 29:23.720
 much more elegant way than I could put it.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.840
 So thank you for doing that as yet another abstraction.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.440
 And yes, indeed, that's what our brain does.

29:29.440 --> 29:30.640
 That's what intelligent systems do.

29:30.640 --> 29:31.840
 That's what programming does.

29:31.840 --> 29:34.680
 That's what science does is build abstraction

29:34.680 --> 29:35.760
 on top of each other.

29:35.760 --> 29:39.560
 And yet there is at a certain point abstractions

29:39.560 --> 29:42.800
 that go into the quote woo, right?

29:42.800 --> 29:47.800
 Sort of, and because we're now,

29:47.920 --> 29:52.460
 it's like we built this stack of, you know,

29:52.460 --> 29:54.680
 the only thing that's true is the stuff that's on the ground.

29:54.680 --> 29:57.480
 Everything else is useful for interpreting this.

29:57.480 --> 30:00.000
 And at a certain point you might start floating

30:00.000 --> 30:04.600
 into ideas that are surreal and difficult

30:04.600 --> 30:08.120
 and take us into areas that are disconnected

30:08.120 --> 30:11.080
 from reality in a way that we could never get back.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.160
 What if instead of calling these abstract,

30:13.160 --> 30:14.640
 how different would it be in your mind

30:14.640 --> 30:15.960
 if we called them general?

30:15.960 --> 30:17.400
 And the phenomenon that you're describing

30:17.400 --> 30:19.080
 is overgeneralization.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.720
 When you try to have a concept or an idea

30:21.720 --> 30:24.760
 that's so general as to apply to nothing in particular

30:24.760 --> 30:27.960
 in a useful way, does that map to what you're thinking

30:27.960 --> 30:28.800
 of when you think of?

30:28.800 --> 30:31.480
 First of all, I'm playing little just for the fun of it.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.400
 Devil's advocate.

30:32.400 --> 30:37.400
 And I think our cognition, our mind is unable

30:37.400 --> 30:39.000
 to visualize.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.520
 So you do some incredible work with visualization and video.

30:42.520 --> 30:46.800
 I think infinity is very difficult to visualize

30:46.800 --> 30:48.240
 for our mind.

30:48.240 --> 30:52.880
 We can delude ourselves into thinking we can visualize it,

30:52.880 --> 30:54.480
 but we can't.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.120
 I don't, I mean, I don't,

30:56.120 --> 30:57.680
 I would venture to say it's very difficult.

30:57.680 --> 31:00.440
 And so there's some concepts of mathematics,

31:00.440 --> 31:02.040
 like maybe multiple dimensions,

31:02.040 --> 31:04.720
 we could sort of talk about that are impossible

31:04.720 --> 31:08.160
 for us to truly intuit, like,

31:08.160 --> 31:13.120
 and it just feels dangerous to me to use these

31:13.120 --> 31:15.720
 as part of our toolbox of abstractions.

31:16.680 --> 31:17.680
 On behalf of your listeners,

31:17.680 --> 31:19.600
 I almost fear we're getting too philosophical.

31:19.600 --> 31:20.440
 Right?

31:20.440 --> 31:21.280
 Heck no.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.120
 Heck no.

31:22.120 --> 31:26.720
 I think to that point for any particular idea like this,

31:26.720 --> 31:28.720
 there's multiple angles of attack.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.920
 I think the, when we do visualize infinity,

31:31.920 --> 31:33.160
 what we're actually doing, you know,

31:33.160 --> 31:34.720
 you write dot, dot, dot, right?

31:34.720 --> 31:37.000
 One, two, three, four, dot, dot, dot, right?

31:37.000 --> 31:37.960
 Those are symbols on the page

31:37.960 --> 31:41.680
 that are insinuating a certain infinity.

31:42.880 --> 31:45.920
 What you're capturing with a little bit of design there

31:45.920 --> 31:49.400
 is the I can always add one more property, right?

31:49.400 --> 31:52.480
 I think I'm just as uncomfortable with you are

31:52.480 --> 31:56.040
 if you try to concretize it so much

31:56.040 --> 31:58.880
 that you have a bag of infinitely many things

31:58.880 --> 32:00.720
 that I actually think of, no, not one, two, three, four,

32:00.720 --> 32:03.360
 dot, dot, dot, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.600
 I try to get them all in my head and you realize,

32:05.600 --> 32:08.120
 oh, you know, your brain would literally collapse

32:08.120 --> 32:10.120
 into a black hole, all of that.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.440
 And I honestly feel this with a lot of math

32:12.440 --> 32:15.040
 that I try to read where I don't think of myself

32:15.040 --> 32:19.880
 as like particularly good at math in some ways.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.360
 Like I get very confused often

32:21.360 --> 32:23.720
 when I am going through some of these texts.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.680
 And often what I'm feeling in my head is like,

32:25.680 --> 32:27.840
 this is just so damn abstract.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.160
 I just can't wrap my head around it.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.800
 I just want to put something concrete to it

32:31.800 --> 32:32.920
 that makes me understand.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.560
 And I think a lot of the motivation for the channel

32:35.560 --> 32:38.400
 is channeling that sentiment of, yeah,

32:38.400 --> 32:40.920
 a lot of the things that you're trying to read out there,

32:40.920 --> 32:43.600
 it's just so hard to connect to anything

32:43.600 --> 32:45.280
 that you spend an hour banging your head

32:45.280 --> 32:47.200
 against a couple of pages and you come out

32:47.200 --> 32:49.240
 not really knowing anything more

32:49.240 --> 32:51.760
 other than some definitions maybe

32:51.760 --> 32:55.520
 and a certain sense of self defeat, right?

32:55.520 --> 32:58.480
 One of the reasons I focus so much on visualizations

32:58.480 --> 33:01.720
 is that I'm a big believer in,

33:01.720 --> 33:03.080
 I'm sorry, I'm just really hampering on

33:03.080 --> 33:04.320
 this idea of abstraction,

33:04.320 --> 33:07.400
 being clear about your layers of abstraction, right?

33:07.400 --> 33:09.760
 It's always tempting to start an explanation

33:09.760 --> 33:11.920
 from the top to the bottom, okay?

33:11.920 --> 33:14.080
 You give the definition of a new theorem.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.120
 You're like, this is the definition of a vector space.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.320
 For example, that's how we'll start a course.

33:18.320 --> 33:20.520
 These are the properties of a vector space.

33:20.520 --> 33:23.480
 First from these properties, we will derive what we need

33:23.480 --> 33:25.120
 in order to do the math of linear algebra

33:25.120 --> 33:26.320
 or whatever it might be.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.520
 I don't think that's how understanding works at all.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.880
 I think how understanding works

33:29.880 --> 33:32.440
 is you start at the lowest level you can get at

33:32.440 --> 33:34.600
 where rather than thinking about a vector space,

33:34.600 --> 33:36.240
 you might think of concrete vectors

33:36.240 --> 33:37.880
 that are just lists of numbers

33:37.880 --> 33:41.040
 or picturing it as like an arrow that you draw,

33:41.920 --> 33:44.400
 which is itself like even less abstract than numbers

33:44.400 --> 33:45.440
 because you're looking at quantities,

33:45.440 --> 33:47.000
 like the distance of the x coordinate,

33:47.000 --> 33:48.080
 the distance of the y coordinate.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.120
 It's as concrete as you could possibly get

33:50.120 --> 33:53.640
 and it has to be if you're putting it in a visual, right?

33:53.640 --> 33:56.880
 It's an actual arrow. It's an actual vector.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.120
 You're not talking about like a quote unquote vector

33:59.120 --> 34:01.080
 that could apply to any possible thing.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.480
 You have to choose one if you're illustrating it.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.920
 And I think this is the power of being in a medium

34:05.920 --> 34:08.160
 like video or if you're writing a textbook

34:08.160 --> 34:10.760
 and you force yourself to put a lot of images

34:10.760 --> 34:13.520
 is with every image, you're making a choice.

34:13.520 --> 34:16.240
 With each choice, you're showing a concrete example.

34:16.240 --> 34:17.560
 With each concrete example,

34:17.560 --> 34:19.680
 you're aiding someone's path to understanding.

34:19.680 --> 34:21.360
 I'm sorry to interrupt you,

34:21.360 --> 34:24.600
 but you just made me realize that that's exactly right.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.880
 So the visualizations you're creating

34:26.880 --> 34:29.840
 while you're sometimes talking about abstractions,

34:29.840 --> 34:34.560
 the actual visualization is an explicit low level example.

34:34.560 --> 34:35.400
 Yes.

34:35.400 --> 34:37.400
 So there's an actual, like in the code,

34:37.400 --> 34:40.600
 you have to say what the vector is,

34:40.600 --> 34:42.200
 what's the direction of the arrow,

34:42.200 --> 34:44.960
 what's the magnitude of the, yeah.

34:44.960 --> 34:48.200
 So that's, you're going, the visualization itself

34:48.200 --> 34:50.200
 is actually going to the bottom of that.

34:50.200 --> 34:52.560
 And I think that's very important.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.960
 I also think about this a lot in writing scripts

34:54.960 --> 34:57.360
 where even before you get to the visuals,

34:57.360 --> 35:00.200
 the first instinct is to, I don't know why,

35:00.200 --> 35:02.560
 I just always do, I say the abstract thing,

35:02.560 --> 35:05.040
 I say the general definition, the powerful thing,

35:05.040 --> 35:07.240
 and then I fill it in with examples later.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.680
 Always, it will be more compelling

35:08.680 --> 35:10.720
 and easier to understand when you flip that.

35:10.720 --> 35:13.480
 And instead, you let someone's brain

35:13.480 --> 35:16.240
 do the pattern recognition.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.200
 You just show them a bunch of examples.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.080
 The brain is gonna feel a certain similarity between them.

35:21.080 --> 35:23.560
 Then by the time you bring in the definition,

35:23.560 --> 35:25.720
 or by the time you bring in the formula,

35:25.720 --> 35:28.920
 it's articulating a thing that's already in the brain

35:28.920 --> 35:30.880
 that was built off of looking at a bunch of examples

35:30.880 --> 35:32.840
 with a certain kind of similarity.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.680
 And what the formula does is articulate

35:34.680 --> 35:36.560
 what that kind of similarity is,

35:36.560 --> 35:41.560
 rather than being a high cognitive load set of symbols

35:42.200 --> 35:45.200
 that needs to be populated with examples later on,

35:45.200 --> 35:48.640
 assuming someone's still with you.

35:48.640 --> 35:51.280
 What is the most beautiful or awe inspiring idea

35:51.280 --> 35:53.840
 you've come across in mathematics?

35:53.840 --> 35:55.160
 I don't know, man.

35:55.160 --> 35:57.240
 Maybe it's an idea you've explored in your videos,

35:57.240 --> 35:58.360
 maybe not.

35:58.360 --> 36:01.280
 What just gave you pause?

36:01.280 --> 36:03.360
 What's the most beautiful idea?

36:03.360 --> 36:04.440
 Small or big.

36:04.440 --> 36:07.360
 So I think often, the things that are most beautiful

36:07.360 --> 36:11.800
 are the ones that you have a little bit of understanding of,

36:11.800 --> 36:14.360
 but certainly not an entire understanding.

36:14.360 --> 36:15.560
 It's a little bit of that mystery

36:15.560 --> 36:17.280
 that is what makes it beautiful.

36:17.280 --> 36:20.200
 What was the moment of the discovery for you personally,

36:20.200 --> 36:23.480
 almost just that leap of aha moment?

36:23.480 --> 36:25.240
 So something that really caught my eye,

36:25.240 --> 36:27.920
 I remember when I was little, there were these,

36:29.320 --> 36:31.120
 I think the series was called like wooden books

36:31.120 --> 36:32.400
 or something, these tiny little books

36:32.400 --> 36:34.680
 that would have just a very short description

36:34.680 --> 36:36.920
 of something on the left and then a picture on the right.

36:36.920 --> 36:37.880
 I don't know who they're meant for,

36:37.880 --> 36:39.640
 but maybe it's like loosely children

36:39.640 --> 36:40.520
 or something like that.

36:40.520 --> 36:41.440
 But it can't just be children,

36:41.440 --> 36:43.160
 because of some of the things I was describing.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.280
 On the last page of one of them,

36:45.280 --> 36:47.600
 somewhere tiny in there was this little formula

36:47.600 --> 36:49.880
 that on the left hand had a sum

36:49.880 --> 36:51.840
 over all of the natural numbers.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.760
 It's like one over one to the S plus one over two to the S

36:54.760 --> 36:57.680
 plus one over three to the S on and on to the infinity.

36:57.680 --> 37:01.120
 Then on the other side had a product over all of the primes

37:01.120 --> 37:03.820
 and it was a certain thing had to do with all the primes.

37:03.820 --> 37:06.480
 And like any good young math enthusiast,

37:06.480 --> 37:08.400
 I'd probably been indoctrinated with how chaotic

37:08.400 --> 37:10.920
 and confusing the primes are, which they are.

37:10.920 --> 37:14.280
 And seeing this equation where on one side

37:14.280 --> 37:15.900
 you have something that's as understandable

37:15.900 --> 37:18.280
 as you could possibly get, the counting numbers.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.480
 And on the other side is all the prime numbers.

37:20.480 --> 37:23.960
 It was like this, whoa, they're related like this?

37:23.960 --> 37:26.480
 There's a simple description that includes

37:26.480 --> 37:28.760
 all the primes getting wrapped together like this.

37:28.760 --> 37:32.200
 This is like the Euler product for the Zeta function,

37:32.200 --> 37:33.800
 as I like later found out.

37:33.800 --> 37:36.120
 The equation itself essentially encodes

37:36.120 --> 37:37.900
 the fundamental theorem of arithmetic

37:37.900 --> 37:39.480
 that every number can be expressed

37:39.480 --> 37:42.080
 as a unique set of primes.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.700
 To me still there's, I mean, I certainly don't understand

37:44.700 --> 37:47.280
 this equation or this function all that well.

37:47.280 --> 37:50.280
 The more I learn about it, the prettier it is.

37:50.280 --> 37:53.360
 The idea that you can, this is sort of what gets you

37:53.360 --> 37:57.240
 representations of primes, not in terms of primes themselves,

37:57.240 --> 37:59.160
 but in terms of another set of numbers.

37:59.160 --> 38:01.960
 They're like the non trivial zeros of the Zeta function.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.280
 And again, I'm very kind of in over my head

38:04.280 --> 38:06.660
 in a lot of ways as I like try to get to understand it.

38:06.660 --> 38:09.720
 But the more I do, it always leaves enough mystery

38:09.720 --> 38:11.640
 that it remains very beautiful to me.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.560
 So whenever there's a little bit of mystery

38:13.560 --> 38:16.780
 just outside of the understanding that,

38:16.780 --> 38:19.680
 and by the way, the process of learning more about it,

38:19.680 --> 38:20.580
 how does that come about?

38:20.580 --> 38:23.800
 Just your own thought or are you reading?

38:23.800 --> 38:24.640
 Reading, yeah.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.480
 Or is the process of visualization itself

38:26.480 --> 38:28.160
 revealing more to you?

38:28.160 --> 38:29.000
 Visuals help.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.320
 I mean, in one time when I was just trying to understand

38:31.320 --> 38:33.760
 like analytic continuation and playing around

38:33.760 --> 38:36.240
 with visualizing complex functions,

38:36.240 --> 38:39.500
 this is what led to a video about this function.

38:39.500 --> 38:40.340
 It's titled something like

38:40.340 --> 38:42.360
 Visualizing the Riemann Zeta Function.

38:42.360 --> 38:45.040
 It's one that came about because I was programming

38:45.040 --> 38:47.680
 and tried to see what a certain thing looked like.

38:47.680 --> 38:48.520
 And then I looked at it and I'm like,

38:48.520 --> 38:50.640
 whoa, that's elucidating.

38:50.640 --> 38:53.460
 And then I decided to make a video about it.

38:53.460 --> 38:56.680
 But I mean, you try to get your hands on

38:56.680 --> 38:58.120
 as much reading as you can.

38:58.120 --> 39:01.800
 You know, in this case, I think if anyone wants to start

39:01.800 --> 39:05.800
 to understand it, if they have like a math background

39:05.800 --> 39:08.840
 like they studied some in college or something like that,

39:08.840 --> 39:10.280
 like the Princeton Companion to Math

39:10.280 --> 39:13.040
 has a really good article on analytic number theory.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.720
 And that itself has a whole bunch of references

39:15.720 --> 39:17.420
 and you know, anything has more references

39:17.420 --> 39:20.160
 and it gives you this like tree to start piling through.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.160
 And like, you know, you try to understand,

39:22.160 --> 39:24.720
 I try to understand things visually as I go.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.320
 That's not always possible,

39:26.320 --> 39:28.340
 but it's very helpful when it does.

39:28.340 --> 39:30.100
 You recognize when there's common themes,

39:30.100 --> 39:34.460
 like in this case, Cousins of the Fourier Transform

39:34.460 --> 39:35.880
 that come into play and you realize,

39:35.880 --> 39:37.000
 oh, it's probably pretty important

39:37.000 --> 39:39.040
 to have deep intuitions of the Fourier Transform,

39:39.040 --> 39:42.360
 even if it's not explicitly mentioned in like these texts.

39:42.360 --> 39:45.240
 And you try to get a sense of what the common players are.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.220
 But I'll emphasize again, like,

39:47.220 --> 39:50.520
 I feel very in over my head when I try to understand

39:50.520 --> 39:53.520
 the exact relation between like the zeros

39:53.520 --> 39:54.600
 of the Riemann Zeta function

39:54.600 --> 39:56.940
 and how they relate to the distribution of primes.

39:56.940 --> 39:59.360
 I definitely understand it better than I did a year ago.

39:59.360 --> 40:02.360
 I definitely understand it on 100th as well as the experts

40:02.360 --> 40:04.680
 on the matter do, I assume.

40:04.680 --> 40:08.280
 But the slow path towards getting there is,

40:08.280 --> 40:09.600
 it's fun, it's charming,

40:09.600 --> 40:12.900
 and like to your question, very beautiful.

40:12.900 --> 40:14.800
 And the beauty is in the, what,

40:14.800 --> 40:17.080
 in the journey versus the destination?

40:17.080 --> 40:19.420
 Well, it's that each thing doesn't feel arbitrary.

40:19.420 --> 40:20.560
 I think that's a big part,

40:20.560 --> 40:23.360
 is that you have these unpredictable,

40:23.360 --> 40:25.880
 no, yeah, these very unpredictable patterns

40:25.880 --> 40:30.480
 or these intricate properties of like a certain function.

40:30.480 --> 40:31.320
 But at the same time,

40:31.320 --> 40:33.800
 it doesn't feel like humans ever made an arbitrary choice

40:33.800 --> 40:35.760
 in studying this particular thing.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.440
 So, you know, it feels like you're speaking

40:38.440 --> 40:41.280
 to patterns themselves or nature itself.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.160
 That's a big part of it.

40:43.160 --> 40:45.080
 I think things that are too arbitrary,

40:45.080 --> 40:46.640
 it's just hard for those to feel beautiful

40:46.640 --> 40:49.800
 because this is sort of what the word contrived

40:49.800 --> 40:51.680
 is meant to apply to, right?

40:53.420 --> 40:57.640
 And when they're not arbitrary means it could be,

40:57.640 --> 41:02.080
 you can have a clean abstraction and intuition

41:02.940 --> 41:04.940
 that allows you to comprehend it.

41:04.940 --> 41:06.220
 Well, to one of your first questions,

41:06.220 --> 41:07.640
 it makes you feel like if you came across

41:07.640 --> 41:09.680
 another intelligent civilization,

41:09.680 --> 41:12.360
 that they'd be studying the same thing.

41:12.360 --> 41:13.680
 Maybe with different notation.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.520
 Certainly, yeah, but yeah.

41:15.520 --> 41:16.360
 Like that's what,

41:16.360 --> 41:18.740
 I think you talked to that other civilization,

41:18.740 --> 41:20.280
 they're probably also studying the zeros

41:20.280 --> 41:21.680
 of the Riemann Zeta function

41:21.680 --> 41:23.840
 or like some variant thereof

41:23.840 --> 41:27.520
 that is like a clearly equivalent cousin

41:27.520 --> 41:28.560
 or something like that.

41:28.560 --> 41:31.400
 But that's probably on their docket.

41:32.480 --> 41:35.920
 Whenever somebody does a lot of something amazing,

41:35.920 --> 41:37.640
 I'm gonna ask the question

41:37.640 --> 41:40.160
 that you've already been asked a lot

41:40.160 --> 41:43.320
 and that you'll get more and more asked in your life.

41:43.320 --> 41:46.160
 But what was your favorite video to create?

41:46.160 --> 41:49.520
 Oh, favorite to create.

41:49.520 --> 41:51.280
 One of my favorites is,

41:51.280 --> 41:54.220
 the title is Who Cares About Topology?

41:54.220 --> 41:55.920
 You want me to pull it up or no?

41:55.920 --> 41:57.300
 If you want, sure, yeah.

41:57.300 --> 42:00.960
 It is about, well, it starts by describing

42:00.960 --> 42:03.040
 an unsolved problem that's still unsolved in math

42:03.040 --> 42:05.020
 called the inscribed square problem.

42:05.020 --> 42:06.720
 You draw any loop and then you ask,

42:06.720 --> 42:09.180
 are there four points on that loop that make a square?

42:09.180 --> 42:10.320
 Totally useless, right?

42:10.320 --> 42:12.480
 This is not answering any physical questions.

42:12.480 --> 42:14.920
 It's mostly interesting that we can't answer that question.

42:14.920 --> 42:17.320
 And it seems like such a natural thing to ask.

42:18.360 --> 42:21.160
 Now, if you weaken it a little bit and you ask,

42:21.160 --> 42:22.580
 can you always find a rectangle?

42:22.580 --> 42:24.280
 You choose four points on this curve,

42:24.280 --> 42:25.640
 can you find a rectangle?

42:25.640 --> 42:27.520
 That's hard, but it's doable.

42:27.520 --> 42:32.520
 And the path to it involves things like looking at a torus,

42:32.960 --> 42:35.320
 this surface with a single hole in it, like a donut,

42:35.320 --> 42:37.300
 or looking at a mobius strip.

42:37.300 --> 42:39.760
 In ways that feel so much less contrived

42:39.760 --> 42:41.680
 to when I first, as like a little kid,

42:41.680 --> 42:43.400
 learned about these surfaces and shapes,

42:43.400 --> 42:45.460
 like a mobius strip and a torus.

42:45.460 --> 42:47.840
 Like what you learn is, oh, this mobius strip,

42:47.840 --> 42:50.760
 you take a piece of paper, put a twist, glue it together,

42:50.760 --> 42:53.720
 and now you have a shape with one edge and just one side.

42:53.720 --> 42:58.480
 And as a student, you should think, who cares, right?

42:58.480 --> 43:00.600
 Like, how does that help me solve any problems?

43:00.600 --> 43:02.720
 I thought math was about problem solving.

43:02.720 --> 43:05.640
 So what I liked about the piece of math

43:05.640 --> 43:08.500
 that this was describing that was in this paper

43:08.500 --> 43:10.080
 by a mathematician named Vaughn

43:10.080 --> 43:12.960
 was that it arises very naturally.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.360
 It's clear what it represents.

43:14.360 --> 43:15.440
 It's doing something.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.800
 It's not just playing with construction paper.

43:17.800 --> 43:20.920
 And the way that it solves the problem is really beautiful.

43:21.800 --> 43:24.280
 So kind of putting all of that down

43:24.280 --> 43:25.840
 and concretizing it, right?

43:25.840 --> 43:27.680
 Like I was talking about how

43:27.680 --> 43:29.400
 when you have to put visuals to it,

43:29.400 --> 43:30.920
 it demands that what's on screen

43:30.920 --> 43:33.320
 is a very specific example of what you're describing.

43:33.320 --> 43:35.920
 The construction here is very abstract in nature.

43:35.920 --> 43:39.320
 You describe this very abstract kind of surface in 3D space.

43:39.320 --> 43:40.920
 So then when I was finding myself,

43:40.920 --> 43:42.040
 in this case, I wasn't programming,

43:42.040 --> 43:44.560
 I was using a grapher that's like built into OSX

43:44.560 --> 43:48.780
 for the 3D stuff to draw that surface,

43:48.780 --> 43:50.800
 you realize, oh man, the topology argument

43:50.800 --> 43:52.680
 is very non constructive.

43:52.680 --> 43:54.160
 I have to make a lot of,

43:54.160 --> 43:55.680
 you have to do a lot of extra work

43:55.680 --> 43:57.440
 in order to make the surface show up.

43:57.440 --> 43:59.440
 But then once you see it, it's quite pretty

43:59.440 --> 44:02.120
 and it's very satisfying to see a specific instance of it.

44:02.120 --> 44:03.540
 And you also feel like, ah,

44:03.540 --> 44:04.840
 I've actually added something

44:04.840 --> 44:06.720
 on top of what the original paper was doing

44:06.720 --> 44:09.640
 that it shows something that's completely correct.

44:09.640 --> 44:10.880
 That's a very beautiful argument,

44:10.880 --> 44:12.680
 but you don't see what it looks like.

44:12.680 --> 44:14.960
 And I found something satisfying

44:14.960 --> 44:16.400
 in seeing what it looked like

44:16.400 --> 44:17.960
 that could only ever have come about

44:17.960 --> 44:19.240
 from the forcing function

44:19.240 --> 44:21.200
 of getting some kind of image on the screen

44:21.200 --> 44:22.560
 to describe the thing I was talking about.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.260
 So you almost weren't able to anticipate

44:24.260 --> 44:25.100
 what it's gonna look like.

44:25.100 --> 44:26.160
 I had no idea.

44:26.160 --> 44:27.000
 I had no idea.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.280
 And it was wonderful, right?

44:28.280 --> 44:30.360
 It was totally, it looks like a Sydney Opera House

44:30.360 --> 44:32.040
 or some sort of Frank Gehry design.

44:32.040 --> 44:35.200
 And it was, you knew it was gonna be something

44:35.200 --> 44:36.480
 and you can say various things about it.

44:36.480 --> 44:39.320
 Like, oh, it touches the curve itself.

44:39.320 --> 44:42.080
 It has a boundary that's this curve on the 2D plane.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.840
 It all sits above the plane.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.320
 But before you actually draw it,

44:45.320 --> 44:48.160
 it's very unclear what the thing will look like.

44:48.160 --> 44:50.760
 And to see it, it's very, it's just pleasing, right?

44:50.760 --> 44:53.240
 So that was fun to make, very fun to share.

44:53.240 --> 44:58.040
 I hope that it has elucidated for some people out there

44:58.040 --> 45:00.120
 where these constructs of topology come from,

45:00.120 --> 45:03.040
 that it's not arbitrary play with construction paper.

45:04.040 --> 45:07.240
 So let's, I think this is a good sort of example

45:07.240 --> 45:09.640
 to talk a little bit about your process.

45:09.640 --> 45:12.760
 You have a list of ideas.

45:12.760 --> 45:17.480
 So that's sort of the curse of having an active

45:17.480 --> 45:19.600
 and brilliant mind is I'm sure you have a list

45:19.600 --> 45:22.000
 that's growing faster than you can utilize.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.560
 Now I'm ahead, absolutely.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.880
 But there's some sorting procedure

45:26.880 --> 45:29.800
 depending on mood and interest and so on.

45:29.800 --> 45:32.640
 But okay, so you pick an idea

45:32.640 --> 45:36.160
 and then you have to try to write a narrative arc

45:36.160 --> 45:38.800
 that sort of, how do I elucidate?

45:38.800 --> 45:41.320
 How do I make this idea beautiful and clear

45:41.320 --> 45:42.240
 and explain it?

45:42.240 --> 45:44.040
 And then there's a set of visualizations

45:44.040 --> 45:46.160
 that will be attached to it.

45:46.160 --> 45:48.440
 Sort of, you've talked about some of this before,

45:48.440 --> 45:52.920
 but sort of writing the story, attaching the visualizations.

45:52.920 --> 45:56.440
 Can you talk through interesting, painful,

45:56.440 --> 45:58.880
 beautiful parts of that process?

45:58.880 --> 46:02.000
 Well, the most painful is if you've chosen a topic

46:02.000 --> 46:05.680
 that you do want to do, but then it's hard to think of,

46:05.680 --> 46:07.480
 I guess how to structure the script.

46:07.480 --> 46:10.640
 This is sort of where I have been on one

46:10.640 --> 46:12.240
 for like the last two or three months.

46:12.240 --> 46:13.720
 And I think that ultimately the right resolution

46:13.720 --> 46:17.360
 is just like set it aside and instead do some other things

46:17.360 --> 46:18.840
 where the script comes more naturally.

46:18.840 --> 46:23.480
 Because you sort of don't want to overwork a narrative.

46:23.480 --> 46:24.700
 The more you've thought about it,

46:24.700 --> 46:26.480
 the less you can empathize with the student

46:26.480 --> 46:28.940
 who doesn't yet understand the thing you're trying to teach.

46:28.940 --> 46:31.860
 Who is the judger in your head?

46:31.860 --> 46:35.480
 Sort of the person, the creature,

46:35.480 --> 46:38.680
 the essence that's saying this sucks or this is good.

46:38.680 --> 46:42.000
 And you mentioned kind of the student you're thinking about.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.740
 Can you, who is that?

46:44.740 --> 46:45.880
 What is that thing?

46:45.880 --> 46:49.960
 That says, the perfectionist that says this thing sucks.

46:49.960 --> 46:53.520
 You need to work on that for another two, three months.

46:53.520 --> 46:54.360
 I don't know.

46:54.360 --> 46:56.160
 I think it's my past self.

46:56.160 --> 46:58.280
 I think that's the entity that I'm most trying

46:58.280 --> 47:00.880
 to empathize with is like you take who I was,

47:00.880 --> 47:02.480
 because that's kind of the only person I know.

47:02.480 --> 47:03.720
 Like you don't really know anyone

47:03.720 --> 47:05.480
 other than versions of yourself.

47:05.480 --> 47:07.880
 So I start with the version of myself that I know

47:07.880 --> 47:10.320
 who doesn't yet understand the thing, right?

47:10.320 --> 47:15.320
 And then I just try to view it with fresh eyes,

47:15.560 --> 47:17.480
 a particular visual or a particular script.

47:17.480 --> 47:18.840
 Like, is this motivating?

47:18.840 --> 47:20.680
 Does this make sense?

47:20.680 --> 47:21.560
 Which has its downsides,

47:21.560 --> 47:25.200
 because sometimes I find myself speaking to motivations

47:25.200 --> 47:28.520
 that only myself would be interested in.

47:28.520 --> 47:30.840
 I don't know, like I did this project on quaternions

47:30.840 --> 47:33.280
 where what I really wanted was to understand

47:33.280 --> 47:34.920
 what are they doing in four dimensions?

47:34.920 --> 47:37.560
 Can we see what they're doing in four dimensions, right?

47:37.560 --> 47:40.400
 And I came up with a way of thinking about it

47:40.400 --> 47:42.000
 that really answered the question in my head

47:42.000 --> 47:43.280
 that made me very satisfied

47:43.280 --> 47:46.640
 and being able to think about concretely with a 3D visual,

47:46.640 --> 47:48.720
 what are they doing to a 4D sphere?

47:48.720 --> 47:49.560
 And so I'm like, great,

47:49.560 --> 47:51.720
 this is exactly what my past self would have wanted, right?

47:51.720 --> 47:52.760
 And I make a thing on it.

47:52.760 --> 47:55.140
 And I'm sure it's what some other people wanted too.

47:55.140 --> 47:57.400
 But in hindsight, I think most people who wanna learn

47:57.400 --> 48:00.460
 about quaternions are like robotics engineers

48:00.460 --> 48:03.320
 or graphics programmers who want to understand

48:03.320 --> 48:06.160
 how they're used to describe 3D rotations.

48:06.160 --> 48:08.280
 And like their use case was actually a little bit different

48:08.280 --> 48:09.360
 than my past self.

48:09.360 --> 48:10.600
 And in that way, like,

48:10.600 --> 48:12.100
 I wouldn't actually recommend that video

48:12.100 --> 48:14.920
 to people who are coming at it from that angle

48:14.920 --> 48:17.460
 of wanting to know, hey, I'm a robotics programmer.

48:17.460 --> 48:20.260
 Like, how do these quaternion things work

48:20.260 --> 48:22.560
 to describe position in 3D space?

48:22.560 --> 48:25.660
 I would say other great resources for that.

48:25.660 --> 48:27.840
 If you ever find yourself wanting to say like,

48:27.840 --> 48:28.880
 but hang on,

48:28.880 --> 48:30.880
 in what sense are they acting in four dimensions?

48:30.880 --> 48:31.900
 Then come back.

48:31.900 --> 48:34.520
 But until then, that's a little different.

48:34.520 --> 48:35.360
 Yeah, it's interesting

48:35.360 --> 48:38.800
 because you have incredible videos on neural networks,

48:38.800 --> 48:39.840
 for example.

48:39.840 --> 48:41.080
 And from my sort of perspective,

48:41.080 --> 48:43.720
 because I've probably, I mean,

48:43.720 --> 48:44.680
 I looked at the,

48:45.520 --> 48:47.120
 is sort of my field

48:47.120 --> 48:49.320
 and I've also looked at the basic introduction

48:49.320 --> 48:51.100
 of neural networks like a million times

48:51.100 --> 48:52.480
 from different perspectives.

48:52.480 --> 48:53.480
 And it made me realize

48:53.480 --> 48:55.800
 that there's a lot of ways to present it.

48:55.800 --> 48:58.960
 So you were sort of, you did an incredible job.

48:58.960 --> 49:00.140
 I mean, sort of the,

49:01.560 --> 49:03.440
 but you could also do it differently

49:03.440 --> 49:04.900
 and also incredible.

49:04.900 --> 49:09.900
 Like to create a beautiful presentation of a basic concept

49:11.800 --> 49:16.080
 requires sort of creativity, requires genius and so on,

49:16.080 --> 49:18.620
 but you can take it from a bunch of different perspectives.

49:18.620 --> 49:21.440
 And that video on neural networks made me realize that.

49:21.440 --> 49:22.960
 And just as you're saying,

49:22.960 --> 49:26.280
 you kind of have a certain mindset, a certain view,

49:26.280 --> 49:28.980
 but from a, if you take a different view

49:28.980 --> 49:30.680
 from a physics perspective,

49:30.680 --> 49:33.380
 from a neuroscience perspective,

49:33.380 --> 49:34.440
 talking about neural networks

49:34.440 --> 49:38.420
 or from a robotics perspective,

49:38.420 --> 49:40.440
 or from, let's see,

49:40.440 --> 49:43.300
 from a pure learning, statistics perspective.

49:43.300 --> 49:46.360
 So you can create totally different videos.

49:46.360 --> 49:48.240
 And you've done that with a few actually concepts

49:48.240 --> 49:49.920
 where you've have taken different cuts,

49:49.920 --> 49:54.840
 like at the Euler equation, right?

49:54.840 --> 49:56.960
 You've taken different views of that.

49:56.960 --> 49:58.720
 I think I've made three videos on it

49:58.720 --> 50:01.040
 and I definitely will make at least one more.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.040
 Right?

50:02.040 --> 50:03.080
 Never enough.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.120
 Never enough.

50:04.120 --> 50:06.200
 So you don't think it's the most beautiful equation

50:06.200 --> 50:07.240
 in mathematics?

50:08.280 --> 50:10.040
 Like I said, as we represent it,

50:10.040 --> 50:11.440
 it's one of the most hideous.

50:11.440 --> 50:13.320
 It involves a lot of the most hideous aspects

50:13.320 --> 50:14.160
 of our notation.

50:14.160 --> 50:16.960
 I talked about E, the fact that we use pi instead of tau,

50:16.960 --> 50:20.680
 the fact that we call imaginary numbers imaginary,

50:20.680 --> 50:23.420
 and then, hence, I actually wonder if we use the I

50:23.420 --> 50:24.880
 because of imaginary.

50:24.880 --> 50:26.600
 I don't know if that's historically accurate,

50:26.600 --> 50:27.960
 but at least a lot of people,

50:27.960 --> 50:30.300
 they read the I and they think imaginary.

50:30.300 --> 50:31.440
 Like all three of those facts,

50:31.440 --> 50:33.720
 it's like those are things that have added more confusion

50:33.720 --> 50:34.560
 than they needed to,

50:34.560 --> 50:35.840
 and we're wrapping them up in one equation.

50:35.840 --> 50:39.080
 Like boy, that's just very hideous, right?

50:39.080 --> 50:40.880
 The idea is that it does tie together

50:40.880 --> 50:42.160
 when you wash away the notation.

50:42.160 --> 50:44.820
 Like it's okay, it's pretty, it's nice,

50:44.820 --> 50:48.320
 but it's not like mind blowing greatest thing

50:48.320 --> 50:49.520
 in the universe,

50:49.520 --> 50:52.020
 which is maybe what I was thinking of when I said,

50:52.020 --> 50:53.320
 like once you understand something,

50:53.320 --> 50:55.960
 it doesn't have the same beauty.

50:55.960 --> 50:59.000
 Like I feel like I understand Euler's formula,

50:59.000 --> 51:00.840
 and I feel like I understand it enough

51:00.840 --> 51:05.000
 to sort of see the version that just woke up

51:05.000 --> 51:07.560
 that hasn't really gotten itself dressed in the morning

51:07.560 --> 51:08.640
 that's a little bit groggy,

51:08.640 --> 51:10.120
 and there's bags under its eyes.

51:10.120 --> 51:13.320
 So you're past the dating stage,

51:13.320 --> 51:15.040
 you're no longer dating, right?

51:15.040 --> 51:16.760
 I'm still dating the Zeta function,

51:16.760 --> 51:18.920
 and like she's beautiful and right,

51:18.920 --> 51:20.100
 and like we have fun,

51:20.100 --> 51:22.640
 and it's that high dopamine part,

51:22.640 --> 51:24.000
 but like maybe at some point

51:24.000 --> 51:26.840
 we'll settle into the more mundane nature of the relationship

51:26.840 --> 51:28.480
 where I like see her for who she truly is,

51:28.480 --> 51:30.220
 and she'll still be beautiful in her own way,

51:30.220 --> 51:33.720
 but it won't have the same romantic pizzazz, right?

51:33.720 --> 51:35.520
 Well, that's the nice thing about mathematics.

51:35.520 --> 51:38.500
 I think as long as you don't live forever,

51:38.500 --> 51:41.840
 there'll always be enough mystery and fun

51:41.840 --> 51:42.920
 with some of the equations.

51:42.920 --> 51:45.480
 Even if you do, the rate at which questions comes up

51:45.480 --> 51:48.080
 is much faster than the rate at which answers come up, so.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.980
 If you could live forever, would you?

51:51.160 --> 51:52.160
 I think so, yeah.

51:52.160 --> 51:53.760
 So you think, you don't think mortality

51:53.760 --> 51:55.980
 is the thing that makes life meaningful?

51:55.980 --> 51:58.240
 Would your life be four times as meaningful

51:58.240 --> 52:00.440
 if you died at 25?

52:00.440 --> 52:02.200
 So this goes to infinity.

52:02.200 --> 52:04.700
 I think you and I, that's really interesting.

52:04.700 --> 52:09.400
 So what I said is infinite, not four times longer.

52:09.400 --> 52:10.360
 I said infinite.

52:10.360 --> 52:15.200
 So the actual existence of the finiteness,

52:15.200 --> 52:18.020
 the existence of the end, no matter the length,

52:18.020 --> 52:20.680
 is the thing that may sort of,

52:20.680 --> 52:22.380
 from my comprehension of psychology,

52:22.380 --> 52:25.600
 it's such a deeply human,

52:25.600 --> 52:28.560
 it's such a fundamental part of the human condition,

52:28.560 --> 52:31.120
 the fact that there is, that we're mortal,

52:31.120 --> 52:34.480
 that the fact that things end,

52:34.480 --> 52:37.880
 it seems to be a crucial part of what gives them meaning.

52:37.880 --> 52:40.560
 I don't think, at least for me,

52:40.560 --> 52:43.040
 it's a very small percentage of my time

52:43.040 --> 52:45.200
 that mortality is salient,

52:45.200 --> 52:47.200
 that I'm aware of the end of my life.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.360
 What do you mean by me?

52:50.080 --> 52:51.280
 I'm trolling.

52:51.280 --> 52:54.120
 Is it the ego, is it the id, or is it the superego?

52:55.840 --> 52:58.160
 The reflective self, the Wernicke's area

52:58.160 --> 52:59.860
 that puts all this stuff into words.

52:59.860 --> 53:02.520
 Yeah, a small percentage of your mind

53:02.520 --> 53:05.800
 that is actually aware of the true motivations

53:05.800 --> 53:06.960
 that drive you.

53:06.960 --> 53:08.360
 But my point is that most of my life,

53:08.360 --> 53:09.600
 I'm not thinking about death,

53:09.600 --> 53:12.000
 but I still feel very motivated to make things

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
 and to interact with people,

53:14.000 --> 53:15.400
 experience love or things like that.

53:15.400 --> 53:16.680
 I'm very motivated,

53:16.680 --> 53:19.400
 and it's strange that that motivation comes

53:19.400 --> 53:21.600
 while death is not in my mind at all.

53:21.600 --> 53:23.600
 And this might just be because I'm young enough

53:23.600 --> 53:24.720
 that it's not salient.

53:24.720 --> 53:25.960
 Or it's in your subconscious,

53:25.960 --> 53:28.100
 or that you've constructed an illusion

53:28.100 --> 53:31.180
 that allows you to escape the fact of your mortality

53:31.180 --> 53:32.760
 by enjoying the moment,

53:32.760 --> 53:34.600
 sort of the existential approach to life.

53:34.600 --> 53:36.160
 Could be.

53:36.160 --> 53:38.120
 Gun to my head, I don't think that's it.

53:38.120 --> 53:40.680
 Yeah, another sort of way to say gun to the head

53:40.680 --> 53:43.400
 is sort of the deep psychological introspection

53:43.400 --> 53:44.240
 of what drives us.

53:44.240 --> 53:47.000
 I mean, that's, in some ways to me,

53:47.000 --> 53:49.080
 I mean, when I look at math, when I look at science,

53:49.080 --> 53:51.600
 is a kind of an escape from reality

53:51.600 --> 53:54.400
 in a sense that it's so beautiful.

53:54.400 --> 53:58.740
 It's such a beautiful journey of discovery

53:58.740 --> 54:00.820
 that it allows you to actually,

54:00.820 --> 54:04.760
 it sort of allows you to achieve a kind of immortality

54:04.760 --> 54:09.680
 of explore ideas and sort of connect yourself

54:09.680 --> 54:12.360
 to the thing that is seemingly infinite,

54:12.360 --> 54:13.960
 like the universe, right?

54:13.960 --> 54:18.600
 That allows you to escape the limited nature

54:18.600 --> 54:23.600
 of our little, of our bodies, of our existence.

54:24.040 --> 54:25.960
 What else would give this podcast meaning?

54:25.960 --> 54:26.800
 That's right.

54:26.800 --> 54:28.000
 If not the fact that it will end.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.920
 This place closes in 40 minutes.

54:30.920 --> 54:33.280
 And it's so much more meaningful for it.

54:33.280 --> 54:35.480
 How much more I love this room

54:35.480 --> 54:36.880
 because we'll be kicked out.

54:38.200 --> 54:42.280
 So I understand just because you're trolling me

54:42.280 --> 54:43.600
 doesn't mean I'm wrong.

54:46.200 --> 54:47.840
 But I take your point.

54:47.840 --> 54:49.000
 I take your point.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.960
 Boy, that would be a good Twitter bio.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.320
 Just because you're trolling me doesn't mean I'm wrong.

54:54.320 --> 54:58.560
 Yeah, and sort of difference in backgrounds.

54:58.560 --> 55:01.520
 I'm a bit Russian, so we're a bit melancholic

55:01.520 --> 55:04.320
 and seem to maybe assign a little too much value

55:04.320 --> 55:07.360
 to suffering and mortality and things like that.

55:07.360 --> 55:09.840
 Makes for a better novel, I think.

55:09.840 --> 55:13.400
 Oh yeah, you need some sort of existential threat

55:13.400 --> 55:15.280
 to drive a plot.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.520
 So when do you know when the video is done

55:18.520 --> 55:20.680
 when you're working on it?

55:20.680 --> 55:21.560
 That's pretty easy actually,

55:21.560 --> 55:24.400
 because I'll write the script.

55:24.400 --> 55:27.120
 I want there to be some kind of aha moment in there.

55:27.120 --> 55:28.760
 And then hopefully the script can revolve around

55:28.760 --> 55:30.280
 some kind of aha moment.

55:30.280 --> 55:32.400
 And then from there, you're putting visuals

55:32.400 --> 55:34.040
 to each sentence that exists,

55:34.040 --> 55:36.360
 and then you narrate it, you edit it all together.

55:36.360 --> 55:37.760
 So given that there's a script,

55:37.760 --> 55:39.760
 the end becomes quite clear.

55:40.680 --> 55:44.320
 And as I animate it, I often change

55:45.560 --> 55:46.800
 certainly the specific words,

55:46.800 --> 55:49.320
 but sometimes the structure itself.

55:49.320 --> 55:53.240
 But it's a very deterministic process at that point.

55:53.240 --> 55:54.440
 It makes it much easier to predict

55:54.440 --> 55:55.840
 when something will be done.

55:55.840 --> 55:57.080
 How do you know when a script is done?

55:57.080 --> 55:59.120
 It's like, for problem solving videos,

55:59.120 --> 56:00.400
 that's quite simple.

56:00.400 --> 56:01.440
 It's once you feel like someone

56:01.440 --> 56:03.560
 who didn't understand the solution now could.

56:03.560 --> 56:04.680
 For things like neural networks,

56:04.680 --> 56:06.720
 that was a lot harder because like you said,

56:06.720 --> 56:09.560
 there's so many angles at which you could attack it.

56:09.560 --> 56:11.720
 And there, it's just at some point

56:11.720 --> 56:15.680
 you feel like this asks a meaningful question

56:15.680 --> 56:18.360
 and it answers that question, right?

56:18.360 --> 56:20.280
 What is the best way to learn math

56:20.280 --> 56:22.400
 for people who might be at the beginning of that journey?

56:22.400 --> 56:24.840
 I think that's a question that a lot of folks

56:24.840 --> 56:26.200
 kind of ask and think about.

56:26.200 --> 56:27.800
 And it doesn't, even for folks

56:27.800 --> 56:29.920
 who are not really at the beginning of their journey,

56:29.920 --> 56:33.920
 like there might be actually deep in their career,

56:33.920 --> 56:35.720
 some type they've taken college

56:35.720 --> 56:36.920
 or taken calculus and so on,

56:36.920 --> 56:39.080
 but still wanna sort of explore math.

56:39.080 --> 56:42.880
 What would be your advice instead of education at all ages?

56:42.880 --> 56:45.840
 Your temptation will be to spend more time

56:45.840 --> 56:48.160
 like watching lectures or reading.

56:48.160 --> 56:50.560
 Try to force yourself to do more problems

56:50.560 --> 56:52.160
 than you naturally would.

56:52.160 --> 56:53.800
 That's a big one.

56:53.800 --> 56:56.040
 Like the focus time that you're spending

56:56.040 --> 56:59.000
 should be on like solving specific problems

56:59.000 --> 57:02.360
 and seek entities that have well curated lists of problems.

57:02.360 --> 57:04.240
 So go into like a textbook almost

57:04.240 --> 57:07.160
 and the problems in the back of a textbook kind of thing,

57:07.160 --> 57:08.080
 back of a chapter.

57:08.080 --> 57:10.560
 So if you can take a little look through those questions

57:10.560 --> 57:12.480
 at the end of the chapter before you read the chapter,

57:12.480 --> 57:13.600
 a lot of them won't make sense.

57:13.600 --> 57:14.560
 Some of them might,

57:14.560 --> 57:16.600
 and those are the best ones to think about.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.920
 A lot of them won't, but just take a quick look

57:18.920 --> 57:20.120
 and then read a little bit of the chapter

57:20.120 --> 57:22.400
 and then maybe take a look again and things like that.

57:22.400 --> 57:25.120
 And don't consider yourself done with the chapter

57:25.120 --> 57:28.160
 until you've actually worked through a couple exercises.

57:29.800 --> 57:31.160
 And this is so hypocritical, right?

57:31.160 --> 57:32.400
 Cause I like put out videos

57:32.400 --> 57:35.920
 that pretty much never have associated exercises.

57:35.920 --> 57:38.640
 I just view myself as a different part of the ecosystem,

57:38.640 --> 57:40.760
 which means I'm kind of admitting

57:40.760 --> 57:42.880
 that you're not really learning,

57:42.880 --> 57:44.720
 or at least this is only a partial part

57:44.720 --> 57:47.480
 of the learning process if you're watching these videos.

57:48.600 --> 57:50.360
 I think if someone's at the very beginning,

57:50.360 --> 57:52.200
 like I do think Khan Academy does a good job.

57:52.200 --> 57:54.840
 They have a pretty large set of questions

57:54.840 --> 57:55.840
 you can work through.

57:55.840 --> 57:56.840
 Just the very basics,

57:56.840 --> 57:58.760
 sort of just picking up,

57:58.760 --> 58:01.200
 getting comfortable with the very basic linear algebra,

58:01.200 --> 58:04.040
 calculus or so on, Khan Academy.

58:04.040 --> 58:05.880
 Programming is actually I think a great,

58:05.880 --> 58:08.440
 like learn to program and like let the way

58:08.440 --> 58:11.760
 that math is motivated from that angle push you through.

58:11.760 --> 58:14.280
 I know a lot of people who didn't like math

58:14.280 --> 58:15.520
 got into programming in some way

58:15.520 --> 58:17.240
 and that's what turned them on to math.

58:17.240 --> 58:19.160
 Maybe I'm biased cause like I live in the Bay area,

58:19.160 --> 58:21.000
 so I'm more likely to run into someone

58:21.000 --> 58:23.320
 who has that phenotype.

58:23.320 --> 58:25.760
 But I am willing to speculate

58:25.760 --> 58:28.080
 that that is a more generalizable path.

58:28.080 --> 58:30.080
 So you yourself kind of in creating the videos

58:30.080 --> 58:32.960
 are using programming to illuminate a concept,

58:32.960 --> 58:35.000
 but for yourself as well.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.920
 So would you recommend somebody try to make a,

58:37.920 --> 58:40.240
 sort of almost like try to make videos?

58:40.240 --> 58:41.840
 Like you do as a way to learn?

58:41.840 --> 58:43.120
 So one thing I've heard before,

58:43.120 --> 58:44.680
 I don't know if this is based on any actual study.

58:44.680 --> 58:47.200
 This might be like a total fictional anecdote of numbers,

58:47.200 --> 58:49.720
 but it rings in the mind as being true.

58:49.720 --> 58:51.820
 You remember about 10% of what you read,

58:51.820 --> 58:54.400
 you remember about 20% of what you listen to,

58:54.400 --> 58:57.280
 you remember about 70% of what you actively interact with

58:57.280 --> 59:00.480
 in some way, and then about 90% of what you teach.

59:00.480 --> 59:02.080
 This is a thing I heard again,

59:02.080 --> 59:03.460
 those numbers might be meaningless,

59:03.460 --> 59:05.840
 but they ring true, don't they, right?

59:05.840 --> 59:07.880
 I'm willing to say I learned nine times better

59:07.880 --> 59:09.200
 if I'm teaching something than reading.

59:09.200 --> 59:11.640
 That might even be a low ball, right?

59:11.640 --> 59:12.960
 So doing something to teach

59:12.960 --> 59:15.180
 or to like actively try to explain things

59:15.180 --> 59:17.800
 is huge for consolidating the knowledge.

59:17.800 --> 59:19.640
 Outside of family and friends,

59:19.640 --> 59:22.400
 is there a moment you can remember

59:22.400 --> 59:23.720
 that you would like to relive

59:23.720 --> 59:26.160
 because it made you truly happy

59:26.160 --> 59:30.160
 or it was transformative in some fundamental way?

59:30.160 --> 59:32.680
 A moment that was transformative.

59:32.680 --> 59:35.040
 Or made you truly happy?

59:35.040 --> 59:36.760
 Yeah, I think there's times,

59:36.760 --> 59:38.720
 like music used to be a much bigger part of my life

59:38.720 --> 59:41.600
 than it is now, like when I was a, let's say a teenager,

59:41.600 --> 59:45.400
 and I can think of some times in like playing music.

59:45.400 --> 59:48.160
 There was one, like my brother and a friend of mine,

59:48.160 --> 59:50.160
 so this slightly violates the family and friends,

59:50.160 --> 59:51.800
 but it was the music that made me happy.

59:51.800 --> 59:54.440
 They were just accompanying.

59:54.440 --> 59:57.480
 We like played a gig at a ski resort

59:57.480 --> 59:59.320
 such that you like take a gondola to the top

59:59.320 --> 1:00:00.660
 and like did a thing.

1:00:00.660 --> 1:00:01.820
 And then on the gondola ride down,

1:00:01.820 --> 1:00:04.180
 we decided to just jam a little bit.

1:00:04.180 --> 1:00:06.280
 And it was just like, I don't know,

1:00:06.280 --> 1:00:09.040
 the gondola sort of came over a mountain

1:00:09.040 --> 1:00:10.740
 and you saw the city lights

1:00:10.740 --> 1:00:13.920
 and we're just like jamming, like playing some music.

1:00:13.920 --> 1:00:16.320
 I wouldn't describe that as transformative.

1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:18.040
 I don't know why, but that popped into my mind

1:00:18.040 --> 1:00:21.200
 as a moment of, in a way that wasn't associated

1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:24.200
 with people I love, but more with like a thing I was doing,

1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:26.160
 something that was just, it was just happy

1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:28.000
 and it was just like a great moment.

1:00:29.280 --> 1:00:32.080
 I don't think I can give you anything deeper than that.

1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:34.840
 Well, as a musician myself, I'd love to see,

1:00:35.720 --> 1:00:38.800
 as you mentioned before, music enter back into your work,

1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:40.080
 back into your creative work.

1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:41.320
 I'd love to see that.

1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:43.880
 I'm certainly allowing it to enter back into mine.

1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:47.840
 And it's a beautiful thing for a mathematician,

1:00:47.840 --> 1:00:51.440
 for a scientist to allow music to enter their work.

1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:53.920
 I think only good things can happen.

1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:57.200
 All right, I'll try to promise you a music video by 2020.

1:00:57.200 --> 1:00:58.040
 By 2020?

1:00:58.040 --> 1:00:58.860
 By the end of 2020.

1:00:58.860 --> 1:00:59.700
 Okay, all right, good.

1:00:59.700 --> 1:01:01.400
 Give myself a longer window.

1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:04.480
 All right, maybe we can like collaborate

1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:05.680
 on a band type situation.

1:01:05.680 --> 1:01:07.020
 What instruments do you play?

1:01:07.020 --> 1:01:08.600
 The main instrument I play is violin,

1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:11.680
 but I also love to dabble around on like guitar and piano.

1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:13.540
 Beautiful, me too, guitar and piano.

1:01:13.540 --> 1:01:18.540
 So in a mathematician's lament, Paul Lockhart writes,

1:01:18.640 --> 1:01:20.080
 the first thing to understand

1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:22.040
 is that mathematics is an art.

1:01:22.040 --> 1:01:24.080
 The difference between math and the other arts,

1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:26.740
 such as music and painting,

1:01:26.740 --> 1:01:29.920
 is that our culture does not recognize it as such.

1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:34.420
 So I think I speak for millions of people, myself included,

1:01:34.420 --> 1:01:37.460
 in saying thank you for revealing to us

1:01:37.460 --> 1:01:39.640
 the art of mathematics.

1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:40.920
 So thank you for everything you do

1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:42.260
 and thanks for talking today.

1:01:42.260 --> 1:01:43.240
 Wow, thanks for saying that.

1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:45.400
 And thanks for having me on.

1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:47.120

 And now, let me leave you with some words of wisdom

1:02:16.080 --> 1:02:20.280
 from one of Grant's and my favorite people, Richard Feynman.

1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:24.800
 Nobody ever figures out what this life is all about,

1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:26.480
 and it doesn't matter.

1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:28.540
 Explore the world.

1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:30.640
 Nearly everything is really interesting

1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:33.300
 if you go into it deeply enough.

1:02:33.300 --> 1:02:45.300
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
