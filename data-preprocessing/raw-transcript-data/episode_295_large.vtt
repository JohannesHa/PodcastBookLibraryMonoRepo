 Slaves produce a surplus which the master gets. Serfs produce a surplus which the lord gets.

00:06.880 --> 00:16.000
 Employees produce a surplus which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative

00:16.000 --> 00:26.240
 class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another

00:26.240 --> 00:34.720
 group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger,

00:34.720 --> 00:41.280
 resentment, and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle.

00:43.680 --> 00:49.440
 The following is a conversation with Richard Wolff, one of the top Marxist economists and

00:49.440 --> 00:57.360
 philosophers in the world. This is a heavy topic, in general and for me personally, given my family

00:57.360 --> 01:04.800
 history in the Soviet Union, in Russia, and in Ukraine. Today the words Marxism, Socialism,

01:04.800 --> 01:11.680
 and Communism are used to attack and to divide, much more than to understand and to learn.

01:11.680 --> 01:18.320
 With this podcast, I seek the latter. I believe we need to study the ideas of Karl Marx,

01:18.320 --> 01:23.520
 as well as their various implementations throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries.

01:24.240 --> 01:29.520
 And in general, we need to both steel man and to consider seriously the ideas we demonize,

01:30.400 --> 01:37.440
 and to challenge the ideas we dogmatically accept as true, even when doing so is unpleasant,

01:37.440 --> 01:44.160
 and at times, dangerous. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our

01:44.160 --> 01:49.920
 sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Richard Wolff.

01:50.720 --> 01:56.960
 Let's start with a basic question, but maybe not so basic after all. What is Marxism? What are the

01:56.960 --> 02:02.800
 defining characteristics of Marxism as an economic and political theory and ideology?

02:02.800 --> 02:08.880
 Well, the simplest way to begin a definition would be to say it's the tradition that takes its

02:09.760 --> 02:20.480
 founding inspiration from the works of Karl Marx. But because these ideas that he put forward

02:21.440 --> 02:30.720
 spread as fast as they did, and as globally as they did, literally it's 140 years,

02:30.720 --> 02:41.360
 140 years since Marx died. And in that time, his ideas have become major types of thinking

02:41.360 --> 02:47.600
 in every country on the earth. If you know much about the great ideas of human history,

02:49.200 --> 02:56.800
 that's an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time.

02:56.800 --> 03:05.040
 And what that has meant, that speed of spread and that geographic diversity, is that the Marxian

03:05.040 --> 03:12.960
 ideas interacted with very different cultural histories, religious histories, and economic

03:12.960 --> 03:20.160
 conditions. So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently in different places

03:20.160 --> 03:29.200
 at different times. And therefore, Marxism, as a kind of first flush definition, is the totality

03:29.200 --> 03:39.200
 of all of these very different ways of coming to terms with it. For the first roughly 40, 50 years,

03:40.560 --> 03:48.240
 Marxism was a tradition of thinking critically about capitalism. Marx himself, that's all he

03:48.240 --> 03:53.760
 really did. He never wrote a book about communism. He never wrote a book really about socialism.

03:53.760 --> 04:01.600
 Either his comments were occasional, fragmentary, dispersed. What he was really interested in was

04:01.600 --> 04:09.760
 a critical analysis of capitalism. And that's what Marxism was, more or less, in its first 40 or 50

04:09.760 --> 04:19.760
 years. The only qualification of what I just said was something that happened in Paris for a few

04:19.760 --> 04:29.200
 weeks. In 1871, there was a collapse of the French government, consequent upon losing a war to Bismarck's

04:29.200 --> 04:35.600
 Germany. And then the result was something called the Paris Commune. The working class of Paris

04:35.600 --> 04:43.120
 rose up, basically took over the function of running the Parisian economy and the Parisian

04:43.120 --> 04:50.560
 society. And Marx's people, people influenced by Marx, were very active in that commune,

04:50.560 --> 04:55.120
 in the leadership of the commune. And Marx wasn't that far away. He was in London.

04:56.240 --> 05:02.640
 These things were happening in Paris. That's an easy transport even then. And for a short time,

05:02.640 --> 05:11.920
 very short, Marxism had a different quality. In addition to being a critique of capitalism,

05:11.920 --> 05:21.240
 it became a theory of how to organize society differently. Before that had only been implicit.

05:21.240 --> 05:28.800
 Now it became explicit. What is the leadership of the Paris Commune going to do? And why? And

05:28.800 --> 05:36.080
 in what order? And in other words, governing, organizing a society. But since it only lasted

05:36.080 --> 05:43.120
 a few weeks, the French army regrouped. And under the leadership of people who were very opposed to

05:43.120 --> 05:51.120
 Marx, they marched back into Paris, took over, killed a large number of the communards, as they

05:51.120 --> 05:57.680
 were called, and deported them to islands in the Pacific that were part of the French empire at the

05:57.680 --> 06:06.720
 time. The really big change happens in Russia in 1917. Now you have a group of Marxists, Lenin,

06:06.720 --> 06:17.120
 Trotsky, all the rest, who are in this bizarre position to seize a moment. Once again, a war,

06:17.120 --> 06:25.120
 like in France, disorganizes the government, throws the government into a very bad reputation

06:25.120 --> 06:31.120
 because it is the government that loses World War I, has to withdraw, as you know,

06:31.760 --> 06:36.960
 Brest, Litovsk and all of that, and the government collapses and the army revolts.

06:37.760 --> 06:46.240
 And in that situation, a very small political party, Russian Social Democratic Workers Party,

06:46.240 --> 06:56.400
 splits, under the pressures of all of this, into the Bolshevik and Menshevik divisions. Lenin,

06:56.400 --> 07:00.640
 Trotsky and the others are in the Bolshevik division. And to make a long story short,

07:00.640 --> 07:09.600
 he's in exile. Lenin's position gets him deported because he says Russian workers should not be

07:09.600 --> 07:16.640
 killing German workers. I mean, this is a war of capitalists who are dividing the world up into

07:16.640 --> 07:24.000
 colonies and Russian working people should not kill and should not die for such a thing. As you

07:24.000 --> 07:30.160
 can expect, they arrest him and they throw him out. Interestingly, in the United States, the

07:30.160 --> 07:36.560
 comparable leader at that time of the Socialist Party here, as you know, there was no Communist

07:36.560 --> 07:42.320
 Party at this point, that comes later. The head of the Socialist Party, a very important American

07:42.320 --> 07:50.240
 figure named Eugene Victor Debs, makes exactly the same argument that Americans should not fight in

07:50.240 --> 07:57.040
 the war. He has nothing to do with Lenin, I don't even know if they knew of each other, but he does

07:57.040 --> 08:02.560
 it on his own. He gets arrested and put in jail here in the United States. By the way, he runs for

08:02.560 --> 08:09.360
 president from jail and does very well, really very well, remarkable. And he's the inspiration

08:09.360 --> 08:18.080
 for Bernie Sanders, if you see the link, although he had much more courage politically than Bernie

08:18.080 --> 08:24.160
 has. That's really interesting. I'd love to return to that link maybe later. History rhymes. Yes,

08:24.160 --> 08:32.800
 the complicated story. Anyway, the importance in terms of Marxism is that now this seizure of power

08:32.800 --> 08:40.160
 by a group of Marxists, that is a group of people inspired by Marx developing what you might call

08:40.160 --> 08:46.560
 a Russian, even though there were differences among the Russians too, but a Russian interpretation,

08:46.560 --> 08:54.720
 this now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism into a plan, at least. What are you

08:54.720 --> 09:02.720
 going to do in the Soviet Union? And a lot of this was then trial and error. Marx never laid any of

09:02.720 --> 09:08.160
 this out. Probably wouldn't have been all that relevant if he had, because it was 50 years

09:08.160 --> 09:15.200
 earlier in another country, etc. So what begins to happen, and you can see how this happens then

09:15.200 --> 09:23.440
 more later in China and Cuba and Vietnam and Korea and so on, is that you have kind of a bifurcation.

09:24.160 --> 09:34.080
 Much of Marxism remains chiefly the critique of capitalism, but another part of it becomes a set,

09:34.080 --> 09:40.960
 and they differ from one to the other, a set of notions of what an alternative post capitalist

09:40.960 --> 09:47.600
 society ought to look like, how it ought to work. And there's lots of disagreement about it,

09:48.160 --> 09:54.720
 lots of confusion, and I would say that that's still where it is. You have a tradition now

09:55.280 --> 10:01.760
 that has these two major wings, critique of capitalism, notion of the alternative,

10:01.760 --> 10:07.680
 and then a variety of each of those, and that would be the framework in which I would answer,

10:07.680 --> 10:14.800
 that's what Marxism is about. Its basic idea, if you had to have one, is that human society

10:15.600 --> 10:18.800
 can do better than capitalism, and it ought to try.

10:19.520 --> 10:23.680
 And then we can start to talk about what we mean by capitalism.

10:23.680 --> 10:24.180
 Fine.

10:25.280 --> 10:30.880
 So we'll look at the critique of capitalism on one side, but maybe stepping back,

10:30.880 --> 10:37.440
 what do you think Marx would say if he just looked at the different implementations of the ideas that

10:37.440 --> 10:42.640
 Marxism throughout the 20th century, where his ideas that were implicit were made explicit?

10:46.800 --> 10:52.800
 Would he shake his head? Would he enjoy some of the parts of the implementations? How do you think

10:52.800 --> 10:54.000
 he would analyze it?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.920
 Well, he had a great sense of humor. I don't know if he had a chance to take a look at his writing,

10:57.920 --> 11:03.680
 but he had an extraordinary sense of humorism. My guess is he would deploy his humor in answering

11:03.680 --> 11:10.000
 this question, too. He would say some of them are inspiring, some of his interpretations of his work,

11:10.000 --> 11:16.320
 and he's very pleased with those. Others are horrifying, and he wishes somehow he could

11:16.320 --> 11:22.880
 erase the connection between those things and the lineage they claim from him, which he would.

11:24.400 --> 11:29.520
 There's a German word—I don't know if you speak the other languages—there's a wonderful

11:29.520 --> 11:36.480
 German word called verzichte, and it's stronger than the word refuse. It's if you want to refuse

11:36.480 --> 11:43.200
 something, but with real strong emphasis. Verzichte darauf is a German way of saying,

11:43.200 --> 11:45.440
 I don't want anything to do with that.

11:46.240 --> 11:51.600
 He would talk then in philosophical terms, because remember, he was a student of philosophy.

11:51.600 --> 11:57.760
 He wrote his doctoral thesis on ancient Greek philosophy and all the rest. He would wax

11:57.760 --> 12:04.560
 philosophical and say, you know, that the ideas you put out are a little bit like having a child.

12:04.560 --> 12:10.640
 You have a lot of influence, but the child is his own or her own person and will find his or

12:10.640 --> 12:17.280
 her own way, and these ideas, once they're out there, go their own way. And as you said, there's

12:17.280 --> 12:22.240
 a particular way that this idea spread, the speed at which it spread throughout the world made it

12:22.240 --> 12:29.120
 even less able to be sort of stabilized and connected back to the origins of where the idea

12:29.120 --> 12:35.520
 came from. The only people who ever really tried that were the Russians after the revolution,

12:35.520 --> 12:41.360
 because they occupied a position for a while, not very long, but they occupied a position for a

12:41.360 --> 12:46.560
 while in which, I mean, it was exalted, right? There had been all these people criticizing

12:46.560 --> 12:53.360
 capitalism for a long time, even the Marxists ever since mid century. And these were the first guys

12:53.920 --> 13:00.240
 who pulled it off. They made it. And so that there was a kind of presumption around the world,

13:00.240 --> 13:08.560
 their interpretation must be kind of the right one, because look, they did it. And so for a while,

13:08.560 --> 13:18.400
 they could enunciate their interpretation. And it came to be widely grasped as something which,

13:18.400 --> 13:23.920
 by the way, gets called in the literature, official Marxism, the very idea that you would

13:23.920 --> 13:30.960
 put that adjective in front of Marxism, or Soviet Marxism or Russian, there were these words that

13:31.840 --> 13:37.920
 where the adjective was meant to somehow say, kind of, this is the canon, you can depart from

13:37.920 --> 13:44.640
 it, but this is the canon. Before the Russian Revolution, there was no such thing. And by the

13:44.640 --> 13:54.240
 1960s, it was already, it was gone. But for a short time, 30, 40 years, it was a kind of,

13:54.960 --> 14:02.080
 and the irony is, particularly here in the United States, where the taboo against Marxism kicks in

14:02.080 --> 14:09.760
 right after World War II, is so total in this country, that I, for example, through most of

14:09.760 --> 14:18.640
 my adult life, have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time simply explaining to American

14:18.640 --> 14:28.880
 audiences that the Marxism they take as canonical is that old Soviet Marxism, which wasn't the canon

14:28.880 --> 14:36.960
 before 1917, and hasn't been since at least the 1960s. But they don't know. It's not that they're

14:36.960 --> 14:42.000
 stupid, and it's not that they're ignorant. It's that, well, ignorance may be, but I mean, it's not

14:42.000 --> 14:49.680
 a mental problem. It's the taboo. Shut it down. And so all of the reopening that, in a way,

14:49.680 --> 14:55.440
 recaptures what went before and develops it in new direction, they just don't know.

14:55.440 --> 15:03.200
 LW. Nevertheless, it's a serious attempt at making the implicit ideas explicit. The Russians,

15:04.240 --> 15:10.320
 the Soviets at the beginning of the 20th century, made a serious attempt at saying, okay, beyond the

15:10.320 --> 15:14.960
 critique of capitalism, how do we actually build a system like this? And so, in that sense,

15:16.720 --> 15:22.720
 not at a high level, but at a detailed level, it's interesting to look at those particular schools.

15:22.720 --> 15:27.760
 Maybe… RL. Right, because, for example, let me just take your point one step further. You really

15:27.760 --> 15:34.720
 cannot understand the Cuban Revolution, the Chinese Revolution, Vietnamese, and the others,

15:34.720 --> 15:43.600
 because each of them is a kind of response, let's call it, to the way the Soviets did it.

15:43.600 --> 15:50.400
 Are you going to do it that way? Well, yes, and no is the answer. This we will do that way,

15:50.400 --> 15:56.960
 but that we're not going to do. And the differences are huge, but you could find a thread—I can do

15:56.960 --> 16:04.000
 that for you if you want—in which all of them are, in a way, reacting. LW. To the originals.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.920
 RL. Yes, very much so. LW. Like maybe most of rock music is reacting to the Beatles and the Stones.

16:09.920 --> 16:16.000
 RL. Something like that. LW. Can you speak to the unique elements of the various schools

16:16.000 --> 16:22.960
 of that Soviet Marxism? So we got Leninism, Trotskyism, Stalinism, maybe even let's expand

16:22.960 --> 16:32.240
 out to Maoism. So maybe I could speak to sort of Leninism, and then please tell me if I'm saying

16:32.240 --> 16:41.840
 dumb things. I think for Lenin, there was an idea that there could be a small sort of vanguard party,

16:41.840 --> 16:48.480
 like a small controlling entity that's like wise and is able to do the central planning decisions.

16:49.040 --> 16:56.320
 Then for Stalinism, one interesting—Stalin's implementation of all of this—one interesting

16:56.320 --> 17:02.720
 characteristic is to move away from the international aspect of the ideal of Marxism to

17:02.720 --> 17:11.200
 make it all about nation, nationalism, the strength of nation. And then so Maoism is

17:13.040 --> 17:19.920
 different in that it's focused on agriculture and rural. And then Trotskyism, I don't know

17:20.640 --> 17:26.480
 except that it's anti Stalin. I mean, I don't even know if there's unique sort of philosophical

17:26.480 --> 17:31.280
 elements there. Anyway, can you maybe from those or something else speak to different unique

17:31.280 --> 17:37.920
 elements that are interesting to think about implementation of Marxism in the real world?

17:37.920 --> 17:46.080
 Probably the best way to get into this is to describe something that happened in Marxism

17:46.080 --> 17:53.120
 that then shapes the answer to your question. In the early days of Marx's writings,

17:53.120 --> 18:00.880
 and you know, his life spans the 19th century. He's born in 1818, dies in 1883, so literally

18:00.880 --> 18:08.720
 he lives the 19th century. And to make things simple, you might look at the first half of the

18:08.720 --> 18:17.680
 first two thirds of his life as overwhelmingly gathering together the precursors to his own work.

18:17.680 --> 18:24.160
 Marx was unusually scholarly in the sense that partly because he didn't work a regular job,

18:24.160 --> 18:29.920
 and partly because he was an exile in London most of his adult life, he worked in the library. I

18:29.920 --> 18:35.600
 mean, he had a lot of time. He got subsidized a little bit by Engels, whose family were

18:35.600 --> 18:42.240
 manufacturers. And you might say the first half to two thirds of his life are about

18:42.240 --> 18:51.520
 the critique of capitalism. And that was what, in a broad sense, the audience for his work,

18:52.080 --> 18:58.560
 Western Europe more or less, was interested in. That's what they wanted. And he gave that to them.

18:58.560 --> 19:06.720
 He wasn't the only one, but he was very, very effective at it. By the last third of his life,

19:06.720 --> 19:17.040
 he and the other producers of an anti capitalist movement, people like the Chartists in England,

19:17.040 --> 19:25.040
 that's a whole other movement, the anarchists of various kinds, like Proudhon in France,

19:25.600 --> 19:32.800
 or Kropotkin or Bakunin in Russia, and so on. You pull all these together, and there was a shift

19:32.800 --> 19:42.640
 in what the audience, let's call it a mixture of militant working class people on the one hand,

19:43.200 --> 19:49.120
 and critical or radical intelligentsia on the other. They now wanted a different question.

19:49.120 --> 19:56.560
 They were persuaded by the analysis. They were agreeable that capitalism was a phase they would

19:56.560 --> 20:03.920
 like to do better than. And the question became, how do we do this? Not anymore, should we? Why

20:03.920 --> 20:09.520
 should we? Could we maybe fix capitalism? No, they had gotten to the point, the system has

20:09.520 --> 20:16.160
 to be fundamentally changed. But they didn't go, you might imagine, they didn't go and say, well,

20:16.160 --> 20:21.520
 what will that new system looks like? They didn't go that way. What they did was ask the question,

20:21.520 --> 20:31.120
 how could we get beyond capitalism? It seems so powerful. It seems to have captured people's minds,

20:31.120 --> 20:39.360
 people's daily lives, and so on. And the focus of the conversation became, this was already

20:39.360 --> 20:46.640
 by the last third of the 19th century, the question of the agency, the mechanism whereby

20:46.640 --> 20:55.200
 we would get beyond. And again, make a long story short, the conversation focused on seizing the

20:55.200 --> 21:03.360
 government. Before that, the government was not a major interest. If you read Marx's Capital,

21:03.360 --> 21:09.440
 the great work of his maturity, three volumes, there's almost nothing in the state. He mentions

21:09.440 --> 21:16.480
 it, but he's interested in the details of how capitalism works, factory by factory, store by

21:16.480 --> 21:22.560
 store, office. What's the structure? The government's secondary for him. But there's also humans within

21:22.560 --> 21:29.040
 that capitalist system of, there's the working class. That's what he's interested in. He's

21:29.040 --> 21:34.960
 interested in each, think of it almost mechanically like the workplace. In the workplace there,

21:34.960 --> 21:40.720
 some people who do this and other people who do that, and they accept this division of authority,

21:40.720 --> 21:46.400
 and they accept this division of what's going on here, particularly because he believed that the

21:46.400 --> 21:53.280
 core economic objective of capitalism was to maximize something called profit, which his

21:53.280 --> 22:00.080
 analysis located right there in the workings of the enterprise. The government was not the

22:00.080 --> 22:08.160
 the key factor here. And he was looking at ideas of value. How much value does

22:08.160 --> 22:14.880
 the labor of the individual workers provide? And that means, how do we reward the workers in an

22:14.880 --> 22:22.560
 ethical way? And so those are the questions. But the government is not part of that picture.

22:23.200 --> 22:28.960
 So it's very significant that towards the end of the 19th century, Marx is still alive when this

22:28.960 --> 22:38.320
 begins, but it really gets going after he dies, is this debate among Marxists about the role of

22:38.320 --> 22:45.280
 the state. They all agreed, nearly all of them agree, that you have to get the state. The working

22:45.280 --> 22:54.560
 class has to get the state because they see the state as the ultimate guarantor of capitalism.

22:54.560 --> 23:01.600
 When things get really out of hand, the capitalist calls the police or he calls the army or both of

23:01.600 --> 23:11.040
 them. And so the government is in a sense this key institution captured in Marxist language

23:11.040 --> 23:18.160
 by the bourgeoisie, by the other side, the capitalists, and yet vulnerable because of

23:18.160 --> 23:25.920
 suffrage. If suffrage is universal or nearly so, if everybody gets a vote, which in a way

23:25.920 --> 23:32.640
 capitalism brings to bear, part of its rejection of feudalism in the French American Revolution

23:32.640 --> 23:41.040
 is to create a place where elected represented. So the government being subject to suffrage

23:41.040 --> 23:49.680
 creates the notion, aha, here's how we're gonna, we have to seize the state. And then that gets

23:49.680 --> 23:56.160
 agreed upon, but there's a big split as to how to do it. One side says you go with the election,

23:56.160 --> 24:04.480
 you mobilize the voter. That gets to be called reformism within Marxism. And the other side

24:04.480 --> 24:12.480
 is revolution. Don't do that. This system, if I may quote Bernie again, is rigged. You can't

24:12.480 --> 24:19.760
 get there. They've long ago learned how to manipulate parliaments. They buy the politicians

24:19.760 --> 24:25.760
 and all that, and therefore revolution is going to be the way to do it. Revolution

24:26.720 --> 24:32.400
 gets a very big boost because the Russians, they did it that way. They didn't do, I mean,

24:32.400 --> 24:39.440
 they fought in the Duma, in the Parliament, but they didn't. And this focus on the state,

24:39.440 --> 24:47.440
 I would argue, goes way beyond what the debaters at the time, and if you're interested in the great

24:47.440 --> 24:55.280
 names, there was a great theorist of the role of the state in a reformist strategy to get power

24:55.280 --> 25:04.480
 in Germany named Edward Bernstein. Very important. His opponents in Germany were Karl Kautsky and

25:04.480 --> 25:11.760
 Rosa Luxemburg, the two other huge figures in Marxism at the time, and they wrote the articles

25:11.760 --> 25:17.200
 that everybody reads, but it was a much broader debate. By the way, that debate still goes on.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.200
 Reformism versus revolution?

25:19.200 --> 25:24.800
 WOLFF Mhm. And in terms of not all that different. I mean, it's adjusted to history, but

25:24.800 --> 25:26.000
 in terms of different.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.640
 SIMON Can you comment on where you lean in terms of

25:31.200 --> 25:34.720
 the mechanism of progress, reformation versus revolution?

25:34.720 --> 25:36.480
 WOLFF I'd rather tell you the historical story.

25:36.480 --> 25:36.980
 SIMON Sure.

25:36.980 --> 25:40.000
 WOLFF Over and over and over again, in most cases,

25:40.560 --> 25:46.560
 the reformists have always won because revolution is frightening, is scary, is dangerous,

25:46.560 --> 25:52.000
 and so most of the time, when you get to the point where it's even a relevant discussion, not an

25:52.000 --> 25:58.320
 abstract thing for conferences, but a real strategic issue, the reformists have won.

25:58.320 --> 26:04.240
 I mean, and I'll give you an example from the United States. In the Great Depression of the

26:04.240 --> 26:11.760
 1930s, you had an extraordinary shift to the left in the United States, the greatest shift to the

26:11.760 --> 26:17.360
 United States, the greatest shift to the left in the country's history before or since, nothing

26:17.360 --> 26:28.000
 like it. Suddenly, you created a vast left wing composed of the labor movement, which went crazy

26:28.000 --> 26:33.680
 in the 1930s. We organized more people into unions in the 1930s than at any time before

26:33.680 --> 26:41.280
 or any time since. It is the explosion. And at the same time, the explosion of two socialist parties

26:41.280 --> 26:48.160
 and the Communist Party that became very powerful, and they all worked together, creating a very

26:48.160 --> 26:55.760
 powerful leftist presence in this country. They debated in a strategically real way reform or

26:55.760 --> 27:02.560
 revolution. The reformers were the union people, by and large, and the communists were the

27:02.560 --> 27:08.320
 revolutionaries, by and large, because they were affiliated with the Communist International,

27:08.320 --> 27:13.280
 with Russia and all of that. And in between, you might say, the two socialist parties,

27:13.280 --> 27:19.920
 one that was Trotskyist in inspiration and the other one more moderate Western European kind

27:19.920 --> 27:26.320
 of socialism. And they had this intense debate. And they ended up, the reformists won that debate.

27:26.320 --> 27:34.800
 There was no revolution in the 1930s here. But there was a reform that achieved unspeakably

27:34.800 --> 27:40.480
 great successes, which is why it was as strong and remains as strong as it does, because

27:40.480 --> 27:45.280
 it achieved in a few years, in the 1930s, starting around 1932,

27:45.280 --> 27:50.480
 three social security in this country. We had never had that before. That's the same one we

27:50.480 --> 27:57.440
 have now. Unemployment insurance never existed before that you have till today. Minimum wage

27:57.440 --> 28:03.280
 for the first time, still have that today. And a federal program of employment that hired 15

28:03.280 --> 28:09.440
 million people. I mean, these were unspeakable gifts, if you like, to the working class.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.120
 So that's the 30s and the 40s.

28:11.120 --> 28:18.560
 30s. Not much in the 40s anymore, but in the 30s. And here's the best part. It was paid for by taxes

28:18.560 --> 28:24.160
 on corporations and the rich. So when people today say, well, you can tax the government,

28:24.160 --> 28:32.160
 the joke is I have to teach American history to Americans because it has been erased from

28:32.160 --> 28:33.360
 consciousness.

28:33.360 --> 28:38.480
 We'll return to that. But first, let's take a stroll back to the beginning of the 20th century

28:38.480 --> 28:39.200
 with the Russians.

28:39.200 --> 28:43.920
 With the Russians. So their interpretation goes like this.

28:47.040 --> 28:52.640
 Everybody was right. The state is crucial. We were right. We were the revolutionaries.

28:52.640 --> 28:59.440
 We seized the state here in Russia. Now we have the state. And socialism

28:59.440 --> 29:06.480
 is when the working class captures the state, either by reform or revolution, and then uses

29:06.480 --> 29:12.880
 its power over the state to make the transition from capitalism to the better thing we're

29:12.880 --> 29:20.480
 going toward. And again, make a long story short, in the interest of time, what happens,

29:20.480 --> 29:26.640
 which is not unusual in human history, is that the means becomes the end.

29:26.640 --> 29:31.200
 In other words, Lenin, who's crystal clear before he died, you know, he doesn't live

29:31.200 --> 29:38.240
 very long, he dies in 23. So he's only in power from 17 to 22. By that time, he has

29:38.240 --> 29:39.120
 his brain trouble.

29:39.120 --> 29:42.000
 1923, by the way, not at age 23.

29:42.000 --> 29:47.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 1923. Yeah, he's only there for four or five years. He's very clear.

29:48.240 --> 29:53.440
 He even says, I've done work on that, I've published, so I know this stuff. He says in

29:53.440 --> 29:59.680
 a famous speech, let's not fool ourselves. We have captured the state, but we don't

29:59.680 --> 30:04.320
 have socialism. We have to create that. We have to move towards that.

30:06.880 --> 30:12.240
 With Stalin, you know, Lenin dies, and there's a fight between Stalin and Trotsky. Trotsky

30:12.240 --> 30:18.000
 loses the fight, he's exiled, he goes to Mexico. Stalin is now alone in power, does

30:18.000 --> 30:27.120
 all the things he's famous or infamous for. And by the end of the 20s, Stalin makes a

30:27.120 --> 30:32.560
 decision. I mean, not that he makes it alone, but things have evolved in Russia so that

30:32.560 --> 30:41.840
 they do the following. They declare that they are socialism. In other words, socialism becomes

30:41.840 --> 30:49.600
 when you capture the state. Not when the state capture has enabled you to do X, Y, Z, other

30:49.600 --> 30:57.600
 things. No, no. The state itself, once you have it, is socialism. So when a socialist

30:57.600 --> 31:04.960
 captures the state, that's socialism. Exactly. That's exactly right. I feel like that's

31:04.960 --> 31:10.160
 definitionally confusing. Well, it shouldn't be, because I'll give you an example. If

31:10.160 --> 31:15.520
 you go to many parts of the United States today, and you ask people, what's socialism?

31:16.160 --> 31:23.360
 They'll look you right in the face and they'll say, the post office. When I first heard this

31:23.360 --> 31:30.080
 as a young man, I go, what? The post office. It took me a while to understand. The post

31:30.080 --> 31:36.960
 office, Amtrak, the Tennessee, all the examples in the United States where the government

31:36.960 --> 31:45.840
 runs something. This is socialism. See, capitalism is if the government doesn't run it. If a

31:45.840 --> 31:52.000
 private individual who's not a government official runs it, well, then it's capitalism.

31:52.000 --> 31:58.880
 If the government takes it, then it's socialism. So what is wrong with that reasoning? So the

31:58.880 --> 32:04.160
 idea, I think... There's nothing wrong with it's a way of looking at the world. It's just

32:04.160 --> 32:09.280
 got nothing to do with Marx. Well, there's Marx, there's Marxism. Let's try to pull

32:09.280 --> 32:22.320
 this apart. So what role does central planning have in Marxism? So Marxism is concerned with

32:22.320 --> 32:31.760
 this class struggle, with respecting the working class. What is the connection between that

32:31.760 --> 32:36.800
 struggle and central planning that is often... Central planning is often associated with

32:36.800 --> 32:44.000
 Marxism. Right. So a centralized power doing... Russia did that. Allocation. So that has to

32:44.000 --> 32:49.600
 do with a very specific set of implementations initiated by the Soviet Union. Has nothing

32:49.600 --> 32:54.960
 to do with Marx. How else can you do... I don't think you can find anywhere in Marx's

32:54.960 --> 33:00.880
 writing anything about central planning or any other kind of planning. Again, fundamentally

33:00.880 --> 33:14.480
 then, Marx's work, it has to do with factories, with workers, with the bourgeoisie, and the

33:14.480 --> 33:20.080
 exploitation of the working class. Exactly. You still have to take that leap. What is

33:20.080 --> 33:28.000
 beyond capitalism? Right. So maybe we should turn to that, focus on that. Yes. Okay. We've

33:28.000 --> 33:34.240
 already looked historically at several attempts to go beyond capitalism. How else can we go

33:34.240 --> 33:40.000
 beyond capitalism? Right. Let me push a little further. They didn't succeed in my judgment

33:40.000 --> 33:46.880
 as a Marxist. And I'm now gonna tell you why they didn't succeed, because they didn't understand

33:46.880 --> 33:52.160
 as well as they could have or should have what Marxist was trying to do. I think I would

33:52.160 --> 33:55.360
 have been like them if I had lived at their time under their circumstances. This is not

33:55.360 --> 34:01.120
 a critique of them, but it's a different way of understanding what's going on. All right.

34:01.120 --> 34:09.840
 So give you an example. Most of my adult life I have taught Marxian economics. I'm a professor

34:09.840 --> 34:16.720
 of economics. I've been that all my life. I'm a graduate of American universities. As

34:16.720 --> 34:22.640
 it happens, I'm a graduate of what in this country passes for its best universities.

34:22.640 --> 34:29.440
 That's another conversation you and I can have. So I went to Harvard, then I went to

34:29.440 --> 34:35.600
 Stanford, and I finished at Yale. I'm like a poster boy for elite education. They tried

34:35.600 --> 34:42.160
 very hard. By the way, I spent 10 years of my life in the Ivy League, 20 semesters, one

34:42.160 --> 34:51.280
 after the other, no break. In those 20 semesters, 19 of them never mentioned a word about Marxism

34:51.280 --> 34:59.200
 that is no critique of capitalism was offered to me ever with one except one professor in

34:59.200 --> 35:05.360
 Stanford in the one semester I studied with him, he gave me plenty to read, but nobody

35:05.360 --> 35:09.520
 else. So that's really interesting. You've mentioned that in the past, and that's very

35:09.520 --> 35:18.560
 true, which makes you a very interesting figure to hold your ground intellectually through

35:18.560 --> 35:25.600
 this idea space where just people don't really even talk about it. Perhaps we can discuss

35:25.600 --> 35:31.360
 historically why that is, but nevertheless, that's the case. So Marxian economics, did

35:31.360 --> 35:35.040
 Karl Marx come up in conversation as a kind of...

35:36.080 --> 35:42.160
 Dismissal. The best example, yeah, he came up only as an object of dismissal. To give

35:42.160 --> 35:48.000
 you an example, the major textbook in economics that I was taught with, and that was for many

35:48.000 --> 35:54.800
 years the canonical book, it isn't quite anymore, was a book authored by a professor of economics

35:54.800 --> 36:03.200
 at MIT named Paul Samuelson, and a whole generation or two were trained on his textbook.

36:03.200 --> 36:10.480
 If you open the cover of his textbook, he has a tree, and the tree is Adam Smith and

36:10.480 --> 36:16.240
 David Ricardo at the root, and then the different branches of it. He's trying to give you an

36:16.240 --> 36:22.480
 idea as a student of how the thing developed. And it's a tree, and everybody on it is a

36:22.480 --> 36:27.760
 bourgeois. And then there's this one little branch that goes off like this and sort of

36:27.760 --> 36:33.040
 starts heading back down. That's Karl Marx. In other words, he had to have it complete

36:33.040 --> 36:38.720
 because he's not a complete faker, but beyond that, no, there was no. Nothing in the book

36:38.720 --> 36:47.520
 gives you two paragraphs of an approach. But that's Cold War. I mean, that's really neither

36:47.520 --> 36:52.080
 here. That's the craziness. Yeah, that's the Cold War in this country. My professors

36:52.080 --> 36:59.280
 were afraid. Anyway, let me get to the core of it, what I think will help. Marx was interested

36:59.280 --> 37:05.680
 in the relationship of people in the process of production. He's interested in the factory,

37:05.680 --> 37:12.800
 the office, the store, what goes on, and by that he means what are the relationships among

37:12.800 --> 37:22.320
 the people that come together in a workplace. And what he analyzes is that there is something

37:22.320 --> 37:31.760
 going on there that has not been adequately understood and that has not been adequately

37:31.760 --> 37:40.560
 addressed as an object needing transformation. And what does he mean? The answer is exploitation,

37:40.560 --> 37:48.080
 which he defines mathematically in the following way. Whenever in a society, any society,

37:48.800 --> 37:54.960
 you organize people, adults, not the children, not the sick, but, you know, healthy adults,

37:54.960 --> 38:03.120
 in the following way, a big block of them, a clear majority, work. That is, they use their

38:03.120 --> 38:09.920
 brains and their muscles to transform nature. A tree into a chair, a sheep into a woolen sweater,

38:09.920 --> 38:16.400
 whatever. In every human community, Marx argues, there are the people who do that work,

38:16.400 --> 38:25.120
 but they always produce more chairs, more sweaters, more hamburgers than they themselves consume,

38:25.120 --> 38:29.680
 whatever their standard of living. Doesn't have to be low, can be medium, can be high,

38:29.680 --> 38:38.200
 but they always produce more than they themselves consume. That more, by the way, Marx, when he

38:38.200 --> 38:44.960
 writes this, uses the German word mehr, m e h r, which is the English equivalent of more. It's the

38:44.960 --> 38:54.720
 more. That more got badly translated into the word surplus. Shouldn't have been, but it was. By the

38:54.720 --> 38:59.360
 way, by German and English people doing the translations. What's the difference between

38:59.360 --> 39:06.080
 more and surplus? Is there a nuanced? Yeah, because surplus has a notion of its discretionary,

39:06.080 --> 39:12.480
 it's sort of extra. He's not making a judgment that it's extra. It's a simple math equation.

39:12.480 --> 39:20.400
 Yes, very simple. One minus the other. Yes, x minus y. That's right. x is the total output,

39:20.400 --> 39:29.200
 y is the consumption by the producer, therefore x minus y equals s, the surplus. Exactly. Now, Marx

39:29.200 --> 39:38.400
 argues, the minute you understand this, you will ask the following question. Who gets the surplus?

39:38.400 --> 39:47.560
 Who gets this extra stuff that is made but not consumed by those who made it? And Marx's answer

39:47.560 --> 39:54.800
 is, therein lies one of the great shapers of any society. How is that organized? For example,

39:54.800 --> 40:03.440
 who gets it? What are they asked, if anything, to do with it in exchange for getting it? What's

40:03.440 --> 40:08.960
 their social role? For example, here we go now, if you get this and you get the core of it anyway,

40:10.640 --> 40:20.480
 and I don't charge much, the workers themselves could get it. The workers themselves could get

40:20.480 --> 40:28.960
 it. That's the closest Marx comes to a definition of communism. Communism would be if the workers

40:28.960 --> 40:38.160
 who produce the surplus together decide what to do with it. So this has to do not just with who gets

40:38.160 --> 40:43.840
 it, but more importantly, who gets to decide who gets it. Well, who gets it and who gets to decide

40:43.840 --> 40:49.440
 what to do with it. Right. Because you can't decide it if you don't have disposition over it.

40:49.440 --> 40:57.920
 So this is the logic of the word sequence. It's produced. Marx uses the word appropriated. In

40:57.920 --> 41:04.400
 other words, whose property, who gets to decide, if you like, what happens. All that property ever

41:04.400 --> 41:10.160
 meant is who gets to decide and who's excluded. That's a clean definition of communism.

41:10.160 --> 41:14.880
 Right. By the way, it's not just clean. This is the only one.

41:14.880 --> 41:19.360
 So can we just linger on the definition of exploitation in that context?

41:20.080 --> 41:27.600
 Easy. It becomes very easy. Exploitation exists if and when the surplus that's produced

41:27.600 --> 41:34.480
 is taken and distributed by people other than those who produced it. Slaves produce a surplus

41:34.480 --> 41:42.000
 which the master gets. Serfs produce a surplus which the lord gets. Employees produce a surplus

41:42.000 --> 41:52.000
 which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative class structures because one

41:52.000 --> 42:01.920
 class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another group of people, not the ones who

42:01.920 --> 42:10.320
 produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger, resentment, and all of the problems

42:10.320 --> 42:18.240
 you can lump under the heading class struggle. I use a metaphor, simple metaphorical story.

42:18.240 --> 42:23.440
 You have two children, let's assume, and you take them to Central Park a few blocks from here.

42:23.440 --> 42:29.440
 It's a nice day and the children are playing and in comes one of those men with an ice cream truck

42:29.440 --> 42:35.600
 comes by. Dingalingalingaling, your children see the ice cream. Daddy, get me an ice cream. So you

42:35.600 --> 42:41.520
 walk over, you take some money, and you get two ice cream cones and you give them to one of the

42:41.520 --> 42:49.040
 children. The other one begins to scream and yell and howl, obviously. What's the issue? And you

42:49.040 --> 42:55.520
 realize you've just made a terrible mistake. So you order the one you gave the two ice cream cones

42:55.520 --> 43:01.440
 to give one of those to your sister or your brother or whatever it is. And that's how you

43:01.440 --> 43:08.480
 solve the problem. Until a psychologist comes along and says, you know, you didn't fix it by

43:08.480 --> 43:16.160
 what you just did. You should never have done that in the first place. My response, so you understand,

43:17.040 --> 43:24.400
 all of the efforts to deal with inequality in economic, political culture, these are all

43:25.520 --> 43:30.560
 giving the ice cream cone back to the kid. You should never do this in the first place.

43:30.560 --> 43:34.080
 LW. The reallocation of resources creates bitterness in the populace.

43:34.080 --> 43:39.920
 RL. Look at Arva. This country is tearing itself apart now in a way that I have never seen in my

43:39.920 --> 43:45.360
 life, and I've lived here all my life, and I've worked here all my life. It's tearing itself

43:45.360 --> 43:53.520
 apart, and it's tearing itself apart basically over the redivision, the redistribution of wealth,

43:53.520 --> 43:59.840
 having so badly distributed in the first place. But that's all in Marx. And notice as I explain

43:59.840 --> 44:06.000
 to you what is going on in this tension filled production scene in the office, the factory,

44:06.000 --> 44:10.640
 the store. I don't have to say a word about the government. I'm not interested in the government.

44:10.640 --> 44:17.280
 The government's really a very secondary matter to this core question. And here comes the big point.

44:18.400 --> 44:25.520
 If you make a revolution and all you do is remove the private exploiter

44:25.520 --> 44:30.880
 and substitute a government official without changing the relationship,

44:32.640 --> 44:36.560
 you can call yourself a Marxist all day long, but you're not getting the point

44:36.560 --> 44:43.360
 of the Marxism. The point was not who the exploiter is, but the exploitation per se.

44:43.360 --> 44:49.040
 You've got to change the organization of the workplace so there isn't a group that makes all

44:49.040 --> 44:55.120
 the decisions and gets the surplus vis a vis another one that produces it. If you do that,

44:55.120 --> 45:01.760
 you will destroy the whole project. Not only will you not achieve what you set out to get,

45:01.760 --> 45:06.880
 but you'll so misunderstand it that the Germans again have a phrase,

45:06.880 --> 45:12.960
 es geht schief. It goes crooked. It doesn't go right. The project gets off the rails because

45:14.800 --> 45:19.600
 it can't understand either what its objective should have been, and therefore it doesn't

45:19.600 --> 45:25.760
 understand how and why it's missing its objective. It just knows that this is not what it had hoped

45:25.760 --> 45:33.520
 for. I mean there's a lot of fascinating questions here. So one is to what degree,

45:33.520 --> 45:42.160
 so there's human nature, to what degree does communism, a lack of exploitation of the working

45:42.160 --> 45:48.960
 class naturally emerge? If you leave two people together in a room and come back a year later,

45:48.960 --> 45:53.840
 if you leave five people together in a room, if you leave a hundred people and a thousand people,

45:54.480 --> 46:01.600
 it seems that humans form hierarchies naturally. So the clever, the charismatic,

46:02.560 --> 46:11.360
 the sexy, the muscular, the powerful, however you define that, starts becoming a leader and start to

46:11.360 --> 46:20.320
 do maybe exploitation in a nonnegative sense, a more generic sense, starts to become an employer,

46:20.960 --> 46:25.520
 not in a capitalist sense, but just as a human. Here, you go do this, and in exchange I will give

46:25.520 --> 46:32.080
 you this. Just becomes the leadership role, right? So the question is, yes, okay, it would be nice,

46:33.200 --> 46:37.680
 the idea sort of of communism would be nice to not steal from the world.

46:37.680 --> 46:41.680
 Nice in theory, but it doesn't work in practice because of human nature.

46:41.680 --> 46:48.320
 Because of human nature. That's, thank you. So what can we say about leveraging human nature

46:48.320 --> 46:52.240
 to achieve some of these ends? There's so many ways of responding,

46:53.280 --> 47:01.600
 in no particular order. Here are some of them. The history of the human race, as best I can tell,

47:01.600 --> 47:11.040
 is a history in which a succession of social forms, forms of society, arise,

47:13.360 --> 47:22.160
 and as they do, they rule out some kinds of human behavior on the grounds that they are socially

47:22.160 --> 47:30.160
 disruptive and unacceptable. The argument isn't really then, is there a need or an instinct,

47:30.160 --> 47:36.560
 is there some human nature that makes people want to do this? Well, whatever that is,

47:36.560 --> 47:42.800
 this has to be repressed or else we don't have a society. And Freud helps us to understand

47:43.520 --> 47:49.920
 that that repression is going on all the time and it has consequences. It's not a finished project,

47:49.920 --> 47:56.160
 you repress it, it's gone, it doesn't work like that. So for example, when you get a bunch of

47:56.160 --> 48:02.880
 people together at some point, they may develop animosities towards one another that lead them to

48:02.880 --> 48:10.480
 want the other person or persons to disappear, to be dead, to be gone. But we don't permit you to

48:11.040 --> 48:21.600
 do that. We just don't. Every economic system that has ever existed has included people who defend it

48:21.600 --> 48:29.920
 on the grounds that it is the only system consistent with human nature and that every

48:29.920 --> 48:37.040
 effort to go beyond it has to fail because it contradicts human nature. I can show you

48:37.040 --> 48:44.160
 endless documents of every tribal society I've ever studied, every anthropological community that

48:44.160 --> 48:50.400
 has ever been studied, slavery wherever it's existed. I can show you endless documents in

48:50.400 --> 48:56.800
 which the defenders of those systems, not all of them of course, but many defenders used that

48:56.800 --> 49:03.520
 argument. To naturalize a system is a way to hold on to it, to prevent it from going,

49:04.400 --> 49:11.440
 to counter the argument that every system is born, every system evolves, and then every system dies.

49:12.240 --> 49:19.360
 And therefore capitalism, since it was born and since it's been developing, we all know what the

49:19.360 --> 49:26.800
 next stage of capitalism is. The burden is on the people who think it isn't going to die.

49:26.800 --> 49:31.200
 Okay, so it doesn't mean they're wrong, but what you're saying is if we look at history,

49:31.840 --> 49:36.720
 you're deeply suspicious of the argument this is going against human nature because we keep

49:36.720 --> 49:42.160
 using that for basically everything including toxic relationship, toxic systems, destructive

49:42.160 --> 49:50.080
 systems. That said, well, let me just ask a million different questions. So one, what about

49:50.080 --> 50:01.120
 the argument that sort of the employer, the capitalist takes on risk versus the employee

50:01.120 --> 50:10.000
 who's just there doing the labor? The capitalist is actually putting up a lot of risk. Are they not

50:10.000 --> 50:14.400
 in sort of aggregating this organization and taking this giant effort, hiring a lot of people?

50:15.040 --> 50:20.480
 Aren't they taking on risk that this is going to be a giant failure? So first of all, there's risk

50:22.000 --> 50:28.400
 almost in everything you undertake. Any project that begins now and ends in the future takes a

50:28.400 --> 50:34.880
 risk that between now and that future something's going to happen that makes it not work out. I mean,

50:34.880 --> 50:42.080
 I got into a cab before I came here today. In order to do this with you, I took a risk. The cab

50:42.080 --> 50:46.400
 could have been in an accident. The lightning could have hit us. A bear could have eaten my

50:46.400 --> 50:51.200
 left foot. Who the hell knows? But shouldn't I reward you for the risk you took? No, hold it

50:51.200 --> 50:57.040
 a second. Let's do this step by step. So everybody's taking a risk. I always found it wonderful.

50:57.040 --> 51:03.040
 You talk about risk and then you imagine it's only some of us who take a risk. Let's go with

51:03.040 --> 51:12.160
 the worker, with the capitalist. That worker, he moved his family from Michigan to Pennsylvania to

51:12.160 --> 51:20.400
 take that job. He made a decision to have children. They are teenagers. They're now in school at a

51:20.400 --> 51:25.440
 time when their friendships are crucial to their development. You're going to yank them out of the

51:25.440 --> 51:35.200
 school because his job is gone. He took an enormous risk to do that job every day, to forestall all

51:35.200 --> 51:41.920
 the other things he could have done. He was taking a risk that this job would be here tomorrow, next

51:41.920 --> 51:48.720
 month, next year. He bought a house, which Americans only do with mortgages, which means he's

51:48.720 --> 51:57.120
 now stuck. He has to make a monthly payment. If you make a mistake, you capitalist. He's the one

51:57.120 --> 52:00.480
 who's going to, you're a capitalist. You got a lot of money. Otherwise, you wouldn't be in that

52:00.480 --> 52:08.400
 position. You've got a cushion. He doesn't. If you investigate, you'll see that in every business

52:08.400 --> 52:11.920
 I've ever been in. I've been involved in a lot of them. So you think it's possible to actually

52:11.920 --> 52:17.360
 measure risk or is your basic argument is there's risk involved in a lot of both the working class

52:17.360 --> 52:23.040
 and the bourgeoisie, the capitalists. That's right. And the worker would never come and say,

52:23.760 --> 52:31.680
 because he's been taught right, I want this payment, a wage for the work I do.

52:32.560 --> 52:39.200
 And I want this page, this payment for the risk I take. Well, there's some level of communication

52:39.200 --> 52:44.640
 like that. You have acknowledgement of dangerous jobs, but that's probably built into the salary,

52:44.640 --> 52:49.840
 all those kinds of things. But you're not incorporating the full spectrum of risk.

52:50.720 --> 52:57.680
 You don't believe that. This country is now being literally transformed from below by an army of

52:57.680 --> 53:04.800
 workers who work at Amazon, fast food joints. You know what their complaint is? It's killing us.

53:05.760 --> 53:13.520
 We get paid shit and it's killing us. There is no relationship except in the minds of the defenders

53:13.520 --> 53:21.120
 of capitalism between the ugliness, the difficulty, the danger of labor on the one hand and the wage.

53:21.120 --> 53:25.840
 Let me give you just a couple of examples. This is my job. This is my life, what I do.

53:26.880 --> 53:33.520
 The median income of a child care worker in the United States right now, as we speak,

53:33.520 --> 53:45.520
 is $11.22 an hour median. So 50% make less, 50% make more. The median income for car park attendant

53:46.480 --> 53:53.440
 is several dollars per hour higher than that. What does the car park attendant do? He stares at your

53:53.440 --> 54:02.080
 car for many hours to make sure that nobody comes and grabs it. Maybe he parks it and he moves it

54:02.080 --> 54:08.800
 and he moves it around to get it in and out. By any measure that I know of that makes any rational

54:08.800 --> 54:16.320
 sense, being in charge of toddlers, two, three, four year olds who are at the key moment of

54:16.320 --> 54:23.200
 mental formation the first five years, to give that a lower salary than you give the guy who

54:23.200 --> 54:31.120
 watches your car. Come on, I know how to explain it. Gender explains all kinds of issues that the

54:31.120 --> 54:37.360
 car park people are males and the day the child care people are females. And that in our culture

54:37.360 --> 54:44.560
 is a very big marker of what, but the one who said only the economics professor, nobody else

54:45.600 --> 54:50.160
 says this stuff because in economics, I don't know if you were familiar with our profession, but

54:50.160 --> 54:58.320
 we have something which we call marginal product. This is a fantasy. I was a mathematician. Before

54:58.320 --> 55:05.040
 I became an economist, I loved mathematics. I specialized in mathematics. So I know mathematics

55:05.040 --> 55:11.120
 pretty well. What economists do is silly, is childish, but they think it's mathematics.

55:13.840 --> 55:22.480
 But think for a minute what it means to suggest that you can identify the marginal product

55:22.480 --> 55:29.680
 of a factor of production, like a worker. In the textbook when it's taught, I've taught this stuff.

55:30.240 --> 55:35.040
 I hold my nose, but I teach it. Then I explain to students what I've just taught you is

55:35.040 --> 55:39.360
 horse shit, but first I teach it. What is the marginal product if it might be useful?

55:39.360 --> 55:46.320
 The notion is if you take away one worker right now from the pile, what will be the diminution

55:46.320 --> 55:53.840
 of the output? That's the marginal product of that worker measured by the amount of the output

55:54.240 --> 56:01.280
 that diminishes output of the raw product of the product. Usually in real terms or physical,

56:01.280 --> 56:05.360
 not the value. You could do a value, but it's really more the physical you're at.

56:05.360 --> 56:11.840
 I mean, there is a transformation thing. I'd love to talk to you about value. It's so interesting.

56:11.840 --> 56:16.800
 What is value? I'd be glad to talk to you about value and price and all of that,

56:16.800 --> 56:23.040
 but I just want to get to this. Hegel, who was Marx's teacher, has a famous line.

56:23.680 --> 56:30.400
 You can't step in the same river twice. The argument is you and the river have changed

56:30.400 --> 56:34.560
 between the first and the second time. It's a different you and it's a different river.

56:34.560 --> 56:39.440
 You can choose not to pay attention to that. You can't claim you're not doing that.

56:39.440 --> 56:44.960
 You can't claim that you can actually do that because you can't. There is no way to do that.

56:44.960 --> 56:49.840
 So the meaning that you can't just remove a worker and have a clean

56:49.840 --> 56:52.480
 mathematical calculation of the effect that it has on the output.

56:52.480 --> 56:57.200
 That's right, because too many other things are going on, too many things are changing,

56:57.200 --> 57:05.600
 and you cannot assume, much as you want to, that the outcome on the output side is uniquely

57:05.600 --> 57:10.160
 determined by the change you made on the input side. You can't do that.

57:10.160 --> 57:14.000
 Even in the average, it's not going to work out.

57:14.000 --> 57:20.640
 You can take, look, mathematics is full of abstractions. You can say, as we do in economics,

57:20.640 --> 57:27.360
 keteris paribus, everything else held constant, but you have to know what you just did. You know

57:27.360 --> 57:31.840
 why you do that? Because you can't do that in the real world. That's not possible. You better

57:31.840 --> 57:39.280
 account for that, otherwise you're mistaking the abstraction from the messy reality you abstracted

57:39.280 --> 57:46.240
 from to get the abstraction. As a quick tangent, if we somehow went through a thought experiment

57:46.240 --> 57:51.360
 or an actual experiment of removing every single economist from the world, would we be better off

57:51.360 --> 57:57.920
 or worse off? Much better off. Okay. Economics, and I'm one, you know, I'm talking about myself.

57:57.920 --> 58:03.920
 We're going to ship all the economists to Mars and see how well it works off.

58:03.920 --> 58:12.640
 The serious part of this is that economics, it's really about capitalism. Economics as a

58:12.640 --> 58:18.080
 discipline is born with capital. There was no such thing. I teach courses at the university,

58:18.080 --> 58:24.480
 for example, called History of Economic Thought. I begin the students with Aristotle and Plato.

58:24.480 --> 58:30.000
 And I say, you know, they talked about really interesting things, but they never called it

58:30.000 --> 58:40.400
 economics. It made no sense to people to abstract something as central to daily life as economics

58:40.400 --> 58:46.400
 broadly defined. It made no sense. That's a creation much, much later. That's capitalism

58:46.400 --> 58:52.000
 that did that, created the field. So when I give them Plato and Aristotle, I have to give them

58:52.000 --> 58:58.960
 particular passages. By the way, footnote, because your audience will like it. Plato and Aristotle

58:58.960 --> 59:04.880
 talked about markets because they lived at a time in ancient Greece when market relations were

59:04.880 --> 59:12.720
 beginning to intrude upon these societies. So they were both interested in this phenomena,

59:12.720 --> 59:18.160
 that we're not just producing goods and then distributing among us. We're doing it in a quid

59:18.160 --> 59:22.720
 pro quo. You know, I'll give you three oranges, you give me two shirts, a market exchange.

59:23.440 --> 59:29.360
 And both Aristotle and Plato hated markets, denounced them, and for the same reason,

59:29.920 --> 59:36.240
 they destroy social cohesion. They destroy community. They make some people rich and

59:36.240 --> 59:41.360
 other people poor, and they set us against each other, and it's terrible. And here's what

59:41.360 --> 59:46.720
 that they agreed on that. Here's what they disagreed on. One of them said, okay, there

59:46.720 --> 59:53.920
 can be no markets. That was Plato. Aristotle comes back and says, no, no, no, no, no, too late for

59:53.920 --> 1:00:00.800
 that. The disruption caused in society by getting rid of this institution that has crawled in

1:00:00.800 --> 1:00:09.760
 amongst us would be too devastating. So we can't do that. But what we can do is control it, regulate

1:00:09.760 --> 1:00:16.880
 it, get from the market what it does reasonably well, and prevent it from doing the destructive

1:00:16.880 --> 1:00:23.680
 things it does so badly. So the fundamentally the destructive thing of a market is it's the

1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:32.960
 engine of capitalism, so it creates exploitation of the worker. It facilitates it, and it is an

1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:40.880
 institution that Plato and Aristotle feel is a terrible danger to community. Which, by the way,

1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:44.640
 is a way of thinking about it that exists right now all over the world.

1:00:45.360 --> 1:00:50.800
 Look, the medieval Catholic Church had a doctrine, the prohibition of usury.

1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:59.360
 You know, and this was that God said, if there's a person who needs to borrow from you,

1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:07.360
 then that's a person in need. And the good Christian thing to do is to help him. To demand

1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:15.440
 an interest payment rather than to help your fellow man is, God hates you for that. That's a sin.

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:19.680
 Jesus is crying all the way to wherever it is he goes.

1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:26.080
 But would Jesus be crying when you try to scale that system? So that has to do with the

1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:31.440
 with the intimate human interaction. The idea of markets is you're able

1:01:33.360 --> 1:01:40.080
 to create a system that involves thousands, millions of humans, and there'd be some level of

1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:45.760
 safe, self regulating fairness.

1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:52.160
 There might be, but it's hard to imagine that charging interest would be the way to do that.

1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:53.840
 I wonder what, so I guess...

1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:59.120
 Suppose you were interested in having, suppose you took us your problem.

1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:02.480
 We have a set of funds that can be loaned out.

1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:11.040
 People don't want to consume it. They're ready to lend it. Okay. To whom should they lend it?

1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:16.480
 Well, we could say in our society, we're going to run this the way professors

1:02:16.480 --> 1:02:24.080
 in institutions like MIT work this. They write up a project. They send the project into some

1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:31.360
 government office where it is looked at against other projects. And this office in the government

1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:38.400
 decides we're going to fund this one and that one because they're more needed in our society.

1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:43.760
 We're in greater need of solving this problem than that problem. And so we're going to lend

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:49.280
 money to people working on this problem more readily or more money than we lend over here,

1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:54.320
 because we're going to, but instead what we do is, who can pay the highest interest rate?

1:02:55.440 --> 1:03:02.800
 Whoa, what are you doing? What ethics would justify you doing? It's like a market in general.

1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:08.080
 Something is in shortage. All markets are about how to handle shortage. That's one

1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:14.480
 basic way to understand it. And so if the demand is greater than the supply, which is all the word

1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:20.480
 shortage means, has no other meaning, if the demand is greater than the supply, okay, now you've got

1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:27.600
 a problem. You can't satisfy all the demanders because you don't have enough supply. You have

1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:32.960
 a shortage. Okay, now how are you going to do it? In a market, you allow people who have a lot of

1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:40.480
 money to bid up the price of whatever's short, and that solves your problem because as the price goes

1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:47.120
 up, the poor people, they drop out. They can't buy the thing at the exalted price, so you've got a

1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:53.680
 way of distributing the shortage. It goes to the people with the most money. At this point, most

1:03:53.680 --> 1:04:00.080
 human beings confronted with this explanation of a market would turn against it because it

1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:07.600
 contradicts their Christian, Judaic, Islamic, all of them would say, what? You know what that means?

1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:13.440
 It means that a rich person can get the scarce milk and give it to their cat, while the poor

1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:19.440
 person has no milk for their five children. There it is. You want a market? Why?

1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:25.760
 The fundamental thing that seems unfair, there's the resulting inequality. Now...

1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:26.800
 Or death.

1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:30.560
 Or death. Well, that's the ultimate inequality.

1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:31.200
 Yes, it is.

1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:36.480
 What about, and we're going to jump around from the philosophical, from the economics,

1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:44.800
 to the sort of debate type of thing. What about sort of the lifting ties raise all boats?

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:53.360
 Meaning, if we look at the 20th century, a lot of people, maybe you disagree with this,

1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:59.680
 but they attribute a lot of the innovation and the average improvement in the quality of life

1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:07.840
 to capitalism, to inventions and innovation, to engineering and science developments

1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:17.360
 that resulted from competition and all those kinds of forces. So, not looking at the individual

1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:24.800
 unfairness of exploitation as it's specifically defined, but just observing historically.

1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:28.880
 Looking at the 20th century, we came up with a lot of cool stuff that seemed to have made life

1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:34.240
 easier and better on average. What do you say to that?

1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:42.880
 I have several responses to that, but I do disagree pretty fundamentally with what's

1:05:42.880 --> 1:05:47.600
 going on there. But let me give you the arguments so that you can hear them,

1:05:47.600 --> 1:05:52.560
 and then you can evaluate them, as can anybody who's listening or watching.

1:05:56.160 --> 1:06:01.600
 Marx was a student of Hegel, and one of Hegel's central arguments was that everything that

1:06:01.600 --> 1:06:09.760
 exists exists, quote, in contradiction. In simple English, there's a good and bad side,

1:06:09.760 --> 1:06:15.040
 if you like, to everything. And you won't understand it unless you accept that proposition

1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:20.160
 and start looking for the good things that are the other side of the bad ones, and the bad things

1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:26.320
 that are the other side of the good ones, etc. So, the dialectic. Yes, exactly. And Marx,

1:06:26.320 --> 1:06:33.200
 very attentive to that, explicitly agrees with this on many occasions, and applies it,

1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:41.040
 of course, to the central object of his research, capitalism. So, this is not a simple minded fellow

1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:45.840
 who's telling you all the bad things about capitalism as if there were nothing that this

1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:53.760
 system achieved or accomplished. And one of the things he celebrates a lot is the technological

1:06:53.760 --> 1:07:00.800
 dynamism of the system, which Marx takes to be profound, because, you know, he lived at the time

1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:08.800
 when major breakthroughs in textile technology and mining and chemistry and so on were achieved.

1:07:10.800 --> 1:07:18.080
 But as to the notion that capitalism is therefore responsible for the improvement in

1:07:18.800 --> 1:07:23.920
 the quality or the standard of living of the mass of people, Marx now comes back and says,

1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:35.600
 oh wait, wait a minute here. Number one, capitalism as a system has been mostly represented by

1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:43.440
 capitalists, which makes a certain sense. And those capitalists, with very few exceptions,

1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:51.840
 some but very few, have fought against every effort to improve the lives of the mass of people.

1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:58.400
 The goal of a capitalist is to minimize labor costs. What that means is replace a worker with

1:07:58.400 --> 1:08:07.200
 a machine, move the production from expensive U.S. to cheap China, bring in desperate immigrants from

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:11.520
 other parts of the world, because they will work for less money than the folks that you have here

1:08:11.520 --> 1:08:18.240
 at home. Every measure to help the standard of living of American workers had to be fought for,

1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:25.600
 had to be fought for, for decades over the opposition of capitalists from the beginning

1:08:26.160 --> 1:08:32.080
 to right now. The reason we have a minimum wage, which was passed in the middle of the 1930s,

1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:38.160
 when it was proposed, it was blocked by capitalists. They got together. And today,

1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:45.520
 just a factoid for you, the last time the minimum wage was raised in the United States,

1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:55.680
 federal minimum wage, was in 2009, when it was set at the lofty sum of $7.25 an hour,

1:08:56.240 --> 1:09:03.920
 which you cannot live on. Over the last 12 years or so, whatever it is now, 11, 12, 13 years

1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:10.640
 since then, we have had an increase in the price level in this country every year. And in the last

1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:18.320
 year, 8.5%. During that time that the prices went up, the minimum wage was never raised.

1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:31.520
 What? This is a time of stock market boom, of growing inequality. This is the nerve of the

1:09:31.520 --> 1:09:39.360
 defender of capitalists, who wants now to get credit for the improvement in the standard of

1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:45.040
 life of the workers that was fought by every generation. You know, it takes your breath away.

1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:53.120
 It's an argument. Whoa. But I take my hat off if I had one, because that is one of the only ways

1:09:53.120 --> 1:10:02.160
 to justify this system. Long ago—let me get to the heart of it—long ago, capitalism could have

1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:10.640
 overcome hunger, could have overcome disease, could have, I mean, way beyond what we have now,

1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:19.760
 but it didn't. And that's the worst moral condemnation imaginable. How do you justify

1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:27.360
 that when you could, you didn't? Look, let me get at it another way, because this may

1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:35.440
 interest you anyway. The issue is not that capitalism isn't technologically dynamic.

1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:41.840
 It is. And along the way, it has developed things that have helped people's lives get better. No

1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:50.560
 question. But the notion that the mass enjoyment of a rising standard of living is somehow built

1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:59.360
 into capitalism is factually nuts and is such an outrageous—and I can give you a—because

1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:05.840
 you do math, you'll understand it. Think of it this way. Imagine a production process in which

1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:13.120
 you have $100 that the capitalist has to lay out for tools, equipment, and raw materials,

1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:20.080
 and $100 that he has to lay out for workers, hire the workers. And he puts them all together,

1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:26.880
 and he has an output. And let's say the output is 100 units of something, or whatever the price is,

1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:35.040
 and that's his revenue. And when he takes his product and sells it and gets the revenue,

1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:42.400
 let's say the revenue is—it doesn't really matter—it's $120, for lack of a better word.

1:11:42.400 --> 1:11:49.520
 And he takes $100 of it and replaces the tools, equipment, and raw materials he used up,

1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:54.240
 another $100 to hire the workers for the next shift, and the other $20 is his profit,

1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:58.800
 and he puts that aside. Now along comes a technological breakthrough,

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:04.480
 a machine, a new machine. And the new machine is so effective,

1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:13.920
 you can get the same number of units of output with half the workers. So you don't need to spend

1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:20.400
 $100 on workers. You only need to spend $50. You can do it with half the workers. And so the

1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:25.360
 capitalist goes to the workers—by the way, this happens every day—and he says to half of them,

1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:31.280
 you're fired. Don't come back Monday morning. I don't need you. It's nothing personal. I got a

1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:38.880
 machine. Why does he do that? Because of the $50 he now no longer has to spend on labor, because

1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:44.640
 he doesn't need half of them. He keeps. Everything else is the same. The machine, everything else is

1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:52.800
 just to make the math easy. So he keeps as his own profit the $50 that before he paid for those

1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:58.480
 workers. Because when he sells it for $220, that $50 he doesn't have to give to the next

1:12:58.480 --> 1:13:06.880
 job because he has a new machine. So that's what he does. The technology leads. He's happy. He's

1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:13.120
 become more profitable. He's got an extra $50, which is why he buys the machine. The workers

1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:20.640
 are screwed. Half of them just lost their job, have to go home to their husband and wife,

1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:25.280
 tell them I don't have a job anymore. I didn't do anything wrong. The guy was nice enough to

1:13:25.280 --> 1:13:31.600
 say it was nothing wrong with me, but he doesn't need it. So I'm completely screwed here. I don't

1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:36.240
 know what I'm going to do about the debts we have, the house on mortgage, my children's education,

1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:43.040
 or whatever else he's got going for himself. Now the point. There was, of course, an alternative

1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:49.440
 path. The alternative path would have been to keep all the workers, pay them exactly the same that

1:13:49.440 --> 1:13:58.160
 you did before, for half a day's work. You would have got the same output, same revenue, same

1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:06.560
 profit as before. But the gain of the technology would have been a half a day of freedom every day

1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:15.360
 of the lives of these workers. The majority of workers would have been really helped by this

1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:23.280
 technology. But instead they were screwed so that one guy, the employer, could make a big bundle of

1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:30.880
 more money. You want to support a system like this? Well, to go back to Hegel, the good and the bad.

1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:37.360
 So you just listed the bad and you also first listed the good, the technological innovation

1:14:37.360 --> 1:14:44.080
 of this kind of system. The question is the alternative, whatever, as we try to sneak up to

1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:48.880
 ideas of what the alternative might look like, what are the good and the bad of the alternative?

1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:56.800
 So you just kind of, as a opposite, by contrast, showed that, well, a nice alternative is you work

1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:06.720
 less, get paid the same, you have more leisure time, opportunity to pursue other interests,

1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:15.920
 the creative interests, family, flourish as a human being, basically strengthen and embolden

1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:26.880
 the basic humanity that's under all of us. Yes. But then what cost does that have on the deadline

1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:36.080
 fueled, competition fueled machine of technological innovation that is the positive side of capitalism?

1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:37.360
 Slows it down.

1:15:37.360 --> 1:15:44.080
 It slows it down. And the question is which is more important for the flourishing of humanity?

1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:52.240
 I agree with that. And I'd love there to be a democratic mechanism. So let's discuss it,

1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:57.360
 let's debate it, and then let's decide what mixture, because it's not either or,

1:15:57.360 --> 1:16:03.600
 the math problem I gave you is either or, we could mix it. You could have a third less of a working

1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:08.000
 day instead of a half less, and then the other part would be extra profit for our employer,

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:16.400
 etc. etc. So let's have a democratic discussion of what is the mix between the positive, and we have

1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:22.880
 no such thing. All of this is decided by one side in this debate, which not only, we know what they

1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:27.520
 do, they always choose the one that maximizes their profit because that's what they were told

1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:34.160
 to do in business school where I've taught. So not only is it an undemocratic decision,

1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:40.720
 but it's lopsided to boot. So we don't have the opportunity, but I would love for us to be good

1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:46.720
 Hegelian Marxists and say, let's take a look at the plus and the minus and make the best decision

1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:53.280
 that we can. We'll make mistakes, but we'll all make them together. It won't be one of us making

1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:59.360
 a dictatorial decision. You know, Marx developed the notion of the dictatorship of the proletariat,

1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:09.840
 not as a notion of how government works, but as a notion of what the practical reality is.

1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:16.640
 The dictatorship in these key decisions is not made by some sitting council, it's made by each

1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:22.800
 little capitalist in his or her relationships with the workers in the workplace, which is why Marx

1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:28.560
 focused his analysis on that point. And by the way, I can sketch for you right now so it doesn't

1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:34.080
 lurk in the background what the alternative is. Let's go there. Okay. It goes right back to what

1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:42.480
 I said earlier. The workers themselves, the collection of employees together appropriate

1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:51.920
 their own surplus and decide democratically what to do with it, which includes the decision of

1:17:51.920 --> 1:18:01.040
 whether or not to buy a machine and whether or not to use the machine and the savings it might allow

1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:12.160
 to be handled by more leisure for themselves or as a fund for new developments in technology or

1:18:12.160 --> 1:18:20.720
 new products or whatever they want. And you know, this is an old idea in humans. Marx loved that.

1:18:20.720 --> 1:18:27.760
 Toward the end of his life, he started reading extensively in anthropology. And one of the

1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:33.520
 reasons he did that toward the end of his life was because he kept discovering that in this

1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:40.560
 society and that one, including here in the United States, that there were examples of people who

1:18:40.560 --> 1:18:50.000
 organized their production in precisely this way, as a collective democratic community in which

1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:56.080
 everybody had an equal voice. So we all together decide democratically what to produce, how to

1:18:56.080 --> 1:19:03.680
 produce, where to produce, and what to do with the output we all help to produce. So let's do it in,

1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:13.360
 you know, in this country where democracy is a value nearly everybody subscribes to.

1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:20.400
 Think about it this way, the stunning contradiction that there is a place in our society

1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:28.080
 where democracy has never been allowed to enter. The workplace. In the workplace, a tiny group of

1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:35.040
 people, unaccountable to the rest of us, the employer, whether that's an individual, a family,

1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:43.040
 a partnership, or a corporate board of directors, tiny group of people controls economically a vast

1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:49.520
 mass of employees. Those employees don't elect those people, have no nothing. There is no

1:19:49.520 --> 1:19:56.960
 accountability. It is the most undemocratic arrangement imaginable. And this society

1:19:56.960 --> 1:20:04.000
 insists on calling itself democratic when it has organized the minor matter of producing

1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:11.440
 everything in a way that is the direct, it's autocratic. So to push back on a few things.

1:20:11.440 --> 1:20:18.400
 So one is the idea of this society calling itself democratic is that the government is elected

1:20:18.400 --> 1:20:24.160
 democratically and the government is able to pressure the workplace through the process of

1:20:24.160 --> 1:20:31.040
 regulation. You pass laws of the boundaries of how, you know, minimum wage, all those kinds of things.

1:20:31.040 --> 1:20:37.360
 That's the one idea. The other is there is a natural force within the capitalist when there's

1:20:37.360 --> 1:20:43.680
 no monopolies of competition being the accountability. So if you're a shitty boss,

1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:50.880
 the employee in the capitalist system has the freedom to move to another company, work for a

1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:56.880
 better boss. So that creates pressure on the employers and the bosses. That's at least the idea

1:20:56.880 --> 1:21:05.440
 that there's two boundaries of you not misbehaving. One is the law, so regulations

1:21:05.440 --> 1:21:11.600
 passed by the government, democratic. And the second is because there's always alternatives,

1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:16.960
 in theory, then that puts pressure on everyone to behave well because you can always leave.

1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:24.960
 So, I mean, that's kinds of accountability. But what you're saying is that does not result

1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:32.720
 in a significant enough accountability for the employer that avoids exploitation of the worker.

1:21:32.720 --> 1:21:39.040
 WOLFF Absolutely. I mean, whatever accountability you get in those mechanisms. And let me respond

1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:48.560
 to that and then I'll counterargument. First, competition. Here again, we have to be Hegelians

1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:56.880
 just a little. Competition destroys itself. It doesn't need any—the whole point of competition

1:21:56.880 --> 1:22:02.960
 is to beat the other guy. If I can produce the same product as the other guy, either a better

1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:08.720
 quality or a lower price or maybe both, then I win because the customers will come to me

1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:12.880
 because my price is lower or my quality is better, and they'll leave the other guy,

1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:17.360
 he'll go out of business. Now, let's follow. When he goes out of business, because I've won

1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:25.200
 the competition, he fires his workers. I hire them because I'm now going to be able to serve a market

1:22:25.200 --> 1:22:33.360
 he can't serve anymore. So I'm going to buy the used equipment, and thereby many become few.

1:22:34.400 --> 1:22:41.360
 Monopoly is the product of competition. It's not the antithesis, it's the product.

1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:43.520
 LAROI Well, let's see.

1:22:43.520 --> 1:22:44.720
 WOLFF That's where it comes from.

1:22:44.720 --> 1:22:48.880
 LAROI There's another element to the system where there's always a new guy that comes in.

1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:51.600
 WOLFF There isn't. There isn't.

1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:58.800
 LAROI Well, that's the dream. The entrepreneurial spirit of the United States,

1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:07.200
 for example, of a capitalist system is you can be broke and one day have a strong idea and build

1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:14.880
 up a business that takes on Google and Facebook and Twitter and all the different car, Ford, GM,

1:23:14.880 --> 1:23:20.400
 which is what you look at Tesla, for example. That's the American dream. One of the many

1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:30.960
 ideals of the American dream is you can move from dirt poor to being the richest person in the world.

1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:31.440
 WOLFF Right.

1:23:31.440 --> 1:23:33.680
 LAROI It can happen.

1:23:33.680 --> 1:23:34.480
 WOLFF It can happen.

1:23:34.480 --> 1:23:37.520
 WOLFF You know what that's like? That's like you can win a lottery.

1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:42.240
 LAROI No, that's not quite. No, the lottery is complete luck. Here,

1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:44.320
 you can work your ass off if you have a good idea.

1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:46.080
 WOLFF The odds are better in the lottery.

1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:49.840
 LAROI That's not true. There's a lot of new businesses.

1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:52.080
 WOLFF How many Teslas do you know?

1:23:52.080 --> 1:23:54.080
 LAROI Tesla is a really bad example because the car

1:23:54.080 --> 1:24:03.200
 company, the automotive sector is so difficult. They operate at such a thin margin of profit.

1:24:03.920 --> 1:24:10.800
 They're probably a good example of capitalism just completely coming to a halt in terms of

1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:16.880
 lack of innovation. That's a very complicated industry because of the supply chain.

1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:23.280
 WOLFF Come on. They have their uniqueness as you're quite right, but so does every other

1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:29.200
 industry. The one thing that's common is that many become few. What you can also have is when you

1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:36.080
 have a few, they jack up the price. They make an enormous profit. In the irony of capitalism,

1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:42.480
 Marx would love this, they begin to incentivize people to break into this industry because the

1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:49.520
 few remaining are making a wild amount of profit because they are a few and can jigger the market

1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:58.320
 to make it work like that for them. The reason every small capitalist is trying to build market

1:24:58.320 --> 1:25:04.320
 share—that's a polite way of saying they want to become a monopolist or to be more exact,

1:25:04.320 --> 1:25:09.600
 an oligopolist, one of a handful of firms that dominates. That's what they're there for.

1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:16.160
 PEDRO But yeah, to push back a little bit also, because this is a question also,

1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:22.960
 do you think we're in danger of oversimplifying capitalism that completely removes the basic

1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:34.240
 decency of human beings? If you give me a choice to press a button to get rid of the competition,

1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:38.080
 but that's going to lead to a lot of suffering, there's a lot of people at the heads of companies

1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:43.520
 that won't press that button. That it's not in the calculation, it's not just money,

1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:47.680
 it's human well being too. So like—

1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:48.240
 PEDRO You think?

1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:50.400
 PEDRO Yes.

1:25:50.400 --> 1:25:53.360
 PEDRO You and I don't live in the same place then.

1:25:53.360 --> 1:25:56.320
 PEDRO So you're saying that the forces of capitalism

1:25:56.320 --> 1:26:01.840
 take over the minds of the people at the top, and then they cease being human.

1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:02.640
 PEDRO No.

1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:07.040
 PEDRO Depending on your model of humans.

1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:08.000
 PEDRO Yeah.

1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.560
 PEDRO They lose track of the better angels of their nature,

1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:15.520
 and they just become cogs in the machine, but they just happen to be the cock at the top.

1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:20.080
 PEDRO I would put it differently. The system is so set up, it's a little bit like natural

1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:26.320
 selection. The guys who may—I could say the women too, it doesn't matter—the people who make it up

1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:32.240
 through the layers of the bureaucracy and get to the top in these things have had to do things along

1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:38.400
 the way that become selective. If they can't stand it because they have that human quality—and there

1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:45.760
 are people, I've known them—they're the ones running an Airbnb in Vermont. They went there and

1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:49.760
 they said, I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not going to treat people like that. I'm going to

1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:56.000
 make a lovely place in Vermont with my husband or my wife or whatever, and I'm going to be enjoying

1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:04.480
 the people that come by and be a decent—of course, of course. But the system selects the firm. If you

1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:10.400
 don't do what has to be done to make the profit go up, you're toast there anyway. The rest of the

1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:15.120
 people who vote for you are going to kick you out. You can tell them all day long what a lovely

1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:19.360
 person you are. Then they're going to look at you and wonder what happened to you. How did you even

1:27:19.360 --> 1:27:25.520
 get this far with the lovely person horseshoe? RL It's not necessarily just a lovely person.

1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:34.240
 So maybe my—I'll just say my bias is the people I know are, especially at the top of companies,

1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:44.480
 are in the tech sector where innovation is such a big part of it. So I think a lot of the things

1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:49.840
 we're talking about is when there's not much innovation in the system. So—

1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:56.480
 RL Innovation usually comes—in the history of capitalism, innovation comes in spurts.

1:27:56.480 --> 1:28:01.680
 There's the electric period, the chemistry period, the nuclear period. There's now whatever you want

1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:08.720
 to call it, the artificial intelligence or robotics or computer. It comes, and then there's a flurry

1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:15.920
 as everything is reorganized around whatever the newest technology is, and then you have a period

1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:21.680
 where you can get excited about that, and the very rich people who come to the top can talk endlessly,

1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:32.240
 as they always do, about innovation. But again, it really is—this is a recurring kind of debate and

1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:41.440
 a recurring kind of issue. For me—how do I put this in a way that—no, I don't mean to offend.

1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:49.040
 RL Please, please. RL No, no, no, I don't. I don't want to, but

1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:57.440
 the problem with capitalism is—and maybe you'll like this—the problem with capitalism is

1:28:58.800 --> 1:29:03.600
 not that it is the one thing that's consistent with human nature. That's what its defenders

1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:08.480
 would like to have us believe. But if anything, I would argue the opposite,

1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:18.560
 that it is such a contradiction to parts of our nature, not other parts, that it can never quite

1:29:18.560 --> 1:29:24.480
 make it. There's always going to be the people who don't go along with it, people you're talking

1:29:24.480 --> 1:29:32.240
 about, who do quit along the way, or maybe a few of them actually make it to the top by god knows

1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:39.280
 what hook or what crook that they did it. But most of them go—and you know why? Because their

1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:48.560
 humanity is contradicted by what it is they're being asked to do. I mean, the corporate sector

1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:58.160
 this year—just to give you an idea—CEOs are jacking up their wage package. They're already

1:29:58.160 --> 1:30:04.480
 out of whack. I mean, the average CEO pay is now three, three hundred times what the average worker

1:30:04.480 --> 1:30:09.600
 pay is. But they're jacking it up even more. Why? Because that's what's happening in their universe.

1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:13.920
 That's what—they're all doing it, and they have to do—each one of them justifies that,

1:30:13.920 --> 1:30:18.320
 I have to do that, otherwise I'd lose my guy to the next one. Which, of course, is true,

1:30:18.320 --> 1:30:22.960
 but is no comfort for the mass of people who aren't CEOs, for whom this argument isn't very

1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:32.000
 exciting. So they're doing that at a time when the American people can't cope. They've just gone

1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:38.320
 through the COVID disaster. They've gone through the second worst economic crash of capitalism

1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:46.160
 in our history. After two years of this one, two punch, they got an inflation, a third punch,

1:30:46.160 --> 1:30:50.640
 and we are now predicting rising interest rates and a recession at the end of the year

1:30:50.640 --> 1:30:55.760
 or early next year. You can't do this to a working class. When this was done to the

1:30:55.760 --> 1:31:02.160
 German working class in the 1920s, Hitler was the result. You keep doing that in this country,

1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:07.360
 we're already watching it, you're going to get that too. You're already getting bits and pieces.

1:31:07.360 --> 1:31:11.920
 You can't keep doing it. So there's a quiet suffering amidst the working class that's growing.

1:31:11.920 --> 1:31:12.880
 Horror. Taking out on—

1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:16.560
 That can turn to anger. Some little 18 year old kid who has to go

1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:24.320
 three hours in his car and blow away people in a supermarket. Huh? What? And it happens

1:31:24.320 --> 1:31:26.080
 every day in this country. Every day.

1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:33.040
 So that anger rises up in those little ways now and then bigger and bigger potentially.

1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:40.320
 By the way, there's one more thing on the rationality. And this goes to Elon Musk.

1:31:40.320 --> 1:31:47.440
 If you're interested, 49,000 people were killed in automobile accidents this last year. The number

1:31:47.440 --> 1:31:54.320
 was just released yesterday. 49,000. Automobiles are the single largest pollutant in the country.

1:31:54.320 --> 1:32:01.120
 They use up an enormous amount of energy. They use up enormous amount of resources.

1:32:01.120 --> 1:32:07.840
 There is a way to make transportation much more rational. And we've known it for decades. It's

1:32:07.840 --> 1:32:15.680
 called mass transportation. It's a really beautifully maintained, crystal clear, clean,

1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:25.520
 frequent system of buses, trains, street trolleys, vans. It could easily be done in this society.

1:32:25.520 --> 1:32:31.680
 In fact, I once did a project that I estimated cost $30 billion. That's less than we're sending

1:32:31.680 --> 1:32:35.280
 to Ukraine to do this, to reconfigure it.

1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:37.600
 A public transit system where?

1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:41.440
 Everywhere in this country. All the major metropolitan. This country's overwhelmingly

1:32:41.440 --> 1:32:42.480
 metropolitan area.

1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:46.000
 Well, it clearly has to be more than 30 billion, but...

1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:47.520
 Well, it was a few years ago.

1:32:47.520 --> 1:32:50.960
 Sure. But you're saying it's a little bit more than 30 billion.

1:32:50.960 --> 1:32:57.680
 But I'm using a lot of this. Right. It's not crazy stuff.

1:32:57.680 --> 1:32:58.960
 It's a reasonable number.

1:32:58.960 --> 1:32:59.440
 Right. Right.

1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:01.360
 Hey, listen, but there's a...

1:33:01.360 --> 1:33:02.560
 Let me just finish the point.

1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:03.360
 Sure. Yes.

1:33:03.360 --> 1:33:12.640
 Okay. So I'm trying to be rational here. If we have a climate crisis, which everyone tells me we do,

1:33:13.200 --> 1:33:18.640
 if it's got a lot to do with fossil fuels, which everybody tells me it has to do, and with the use

1:33:18.640 --> 1:33:24.400
 of the fossil fuel, particularly for the automobile, then the solution to the problem would be mass

1:33:24.400 --> 1:33:29.680
 transit. We're doing nothing to make that happen. Nothing.

1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:37.360
 Well, you could argue that autonomous vehicles is a kind of public transit because it's going to be

1:33:37.360 --> 1:33:44.400
 reusable vehicles. It will end, in theory, car ownership. So you just have a more kind of

1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:45.680
 distributed public transit system.

1:33:45.680 --> 1:33:51.520
 If it happens, but you know that that's a side effect. His major goal and the major goal of the

1:33:51.520 --> 1:33:58.400
 other companies that are busy squeezing to get his share of the pie smaller, so they have some,

1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:04.080
 Ford, General Motors, Toyota, all of them are making electric cars now. So what they've done is

1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:09.840
 they've replaced the individual car with fossil fuel with another individual car.

1:34:09.840 --> 1:34:10.320
 Yeah.

1:34:10.320 --> 1:34:12.880
 That's fucking nuts. What are you doing?

1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:17.600
 Well, that's one of the things they're doing, but automation is also another one. But on the Elon

1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:24.000
 side, there's also a hilarious thing named Boring Company, which is working on tunnels, which is

1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:31.600
 actually expanding the flexibility you might have to start playing with ideas of public transit,

1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:37.920
 I think. Listen, I'm now partially living in Austin, Texas, that I don't know if they know

1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:40.000
 what a public transit system is, period.

1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:40.480
 Yes.

1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:41.520
 There's F150 pickup trucks.

1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:43.200
 Most American cities are.

1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:43.920
 Yeah.

1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:46.720
 Well, this is an interesting, so.

1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:53.360
 The older, by the way, footnote, the older this city, the more likely it has public transportation.

1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:54.800
 So you're saying.

1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:56.240
 Boston is the best example.

1:34:56.240 --> 1:34:56.880
 Yes.

1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:58.160
 Have you been, well, you.

1:34:58.160 --> 1:35:00.320
 Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, I have a place in Boston.

1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:05.040
 Boston with the street railway, Boston is your case study of how to do this,

1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:07.840
 because they've been doing it all along. New York's pretty good, too.

1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:11.280
 There's a tradeoff. Yeah, New York, I would say, is better than Boston because

1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:17.120
 so there's, you know, their technology also helps you out to do the public transit better.

1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:21.120
 It's almost like Boston is a little too old, but yes, I get your point.

1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:29.600
 But there is a, the Ford F150 pickup truck symbolizes something about America,

1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:35.680
 and there is a practical nature to the fact that in order to do public transit,

1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:42.320
 in order to do some of these things that you're talking about with the working class,

1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:48.000
 there has to be a central planning component, or there has to be a centralized component.

1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:55.200
 And America is very much based on the idea of, at least in recent times,

1:35:55.200 --> 1:35:59.840
 I would say from the founding, of individualism, of respecting individual freedom.

1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:06.880
 Are you worried that in order to bring some of these ideas of Marxism to life,

1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:10.080
 you would trample on individual freedoms?

1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:10.560
 No.

1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:13.360
 Can you respect both?

1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:20.560
 Sure. For me, Marxism is a way to enhance the individual freedom of the mass of people

1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:26.880
 who have had that freedom eroded under the capitalist. That's a motive for my Marxism.

1:36:26.880 --> 1:36:34.800
 It was for Marx too. He loved the French Revolution. He loved the liberté, égalité, fraternité,

1:36:34.800 --> 1:36:39.520
 the great three, and then democracy, the American contribution, if you like.

1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:44.160
 He believed in all of that. His critique of capitalism was, it promised it,

1:36:44.880 --> 1:36:49.280
 and then never delivered it. And the reason you have to go beyond it is because

1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:59.440
 it didn't deliver what it had promised. So for me, it is the fulfillment of agenda.

1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:08.960
 But again, I'm a Hegelian Marxist, if you want. Individualism, for me, is not the way it's set

1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:18.160
 up in this society, some sort of antithesis to the government. I think an immense con has been

1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:24.880
 pulled on the American people. And the con works like this. You know what's bad and what's dangerous

1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:29.200
 and threatens you? It's the government. The government's going to come in and tell you

1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:33.600
 what to do. The government's going to run your life. The government's the problem.

1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:37.520
 There really is no other way to explain the following in American politics.

1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:44.000
 Large numbers of people lose their homes in a downturn, like the so called Great

1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:51.600
 Recession of 2008. Who do they blame? The government. Large numbers of people go unemployed,

1:37:51.600 --> 1:37:58.720
 and what is the media all about? The government. If I were a capitalist, I'd love this. I kick the

1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:03.840
 workers by throwing them out of their home, and they don't get angry at me. They get angry at the

1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:09.200
 government. I fire large numbers of people. I have no responsibility for what happens to them as a

1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:16.080
 result of having no job and no income. And they get angry at the senator. I'm laughing all the way

1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:23.520
 to the bank. This is a genius stroke. In theory. But if you look at government, because you said

1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:27.840
 accountability in the capitalist system has no accountability. There's some pushback I give on

1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:32.240
 the accountability. I think there is some accountability we can discuss in a Hegelian way.

1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:40.320
 Who there's more accountability for. I would say that in theory, government is perfectly

1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:46.400
 accountable. That's the whole point of a democratic system is you vote people in. In practice,

1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:52.560
 there's a giant growing bureaucracy that is accountable only on the surface. There's two

1:38:52.560 --> 1:39:03.120
 parties that seem to be the same. Media somehow integrated into making the same two parties that

1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:09.360
 are just wearing different colored shirts to seem like they're very opposed and are arguing and

1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:16.240
 bitterly arguing and calling each other's nasty names and all those kinds of things. But that's

1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:24.400
 government. So who exactly is worse here? Government or companies? Well, why are we asking

1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:31.600
 that question? These are twins. Look, what you were able to say about Republicans and Democrats

1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:36.480
 just now, with which I agree. I would say the same thing about corporations and the government.

1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:42.480
 This is the same people. Literally. Let's go to Churchill. Which one is worse? Let's go to

1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:47.920
 Churchill. Democracy is the worst form of government except all the other ones or whatever.

1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:52.960
 So this kind of same idea. Which one exactly is worse? Because to me, it seems like...

1:39:52.960 --> 1:39:54.640
 Which one between what and what?

1:39:54.640 --> 1:40:01.120
 Government and industry and companies. It's because government is plagued by...

1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:10.000
 I would call it corruption because the corruption of bureaucratic paperwork.

1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:15.600
 But they're not accountable. There doesn't seem to be a serious accountability.

1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:22.720
 Again, we're not living on the same planet. The greatest practitioners of central planning

1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:32.400
 are corporations. Elon has an operation like General Motors, Ford, IBM, or any of the other

1:40:32.400 --> 1:40:40.080
 megacorps. They have to plan. They buy up companies because they don't want to deal

1:40:40.080 --> 1:40:46.880
 in the market. They don't want the insecurity, the uncertainty of having to buy their inputs

1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:53.120
 or sell their outputs to somebody they don't control. They want the professor to teach the

1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:59.680
 genius of a market. They hate the market. And when they grow to be big, they keep buying

1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:04.400
 whoever they were dealing with before so they could better control them, which requires them

1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:12.000
 then to plan the production and distribution of goods inside rather than buying them in the market.

1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:18.960
 The model of the government is it's a private corporation. I have spent my life...

1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:25.280
 I'll give you an example. In American universities, big ones, famous ones, not just as a student but as

1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:29.920
 a professor. I've been half a dozen schools. I teach now at the new school here. It's another one,

1:41:29.920 --> 1:41:37.760
 right? They all model themselves after businesses. They model their... You can attack the bureaucracy

1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:44.640
 of universities. Good reason. It's a mess. But they're proudly modeling themselves

1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:53.760
 on organizing their bureaucracy in a businesslike manner. So you're looking at a difference which

1:41:53.760 --> 1:42:00.880
 isn't there. The government and the private sector are partners, and both of them wouldn't have it

1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:07.440
 any other way. The corporations want that from the government, and the government now knows that to

1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:14.000
 please the corporations is the number one objective they have because that's how they keep their jobs

1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:20.480
 and keep their system going. And so for all practical purposes, this is the same people.

1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:27.840
 But there's important differences that I don't know if they're fundamental or just a consequence

1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:32.800
 of history. But if you have government, they're accountable in a different way than companies.

1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:38.960
 Companies are accountable by... Especially if you have a consumer, they're accountable by sort of

1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:43.120
 the consumer spending or not spending their money on whatever the heck the company is selling.

1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:49.840
 Right. The government is accountable by votes. And it seems like

1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:58.480
 government, unlike companies, for most of company's history, is always too big to fail, meaning

1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:04.320
 it can always just print money. It can always save itself. And that creates a bureaucracy.

1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:12.480
 You rarely pay the cost of having made bad decisions if you're in government. You

1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:19.200
 distribute the blame, and it's very unclear who's responsible for bad decisions. So bad decisions

1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:25.920
 in government accumulate. So you become more and more and more inefficient and more and more poor

1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:30.320
 in your decision making in terms of, you said, public transit. Should we build a public transit

1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:36.320
 system in this city or not? That's a difficult decision. That's an interesting decision. I would

1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:42.560
 say it's very often a very good decision. But whoever makes that decision should be accountable

1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:47.920
 for a good or bad decision. And it seems like companies are more accountable. They pay...

1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:57.200
 They feel the pain of having made a bad decision more because it can go bankrupt. There's much more

1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:03.680
 day to day pressure to make good engineering decisions. Government doesn't seem to be under

1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:10.160
 the same level of pressure. Do you disagree with that? I disagree with that. Everything in my

1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:20.320
 history pushes me. You may be living... I may be living in a different planet or taking a different

1:44:20.320 --> 1:44:27.840
 sort of drug. I won't mention the name, but I personally had a lot to do with a very large

1:44:27.840 --> 1:44:37.760
 company here in the United States, here in the New York area. And it involved two brothers and

1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:47.120
 a family who built it up into a huge corporation. One of the brothers was kind of the dynamo

1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:52.640
 of the family. And he was more responsible than anybody else building it up.

1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:56.960
 But he took care of his brothers. He had a nice feeling about his brothers. So, the one brother

1:44:56.960 --> 1:45:05.440
 who could not, you know, without help tie his shoes, became a vice president. Got an enormous

1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:12.560
 salary. Got a beautiful office in a skyscraper, not that many blocks from where I'm sitting right

1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:23.120
 now. And that was the way that family handled that company. And all of his relatives that were

1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:31.120
 somewhere in this company doing a variety of whatever, because... And my experience with this,

1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:37.920
 and because I went to the schools, I told you, all my experiences with that group of people,

1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:44.480
 corporate experiences, full of those stories. You know, they made mistake after mistake,

1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:52.560
 which they would tell you didn't undermine. They were always able to blame somebody else,

1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:58.240
 something else that scraped them through. And had they not been able to, they would have been

1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:05.280
 replaced by another person who did the same thing for as long as they could. And they knew it. They

1:46:05.280 --> 1:46:13.280
 would talk about it at family events. That's how I know. I understand that you want the outside

1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:17.280
 world to look at it this way, but it's not my experience.

1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:25.120
 But again, that kind of thing, at the risk of saying human nature again, I wonder what

1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:36.480
 kind of system allows for that more versus less. This is the question of, I would call that, let's

1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:42.240
 put that under the umbrella term of corruption. Which system allows for more corruption?

1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:46.320
 But remember that the way I defined the different system is not more or less government.

1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:55.280
 It's more or less allowing a democratic workplace, reconfiguring it. What happens when everybody

1:46:55.280 --> 1:47:01.760
 has a vote? When you have to explain what the strategies are, what the alternatives are to a

1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:08.240
 larger number of people than a board of directors or major shareholders or whoever it is that most

1:47:08.240 --> 1:47:13.840
 companies are responsible to. And now you've got a whole different universe. It's not a small group

1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:18.400
 that can't be hidden the way it's normally hidden, most of it, and on and on and on.

1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:25.200
 Worker coops is what this is called in many parts of the world. So it's not that I'm advocating

1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:32.400
 something that's never been seen before, not at all. The Marxism I understand is to pick from

1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:40.560
 historical precedents the things that we think will work better. And I think if all the people

1:47:40.560 --> 1:47:45.600
 in enterprise, just to drive the point home, democratically decided they would never give

1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:50.880
 two or three individuals 100 million dollars while everybody else can't send their kid to

1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:59.280
 college. I mean they can do that. So just to return, just to address this point about the

1:47:59.280 --> 1:48:05.440
 particular implementation of Marxism that was the early days in the Soviet Union. Why did

1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:12.240
 Stalinism, for example, lead to so much bloodshed, do you think, and human suffering? Is there any

1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:23.280
 elements within the ideas of Marxism that catalyzed the kind of government, the kind of system that

1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:29.600
 led to that bloodshed? I don't think so. I think there were many things that led to the bloodshed

1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:41.040
 and to all that Stalin's regimes did. And I spent 10 years of my life with another economist writing

1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:49.280
 a book about that to try to explain from a Marxist position the rise and fall of the Soviet Union.

1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:56.160
 You might want to take a look at it sometime. I'm going to say a few things now, but all of

1:48:56.160 --> 1:49:05.360
 those things are spelled out in great detail with loads of empirical evidence, etc. in that work.

1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:09.200
 Let me start with playing a little bit with Hegel.

1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:21.360
 The biggest impact that Marxism had on the Soviet Union was really not so much what the Soviet Union

1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:29.200
 did, but what the rest of the world did. You had a really interesting move, and I'll give you a

1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:40.240
 parallel from today. The move was that the old Russian regime collapsed. World War I, it fell

1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:46.800
 apart. The Tsar and all of that, it couldn't survive. It had already been in trouble. There

1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:53.520
 was a revolution in 1905. There was the loss of the war to Japan. If you know Russian history,

1:49:53.520 --> 1:50:01.760
 which I assume you do, you'll know that there was a lot leading up to the collapse in 1917.

1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:09.840
 In some ways, it was fortuitous that the political group, very small, that could seize

1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:17.440
 the opportunity of that collapse, happened to be Marxists. Earlier on with Kerensky,

1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:23.920
 the first government that tried, it wasn't people all that impressed by Marxism. It was people more

1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:31.920
 skeptical and would not have been called Marxist, probably, by history. They tried. They couldn't.

1:50:31.920 --> 1:50:36.960
 Lenin and his associates were able to take over from them later in that same year.

1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:45.760
 The rest of the world, though, was horrified. The rest of the world saw Marxism having taken

1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:53.840
 this immense leap from being a political party, a movement, critical of capitalism, yes,

1:50:54.480 --> 1:51:01.840
 but still not challenging the power. Now it had the power, and in a big country. And they freaked

1:51:01.840 --> 1:51:10.400
 out. If you know American history, the leadership of this country went completely berserk. I mean,

1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:17.600
 we had a repression of the left, the likes of which we had not seen before. The 20s were a time

1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:27.760
 of Palmer raids in Boston, the Sacco Vanzetti trials, I mean, really grim hostility. And you

1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:33.280
 had the four countries agreeing to invade the Soviet Union to try to crush the revolution.

1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:41.520
 The US, Britain, France, and Japan all attacked 10,000 American troops. So what you had right away

1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:51.040
 was a notion in the West that this was unthinkable. There was a great professor at Princeton,

1:51:51.040 --> 1:51:58.960
 Meier, I forget his first name, who wrote this wonderful book about all American foreign policy

1:51:58.960 --> 1:52:08.480
 since 1917 has been obsessed with Russia. Even now, this fight with Ukraine is half about Russia,

1:52:08.480 --> 1:52:14.400
 as if Russia still was the Soviet Union, as if people haven't figured out. That was a big

1:52:14.400 --> 1:52:23.680
 change back in 1989 and 90. Yeltsin and Putin are not what you had before, or at least they're not

1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:31.600
 Lenin. They may not be so different from some of the other, but in any case. So you had one factor

1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:41.920
 was the utter isolation, the utter condemnation, the global. I mean, Rosa Luxemburg, I assume you

1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:48.480
 know, Rosa Luxemburg is hunted down in the streets of Berlin. She's a critic of Lenin's, by the way,

1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:54.800
 but she's a leftist, hunted down and hacked into bits, killed. So you're attributing some

1:52:56.960 --> 1:53:01.440
 of the bloodshed to the fact that basically the rest of the world turned away.

1:53:02.160 --> 1:53:05.840
 Turned against. Turned against. So you turn against is the better word.

1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:13.520
 I mean, not in order of importance, but it's a very important part of the psychology of being,

1:53:13.520 --> 1:53:19.760
 you know, it's what you would call paranoid if there weren't quite as much evidence that indeed

1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:24.560
 there was a lot to be afraid of at that time. Nobody had ever done it. Look, you could see the

1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:31.600
 effects of it by Stalin inventing the idea, which had no support at first, that you could have

1:53:31.600 --> 1:53:38.640
 socialism in one country. That was thought to be ridiculous, that socialism was internationalism.

1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:45.040
 Marx was against capitalism everywhere. It was, you know, workers of the world unite,

1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:54.640
 not workers of Russia unite. He had to go through a procedure of kind of coming to terms

1:53:54.640 --> 1:54:00.080
 with the fact that the revolution he had in Russia, which was tried in Berlin,

1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:06.320
 was tried in Munich, was tried in Budapest, was tried in Seattle here. They all failed.

1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:14.880
 They all failed, and he's left. So the French would say, tout ça, right? All alone. That's one.

1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:23.840
 The second thing is economic isolation. Russia's a poor country, and it needed what it got before

1:54:23.840 --> 1:54:28.400
 the war, which were heavy investments from the French and the Germans particularly, but others

1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:36.480
 too. Now this was all cut off, and you can see the replay with the sanctions program. We're going to

1:54:36.480 --> 1:54:41.440
 do it again. We're going to do it again. We have to do it. The world is different, and the sanctions

1:54:41.440 --> 1:54:49.280
 don't work, but they're going to trial, because it's the history. But that culture today is

1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:54.720
 completely different. Russia's a different place today, but Russia has China, and that changes

1:54:54.720 --> 1:55:00.080
 everything. And they don't get that here yet, but they will. Yeah, there's a very complicated

1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:08.880
 dynamic with China, even with India. Yep. Or Turkey, Brazil. Sorry to say, human nature may

1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:15.760
 change at a slower pace. Yes, that has occurred to me as well. I get that point. So is there,

1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:22.400
 can you steel man the case, or consider the case, that there's something about the implementation

1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:29.040
 of Marxism, maybe because of the idealistic nature of focusing on the working class and

1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:38.160
 workers unite, that naturally leads to a formation of a dictatorial force, a dictator that says,

1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:46.960
 let us temporarily give power to this person to manage some of the details of how to run the

1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:54.080
 democracy, of giving voice to the workers so that they get to choose. And then that naturally

1:55:54.080 --> 1:56:00.000
 leads to a dictator, and there's naturally, in human nature, power and absolute power,

1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:07.520
 as the old adage goes, corrupts absolutely. Is it possible that whenever you focus on Marxist ideals,

1:56:07.520 --> 1:56:13.440
 you're going to end up with a dictator, and often, when you give too much power to anyone human,

1:56:13.440 --> 1:56:18.320
 a small number of people, you're going to get into a huge amount of trouble? You've

1:56:18.320 --> 1:56:22.960
 putched things together there that I would... That's what... I think if you give...

1:56:22.960 --> 1:56:25.840
 Putched is a good word. Yeah. It's German.

1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:33.520
 Remember, I told you, my mother was born in Germany. And then your dad is French.

1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:39.600
 Yeah, but he was born in Metz, if you know European. It's a city on the border of France

1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:45.520
 and Germany. If you come from Alsatians, Alsass in German.

1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:46.880
 So they're German speaking, French speaking?

1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:52.560
 Yeah, they're both. It's bilingual because it's been back and forth so many times

1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:56.960
 in medieval days already that it... Literally, you go from one store to another,

1:56:56.960 --> 1:57:00.640
 the proprietor here is French and the proprietor there is German,

1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:06.320
 but they all speak both languages because... You don't speak either of them?

1:57:06.320 --> 1:57:07.280
 I speak Russian.

1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:12.400
 Russian, but not German or French? Ukrainian, no. It took French for four years

1:57:12.400 --> 1:57:16.880
 in high school, but I've forgotten all of it. I remember the romance and the spirit

1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:19.440
 of the language, but not the details. I'm sure I can remember.

1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:30.160
 If you allocate power unequally, undemocratically, and you do it for a very long period of time,

1:57:30.160 --> 1:57:40.000
 and you do it on many levels of ideology, it is not surprising that it sticks and it stays.

1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:45.600
 And you can make a political revolution or even an economic revolution and you will discover

1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:51.680
 it has a life of its own and it's going to take a long time before people don't.

1:57:51.680 --> 1:57:59.520
 If you have a religious tradition, Christianity, that prides itself on its monotheism

1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:04.000
 and that it doesn't want to have anything to do with the old Greek mythologies when there was

1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:09.520
 Zeus and Diana and all the others, and they were very humanlike, but instead we have one

1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:15.600
 who is the absolute beginning. What are you doing? You're teaching people

1:58:17.600 --> 1:58:23.360
 an authority line that comes from the individual. If you have a sequence of kings,

1:58:23.360 --> 1:58:29.520
 if in your feudal manner the lord sits called the landlord and he has unspeakable power

1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:34.400
 over everything that goes on, and you do this for thousands of years,

1:58:35.200 --> 1:58:42.240
 you can make a Russian revolution in 1917. But if you imagine you've gotten away from all that

1:58:42.240 --> 1:58:49.760
 people assume without ever thinking about it, you're going to have trouble. Stalin is figured

1:58:49.760 --> 1:58:58.080
 here as the originator of his situation. He wasn't. He never had that power. He may have thought that,

1:58:58.080 --> 1:59:05.680
 but I don't. He's the product. Look, the Cuban people made Fidel, who really wasn't that kind

1:59:05.680 --> 1:59:12.240
 of guy. You know, he's a baseball playing lawyer. That's what he was. But they made him into Tala.

1:59:12.240 --> 1:59:20.880
 So you're the product of history. No, no, no. It was the systems, feudalism, the nature,

1:59:20.880 --> 1:59:27.840
 it was the structures and institutions that cultivated in people a mentality that has its

1:59:27.840 --> 1:59:33.280
 own rhythm and doesn't follow the calendar of a political revolution.

1:59:33.280 --> 1:59:36.240
 That's the fundamental question. Is there something about communism

1:59:36.240 --> 1:59:44.320
 that creates a mentality that enables somebody like Stalin or Mao?

1:59:44.320 --> 1:59:51.120
 No, I think it's the social issues and problems the society has that make them then go to what

1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:56.640
 they find familiar, to what seems to make sense, and he's the guy. Look, let me give you an example

1:59:56.640 --> 2:00:02.880
 from American history. The Republican Party has traditionally in this country been the party of

2:00:02.880 --> 2:00:09.840
 private enterprise and minimum government. In comes Trump, runs for office in 2016,

2:00:10.480 --> 2:00:19.120
 is elected. What does he do? He commences the most massive tax increase and the most

2:00:19.120 --> 2:00:26.880
 massive government intervention in the worlds of economics that we've had for decades. Nobody says

2:00:26.880 --> 2:00:38.320
 anything. The Republicans cave and the Democrats largely too. They cave. He can throw a tariff on

2:00:38.320 --> 2:00:43.760
 anything. He gets up in front of the American people and he says the Chinese will pay the tariff.

2:00:44.480 --> 2:00:50.320
 That's not what a tariff is. It's not how a tariff works. He would flunk a freshman course

2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:57.120
 in economics, which everybody knows, everybody who teaches these courses. No, it doesn't matter. He's

2:00:57.120 --> 2:01:03.840
 still calling the shots. What is going on here is that a society has come to a point where it can't

2:01:04.400 --> 2:01:14.960
 solve its problems and it begins what? To tap into older forms and all of the laissez faire

2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:22.560
 and all of the individualism. And suddenly the Republican Party is gung ho. And now they're

2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:28.560
 going to make abortion illegal. The government is telling you what you can do with your uterus.

2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:36.240
 What? What? The government is being given more and more and more and more power. They're hoping

2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:43.200
 what? Do they like the government? No. They're desperate. This is not a pro government

2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:51.440
 and it wasn't in Russia either. They were in a desperate fix and so, and he took advantage.

2:01:52.320 --> 2:02:01.040
 So to which degree would you say Marx's ideas led to the creation of the

2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:11.280
 National Socialism Party of German workers, hence the Nazi Party, the fascist party in the 30s

2:02:11.280 --> 2:02:17.360
 and the 40s at the head of whom was Hitler, which I just recently learned he was

2:02:18.720 --> 2:02:23.680
 employee number seven of the party or whatever, the seventh person to have joined the party

2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:30.080
 and have created one of the most consequential and powerful political parties in the history

2:02:30.080 --> 2:02:38.000
 of the 20th century. What degree did Marx's ideas, Marxism ideas have to play? It is the National

2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:50.080
 Socialist Party of German workers. Right. Workers. National Socialist Deutsche Arbeiter Partei,

2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:56.560
 German Worker Party. Worker Party. National Socialist German Worker Party. So. Well here's

2:02:56.560 --> 2:03:03.280
 the history. Did he care about the workers or did he just use the workers as a populist message?

2:03:03.280 --> 2:03:10.960
 The only thing that Marxism did for Mr. Hitler was provide him with his stepping stone to power,

2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:14.560
 but had nothing, no other, he didn't know anything about it, didn't care anything about it,

2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:18.000
 nor did the people around him. Here's the story of what happened there,

2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:23.600
 which I know largely through my own family and plus my own history, the work that I did.

2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:32.000
 The most successful socialist party in Europe was the German Party. It started around 1870,

2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:38.880
 Marx was still alive. Some of his own family were leaders, Fernand Lassalle and others, his daughters.

2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:44.720
 By the end of the century, it was the second most important party in Germany.

2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:53.840
 Nobody understood it. It was almost as big a shock to the Europeans as was the Russian Revolution

2:03:53.840 --> 2:04:00.800
 in 1917. Here was a political party that was now in every German city, in every German town,

2:04:00.800 --> 2:04:10.080
 powerful and enjoying its rise up. My family is involved in this, I really do know the story.

2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:22.640
 It meant that starting around 1906, 1907, 1908, if you wanted to have any kind of presence

2:04:23.360 --> 2:04:29.360
 in the German working class, you had to use the word socialist. You had to, otherwise they wouldn't

2:04:29.360 --> 2:04:36.560
 pay attention. The other parties called themselves Catholic. Germany is divided, the upper two,

2:04:36.560 --> 2:04:42.000
 the northern two thirds is Protestant, the southern third is Catholic. Munich and Bavaria

2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:47.600
 is Catholic and every other part of Germany basically is Protestant. You could be in the

2:04:47.600 --> 2:04:54.400
 Catholic Party, that was the south, or you could be in various conservative, Prussian and other.

2:04:54.400 --> 2:04:59.920
 But if you wanted to have a presence in the working class, which was growing, in Germany

2:04:59.920 --> 2:05:06.640
 a very powerful capitalist country, expanding like crazy at this time. Germany was the major

2:05:06.640 --> 2:05:12.640
 competitor to Britain for the empire. The United States was coming up too, but it was Germany and

2:05:12.640 --> 2:05:21.280
 US taking over from Britain's empire. So the German working class was it. So anybody who wanted

2:05:21.280 --> 2:05:29.840
 to approach the working class in whatever way had to come to terms and be friendly to socialism.

2:05:31.200 --> 2:05:37.680
 Other parties did this too, just like Hitler. They put the word socialist in their party,

2:05:37.680 --> 2:05:43.600
 but they wanted to make it clear that they weren't anything to do with the Soviet Union

2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:49.920
 or anything to do with Marxism. So they put the word national. Nazi is the first four letters

2:05:49.920 --> 2:05:56.480
 of national, national in German, and the ZI is how you spell national in the German.

2:05:56.480 --> 2:05:58.880
 National socialism, but definitely not communists.

2:05:58.880 --> 2:06:02.640
 That's right. They killed communists. They fought communists in the street.

2:06:03.520 --> 2:06:09.200
 They had pitched battles. They literally threatened each other's existence and their

2:06:09.200 --> 2:06:15.360
 lives. And the first people that he arrested and put in jail were not Jews and gypsies and all the

2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:20.160
 other people he eventually killed. It was communists. They were the number one, and

2:06:20.160 --> 2:06:26.560
 socialists right behind him. Why? Because up until he takes power, January of 1933,

2:06:26.560 --> 2:06:31.600
 that's when Hitler takes power, the last elections, two of them in 1932,

2:06:32.400 --> 2:06:36.720
 the socialists and communists, they vote together, 50% of the vote in Germany.

2:06:36.720 --> 2:06:43.760
 So he appealed to the German manufacturers, the German capitalists, and he said,

2:06:43.760 --> 2:06:50.720
 the communists and socialists are going to win. And you're just the capitalists. You have too

2:06:50.720 --> 2:06:56.080
 few people. You need a mass base, and I'm the only one that can do that.

2:06:56.080 --> 2:06:59.520
 And it was just a populist message that he used.

2:06:59.520 --> 2:07:07.360
 That's right. But it was explicitly done as a deal. The ruling group said to Hindenburg,

2:07:07.360 --> 2:07:11.920
 the old Prussian man who was in charge of the German government at the time,

2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:16.480
 you have to invite Hitler to form a new government. Otherwise, he would never have

2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:22.480
 done it. He had called Hitler nasty names before. The Prussian aristocracy looked down on Hitler

2:07:22.480 --> 2:07:28.720
 as a little funny man with a mustache who was Austrian, wasn't even German. For them,

2:07:28.720 --> 2:07:37.200
 that mattered. So he comes in as the enemy, the smasher of socialism and communism,

2:07:37.200 --> 2:07:43.680
 which he immediately does. Only people who don't know or care about the history

2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:52.080
 pick up on the word. It's like there are people here in the United States who like to say,

2:07:53.680 --> 2:08:00.800
 we are not a democracy, we are a republic, which is like saying, I'm not a banana, I'm a fruit.

2:08:00.800 --> 2:08:07.440
 You have to explain to these people, a banana is a kind of fruit. So you have to explain to people,

2:08:07.440 --> 2:08:14.000
 yes, we're a republic, but we have a commitment to democracy as a way to govern the republic,

2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:18.080
 because to say you're a republic doesn't imply what kind of government you have. You have to

2:08:18.080 --> 2:08:20.160
 go through that with people so they kind of get it.

2:08:20.160 --> 2:08:26.560
 And certain words have power beyond their actual meaning. They're used in communication,

2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:31.920
 whether it's negative, like racist, or positive, like freedom of speech.

2:08:31.920 --> 2:08:33.760
 RL. Or Democrat, with a D.

2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:36.240
 RG. Yeah, and then you use that to mean something.

2:08:36.240 --> 2:08:37.120
 RL. Who knows?

2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:44.400
 RG. Or negative, stop Donnie, stop being a socialist, or whatever that means that's not

2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:50.080
 even used in any kind of philosophical or economic sense. So let's fast forward to today.

2:08:50.080 --> 2:08:50.560
 RL. Right.

2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:52.000
 RG. You mentioned Bernie Sanders.

2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:52.400
 RL. Right.

2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:59.040
 RG. There's another popular figure that represents some ideas of maybe let's call it democratic

2:08:59.040 --> 2:09:03.600
 socialism, and maybe let's try to start to sneak up on a definition of what that could

2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:10.240
 possibly mean, but AOC, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, she's from these parts.

2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:11.120
 RL. Yes, Queens.

2:09:11.120 --> 2:09:21.600
 RG. So maybe if you can comment on Bernie Sanders or AOC, are they open to some ideas in Marxism?

2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:26.560
 Are they representing those ideas well in both the economic and the political sense?

2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:28.640
 RL. Okay.

2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:31.440
 RG. Where do I begin?

2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:39.840
 RL. Yeah, the socialist movement predates Marx, was always larger than Marx, and has

2:09:39.840 --> 2:09:44.320
 gone on to develop separately after Marx's death. So...

2:09:44.320 --> 2:09:50.800
 RG. Can we pause on that actually? Is there a nice way to delineate, draw a line between

2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:59.040
 Marxism and socialism? Or if Marxism is kind of a part of socialism, can you speak to like,

2:09:59.760 --> 2:10:04.720
 maybe try to define once again what Marxism is and what socialism is?

2:10:04.720 --> 2:10:16.080
 RL. Right. Marxism is a systematic analysis heavily focused on economics, and as I said

2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:29.120
 earlier, devoted to mostly a critique of capitalism, and that's its strength, how it does that,

2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:36.640
 how it poses the questions, how it analyzes the way capitalism works. That is really the

2:10:36.640 --> 2:10:44.800
 forte of the Marxist tradition. Socialism is a bigger, broader tent within which Marxism

2:10:44.800 --> 2:10:51.280
 figures. It's there so that people who aren't Marxists are nonetheless aware of Marxism,

2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:59.600
 like it more or less, study it more or less. But it's a broader notion that I like to use

2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:07.520
 this sentence to describe. It's a broad idea that we can do better than capitalism, that really

2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:16.800
 there are all kinds of things about capitalism that are not what we as modern citizens of the

2:11:16.800 --> 2:11:23.760
 world think are adequate, that we are in a tradition that goes back to all the people who

2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:27.680
 thought they could do better than slavery, and all the people who thought they could do better

2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:35.120
 than feudalism. We've made progress. Feudalism was a progress over slavery. Capitalism was a

2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:41.840
 progress over both of them. And progress hasn't stopped. And we are the people who, in a variety

2:11:41.840 --> 2:11:51.840
 of ways, want the progress to go further and are not held back by believing that capitalism is

2:11:51.840 --> 2:11:59.680
 somehow the best beyond which we cannot go or even think. We find that to be, in the worst sense of

2:11:59.680 --> 2:12:07.920
 the word, a reactionary way of thinking. And we're that large community. Many of us are not interested

2:12:07.920 --> 2:12:16.080
 in economics all that much. We don't think that's the focal area. We are socialists, for example,

2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:22.400
 because we want to do something to deal with climate change. We think the world is about to

2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:31.600
 kill itself physically, and we want to take steps with other people to stop that, to fix that, etc.,

2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:39.440
 etc. So that's, for me, a kind of difference. It's a little difficult to say because there's no

2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:49.520
 other figure like Marx that has an equal impact, an equal place within the broad socialist

2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:58.560
 tradition. And the only tradition that comes close might be the anarchist tradition. But that's very

2:12:58.560 --> 2:13:05.520
 specialized, and that's a whole other kind of conversation. And whatever you say, the influence

2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:14.160
 of the great anarchist thinkers—Kropotkin, Bakunin, Sorel, and others—still doesn't

2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:21.120
 amount to the impact that Marx and Marxism have had so far. That could change, but I mean, up to

2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:28.880
 this point, that's the—I think that's a way of understanding the relationship.

2:13:28.880 --> 2:13:33.440
 Yeah, that's an interesting thing that some of the ideas within anarchism—and of course,

2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:41.920
 it's one of the more varied disciplines because there's such, maybe by definition, such variety

2:13:41.920 --> 2:13:51.520
 in their thinkers—but they kind of stand for a dismantling of a power center, and that,

2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:56.880
 if not equates, tends to rhyme with some of the ideas of socialism.

2:13:56.880 --> 2:13:57.520
 Absolutely.

2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:04.080
 There's a whole train of thought in socialist ideas and in Marxist ideas

2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:12.400
 that uses the phrase, quote, the withering away of the state. That's a quotation from Lenin.

2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:22.000
 People should understand that's a quotation from Lenin. And it was made by Lenin. In other words,

2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:28.240
 Lenin was saying, that's a good thing. That's something we stand for. We want to create the

2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:34.400
 conditions under which there is a—because you remember the communists, or whatever,

2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:39.520
 they weren't called that at first in Russia before the revolution. They were just socialists.

2:14:40.080 --> 2:14:44.560
 They were hunted down and persecuted by the government left and right. They had no love

2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:51.440
 for the government. The government was their literal, everyday enemy. And being critical

2:14:51.440 --> 2:14:57.600
 of government didn't just mean this particular government, but of the whole—being a Marxist,

2:14:57.600 --> 2:15:03.040
 you always ask the questions of the social constitution of whatever it is you're struggling

2:15:03.040 --> 2:15:08.960
 against. So there was this interest, why is the state so important? Especially because if you

2:15:08.960 --> 2:15:14.560
 understand feudalism, particularly early feudalism, it didn't have powerful states.

2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:20.800
 One of Lenin's greatest books is called The Economic History of Russia, and it goes back

2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:26.720
 centuries. It's a huge book, three or four inches thick, and I'm one of the few people who've read

2:15:26.720 --> 2:15:35.520
 it. And he's very good about the absence of a strong central government in many parts of

2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:41.360
 feudalism, including inside Russia, but also in other parts of Europe. The development of a powerful

2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:48.400
 central state comes towards the end of feudalism as it is desperate to hold on, which ought to be

2:15:48.400 --> 2:15:54.880
 suggestive that maybe the turn to powerful governments here in the United States or in Europe

2:15:54.880 --> 2:16:03.440
 and Europe is maybe also because this system is exhausted and can't go on and has to marshal every

2:16:03.440 --> 2:16:12.160
 last bit of power it can, not to be lost in history. It would be interesting to see what

2:16:12.160 --> 2:16:18.080
 the Soviet Union would look like if Lenin never died. A lot of people have asked that question

2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:24.080
 over the years, a lot of people. There's Stalin sliding in in the middle of the night,

2:16:24.080 --> 2:16:32.000
 erasing the withering away of the state part. So just to return briefly back to AOC and Bernie

2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:35.840
 Sanders, what are your thoughts about these modern political figures that represent some of these

2:16:35.840 --> 2:16:41.840
 ideas, and they sometimes refer to those ideas as democratic socialism? The crucial thing about

2:16:41.840 --> 2:16:48.400
 Bernie and about AOC, and this is particularly true about Bernie, because AOC is much younger

2:16:48.400 --> 2:16:59.280
 and Bernie's an older man. Bernie, being roughly my age, has been around formatively as a student,

2:16:59.280 --> 2:17:05.040
 as an activist, and then coming up through the ranks in Burlington, Vermont as a mayor and all

2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:12.720
 the rest. He lived through what, for lack of a better term, I would call Cold War America.

2:17:12.720 --> 2:17:19.200
 And the taboo in Cold War America, running from around 1945, 6 to the present, I mean,

2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:29.920
 really never stopped, was a Manichean worldview. The United States is good, it defines democracy,

2:17:29.920 --> 2:17:35.920
 and the Soviet Union is awful, it defines whatever the opposite of democracy should be called.

2:17:35.920 --> 2:17:47.440
 Good here, evil there. It was taken so far that even among the ranks of academic individuals,

2:17:48.720 --> 2:17:56.160
 it was impossible to have a conversation. I mean, I can't tell, just make it very personal,

2:17:56.160 --> 2:18:02.800
 the number of times I would raise my hand in my classes at Harvard or Stanford or Yale,

2:18:02.800 --> 2:18:08.640
 and I would ask a question that had something to do with Marxism,

2:18:08.640 --> 2:18:13.440
 because I was studying it on my own. There were no courses to teach this to me,

2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:18.160
 except by people who trashed it, other than that, and I didn't want that.

2:18:20.160 --> 2:18:26.640
 So I would ask a question, and I would see in the faces of my teachers, both those I didn't

2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:32.640
 much care for and those who were good teachers that I liked, fear. It was just fear. They didn't

2:18:32.640 --> 2:18:37.920
 want to go there. They didn't want to answer my question. And after a while, I got to know some

2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:42.560
 of them, and I found out why. Because you don't know how the rest of the class is going to

2:18:42.560 --> 2:18:47.680
 understand this. Either they would have to say, I don't know, which would be the honest truth for

2:18:47.680 --> 2:18:52.400
 many of them, but a professor does not want to say in a classroom, I don't know, that's just

2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:59.600
 not cool. Or they'd have to, if they knew, they'd have to say something that indicated they didn't

2:18:59.600 --> 2:19:05.360
 know really much, and they weren't going to do that. Or they would know something, and maybe

2:19:05.360 --> 2:19:12.160
 that would be because they were interested. They did not want the rest of the students to begin to

2:19:12.160 --> 2:19:20.400
 say, oh, you know, Professor Smith, you know, he's interested. This is not good for your career. You

2:19:20.400 --> 2:19:25.520
 don't know how this is going to play out. Who's going to say what to whom? And I could see in

2:19:25.520 --> 2:19:31.680
 their faces what I later learned, because they told me, come to my office hours. We're in the

2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:40.800
 office. We can talk about it. But that's how bad it was. Is it not still? Pretty much. In my field,

2:19:40.800 --> 2:19:46.000
 the great so called debate, I mean, I find it boring, but the great debate for my colleagues

2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:52.640
 is between what's called neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics. Neoclassical, the

2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:58.800
 government should stay out of the economy. Let's say fair or liberalism. And the Keynesian saying,

2:19:58.800 --> 2:20:04.240
 no, you crazy neoclassical, if you do that, you'll have Great Depressions, and the system will

2:20:04.240 --> 2:20:10.880
 collapse. You need the government to come in to solve the problems, to fix the weaknesses. And

2:20:10.880 --> 2:20:15.600
 they hate each other, and they throw each other out of their jobs. One of the very few things that

2:20:15.600 --> 2:20:22.800
 they can do together that they agree on is keeping people like me out. That they can find common

2:20:22.800 --> 2:20:34.000
 ground to do. So I had to learn it all on my own. Why am I telling you this? Because this taboo means

2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:43.280
 that all of the complicated developments within Marxism and within socialism of the post World

2:20:43.280 --> 2:20:52.480
 War II period, the vast bulk of all of that is unknown, not just to the average American person,

2:20:52.480 --> 2:20:58.160
 but to the average American academic, to the average American who thinks of himself or herself

2:20:58.160 --> 2:21:05.680
 as an intellectual. I mean, I have had to spend ridiculous amounts of my time explaining Soviet

2:21:05.680 --> 2:21:13.440
 history. They have no idea. Or saying there's this man Lukács, a Hungarian Marxist, he really had

2:21:13.440 --> 2:21:20.800
 interest in, or to explain that Gramsci was not a great literary critic. He was head of the

2:21:20.800 --> 2:21:28.240
 Communist Party of Italy for most of his adult life. What does that mean? You like Gramsci as a

2:21:28.240 --> 2:21:35.440
 literary critic, but they didn't even know. They don't even know. It's been erased. It's

2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:41.600
 a little bit like stories I've heard about Trotsky and his influence kind of erased in the Soviet

2:21:41.600 --> 2:21:48.240
 Union because he obviously fell out of favor. And so somehow all of his writings, many of which are

2:21:48.240 --> 2:21:55.440
 very interesting and complicated, anyway. So what you're going to have in this country is a slow

2:21:56.400 --> 2:22:04.800
 awakening of socialism from a long hibernation called the Cold War. I never expected, to be very

2:22:04.800 --> 2:22:10.240
 honest with you, that I would live to see it. I knew it would come, because these things always do,

2:22:11.040 --> 2:22:18.240
 but I didn't expect to see it. So I have been surprised, as have a lot of us, that when it

2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:26.960
 starts to happen, it happens fast. So you see Bernie as an early sign of the awakening from

2:22:26.960 --> 2:22:32.720
 the Cold War to accept the idea of socialism. Bernie was always a socialist. We all knew.

2:22:32.720 --> 2:22:40.240
 And everybody who paid attention, he denied it. But 2016, he makes a decision, momentous,

2:22:40.240 --> 2:22:46.320
 to run for president. He's just a senator from Vermont. Vermont is one of the smallest

2:22:46.320 --> 2:22:51.280
 states in the Union. People who live in Vermont love to tell you that there are more cows than

2:22:51.280 --> 2:22:57.920
 people in Vermont, et cetera, et cetera. So here from this little state, this elderly gentleman

2:22:57.920 --> 2:23:03.760
 with a New York City accent runs for office and says, I'm a socialist. And when they attack him,

2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:09.920
 he doesn't run away. I'm a socialist. I'm a socialist. Now, he had been. It wasn't a secret

2:23:09.920 --> 2:23:15.920
 that suddenly got out. But the great question—and I don't mind telling you, because I went to the

2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:21.680
 right schools. I know a lot of people. You know, Janet Yellen was my classmate at Yale,

2:23:21.680 --> 2:23:26.960
 and stuff like that. So I was speaking with a high official of the Democratic Party,

2:23:26.960 --> 2:23:30.480
 and I said, well, what do you think about Bernie entering the race?

2:23:31.280 --> 2:23:37.600
 Makes no difference. He doesn't get 1% of the vote. Right? He was wrong. They had no idea

2:23:37.600 --> 2:23:42.960
 what was coming. But the truth is, I didn't either. It wasn't just that he didn't get it.

2:23:42.960 --> 2:23:46.960
 I thought his 1% was probably right. So we were both wrong.

2:23:46.960 --> 2:23:51.120
 Yeah, change can happen fast. Do you think AOC might be president one day?

2:23:51.120 --> 2:24:01.120
 Yeah. Possible. Possible. But two things. Number one, it's fast. Number two,

2:24:02.800 --> 2:24:11.280
 it's going to go in the following direction, I would guess. You begin with the most moderate,

2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:18.160
 calm, nonconfrontational socialism you can imagine.

2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:19.680
 So not AOC or Bernie.

2:24:19.680 --> 2:24:23.280
 No, no. They are not confrontational, in my judgment.

2:24:23.280 --> 2:24:26.960
 In terms of the ideas of socialism. I mean, they're both very feisty.

2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:30.320
 They're feisty personally, but not ideologically.

2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:40.560
 Bernie is also, in honest moments, and they both really are pretty honest folks,

2:24:40.560 --> 2:24:47.840
 at least in my experience. In honest moments, Bernie will tell you that what he advocates

2:24:47.840 --> 2:24:55.760
 as democratic socialism is pretty much what FDR was in the 1930s. It was a kind of popular

2:24:56.480 --> 2:25:02.960
 government, tax the rich a lot more than you do now to provide a lot more support for the

2:25:02.960 --> 2:25:08.880
 working class than you do now. That's not a fundamental change. That's what he means

2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:15.680
 by socialism. When he talks about it and he's asked for examples, he mentions Denmark a lot.

2:25:15.680 --> 2:25:23.600
 Okay, that's consistent. That's the softest kind of socialism, and that's where we're going to

2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:29.200
 start in a country coming out of hibernation. Pretty soon, it's already happening, there'll

2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:35.520
 be people who need and want to go further in the direction of socialism than Bernie and AOC are

2:25:35.520 --> 2:25:43.360
 comfortable with. You can already see the shoots of it now. AOC voted, together with most of the

2:25:43.360 --> 2:25:49.760
 others, to support the money for Ukraine. Okay, a lot of people in the socialist movement do not

2:25:49.760 --> 2:25:56.880
 support that. I don't know exactly how that's going to work out, but that should give people

2:25:56.880 --> 2:26:01.360
 an idea. There are disagreements, and they're going to fester, and they're going to grow.

2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:08.800
 So people in the socialist sphere don't support money from the United States in the large amounts

2:26:08.800 --> 2:26:13.920
 that it is being sent to Ukraine. Is it because it's fundamentally the military, industrial

2:26:13.920 --> 2:26:19.840
 complex is a capitalist institution kind of thing? No, there are some people for whom that's the

2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:28.000
 issue. Then there are people for whom it's guns and butter, and why are we over there when we have

2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:34.320
 such needs at home that are being neglected? And then there are people who, well, go back to what

2:26:34.320 --> 2:26:40.720
 we talked about at the beginning, who are more like Lenin and Debs. This is a fight between

2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:48.800
 Western capitalism and Russian oligarchs and wannabe oligarchs in Ukraine, and what are we

2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:55.680
 doing here? We have to insist that these forces sit down at the bargaining table and negotiate

2:26:55.680 --> 2:27:00.400
 a settlement, don't kill large numbers of Ukraine. I mean, everybody's willing to fight to the last

2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:06.240
 Ukrainian is a little strange here. What are you doing? You're supposed to be in favor of peace,

2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:11.840
 you know, and for the United States, which just finished invading and occupying Afghanistan and

2:27:11.840 --> 2:27:16.480
 Iraq, to be against another country invading. I mean, who in the world is going to take this

2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:23.120
 seriously? This is crazy. You know, I invade, it's good, and you invade, it's terrible. What?

2:27:23.920 --> 2:27:30.160
 You know, what are you doing? Why are you doing that? What's going on here? All of these

2:27:30.160 --> 2:27:35.680
 questions are being active—by the way, not just by socialists, by lots of other people too—inside

2:27:35.680 --> 2:27:42.080
 the Democratic Party and also inside the Republican Party. You watch that Tucker Carlson or people

2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:47.920
 like that, they are against the stuff in Ukraine. They don't want the money spent there, they don't

2:27:47.920 --> 2:27:53.600
 want the weapons sent there, they don't like the whole policy, and Trump wobble.

2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:58.720
 So Mr. Biden's policy has got all kinds of critics on the left and the right,

2:27:58.720 --> 2:28:05.440
 and every day that this thing lasts, these criticisms get bigger. Anyway, the point is that

2:28:05.440 --> 2:28:16.240
 AOC and Bernie should be, I think, evaluated as the early shoots after a long winter of Cold War

2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:25.760
 isolation from the whole—you know, when I explain to people the contribution made, for example,

2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:32.080
 to modern Marxism—I'll give you an example—by the French philosopher Louis Althusser. I don't

2:28:32.080 --> 2:28:38.720
 know if the name means anything to you. Okay. He was the rector of the École Normale

2:28:38.720 --> 2:28:45.680
 Supérieure in Paris. That's the equivalent. Imagine in this country if there were a university

2:28:45.680 --> 2:28:53.600
 that combined Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and MIT. It would be the university. Well, the École Normale

2:28:53.600 --> 2:29:00.800
 in France, in Paris, is the—he was a tenured professor who became the rector. The rector is

2:29:00.800 --> 2:29:06.160
 like the president of the university, an active member of the French Communist Party most of his

2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:12.240
 adult life. That was possible in France during the Cold War. That was unthinkable in this country.

2:29:12.240 --> 2:29:21.200
 You could not in a million years, right? So Althusser, as a philosopher, tried to bring

2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:29.760
 a version of postmodernism into Marxism, with enormous impact all over the world, where he

2:29:29.760 --> 2:29:35.680
 traveled—not just in Europe, all over, right? So if you want to look him up, I'll spell it out for

2:29:35.680 --> 2:29:46.880
 you. Sure. A.L.T.H.U.S.S.E.R. Louis. The Louis is spelled L.O.U.I.S. Louis Althusser. Look him up.

2:29:46.880 --> 2:29:53.200
 You'll see tons of stuff. By the way, MIT Press is a major publisher, if I remember, of his works

2:29:53.200 --> 2:29:59.600
 in English. By the way, the textbook I wrote in economics, in case you're ever interested,

2:29:59.600 --> 2:30:05.440
 was also published by the MIT Press. And the title? Contending Economic Theories.

2:30:05.440 --> 2:30:12.320
 Neoclassical, Keynesian, and Marxian. That's at MIT. Marxian. Yeah, that's right. And by the way,

2:30:12.320 --> 2:30:18.160
 when we think—I don't know if there's an interesting distinction between Marxian economics

2:30:18.160 --> 2:30:26.480
 and Marxist—I suppose Marxism is the umbrella of everything that's— I only use it because

2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:35.200
 Marxist I use as a noun. A person is a Marxist. Marxian I use as an adjective to qualify. But

2:30:35.200 --> 2:30:39.760
 I don't mean some great difference. There's a last point I would like to make about

2:30:39.760 --> 2:30:49.440
 AOC and Bernie that's also general. I'm a historian, too, and I know that the transition

2:30:49.440 --> 2:30:56.320
 out of feudalism in Europe to capitalism was a transition that took centuries and that occurred

2:30:56.320 --> 2:31:02.800
 in fits and starts. So, for example, a feudal manor would start to disintegrate. Serfs would

2:31:02.800 --> 2:31:09.040
 run away. They'd run into a town. How would they live in the town? They had no land anymore because

2:31:09.040 --> 2:31:15.440
 they had run away from the feudal manor. A deal was struck without the people involved in the deal

2:31:15.440 --> 2:31:22.720
 understanding what they were doing. A merchant would say to one of these serfs, I'm in the

2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:27.280
 business of buying and then reselling stuff and living off the difference, but, you know,

2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:33.120
 I could make more money if I produce some of this stuff myself rather than buy it from somebody

2:31:33.120 --> 2:31:38.400
 else. So I'm going to make you a deal. I'm going to give you money once a week. I'll give you

2:31:38.400 --> 2:31:43.600
 money, what we would later call a wage, and you come here and under my supervision you make this

2:31:43.600 --> 2:31:50.400
 crap that I'm going to then sell and this all works out. In other words, there were efforts,

2:31:51.520 --> 2:31:57.680
 unconscious, not self aware, to go out of feudalism to a new system.

2:31:59.040 --> 2:32:04.960
 Some of them lasted a few days and then fell apart. Some of them lasted weeks or months or

2:32:04.960 --> 2:32:14.960
 years, but it took a long time before the conditions were ready for a kind of a general

2:32:14.960 --> 2:32:21.760
 switch and once that was done it grew on itself and became the global capitalist system we have

2:32:21.760 --> 2:32:28.800
 today. That's the only model we have. So for me that's what I see when I look at socialism.

2:32:28.800 --> 2:32:38.080
 I see the Paris Commune was an event, an attempt. It lasted a few weeks. I see Russia, that was an

2:32:38.080 --> 2:32:44.480
 attempt, lasted 70 years. Then I see, and you know, fill in the blank, I see these are all early

2:32:44.480 --> 2:32:52.400
 experiments. These are all you learn things to do, learn things never to do again. The good, the bad,

2:32:52.960 --> 2:32:58.640
 what do you build on? How do you learn? And that's what the socialist and Marxist tradition

2:32:58.640 --> 2:33:04.800
 when it's serious, that's what it does. So in your ideas sort of capitalism was a significant

2:33:04.800 --> 2:33:12.320
 improvement over the feudalism and we are coming to an age and over slavery and we're coming to

2:33:12.320 --> 2:33:18.720
 an age where capitalism will die out and make, it's not that capitalism is somehow fundamentally

2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:24.400
 broken. It's better than the things that came before but there's going to be things yet better

2:33:24.400 --> 2:33:31.760
 and they will be grounded in the ideas of Marxism and socialism. Is there just to linger briefly on

2:33:32.640 --> 2:33:41.600
 the way Marxism is used as a term on Twitter. There's something called, I'm sorry if I'm using

2:33:41.600 --> 2:33:51.120
 the terms incorrectly, but cultural Marxism. Criticisms of universities being infiltrated

2:33:51.120 --> 2:33:59.360
 by cultural Marxists. I'm not exactly sure. I don't pay close enough attention, but it's woke.

2:34:00.560 --> 2:34:08.080
 There's a kind of woke ideology that I'm not exactly sure. What is the fundamental text?

2:34:09.360 --> 2:34:16.960
 Who's the Karl Marx of wokeness? All I do know is that there's certain characteristics

2:34:16.960 --> 2:34:25.440
 of woke ideology, which is hard lines are drawn between the good guys and the bad guys.

2:34:28.160 --> 2:34:35.120
 And basically everyone is a bad guy except the people that are very loudly nonstop saying that

2:34:35.120 --> 2:34:47.200
 they're the good guy. And that applies for racism, for sexism, for gender politics,

2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:54.960
 identity politics, all that kind of stuff. Is there any parallels between Marxian economics

2:34:54.960 --> 2:35:00.160
 and Marxist ideology and whatever is being called Marxism on Twitter?

2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:05.440
 WOLFF No, not much. One of the consequences

2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:13.120
 of the taboo after World War II is that Marxism, like socialism and communism, become swear words.

2:35:13.120 --> 2:35:20.480
 It's like calling somebody, well, I won't use bad language, but using a four letter word to describe

2:35:20.480 --> 2:35:26.720
 somebody. So instead of calling them this or that, you call them a Marxist. In many circles,

2:35:26.720 --> 2:35:32.880
 this is even worse than whatever other adjective you might have used, but it doesn't have a

2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:41.680
 particular meaning that I can assess. The closest you get is your little list. It is somebody who is

2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:50.640
 concerned about race and sex and sexual orientation, gender and all of those things,

2:35:50.640 --> 2:35:59.360
 and wants there to be transgendered bathrooms. And I don't like any of these people, so I slap

2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:07.120
 the word Marxism or the phrase cultural Marxism, because it isn't Marxism about getting more money

2:36:07.120 --> 2:36:14.320
 or controlling the industry or all those things that dimly we know Marxists somehow are concerned

2:36:14.320 --> 2:36:19.120
 about. So this is odd, since they don't know much about Marxism. I've always been interested

2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:25.360
 in culture. I mean, Lukacs, the man I mentioned to you before, Gramsci, that's what they're famous

2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:32.560
 for, the analysis of what Marxism particularly has to say about culture. Gramsci writes at great

2:36:32.560 --> 2:36:39.200
 length about the Catholic Church, about theater and painting in Italy and on and on. I mean,

2:36:40.240 --> 2:36:43.680
 this is just ignorance talking. They don't know anything about that. They wouldn't know what the

2:36:43.680 --> 2:36:51.120
 names are. It's a label that summarizes, kind of a shorthand, I'm against all of this. I don't

2:36:51.120 --> 2:36:57.360
 want to be told that there's ugly racism in this country, and it always has been, or sexism, or

2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:06.480
 phobia against gay people, whatever it is that's agitating them. Marxism or socialism,

2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:13.760
 I mean, it's just like socialism is the post office. It is a mentality. Well, but I don't

2:37:13.760 --> 2:37:20.640
 blame them. I mean, it's childish. It's mean spirited. But it comes out of the fact no one

2:37:20.640 --> 2:37:26.800
 ever sat them down and said, you know, here is this tradition. It's got these kinds of things

2:37:26.800 --> 2:37:33.280
 that people kind of share and these big differences. Look, an intelligent society,

2:37:33.280 --> 2:37:40.560
 which this country is, could have and should have done that. It was fear and a kind of terror that

2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:45.520
 made them behave in the way they did, and we're now seeing it. Having said that, there is such a

2:37:45.520 --> 2:37:58.320
 thing as cultural Marxism. What that is is simply those Marxists who devoted themselves to analyzing

2:37:58.320 --> 2:38:07.600
 how it is that a particular culture is, on the one hand, shaped by capitalism and, on the other hand,

2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:14.560
 it becomes a condition for capitalism to survive and grow. In other words, how do we analyze the

2:38:14.560 --> 2:38:24.880
 interaction between the class struggle on the job and attitude towards sexuality, or movements in

2:38:24.880 --> 2:38:32.400
 music, or whatever else culture. And there are Georg Lukács, this Hungarian, great name in there,

2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:38.640
 the greatest of all the names, Antonio Gramsci. And a modern name, just died a couple years ago,

2:38:38.640 --> 2:38:46.480
 a British intellectual named Stuart Hall, H A L L. If I were teaching, which I have done,

2:38:46.480 --> 2:38:55.280
 a course in cultural Marxism, those would be three major blocks on the syllabus. I would give you

2:38:55.280 --> 2:39:02.560
 articles and books to read of their stuff, because it has been so seminal in provoking many, many

2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:07.040
 others. So there is something to be said and understood about the kind of culture that

2:39:07.040 --> 2:39:13.360
 capitalism creates and the kind of culture that enables capitalism. Yes, and Marxists are

2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:18.320
 particularly those who like to look at that interaction. In other words, they are interested

2:39:18.320 --> 2:39:24.080
 in how capitalism shapes culture and how culture shapes capitalism. There is another name, I

2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:34.720
 forgot. Stuart Hall is British, Gramsci is Italian, Lukács is Hungarian. The German is Walter Benjamin,

2:39:34.720 --> 2:39:44.240
 B E N J A M I N. He was a member of the Frankfurt School, which is a huge school of Marxism that

2:39:44.240 --> 2:39:49.600
 developed in Frankfurt, Germany, and that has a lot of people, many of whom were interested in

2:39:49.600 --> 2:39:56.560
 cultural questions. It was a bit of a reaction against the narrow Marxism that was so focused on

2:39:56.560 --> 2:40:02.080
 economics and politics. There were people who said, you're leaving out very important parts

2:40:02.080 --> 2:40:08.480
 of modern society that are shaping the economy as much as they are shaped by it. And it was that

2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:15.680
 impetus to open Marxism to be more inclusive in what it deemed to be important to understand

2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:20.560
 that this cult, and they call themselves cultural Marxists, but they had a completely different

2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:27.120
 meaning from this. This is just, you know, just bad mouthing, that's all.

2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:33.600
 LW Let me ask a more personal question. So for most of the 20th century, no not most,

2:40:33.600 --> 2:40:39.280
 but a large many decades in the United States as a consequence of the Cold War and before,

2:40:39.840 --> 2:40:46.800
 being a Marxist is one of the worst things you could be. Have you had dark periods in your own

2:40:46.800 --> 2:40:54.400
 life where you've gone to some dark places in your mind where it was difficult, like self doubt,

2:40:54.400 --> 2:41:00.400
 difficult to know, like what the hell am I doing? When you're surrounded by colleagues and people,

2:41:00.400 --> 2:41:06.480
 you said prestigious universities, both personal interest of career, but also as a human being,

2:41:06.480 --> 2:41:14.400
 when everybody, you know, kind of looks at you funny because you're studying this thing. Did

2:41:14.400 --> 2:41:16.160
 that ever get you real low?

2:41:16.160 --> 2:41:21.680
 RL No. I know people who had exactly what you said. I mean, your question's perfectly reasonable.

2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:23.920
 If I were you, I'd be asking me that question too.

2:41:23.920 --> 2:41:26.400
 LW And what's wrong with you?

2:41:26.400 --> 2:41:33.440
 RL Nothing wrong with the question. And here's the honest truth. I don't know how anomalous I am. I

2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:41.360
 really don't. But the truth is, no. I have, if my wife was sitting here, she'd tell you what she

2:41:41.360 --> 2:41:47.760
 tells me, which is I have been tremendously lucky in my life, which is true. But then again,

2:41:47.760 --> 2:41:58.320
 luck never is the only explanation for things. That's part of it. What can I say? I didn't choose

2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:03.440
 the time of my birth. I didn't choose the communities in which I grew up or the schools I

2:42:03.440 --> 2:42:04.800
 attended or anything else.

2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:09.440
 RL No, but the fact that there was no courses or extensive courses on Marxian economics.

2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:14.880
 RL But you know, again, I'm Hegel. On the one hand, I was denied good instruction.

2:42:14.880 --> 2:42:21.600
 On the other hand, I had to go out and learn it on my own. And the motivation when you do that is

2:42:21.600 --> 2:42:27.520
 very different. I'm not the student who sits there with my notebook, taking notes of what the great

2:42:27.520 --> 2:42:35.440
 professor says and reading the text and getting ready for the exam. I don't have an exam. I'm

2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:45.520
 doing something slightly risque, you know, kind of romantically different and oppositional. I was

2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:52.960
 able to find always one or two professors that I could talk to outside of the classroom situation,

2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:59.440
 other students who felt enough similar to me that we could get together and read these books and

2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:06.960
 talk about them. I had a number of really fortuitous people who were kind to me and gave me

2:43:06.960 --> 2:43:14.560
 of their time and their effort to teach me along the way. And I've had the benefit that because I

2:43:14.560 --> 2:43:21.920
 went to all these fancy schools, I do know a lot of people who are in high places in this culture.

2:43:21.920 --> 2:43:27.840
 And when I have been put in difficult positions, I often wave my pedicure at them and say,

2:43:27.840 --> 2:43:34.400
 I often wave my pedigree and it works like garlic with the devil. They back away. They back away.

2:43:35.600 --> 2:43:40.480
 Because Americans are very deferential to that kind of academic prestige.

2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:46.160
 But there's a personal psychological thing that seems that you have never been shaken by this. You

2:43:46.160 --> 2:43:53.600
 have just naturally somebody who just has perseverance.

2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:57.440
 WOLFF Well, I would put it, I understand what you're saying, but I would put it a little

2:43:57.440 --> 2:44:08.080
 differently. I think capitalism struck me early on in my life as not that great a system and nothing

2:44:08.080 --> 2:44:20.640
 has happened to change my mind. In other words, the development just kept giving me more and more

2:44:20.640 --> 2:44:29.200
 evidence. And I must say over the last 10 years, what's really changed? The last 10 years. I mean,

2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:35.040
 I can't describe to you how big that change is. And that may be more important than anything else

2:44:35.040 --> 2:44:44.160
 we've discussed. Up until 10 years ago, I would do a public event, an interview on television or

2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:52.080
 a radio thing or give a talk at some conference or something. Once every two or three months,

2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:58.640
 I'd be invited and I would do it, like academics often do. I now do two to three to four

2:44:59.280 --> 2:45:09.680
 interviews every day. So, there's a hunger. How is there hunger? And I want to be honest with you.

2:45:09.680 --> 2:45:15.440
 WOLFF As I say at the end of some of my talks, I allow there to be a kind of a pregnant pause

2:45:16.160 --> 2:45:22.640
 from the podium that I lean into the microphone and I say, with as much smile as I can get,

2:45:23.200 --> 2:45:32.320
 I'm having the time of my life. And that's the truth. That's the truth. I never expected, look,

2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:37.200
 I'm used to teaching a classroom, a seminar for graduate students with eight or nine or 10

2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:44.080
 students or a regular undergraduate class with 30 or an occasional introductory course

2:45:44.080 --> 2:45:51.520
 with a few hundred. I've done all of those things many times. But an audience, you know,

2:45:52.800 --> 2:45:58.080
 that I can count in the hundreds of thousands on YouTube and all of that, no, that's new.

2:45:58.080 --> 2:46:07.600
 LESTER Is there advice you can give, given your bold and nonstandard career and life, advice you

2:46:07.600 --> 2:46:14.160
 can give to high school students, college students about how to have a career like that, or maybe

2:46:14.160 --> 2:46:24.640
 how to have a career or a life they can be proud of? WOLFF Yeah. First of all, my advice is go for

2:46:24.640 --> 2:46:31.520
 it. The conditions for doing that now are infinitely better than they were when I had to do it.

2:46:32.400 --> 2:46:40.800
 And I could do it and I'm happy I did it. Becoming a teacher is one of those decisions I made

2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:48.800
 that I've never regretted. And I've never regretted being a critic of this society,

2:46:48.800 --> 2:46:58.880
 ever. I find it edifying. I find it, I mean, the gratitude people express to me for helping them

2:46:58.880 --> 2:47:04.400
 see kind of what's going on is unbelievably encouraging. I mean, what can I tell you?

2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:08.720
 LESTER So that fills you, that fills you with joy. Pointing out that the Emperor has no clothes

2:47:08.720 --> 2:47:14.720
 fills you. That's a life not just important. WOLFF And you know why? It's because most of the people

2:47:14.720 --> 2:47:21.280
 who say something like that to me are people who, if they had the vocabulary, and some of them do,

2:47:21.920 --> 2:47:28.800
 would say, you know, I thought I was seeing through that outfit that I was wearing. I thought

2:47:28.800 --> 2:47:35.920
 it and they did. And all they needed was a little extra this information or that factoid or this

2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:43.920
 logic. And they have that. And I remember having that too. When I had a teacher who made something

2:47:43.920 --> 2:47:50.640
 clear that had been murky, I always felt gratitude. And now I get that gratitude a good bit.

2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:57.760
 And yes, it is enormously gratifying. And I'm not sure I could get it any other way.

2:48:00.400 --> 2:48:09.040
 I have learned and I'm walking proof that being a critic of society and doing it systematically

2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:15.360
 and sharing it with other people makes for a very good life. A very good life.

2:48:15.360 --> 2:48:23.520
 LESTER Speaking of which, however, one other aspect of human nature is that life comes to an end.

2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:27.680
 Do you think about your death? Are you afraid of it?

2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:36.400
 WOLFF Afraid of it? No. Think about it? Yes. Yes. I'm not afraid. I've always thought,

2:48:36.400 --> 2:48:41.360
 you know, death is hard for the people that are left when you're dead. It's not going to bother

2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:49.200
 you very much. So I worry more about my wife. I'm very attached to my wife. I might mention to you,

2:48:49.200 --> 2:48:58.800
 I got married when I was 23 years old. That's my wife to this day. So I'm lucky because if you get

2:48:58.800 --> 2:49:07.840
 married to anybody in age 23, it's either luck or it isn't. LESTER What role has love played

2:49:07.840 --> 2:49:09.120
 in your life? WOLFF Enormous.

2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:17.280
 Because I came from a family, you know, if your family is political refugees, which mine were,

2:49:17.280 --> 2:49:24.240
 who had to interrupt their lives, moved to another continent, learn another language,

2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:35.200
 find another life, income and job. The disruption goes real deep for any refugee. So my mother and

2:49:35.200 --> 2:49:48.240
 father were both refugees. They met as refugees. So I had to, in a way, make it up to them. I had

2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:56.560
 to be, I was the first child of their younger sister, but the first child. And, you know,

2:49:56.560 --> 2:50:02.320
 there's a lot of psychological pressure on you if you're in that situation. Nobody means you harm,

2:50:02.320 --> 2:50:10.640
 but you've got to do what they couldn't, what was shut off to them in a way they want you to do.

2:50:10.640 --> 2:50:17.200
 It's the closest they're going to get to what they had hoped. And my parents were both university

2:50:17.200 --> 2:50:23.280
 students. My father was a lawyer. My mother had to leave the university to run for her life.

2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:32.400
 So I had to perform. You know, I went to high school here in the United States. I had to get

2:50:32.400 --> 2:50:36.720
 all A's. I had to be on the football team. I had to play the violin in the orchestra. I had to

2:50:36.720 --> 2:50:44.480
 do all these because everything had to be achieved. So I'm an achievement crazy person that

2:50:44.480 --> 2:50:51.440
 way. But that's functional in this dysfunctional society. But on top of that, that's an achievement

2:50:52.320 --> 2:50:58.160
 within the game of this particular society. But then love seems to be a thing that's greater

2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:02.880
 than that game. Is that something that made you a better person? Oh, God, yes. How is it

2:51:04.320 --> 2:51:10.160
 made you a better Marxian and a better human? Everything. Because my wife, by profession,

2:51:10.160 --> 2:51:17.840
 is a psychotherapist. Excellent. I love it. And I needed it. And so I married it. I didn't know

2:51:17.840 --> 2:51:24.400
 what I was doing at the time, but I think as I look back on it, that was more than a little what

2:51:24.400 --> 2:51:32.560
 was going on. And she has tutored me all my life about a whole range of aspects of life that my

2:51:32.560 --> 2:51:42.480
 family never talked about, never dealt with, never at least explicitly engaged in any of that.

2:51:42.480 --> 2:51:48.560
 Because it was all about survival. The immigrant challenge is survival. Survive. And you're so busy

2:51:50.320 --> 2:51:55.280
 that you tell yourself you can't do that. Of course you can. And there are other reasons

2:51:55.280 --> 2:52:01.280
 why you're not going to look at those problems. But the survival is so urgent that you can fool

2:52:01.280 --> 2:52:08.880
 yourself this way. And my parents did that. One last question. What's the meaning of life,

2:52:08.880 --> 2:52:19.280
 Richard Wolff? Why are we here? I will quote you, Mr. Marx. Let's go. Life is struggle. And for me,

2:52:20.400 --> 2:52:29.920
 I have found that to be true. That the struggle, whether it is to build a relationship with your

2:52:29.920 --> 2:52:36.880
 child, I have two children, whether it's to build one with your spouse, whether it's to understand

2:52:36.880 --> 2:52:44.800
 a complicated argument and simplify it so that you can share the pleasure of understanding this

2:52:44.800 --> 2:52:53.440
 relationship to a student or to an audience. It's a struggle to do all those things. But that

2:52:53.440 --> 2:53:02.640
 network of struggles, that makes life interesting, intriguing, and satisfying.

2:53:02.640 --> 2:53:04.000
 And meaningful.

2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:05.040
 Very meaningful.

2:53:05.040 --> 2:53:09.520
 And that latter thing, I got to say, you do masterfully. You're one of the great communicators

2:53:09.520 --> 2:53:14.640
 and educators out there today. And it's a huge honor that you would sit with me for so many hours.

2:53:14.640 --> 2:53:15.440
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:19.680
 This is awesome. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Wolff.

 And now, let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.

2:53:28.240 --> 2:53:35.760
 The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.

2:53:35.760 --> 2:53:51.440
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
