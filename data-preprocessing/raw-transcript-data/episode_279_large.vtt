00:00.000 --> 00:01.720
 I don't know what it's like to be an alien.

00:01.720 --> 00:03.040
 I would like to know.

00:03.040 --> 00:05.560
 Two alien civilizations coexisting on a planet,

00:05.560 --> 00:07.080
 what's that look like exactly?

00:07.080 --> 00:09.720
 When you see them and they see you,

00:09.720 --> 00:11.440
 you're assuming they have vision,

00:11.440 --> 00:14.520
 they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.360
 That's a lot of assumptions they're making.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.660
 What human level intelligence has done is quite different.

00:19.660 --> 00:21.600
 It's not just that we remember states

00:21.600 --> 00:23.880
 that the universe has existed in before,

00:23.880 --> 00:26.600
 it's that we can imagine ones that have never existed

00:26.600 --> 00:29.200
 and we can actually make them come into existence.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.560
 So you can travel back in time sometimes.

00:32.560 --> 00:33.400
 Yes.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.040
 You travel forward in time to travel back.

00:35.040 --> 00:35.880
 Yes.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.320
 The following is a conversation

00:40.320 --> 00:42.720
 with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.280
 They have each been on this podcast once before

00:45.280 --> 00:48.400
 individually and now for their second time,

00:48.400 --> 00:49.880
 they're here together.

00:49.880 --> 00:53.960
 Sarah is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.760
 Lee is a chemist and if I may say so,

00:57.760 --> 01:01.580
 the real life manifestation of Rick from Rick and Morty.

01:01.580 --> 01:04.360
 They both are interested in how life originates

01:04.360 --> 01:08.520
 and develops both life here on earth and alien life,

01:08.520 --> 01:11.240
 including intelligent alien civilizations

01:11.240 --> 01:13.240
 out there in the cosmos.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.520
 They are colleagues and friends

01:15.520 --> 01:18.000
 who love to explore, disagree and debate

01:18.000 --> 01:20.200
 nuanced points about alien life.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.560
 And so we're calling this an alien debate.

01:24.560 --> 01:27.280
 Very few questions to me are as fascinating

01:27.280 --> 01:29.000
 as what do aliens look like?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.640
 How do we recognize them?

01:30.640 --> 01:32.160
 How do we talk to them?

01:32.160 --> 01:34.920
 And how do we make sense of life here on earth

01:34.920 --> 01:37.120
 in the context of all possible life forms

01:37.120 --> 01:38.640
 that are out there?

01:38.640 --> 01:41.320
 Treating these questions with the seriousness

01:41.320 --> 01:44.240
 and rigor they deserve is what I hope to do

01:44.240 --> 01:48.200
 with this conversation and future ones like it.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.400
 Our world is shrouded in mystery.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.720
 We must first be humble to acknowledge this

01:52.720 --> 01:54.840
 and then be bold and diving in

01:54.840 --> 01:57.360
 and trying to figure things out anyway.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.480
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

 To support it, please check out our sponsors

02:01.560 --> 02:02.960

02:02.960 --> 02:07.700
 And now, dear friends, here's Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.080
 First of all, welcome back Sarah, welcome back Lee.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.680
 You guys, I'm a huge fan of yours.

02:12.680 --> 02:13.680
 You're incredible people.

02:13.680 --> 02:14.880
 I should say thank you to Sarah

02:14.880 --> 02:17.320
 for wearing really awesome boots.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.660
 We'll probably overlay a picture later on,

02:19.660 --> 02:21.720
 but why the hell didn't you dress up, Lee?

02:21.720 --> 02:22.560
 No, I'm just kidding.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.400
 This is me dressed up.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.280
 You were saying that you're pink,

02:25.280 --> 02:26.900
 that your thing is pink.

02:26.900 --> 02:30.200
 My thing is black and white, the simplicity of it.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.140
 Where's the pink?

02:31.140 --> 02:33.400
 When did the pink, when did it hit you

02:33.400 --> 02:34.240
 that pink is your color?

02:34.240 --> 02:39.240
 I became pink about, I don't know, actually, maybe 2017.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.320
 Did you know me when you first?

02:42.320 --> 02:44.040
 I think I met you pre pink.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.600
 Yeah, yeah, so about 2017, I think.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.920
 I just decided I was boring

02:48.920 --> 02:50.360
 and I needed to make a statement

02:50.360 --> 02:53.840
 and red was too bright, so I went pink, salmon pink.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.320
 Well, I think you were always pink.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.520
 You just found yourself in 2017.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.540
 There's an amazing photo of him

03:00.540 --> 03:02.280
 where there's like everybody in their black gown

03:02.280 --> 03:03.640
 and he's just wearing the pink pants.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.280
 Oh, that was at the Waggonen University.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.320
 It's totally nuts.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.760
 100 year anniversary, they got me to give the plenary

03:08.760 --> 03:10.800
 and they didn't find that outfit for me,

03:10.800 --> 03:13.120
 so they were all wearing these silly hats and these gowns

03:13.120 --> 03:14.360
 and there was me dressed up in pink

03:14.360 --> 03:15.960
 looking like a complete idiot.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.000
 We're definitely gonna have to find that picture

03:18.000 --> 03:22.200
 and overlay it, big full screen, slow motion.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.680
 All right, let's talk about aliens.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.080
 We'll find places we disagree and places we agree,

03:28.160 --> 03:31.300
 life, intelligence, consciousness, universe, all of that.

03:31.300 --> 03:35.520
 Let's start with a tweet from Neil deGrasse Tyson

03:35.520 --> 03:39.660
 stating his skepticism about aliens wanting to visit Earth.

03:39.660 --> 03:44.040
 Quote, how egocentric of us to think that space aliens

03:44.040 --> 03:47.560
 who have mastered interstellar travel across the galaxy

03:47.560 --> 03:51.640
 would give, pardon the French,

03:51.640 --> 03:54.880
 would give a shit about humans on Earth.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.980
 So let me ask you, would aliens care about visiting Earth,

03:57.980 --> 04:00.500
 observing, communicating with humans?

04:00.500 --> 04:05.080
 Let's take a perspective of aliens, maybe Sarah first.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.400
 Are we interesting in the whole spectrum

04:08.400 --> 04:10.240
 of life in the universe?

04:11.080 --> 04:13.780
 I'm completely biased, at least as far as I think right now

04:13.780 --> 04:16.360
 we're the most interesting thing in the universe.

04:16.360 --> 04:21.360
 So I would expect based on the intrinsic curiosity

04:21.560 --> 04:25.040
 that we have and how much I think that's deeply related

04:25.040 --> 04:26.680
 to the physics of what we are,

04:26.680 --> 04:29.920
 that other intelligent aliens would want to seek out

04:29.920 --> 04:32.280
 examples of the phenomena they are

04:32.280 --> 04:34.460
 to understand themselves better.

04:34.460 --> 04:37.240
 And I think that's kind of a natural thing to want to do.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.400
 And I don't think there's any kind of judgment

04:39.400 --> 04:42.040
 on it being a lesser being or not.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.440
 It's like saying you have nothing to learn

04:43.440 --> 04:45.160
 by talking to a baby.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.040
 You have lots to learn, probably more than you do

04:47.040 --> 04:48.360
 talking to somebody that's 90.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.440
 So yeah, so I think they absolutely would.

04:51.440 --> 04:55.280
 So whatever the phenomena is that is human,

04:55.280 --> 04:57.680
 there will be an inkling of the same kind of phenomena

04:57.680 --> 05:00.800
 within alien species and they will be seeking that same.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.440
 I think there's gotta be some features of us

05:02.440 --> 05:03.600
 that are universal.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.520
 And I think the ones that are most interesting,

05:06.520 --> 05:08.660
 and I hope I live in an interesting universe,

05:08.660 --> 05:13.660
 are the ones that are driven by our curiosity

05:13.660 --> 05:18.380
 and the fact that our intelligence allows us to do things

05:18.380 --> 05:19.740
 that the universe wouldn't be able to do

05:19.740 --> 05:21.300
 without things like us existing.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.980
 We're gonna define a lot of terms.

05:23.980 --> 05:25.820
 One of them is interesting.

05:25.820 --> 05:26.660
 Yes.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.180
 That's a very interesting term to try to define.

05:29.180 --> 05:30.420
 Ali, what do you think?

05:30.420 --> 05:33.260
 Are humans interesting for aliens?

05:33.260 --> 05:34.580
 Well, let's take it from our perspective.

05:34.580 --> 05:37.500
 We want to go find aliens as a species quite desperately.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.500
 So if we put the shoe on the other foot,

05:39.500 --> 05:41.140
 of course we're interesting.

05:41.140 --> 05:44.180
 But I'm wondering and assuming

05:44.180 --> 05:45.940
 that we're at the right technological capabilities

05:45.940 --> 05:48.940
 to go searching for aliens, then that's interesting.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.300
 So what I mean is,

05:50.300 --> 05:52.980
 if there needs to be a massive leap in technology

05:52.980 --> 05:54.260
 that we don't have,

05:55.420 --> 05:58.620
 how will aliens prioritize coming to Earth and other places?

05:58.620 --> 06:02.300
 But I do think that they would come and find us

06:02.300 --> 06:04.740
 because they'd want to find out about our culture,

06:04.740 --> 06:06.740
 what things are universal.

06:06.740 --> 06:07.580
 I mean, I'm a chemist.

06:07.580 --> 06:09.980
 I would say, well, is the chemistry universal, right?

06:09.980 --> 06:11.780
 Are the creatures that we're going to find

06:11.780 --> 06:13.540
 making all this commotion,

06:13.540 --> 06:15.300
 are they made of the same stuff?

06:17.220 --> 06:19.180
 What does their science look like?

06:20.260 --> 06:22.540
 Are they off planet yet?

06:22.540 --> 06:25.860
 I guess there's, so I think that Neil deGrasse Tyson

06:25.860 --> 06:27.380
 is being slightly pessimistic

06:27.380 --> 06:31.780
 and maybe trying to play the tune

06:31.780 --> 06:33.140
 that the universe is vast

06:33.140 --> 06:35.140
 and it's not worth them coming here.

06:35.140 --> 06:37.340
 I don't think that,

06:37.340 --> 06:39.740
 but I just worry that maybe we don't have

06:39.740 --> 06:40.780
 the ability to talk to them.

06:40.780 --> 06:42.260
 We don't have the universal translator.

06:42.260 --> 06:43.460
 We don't have the right physics,

06:43.460 --> 06:45.180
 but sure, they should come.

06:45.180 --> 06:46.100
 We are interesting.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.460
 I want to know if they exist.

06:47.460 --> 06:49.500
 It would make it easier if they just came.

06:50.620 --> 06:54.300
 So again, I'm going to use your tweets

06:54.300 --> 06:56.100
 like it's Shakespeare and analyze it.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.300
 So Sarah tweeted,

06:58.340 --> 07:01.500
 thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.500
 So how much do you think aliens

07:04.500 --> 07:07.660
 are thinking about other aliens, including humans?

07:07.660 --> 07:11.980
 So you said, we humans want to visit.

07:13.180 --> 07:15.260
 Like we're longing to connect with aliens.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.100
 Why is that?

07:16.100 --> 07:16.940
 Can you introspect that?

07:16.940 --> 07:18.620
 Is that an obvious thing that we should be,

07:18.620 --> 07:20.740
 like what are we hoping to understand

07:20.740 --> 07:23.580
 by meeting aliens exactly?

07:23.580 --> 07:25.500
 Asking as an introvert, it's like,

07:25.500 --> 07:26.740
 I ask myself this all the time.

07:26.740 --> 07:30.260
 Why go out on a Friday night to meet people?

07:30.260 --> 07:31.100
 What are you hoping to find?

07:31.100 --> 07:33.700
 I think the curiosity, so when I saw Sarah put that tweet,

07:33.700 --> 07:35.300
 I think I answered it actually as well,

07:35.300 --> 07:38.900
 which was we are thinking about trying to make contact.

07:38.900 --> 07:41.780
 So they almost certainly are,

07:41.780 --> 07:43.500
 but maybe there's a number of classes.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.780
 There are those aliens that have not yet made contact

07:46.780 --> 07:48.980
 with other aliens like us.

07:48.980 --> 07:51.780
 Those aliens have made contact with just one other alien

07:51.780 --> 07:55.060
 and maybe it's an anticlimax and slime, right?

07:55.060 --> 07:56.580
 And aliens have made contact

07:56.580 --> 07:59.780
 with not just one set of intelligent species, but several.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.140
 That must be amazing actually.

08:01.140 --> 08:03.380
 Literally there are some place in the universe,

08:03.380 --> 08:05.060
 there must be one alien civilization.

08:05.060 --> 08:07.060
 Let's not make contact with not one,

08:07.060 --> 08:09.740
 but two other intelligent civilizations.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.180
 So they must be thinking about it.

08:12.180 --> 08:16.540
 There must be entire degree courses on aliens,

08:16.540 --> 08:21.540
 thinking about aliens and universal cultural norms.

08:21.540 --> 08:24.540
 Do you think they will survive the meeting?

08:24.540 --> 08:26.580
 And by the way, Lee did respond saying,

08:26.580 --> 08:28.580
 that's all the universe wants.

08:28.580 --> 08:31.980
 So Sarah said, thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.

08:31.980 --> 08:34.500
 Lee said, that's all the universe wants.

08:34.500 --> 08:38.740
 And then Sarah responded, cheeky universe we live in.

08:38.740 --> 08:42.180
 So cheeky is a cheeky version of the word interesting,

08:42.180 --> 08:45.260
 all of which we'll try to define mathematically.

08:45.260 --> 08:47.180
 Cheeky might be harder than interesting.

08:47.180 --> 08:48.620
 Because there's humor in that too.

08:48.620 --> 08:49.500
 Yes.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.460
 I think there's a mathematical definition of humor,

08:51.460 --> 08:52.500
 but we'll talk about that in a bit.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.460
 Oh interesting.

08:53.460 --> 08:54.620
 Yeah, sure there is, yeah.

08:54.620 --> 08:57.740
 So if you're a graduate student alien

08:57.740 --> 09:00.780
 looking at multiple alien civilizations,

09:00.780 --> 09:03.580
 do you think they survive the encounters?

09:03.580 --> 09:06.580
 I think there's a tendency to anthropomorphize

09:06.580 --> 09:08.140
 a lot of the discussions about alien life,

09:08.140 --> 09:10.140
 which is a really big challenge.

09:10.140 --> 09:13.100
 So usually when I'm trying to think about these problems,

09:13.100 --> 09:16.500
 I don't try to think about us as humans,

09:16.500 --> 09:18.260
 but us as an example of phenomenon

09:18.260 --> 09:21.340
 that exists in the universe that we have yet to explain.

09:21.340 --> 09:24.460
 And it doesn't seem to be the case

09:24.460 --> 09:27.620
 that if I think about the features,

09:27.620 --> 09:30.500
 I would argue are most universal about that phenomenon,

09:30.500 --> 09:31.780
 that there's any reason to think

09:31.780 --> 09:35.020
 that a first encounter with another lineage

09:35.020 --> 09:38.860
 or example of life would be antagonistic.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.700
 I think, yeah.

09:42.700 --> 09:46.020
 And I think there's this kind of assumption,

09:46.020 --> 09:49.340
 I mean, going back to Neil deGrasse Tyson's quote,

09:49.340 --> 09:51.220
 I mean, it kind of bothers me because there's a,

09:51.220 --> 09:52.100
 I mean, I'm a physicist,

09:52.100 --> 09:53.700
 so I know we have a lot of egos

09:53.700 --> 09:56.260
 about how much we can describe the world,

09:56.260 --> 09:57.700
 but that there's this like,

09:57.700 --> 09:59.660
 because we understand fundamental physics so well,

09:59.660 --> 10:02.740
 we understand alien life and we can kind of extrapolate,

10:02.740 --> 10:04.620
 and I just think that we don't.

10:04.620 --> 10:06.780
 And the quest there is really, you know,

10:06.780 --> 10:09.220
 really to understand something totally new

10:09.220 --> 10:11.700
 about the universe, and that thing just happens to be us.

10:11.700 --> 10:12.660
 I agree, I agree.

10:12.660 --> 10:13.900
 There's something else more profound.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.980
 I think Neil was just being, again,

10:15.980 --> 10:17.900
 he's just trying to stir the pot.

10:17.900 --> 10:21.380
 I would say from a contingency point of view,

10:21.380 --> 10:22.700
 I want to know how many ways

10:22.700 --> 10:26.380
 does the universe build structures, build memories, right?

10:26.380 --> 10:29.140
 And then I want to know if those memories

10:29.140 --> 10:30.100
 can interact with each other.

10:30.100 --> 10:33.660
 And if you have two different origins of life

10:33.660 --> 10:34.780
 and then origins of intelligence,

10:34.780 --> 10:36.740
 and then these things become conscious,

10:36.740 --> 10:37.940
 surely you want to go and talk to them

10:37.940 --> 10:41.900
 and figure out what commonalities you share.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.980
 And it might be that we're just unable to conceive

10:43.980 --> 10:44.940
 of what they're going to look like.

10:44.940 --> 10:46.380
 They're just going to be completely different,

10:46.380 --> 10:48.500
 you know, infrastructure,

10:48.500 --> 10:50.420
 but surely we'll want to go and find out a map.

10:50.420 --> 10:52.420
 And surely curiosity is a property

10:52.420 --> 10:55.100
 that evolution has made on earth.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.140
 And I can't see any reason

10:57.140 --> 10:58.380
 that it won't happen elsewhere

10:58.380 --> 11:00.260
 because curiosity probably exists

11:00.260 --> 11:03.700
 because we want to find innovations in the environment.

11:03.700 --> 11:08.620
 We want to use that information to help our technology.

11:08.620 --> 11:10.780
 And also curiosity is like planning for the future.

11:10.780 --> 11:12.100
 Are they going to fight us?

11:12.100 --> 11:15.140
 Are we going to be able to trade with them?

11:15.140 --> 11:17.020
 So I think that Neil's just, I don't know,

11:17.020 --> 11:19.340
 maybe, you know, I mean, give a shit.

11:19.340 --> 11:22.620
 That's really, I think that's really down on earth, right?

11:22.620 --> 11:25.020
 How would aliens categorize humans, do you think?

11:25.940 --> 11:26.780
 How would we?

11:26.780 --> 11:28.140
 So let's put it the other way around.

11:28.140 --> 11:29.100
 Slime category.

11:29.100 --> 11:30.460
 Maybe, no, no, no.

11:30.460 --> 11:33.260
 Maybe we could, the thing is a bit odd, right?

11:33.260 --> 11:35.500
 Look at Instagram, Twitter,

11:35.500 --> 11:36.820
 all these people taking selfies.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.380
 I mean, does the universe

11:38.380 --> 11:40.740
 is the ultimate state of consciousness,

11:40.740 --> 11:42.860
 thinking beings that take photographs themselves

11:42.860 --> 11:44.220
 and upload them to an internet

11:44.220 --> 11:46.940
 with other thinking beings looking at each other's photos.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.540
 So I think that they will be.

11:49.540 --> 11:50.980
 What's wrong with that?

11:50.980 --> 11:53.540
 I did not say there was anything wrong with it.

11:53.540 --> 11:56.700
 It's consciousness manifested at scale.

11:56.700 --> 11:58.420
 Selfies, Instagram.

11:58.420 --> 12:00.060
 It's like the mirror test at scale.

12:00.060 --> 12:02.580
 Yeah, I do think that curiosity

12:02.580 --> 12:04.220
 is really the driving force

12:04.220 --> 12:05.940
 for why we have our technology, right?

12:05.940 --> 12:08.500
 If we weren't curious, we wouldn't go out, left the cave.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.580
 So I think that,

12:11.660 --> 12:14.300
 so I think that Neil's got it completely wrong, in fact.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.500
 Actually, of course they'd want to come here.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.900
 It doesn't mean they are coming here.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.460
 We've seen evidence for that.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.940
 I guess we can argue about that, right?

12:21.940 --> 12:23.820
 But I think that we want,

12:23.820 --> 12:26.220
 I desperately, and I know that Sarah does too,

12:26.220 --> 12:28.460
 but I won't speak for you, you're here.

12:28.460 --> 12:30.020
 I desperately want to have missions

12:30.020 --> 12:32.620
 to look for life in the solar system right now.

12:32.620 --> 12:34.780
 I want to map life over the solar system.

12:34.780 --> 12:36.340
 And then I want to understand how we can go

12:36.340 --> 12:39.900
 and find life as quickly as possible at the nearest stars,

12:39.900 --> 12:41.660
 and also at the same time do it in the lab,

12:41.660 --> 12:44.380
 just to compensate, you know?

12:44.380 --> 12:45.660
 So, sure.

12:45.660 --> 12:47.380
 Yeah, just one more point on this.

12:47.380 --> 12:49.900
 If you think about sort of what's driven

12:49.900 --> 12:53.340
 the most features of our own evolution as a species,

12:53.340 --> 12:55.060
 and try to map that to alien species,

12:55.060 --> 12:57.980
 I always think like optimism is what's gonna get us furthest.

12:57.980 --> 13:00.180
 And so I think a lot of people always think

13:00.180 --> 13:02.660
 that it's like war and conflict is gonna be the way

13:02.660 --> 13:06.060
 that alien species will expand out into the cosmos.

13:06.060 --> 13:08.340
 But if you just look at how we're doing it

13:08.340 --> 13:09.500
 and how we talk about it,

13:09.500 --> 13:12.100
 so is our future in space is always, you know,

13:12.100 --> 13:14.300
 built from narratives of optimism.

13:14.300 --> 13:18.060
 And so it seems to me that if intelligence does get out

13:18.060 --> 13:20.380
 in the universe, that it's gonna be more optimism

13:20.380 --> 13:22.260
 and curiosity driving it than war and conflict,

13:22.260 --> 13:25.540
 because those things end up crushing you.

13:25.540 --> 13:28.020
 So there might be some selective filter.

13:28.020 --> 13:29.460
 Of course, this is me being an optimist.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.900
 I'm a half full kind of person, but.

13:31.900 --> 13:35.500
 Is it obvious that curiosity, not obvious,

13:35.500 --> 13:36.340
 but what do you think?

13:36.340 --> 13:38.860
 Is curiosity a more powerful force in the universe

13:38.860 --> 13:43.260
 than violence and the will to power?

13:43.260 --> 13:47.300
 So, because you said you framed curiosity as a way

13:47.300 --> 13:50.140
 to also plan on how to avoid violence,

13:50.140 --> 13:52.460
 which is an interesting framing of curiosity.

13:52.460 --> 13:55.820
 But I could also argue that violence

13:55.820 --> 14:00.500
 is a pretty productive way to operate in the world,

14:00.500 --> 14:02.620
 which is like, that's one way to protect yourself.

14:02.620 --> 14:04.160
 The best defense is offense.

14:05.860 --> 14:07.900
 I'm not qualified to answer this, but I'll have a go.

14:07.900 --> 14:10.580
 I think violence, let's not talk about violence.

14:10.580 --> 14:12.420
 That's the summary of this podcast.

14:12.420 --> 14:16.620
 I would, yeah, maybe, I would, let's not call it violence,

14:16.620 --> 14:17.820
 but I call it erasure.

14:17.820 --> 14:20.100
 So if you think about the way evolution works,

14:20.100 --> 14:23.560
 or the way, obviously talk about assembly theory,

14:23.560 --> 14:24.400
 but I won't.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.500
 So if you say you build,

14:26.500 --> 14:29.140
 curiosity allows you to open up avenues, new graphs, right?

14:29.140 --> 14:31.520
 So new features you can play.

14:33.020 --> 14:36.180
 The ability to erase those things allows you to start again

14:36.180 --> 14:37.500
 and do some pruning.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.820
 So the universe, I think curiosity gets you furthest.

14:39.820 --> 14:41.740
 Curiosity gets you rockets that land.

14:41.740 --> 14:43.840
 It gets you robots that can make drugs.

14:43.840 --> 14:48.540
 It gets you poetry and art and communication.

14:48.540 --> 14:52.220
 And then, I often think wouldn't it be great in bureaucracy

14:52.220 --> 14:54.820
 to have another world war, not literally a world war now,

14:54.820 --> 14:57.260
 please no world war, but the equivalent

14:57.260 --> 14:59.740
 so we get remove all the admin bureaucracy, right?

14:59.740 --> 15:02.080
 All the admin violence, get rid of it and start again.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.240
 Do you know what I mean?

15:03.240 --> 15:06.220
 Because you get layers and you get redundant systems built.

15:06.220 --> 15:09.280
 So actually a reset, let's not call it violence,

15:09.280 --> 15:13.980
 a reset in some aspects of our culture

15:13.980 --> 15:18.260
 and our technology allows us to then build

15:18.260 --> 15:19.820
 more important things about the,

15:19.820 --> 15:22.220
 because how many cookies do I have to click on?

15:22.220 --> 15:26.860
 How many extra clicks do I have in the future of my life

15:26.860 --> 15:29.500
 that I could remove and a bit of a reset

15:29.500 --> 15:33.140
 would allow us to start again.

15:33.140 --> 15:37.100
 And maybe that's how I suppose our encounter aliens will be.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.380
 Maybe they will fight with us and say,

15:38.380 --> 15:41.180
 oh, we're not as excited by you as we thought.

15:41.180 --> 15:42.580
 We'll just get rid of you.

15:42.580 --> 15:44.100
 So they might want to reset Earth.

15:44.100 --> 15:44.940
 Yeah, why not?

15:44.940 --> 15:47.340
 To be like, let's see how the evolution runs again.

15:47.340 --> 15:51.700
 This seems like they've, there's nothing new happening here.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.980
 They're observing for a while.

15:52.980 --> 15:55.900
 This is just not, let's keep it more fun.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.500
 Let's start with the fish again.

15:59.180 --> 16:04.180
 I like how you equated violence to resetting your cookies.

16:04.220 --> 16:06.340
 I suppose that's the kind of violence.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.780
 In this modern world where words are violence,

16:08.780 --> 16:10.620
 resetting cookies is the kind of violence.

16:10.620 --> 16:11.460
 I don't know where that came from.

16:11.460 --> 16:12.280
 I'm completely, yeah.

16:12.280 --> 16:14.260
 That's poetic, really.

16:14.260 --> 16:17.460
 Okay, so let's talk about life.

16:17.460 --> 16:19.300
 What is life?

16:19.300 --> 16:20.660
 What is non life?

16:20.660 --> 16:23.540
 What is the line between life and non life?

16:23.540 --> 16:24.660
 And maybe at any point,

16:24.660 --> 16:27.900
 we can pull in ideas of assembly theory.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.980
 Like how do we start to try to define life?

16:29.980 --> 16:32.100
 And for people listening,

16:32.100 --> 16:35.340
 so Sarah identifies as a physicist

16:35.340 --> 16:37.820
 and Lee identifies as a chemist.

16:37.820 --> 16:41.540
 Of course, they are very interdisciplinary in nature

16:41.540 --> 16:45.820
 in general, but so what is life?

16:46.860 --> 16:47.700
 Sarah.

16:49.140 --> 16:50.420
 I love asking that question

16:50.420 --> 16:52.020
 because it's so absurdly big.

16:52.020 --> 16:53.060
 I know, I love it.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.940
 It's my absolute favorite question in the whole universe.

16:56.940 --> 17:00.540
 So I think I have three ways of describing it right now.

17:00.540 --> 17:01.740
 And I like to say all three of them

17:01.740 --> 17:03.900
 because people latch onto different facets of them.

17:03.900 --> 17:07.060
 And so the whole idea of what Lee and I are trying to work on

17:07.060 --> 17:08.420
 is not to try to define life,

17:08.420 --> 17:10.140
 but to try to find a more fundamental theory

17:10.140 --> 17:12.220
 that explains what the phenomenon we call life.

17:12.220 --> 17:14.140
 And then it should explain certain attributes

17:14.140 --> 17:15.860
 and you end up having a really different framing

17:15.860 --> 17:17.300
 than the way people usually talk.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.660
 So the way I talk about it three different ways.

17:20.620 --> 17:22.860
 Life is how information structures matter

17:22.860 --> 17:24.100
 across space and time.

17:25.140 --> 17:29.820
 Life is, I don't know, this one's from you actually,

17:29.820 --> 17:32.540
 simple machines constructing more complex machines.

17:32.540 --> 17:35.860
 And the other one is the physics of existence,

17:35.860 --> 17:38.740
 so to speak, which is life is the mechanism

17:38.740 --> 17:41.540
 the universe has to explore the space of what's possible.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.740
 That's my favorite.

17:43.740 --> 17:46.700
 So can I, yeah, yeah, can I add on to that?

17:46.700 --> 17:49.380
 Okay, can you say the physics one again?

17:49.380 --> 17:50.980
 Physics of existence.

17:50.980 --> 17:52.140
 Yeah, the physics of existence.

17:52.140 --> 17:53.780
 I don't know what to call it.

17:53.780 --> 17:55.620
 If you think of all the things that could exist,

17:55.620 --> 17:57.180
 only certain things do exist.

17:57.180 --> 18:01.260
 And I think life is basically the universe's mechanism

18:01.260 --> 18:03.460
 of bringing things into physically existing

18:03.460 --> 18:04.420
 in the moment now.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.660
 Yeah.

18:06.660 --> 18:08.500
 Yeah, and what's another one?

18:08.500 --> 18:09.740
 So we were debating this the other day.

18:09.740 --> 18:14.420
 So if you think about a universe that has nothing in it,

18:14.420 --> 18:16.100
 that's kind of hard to conceive of, right?

18:16.100 --> 18:18.380
 Because, and this is where physicists really go wrong.

18:18.380 --> 18:20.900
 They think of a universe with nothing in it, they can't.

18:20.900 --> 18:21.740
 And you think.

18:21.740 --> 18:22.940
 But nonexistence is really hard to think.

18:22.940 --> 18:23.780
 Nonexistence, yeah.

18:23.780 --> 18:26.940
 And then you think of a universe with everything in it,

18:26.940 --> 18:28.020
 that's really hard.

18:28.020 --> 18:30.380
 And you just have this white blob, right?

18:30.380 --> 18:31.620
 It's just everything.

18:31.620 --> 18:34.380
 But the fact we have discrete stuff in the universe,

18:34.380 --> 18:38.100
 Beyonce planets, so you've got stars, space, planet stuff,

18:38.100 --> 18:41.900
 right, the boring stuff, but I would define life

18:41.900 --> 18:46.300
 or say that life is where there are architectures,

18:46.300 --> 18:48.380
 any architectures, and we should stop fixating

18:48.380 --> 18:52.340
 on what is building the architectures to start with.

18:52.340 --> 18:55.340
 And the fact that the universe has discrete things

18:55.340 --> 18:57.860
 and it is completely mind blowing.

18:57.860 --> 19:01.060
 If you think about it for one second,

19:01.060 --> 19:03.780
 the fact there's any objects at all,

19:03.780 --> 19:07.660
 and there's, because for me, the object is a proxy

19:07.660 --> 19:10.540
 for a machine that built it,

19:10.540 --> 19:14.860
 some information being moved around,

19:14.860 --> 19:18.700
 actuation, sensing, getting resource,

19:18.700 --> 19:20.220
 and building these objects.

19:20.220 --> 19:23.540
 So for me, everyone's been obsessing about the machine,

19:23.540 --> 19:27.420
 but I'm like, forget the machine, let's see the objects.

19:27.420 --> 19:30.260
 And I think in a way that assembly theory,

19:30.260 --> 19:31.900
 we realized maybe a few months ago

19:31.900 --> 19:35.620
 that assembly theory actually does account for the soul

19:35.620 --> 19:37.860
 and the objects, not mystically like say,

19:37.860 --> 19:39.500
 Sheldrake's morphic resonance,

19:39.500 --> 19:42.940
 or Leibniz's monadology, seeing souls in things.

19:42.940 --> 19:45.700
 But when you see an object, and I've said this before,

19:45.700 --> 19:49.260
 but this object is evidence of thought,

19:49.260 --> 19:51.300
 and then there's a lineage of those objects.

19:51.300 --> 19:54.500
 So I think what is fascinating is that,

19:54.500 --> 19:55.820
 you put it much more elegantly,

19:55.820 --> 19:58.500
 but the barrier between life and non life

19:58.500 --> 20:01.540
 is accruing enough memories to then actuate.

20:01.540 --> 20:04.860
 So what that means is there are contingency,

20:04.860 --> 20:06.740
 there are things that happen in the universe get trapped,

20:06.740 --> 20:10.140
 these memories then have a causal effect on the future.

20:10.140 --> 20:12.540
 And then when you get those concentrated in a machine,

20:12.540 --> 20:14.260
 and you're actually able in real time,

20:14.260 --> 20:19.260
 able to integrate the past, the present with the future,

20:19.260 --> 20:21.620
 and do stuff, that's when you are most alive.

20:22.620 --> 20:23.820
 You being the machine.

20:23.820 --> 20:24.660
 Yes.

20:24.660 --> 20:26.980
 Wait a minute, why is the object,

20:26.980 --> 20:29.380
 so one of the ways to define life,

20:29.380 --> 20:31.700
 that Sarah said, is simple machines

20:31.700 --> 20:34.180
 creating complex machines.

20:34.180 --> 20:37.340
 So there's a million questions there.

20:37.340 --> 20:39.540
 So how the hell does a simple machine

20:39.540 --> 20:41.260
 create a complex machine?

20:41.260 --> 20:42.860
 By mutation.

20:42.860 --> 20:44.260
 So this is what we were talking about at the beginning,

20:44.260 --> 20:46.180
 is you have the minimum replicator, so a molecule.

20:46.180 --> 20:47.740
 So this is what I was trying to convince Sarah

20:47.740 --> 20:49.780
 of the mechanism get there years ago, I think,

20:49.780 --> 20:52.580
 but then you've been building on it and saying,

20:52.580 --> 20:55.780
 you have a molecule that can copy itself,

20:55.780 --> 20:58.300
 but then there has to be some variability,

20:58.300 --> 21:00.340
 otherwise it's not gonna get more functional.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.180
 So you need to add bits on.

21:02.180 --> 21:04.700
 So you have a minimum molecule that can copy itself,

21:04.700 --> 21:05.820
 but then it can add bits on,

21:05.820 --> 21:07.140
 and that can be copied as well,

21:07.140 --> 21:09.980
 and those add ons can give you additional function,

21:12.500 --> 21:15.780
 to be able to acquire more stuff to exist.

21:15.780 --> 21:18.260
 So existence is weird,

21:18.260 --> 21:21.180
 but the fact that there is existence is why there is life,

21:21.180 --> 21:23.660
 and that's why I realized a few days ago

21:23.660 --> 21:25.420
 that there must be, that's why alien life

21:25.420 --> 21:28.780
 must be everywhere, because there is existence.

21:28.780 --> 21:33.700
 Is there a conservation of cheeky stuff happening?

21:33.700 --> 21:37.220
 So how can you keep injecting more complex things?

21:38.860 --> 21:41.300
 Doesn't the machine that creates the object

21:41.300 --> 21:46.300
 need to be as or more powerful than the things it creates?

21:48.420 --> 21:51.740
 So how can you get complexity from simplicity?

21:51.740 --> 21:54.860
 So the way you get complexity from simplicity

21:54.860 --> 21:57.660
 is that you, I'm just making this up,

21:57.660 --> 21:59.020
 but this is kind of my notion,

21:59.020 --> 22:00.420
 and you have a large volume of stuff,

22:00.420 --> 22:03.420
 so you're able to get seeds, if you like,

22:03.420 --> 22:05.660
 random cues from the environment.

22:05.660 --> 22:07.460
 So you just use those objects

22:07.460 --> 22:11.740
 to basically write on your tape, ones and zeros, whatever.

22:11.740 --> 22:16.740
 And that is necessarily rich, complex, okay?

22:17.700 --> 22:19.660
 But it has a low assembliness,

22:19.660 --> 22:21.380
 but even though it has a high assembly number,

22:21.380 --> 22:22.580
 we can talk about that.

22:22.580 --> 22:24.300
 But then when you start to then integrate

22:24.300 --> 22:28.700
 that all into a smaller volume, as over time,

22:28.700 --> 22:31.220
 and you become more autonomous,

22:31.220 --> 22:33.020
 you then make the transition.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.740
 I don't know what you think about that.

22:34.740 --> 22:38.900
 I think the easiest way to think about it is actually,

22:38.900 --> 22:40.900
 which I know is a concept you hate, but I also hate,

22:40.900 --> 22:43.220
 which is entropy, but people are more familiar with entropy

22:43.220 --> 22:45.380
 than what we talk about in assembly theory.

22:45.380 --> 22:50.020
 And also the idea that, like, say physics as we know it

22:50.020 --> 22:52.740
 involves objects that don't exist across time,

22:52.740 --> 22:55.660
 or as we would say, low memory objects.

22:55.660 --> 22:58.380
 So one of the key distinctions that is...

22:58.380 --> 22:59.700
 Low memory objects.

22:59.700 --> 23:01.220
 Yeah, so physics is all...

23:01.220 --> 23:02.660
 Physicists are low memory objects.

23:02.660 --> 23:05.020
 Low memory objects.

23:05.020 --> 23:08.060
 Physicists are creators of low memory objects

23:08.060 --> 23:10.220
 or manipulators of low memory objects.

23:10.220 --> 23:11.060
 Absolutely.

23:11.060 --> 23:13.180
 It's a very nice way of putting it.

23:13.180 --> 23:14.020
 Okay, sorry, go ahead.

23:14.020 --> 23:14.860
 Yeah, no, it's okay.

23:14.860 --> 23:15.700
 Sorry to keep interrupting.

23:15.700 --> 23:16.780
 No, no, no, it's fine.

23:16.780 --> 23:18.820
 I like it too, it's very funny.

23:18.820 --> 23:20.380
 But I think it's a good way of phrasing it

23:20.380 --> 23:22.260
 because I think this kind of idea we have

23:22.260 --> 23:25.420
 in assembly theory is that, you know,

23:25.420 --> 23:27.580
 physics as we know it has basically removed time

23:27.580 --> 23:31.340
 as being a physical observable of an object.

23:31.340 --> 23:33.580
 And the argument I would make is that

23:33.580 --> 23:36.100
 when you look at things like water bottles or us,

23:36.100 --> 23:38.340
 we're actually things that exist

23:38.340 --> 23:40.940
 that have a large extent in time.

23:40.940 --> 23:44.380
 So we actually have a physical size and time,

23:44.380 --> 23:46.540
 and we measure that with something called

23:46.540 --> 23:49.460
 the assembly index in molecules,

23:49.460 --> 23:53.220
 but presumably everyone should have sort of a,

23:53.220 --> 23:54.940
 do you want to explain what assembly?

23:54.940 --> 23:56.380
 Yeah, let's, you know what?

23:56.380 --> 23:59.500
 Let's step back and start at the beginning.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.020
 What is assembly theory?

24:01.020 --> 24:02.140
 Lee sent me some slides.

24:02.140 --> 24:05.940
 There's a big sexy paper coming out probably.

24:05.940 --> 24:07.420
 Maybe, I don't know.

24:07.420 --> 24:08.740
 We've almost finished it.

24:10.180 --> 24:11.500
 Almost, almost finished it.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.540
 That's also a summary of science.

24:13.540 --> 24:14.740
 We're almost done.

24:14.740 --> 24:15.580
 Yes.

24:15.580 --> 24:16.420
 Well, no, no, we're almost done.

24:16.420 --> 24:17.580
 It's the history of science.

24:17.580 --> 24:20.460
 We are ready to start an interesting discussion

24:20.460 --> 24:21.820
 with our peers.

24:21.820 --> 24:22.660
 Right.

24:22.660 --> 24:24.260
 You're the machine that created the object,

24:24.260 --> 24:26.220
 and we'll see what the object takes us.

24:26.220 --> 24:29.020
 All right, so what is assembly theory?

24:29.020 --> 24:30.780
 Yeah, well, I think the easiest way

24:30.780 --> 24:33.780
 for people to understand it is to think about

24:33.780 --> 24:35.020
 assembly and molecules,

24:35.020 --> 24:36.540
 although the theory is very general.

24:36.540 --> 24:38.140
 It doesn't just apply to molecules.

24:38.140 --> 24:39.460
 And this was really Lee's insight,

24:39.460 --> 24:42.260
 so it's kind of funny that I'm explaining it, but.

24:42.260 --> 24:43.300
 I'll mark you.

24:43.300 --> 24:45.620
 Okay, all right, I'm ready, I'm ready.

24:45.620 --> 24:47.460
 You have to tell me where I get the check marks minus,

24:47.460 --> 24:48.300
 but.

24:48.300 --> 24:49.140
 It's your theory as well.

24:49.140 --> 24:49.980
 Yeah, I know.

24:49.980 --> 24:51.740
 But imagine a molecule,

24:51.740 --> 24:54.380
 and then you can break the molecule apart

24:54.380 --> 24:55.820
 into elementary building blocks.

24:55.820 --> 24:57.100
 They happen to be bonds.

24:57.100 --> 24:58.660
 And then you can think of all the ways,

24:58.660 --> 24:59.900
 for molecular assembly theory,

24:59.900 --> 25:00.820
 you can think of all the ways

25:00.820 --> 25:02.380
 of building up the original molecule.

25:02.380 --> 25:04.980
 So there's all these paths that you can assemble it.

25:04.980 --> 25:06.740
 And the sort of rules of assembly is

25:06.740 --> 25:09.460
 you can use pieces that have been generated already.

25:09.460 --> 25:11.900
 So it has this kind of recursive property to it.

25:11.900 --> 25:13.580
 And so that's where kind of memory

25:13.580 --> 25:15.100
 comes into assembly theory.

25:15.100 --> 25:17.740
 And then the assembly index is

25:17.740 --> 25:19.460
 the shortest path in that space.

25:19.460 --> 25:21.820
 So it's supposed to be the minimal amount of history

25:21.820 --> 25:23.300
 that the universe has to undergo

25:23.300 --> 25:25.580
 in order to assemble that particular object.

25:25.580 --> 25:27.900
 And the reason that this is significant is

25:27.900 --> 25:29.660
 we figured out how to measure that

25:30.580 --> 25:33.300
 with a mass spec in the lab.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.340
 And we had this conjecture

25:35.340 --> 25:36.940
 that if that minimal number of steps

25:36.940 --> 25:38.540
 was sufficiently large,

25:38.540 --> 25:40.500
 it would indicate that you required a machine

25:40.500 --> 25:41.740
 or a system that had information

25:41.740 --> 25:43.380
 about how to assemble that specific object

25:43.380 --> 25:45.180
 because the combinatorial space of possibilities

25:45.180 --> 25:47.340
 is getting exponentially large

25:47.340 --> 25:49.100
 as the assembly index is increasing.

25:49.100 --> 25:50.860
 So it's just, sorry to interrupt,

25:50.860 --> 25:54.780
 so that means there's a sufficiently high assembly index

25:55.820 --> 25:59.660
 that if observed in an object

25:59.660 --> 26:04.460
 is an indicator that something lifelike created it

26:04.460 --> 26:07.500
 or is the object itself lifelike?

26:07.500 --> 26:08.540
 Both.

26:08.540 --> 26:10.100
 But you might want to make the distinction

26:10.100 --> 26:12.580
 that a water bottle is not life,

26:12.580 --> 26:14.660
 but it would still be a signature

26:14.660 --> 26:16.660
 that you were in that domain of physics

26:16.660 --> 26:18.020
 and that I might be alive.

26:19.900 --> 26:22.140
 So there will be potentially a lot of arguments

26:22.140 --> 26:25.620
 about where the line, at which assembly index

26:26.820 --> 26:28.860
 does interesting stuff start to happen.

26:28.860 --> 26:30.620
 The point is we can make all the arguments,

26:30.620 --> 26:32.260
 but it should be experimentally observable

26:32.260 --> 26:34.220
 and Lee can talk more about that part of it.

26:34.220 --> 26:36.620
 But the point I want to make about it is

26:36.620 --> 26:39.180
 there was always this intuition that I had

26:39.180 --> 26:41.260
 that there should be some complexity threshold

26:41.260 --> 26:44.060
 in the universe above which you would start to say

26:44.060 --> 26:46.900
 whatever physics governs life actually becomes operative.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.140
 And I think about it a little bit

26:48.140 --> 26:50.460
 like we have Planck's constant,

26:50.460 --> 26:52.420
 and we have the fine structure constant.

26:52.420 --> 26:54.700
 And then this sort of assembly threshold

26:54.700 --> 26:59.700
 is basically another sort of potentially constant of nature.

26:59.940 --> 27:02.420
 It might depend on the specific features of the system,

27:02.420 --> 27:04.580
 but which we debate about sometimes.

27:04.580 --> 27:07.780
 But then when you're past that,

27:07.780 --> 27:10.140
 you have to have some other explanation

27:10.140 --> 27:11.700
 than the current explanations we have in physics,

27:11.700 --> 27:13.340
 because now you're in high memory.

27:15.140 --> 27:18.460
 The things actually require time for them to exist

27:18.460 --> 27:20.260
 and time becomes a physical variable.

27:20.260 --> 27:23.780
 The path to the creation of the object is the memory.

27:23.780 --> 27:25.780
 So you need to consider that.

27:25.780 --> 27:29.540
 Yeah, but the point is that's a feature of the object.

27:29.540 --> 27:33.540
 So when I think of all the things in this room,

27:34.580 --> 27:37.580
 we see the projection of them as a water bottle,

27:37.580 --> 27:39.940
 but assembly theory would say that this is a causal graph

27:39.940 --> 27:41.820
 of all the ways the universe can create this thing.

27:41.820 --> 27:43.460
 That's what it is as an object.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.620
 And we're all interacting, a causal graph.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.460
 And most of the creativity in the biosphere

27:47.460 --> 27:50.020
 is because a lot of the objects that exist now

27:50.020 --> 27:52.660
 are huge in their structure across time.

27:52.660 --> 27:55.420
 Four billion years of evolution to get to us.

27:55.420 --> 27:57.580
 Is it possible to look at me

27:57.580 --> 28:01.500
 and infer the history that led to me?

28:01.500 --> 28:04.940
 If you, you as an individual might be hard.

28:04.940 --> 28:09.180
 You as a representative of a population of objects

28:09.180 --> 28:10.220
 that have high assembly

28:10.220 --> 28:12.340
 with similar causal history and structure

28:12.340 --> 28:14.740
 that you can communicate with, i.e. other humans,

28:14.740 --> 28:15.820
 you can infer a lot probably.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.020
 Yeah, also with them.

28:17.020 --> 28:18.380
 Which we do genomically even.

28:18.380 --> 28:19.580
 I mean, it's not like,

28:19.580 --> 28:21.060
 we have a lot of information in us,

28:21.060 --> 28:23.100
 we can reconstruct histories from.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.660
 Assembly is saying something slightly deeper.

28:24.660 --> 28:25.540
 Yeah, one thing to add.

28:25.540 --> 28:26.980
 I mean, it's not just about the object,

28:26.980 --> 28:28.140
 but the objects occur

28:28.140 --> 28:30.260
 and not just objects with high assembly number,

28:30.260 --> 28:32.180
 because you can have random things

28:32.180 --> 28:33.020
 that have a high assembly number,

28:33.020 --> 28:34.260
 but they must have,

28:34.260 --> 28:36.500
 there must be a number of identical copies.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.940
 So you know you're getting away from the random,

28:38.940 --> 28:40.180
 because you could take a snapshot.

28:40.180 --> 28:42.140
 This is why, it's not I hate entropy,

28:42.140 --> 28:44.420
 I love entropy when used correctly,

28:44.420 --> 28:46.140
 but it's about the problem of entropy,

28:46.140 --> 28:47.740
 you have to have a labeler.

28:47.740 --> 28:50.700
 And so you can label the beginning and the end,

28:50.700 --> 28:52.340
 the start and the finish, you know,

28:52.340 --> 28:53.820
 where what you can do in assembly is say,

28:53.820 --> 28:56.460
 oh, I have a number of objects in abundance.

28:56.460 --> 28:58.100
 They all have these features.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.980
 And then you can infer.

28:59.980 --> 29:01.860
 And one of the things that we debated a lot,

29:01.860 --> 29:02.940
 particularly during lockdown,

29:02.940 --> 29:05.500
 because I almost went insane trying to crush the,

29:05.500 --> 29:06.860
 produce the assembly equation.

29:06.860 --> 29:08.460
 So we came up with the assembly equation.

29:08.460 --> 29:09.980
 I had, just imagine this.

29:09.980 --> 29:12.100
 So you have a string where,

29:13.860 --> 29:16.060
 actually it makes me sick trying to remember it.

29:16.060 --> 29:18.580
 It was so, it did my head in for a long time.

29:18.580 --> 29:21.700
 Yeah, because I couldn't,

29:21.700 --> 29:23.900
 so if you just have a string of say words,

29:23.900 --> 29:27.060
 say, you know, a series of words, series of letters.

29:27.060 --> 29:29.940
 So you just have A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C, D, D, D.

29:29.940 --> 29:32.500
 And you find that object and you just have four A's,

29:32.500 --> 29:35.340
 four B's, four C's, four D's together, boom.

29:35.340 --> 29:38.060
 Then, and that you measured that.

29:38.060 --> 29:40.700
 So you physically measured that string of letters.

29:40.700 --> 29:44.260
 Then what you could do is you can infer sub graphs

29:44.260 --> 29:46.740
 of maybe the four A's, the four B's,

29:46.740 --> 29:47.780
 the four C's and the four C's,

29:47.780 --> 29:50.060
 but you don't see them in the real world.

29:50.060 --> 29:51.300
 You just infer them.

29:51.300 --> 29:53.860
 And I really got stuck with that

29:53.860 --> 29:55.740
 because there's a problem to try and work out

29:55.740 --> 29:57.700
 what's the difference between a long,

29:57.700 --> 29:59.660
 you know, a physical object

29:59.660 --> 30:01.460
 and this assembly space of the objects

30:01.460 --> 30:05.780
 that we realized the best way to put that is infer in time.

30:05.780 --> 30:08.140
 So although we can't infer your entire history,

30:08.140 --> 30:10.460
 we know at some point the four A's were made,

30:10.460 --> 30:12.580
 the four B's was made, the four C's were made,

30:12.580 --> 30:15.500
 the four D's were made and they all got added together.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.620
 And that's one really interesting thing

30:17.620 --> 30:19.060
 that's come out of the theory,

30:19.060 --> 30:21.820
 but the killer when we knew we were going beyond

30:24.140 --> 30:26.380
 beyond standard complexity theories,

30:26.380 --> 30:29.940
 but incredibly successful is that we realized

30:29.940 --> 30:31.460
 we could start to measure these things

30:31.460 --> 30:33.420
 for real across domains.

30:33.420 --> 30:36.660
 So the assembly index is actually an intrinsic property

30:36.660 --> 30:40.700
 of all stuff that you can break into components,

30:41.700 --> 30:42.980
 particularly molecules are good

30:42.980 --> 30:44.300
 because you can break them up

30:44.300 --> 30:47.220
 into smaller molecules, into atoms.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.900
 The challenge will be making that more general

30:49.900 --> 30:50.740
 across all the domains,

30:50.740 --> 30:51.820
 but we're working on it right now

30:51.820 --> 30:53.020
 and I think the theory will do that.

30:53.020 --> 30:54.780
 So components, domains,

30:54.780 --> 30:58.140
 so you're talking about basically measuring

30:58.140 --> 31:00.940
 the complexity of an object in what,

31:00.940 --> 31:03.260
 biology, chemistry, physics,

31:03.260 --> 31:04.860
 that's what you mean by domains.

31:05.860 --> 31:06.700
 Complexity of tests.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.140
 Sociology. Complexity of computers.

31:08.140 --> 31:10.220
 Complexity of memes, you know.

31:10.220 --> 31:11.660
 Memes? Yep.

31:11.660 --> 31:13.260
 What is that, ideas?

31:13.260 --> 31:15.220
 Yeah, I mean, so one of the.

31:15.220 --> 31:16.980
 Ideas are objects in assembly theory.

31:16.980 --> 31:17.820
 Yeah. They are.

31:17.820 --> 31:18.980
 They're physical things.

31:18.980 --> 31:20.340
 They're just features of the causal graph.

31:20.340 --> 31:22.140
 I mean, the fact that I can talk to you right now

31:22.140 --> 31:23.780
 is because we're exchanging structure

31:23.780 --> 31:24.940
 of our assembly space.

31:27.220 --> 31:32.220
 So conversation is the exchanging structures

31:32.220 --> 31:33.180
 in assembly space.

31:33.180 --> 31:34.940
 What is assembly space?

31:34.940 --> 31:36.620
 When I started working on origins of life,

31:36.620 --> 31:39.580
 I was writing about something called top down causation,

31:39.580 --> 31:42.140
 which a lot of like philosophers are interested in

31:42.140 --> 31:44.020
 and people that worry about the mind body problem.

31:44.020 --> 31:45.900
 But the whole idea is, you know,

31:45.900 --> 31:49.700
 if we have, you know, the microscopic world of physics

31:49.700 --> 31:50.900
 is causally complete,

31:50.900 --> 31:53.300
 it seems like there's no room for higher level causes

31:53.300 --> 31:56.380
 like our thoughts to actually have any impact on the world.

31:56.380 --> 31:59.140
 And that didn't, that seems problematic

31:59.140 --> 32:01.300
 when you get to studying life and mind

32:01.300 --> 32:03.420
 because it does seem that quote unquote,

32:03.420 --> 32:05.460
 emergent properties do matter to matter.

32:08.820 --> 32:10.980
 And then there's this other sort of paradoxical situation

32:10.980 --> 32:12.940
 where information looks like it's disembodied.

32:12.940 --> 32:14.260
 So we talk about information,

32:14.260 --> 32:16.180
 like it can just move from any physical system

32:16.180 --> 32:17.500
 to any other physical system.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.260
 And it doesn't require,

32:20.300 --> 32:22.580
 like you don't have to specify anything about the substrate

32:22.580 --> 32:24.180
 to talk about information.

32:24.180 --> 32:27.260
 And then there's also the way we talk about mathematics

32:27.260 --> 32:28.660
 is also disembodied, right?

32:28.660 --> 32:31.020
 Like the platonic world of forms

32:31.020 --> 32:34.940
 and I think all of those things are hinging

32:34.940 --> 32:37.100
 that we really don't know how to think about abstractions

32:37.100 --> 32:38.380
 as physical things.

32:39.580 --> 32:43.900
 And really, I think what assembly theory is pointing to

32:43.900 --> 32:46.940
 is what we're missing there is the dimension of time.

32:46.940 --> 32:48.900
 And if you actually look at an object

32:48.900 --> 32:51.100
 being extended across time,

32:51.100 --> 32:54.220
 what we call information and the things that look abstract

32:54.220 --> 32:55.580
 are things that are entangled

32:55.580 --> 32:57.340
 in the histories of those objects.

32:57.340 --> 32:59.900
 They're features of the overlapping assembly space.

32:59.900 --> 33:02.540
 So they look abstract because they're not

33:02.540 --> 33:05.260
 part of the current structure,

33:05.260 --> 33:06.580
 but they're part of the structure

33:06.580 --> 33:09.060
 if you thought about it as like the philosophical concept

33:09.060 --> 33:11.620
 of a hyperobject, an object that's too big in time

33:11.620 --> 33:13.740
 for us to actually to resolve.

33:13.740 --> 33:15.860
 And so I think information is physical.

33:15.860 --> 33:17.940
 It's just physical in time, not in space.

33:18.940 --> 33:22.140
 Too hyperobject, too difficult for us to resolve.

33:22.140 --> 33:26.060
 So we're supposed to think about of life

33:26.060 --> 33:28.140
 as this thing that stretches through time

33:28.140 --> 33:31.100
 and there's a causation chain that led to that thing.

33:32.220 --> 33:34.380
 And then you're trying to measure something

33:34.380 --> 33:36.900
 with the assembly index about properties of that.

33:36.900 --> 33:39.340
 The assembly index is the ordering,

33:39.340 --> 33:41.780
 like you could think of it as like a partial ordering

33:41.780 --> 33:43.740
 of all the things that can happen.

33:43.740 --> 33:46.780
 So in thermodynamics, we coarse grain things

33:46.780 --> 33:48.100
 by temperature and pressure.

33:48.100 --> 33:50.460
 In assembly theory, we coarse grain

33:50.460 --> 33:52.260
 by the number of copies of an object

33:52.260 --> 33:53.980
 and the assembly index, which is basically,

33:53.980 --> 33:56.180
 if you think of the space of all possible things,

33:56.180 --> 33:58.340
 it's like a depth of how far you've gone into that space

33:58.340 --> 34:00.220
 and how much time was required to get there.

34:00.220 --> 34:02.140
 In the shortest possible version.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.780
 The shortest possible version.

34:03.780 --> 34:07.500
 Not average, because can't you just 3D?

34:07.500 --> 34:09.620
 You're gonna kill me with that question.

34:09.620 --> 34:13.580
 Not 3D, can't you always 3D print the thing?

34:13.580 --> 34:14.820
 Let's like stab him in the heart.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.460
 No, because I had such a fight.

34:16.460 --> 34:18.740
 So Sarah's team and my team are writing this paper

34:18.740 --> 34:20.140
 at the moment and.

34:20.140 --> 34:21.340
 It's so funny.

34:21.340 --> 34:23.020
 I think we kind of share the, at the beginning,

34:23.020 --> 34:23.980
 you were like, no, that's not right.

34:23.980 --> 34:24.820
 Oh yeah, that's right.

34:24.820 --> 34:25.900
 And we're doing this for a bit.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.860
 And then the problem is when you build a theory

34:27.860 --> 34:29.340
 and build the intuition,

34:29.340 --> 34:31.700
 there's some certain features, right,

34:31.700 --> 34:34.260
 of the theory that almost felt like

34:34.260 --> 34:35.500
 I was being religious about saying,

34:35.500 --> 34:37.020
 right, you have to do this.

34:37.020 --> 34:40.380
 A good assembly theorist does this, does this, does this.

34:40.380 --> 34:44.460
 And Sarah's postdoc, Daniel, and my postdoc, Abhishek,

34:44.460 --> 34:45.300
 and they were both.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.140
 They're both brilliant.

34:46.140 --> 34:47.860
 They're brilliant, but they were like,

34:47.860 --> 34:49.500
 no, we don't buy that.

34:49.500 --> 34:52.380
 And I was like, it is, they were like,

34:52.380 --> 34:55.180
 well, Lee, actually, I thought you were the first

34:55.180 --> 34:56.620
 to say that, you know, you can't,

34:56.620 --> 34:58.060
 if you can't explain it, it doesn't,

34:58.060 --> 35:00.140
 and you can't do an experiment that doesn't exist.

35:00.140 --> 35:00.980
 And that saved me.

35:00.980 --> 35:01.980
 And I said to Abhishek,

35:01.980 --> 35:03.420
 Abhishek's my postdoc in Glasgow,

35:03.420 --> 35:06.220
 Daniel is Sarah's postdoc in ASU.

35:06.220 --> 35:08.980
 I was like, I have the experimental data.

35:08.980 --> 35:11.060
 So when I basically take the molecules

35:11.060 --> 35:12.820
 and chop them up in the mass spec,

35:12.820 --> 35:14.460
 the assembly number is never the average.

35:14.460 --> 35:15.740
 It's always the shortest.

35:15.740 --> 35:16.860
 It's an intrinsic property.

35:16.860 --> 35:19.180
 And then the penny drop for Abhishek said, okay.

35:19.180 --> 35:22.180
 So I had these things that we had to believe

35:22.180 --> 35:23.340
 to start with or to trust,

35:23.340 --> 35:24.780
 and then we'd done the math and it comes out.

35:24.780 --> 35:26.940
 And they now have the shortest path, actually.

35:26.940 --> 35:29.140
 It's up, it explains why the shortest path.

35:29.140 --> 35:32.700
 Here's why the shortest path is important, not the average.

35:32.700 --> 35:34.740
 The shortest path needs you to identify

35:34.740 --> 35:37.100
 when the universe has basically got a memory,

35:37.100 --> 35:38.060
 not an average.

35:38.060 --> 35:40.260
 So what you want to be able to do is to say,

35:40.260 --> 35:43.780
 what is the minimum number of features

35:43.780 --> 35:45.500
 that I want to be able to see in the universe?

35:45.500 --> 35:46.780
 When I find those features,

35:46.780 --> 35:50.820
 I know the universe has had a coherent memory

35:50.820 --> 35:53.460
 and is basically alive.

35:53.460 --> 35:56.980
 And so that gives you the lower bound.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.540
 So that's like, of course there's going to be other paths.

35:59.540 --> 36:01.140
 We can be more ridiculous, right?

36:01.140 --> 36:03.460
 We can have other parts, but it's just the minimum.

36:03.460 --> 36:06.100
 So probabilistically at the beginning,

36:06.100 --> 36:07.940
 because assembly theory was built

36:07.940 --> 36:11.900
 as a measure for biosignatures, I needed to go there.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.780
 And then I realized it was intrinsic.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.740
 And then Sarah realized it was intrinsic

36:15.740 --> 36:16.940
 and these hyperobjects were coming.

36:16.940 --> 36:19.820
 And we were kind of fusing that notions together.

36:19.820 --> 36:21.340
 And then the team were like, yeah,

36:21.340 --> 36:25.780
 but if I have enough energy and I have enough resources,

36:25.780 --> 36:27.060
 I might not take the shortest path.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.020
 I might go a bit longer.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.020
 I might take a really long path

36:30.020 --> 36:33.180
 because it allows me then to do something else.

36:33.180 --> 36:34.300
 So what you can do is, let's say

36:34.300 --> 36:37.420
 I've got two different objects, A and B,

36:37.420 --> 36:40.380
 and they both have different shortest paths to get them.

36:40.380 --> 36:43.860
 But then if you want to make A and B together,

36:43.860 --> 36:44.940
 they will have a compromise.

36:44.940 --> 36:48.620
 So in the joint assembly space, that might be an average,

36:48.620 --> 36:50.220
 but actually it's the shortest way

36:50.220 --> 36:52.300
 you can make both A and B

36:52.300 --> 36:54.700
 with a minimum amount of resource in time.

36:54.700 --> 36:56.860
 So suddenly you then layer these things up.

36:56.860 --> 36:59.780
 And so the average becomes not important,

36:59.780 --> 37:03.740
 but as you literally overlap those sets,

37:03.740 --> 37:05.340
 you get a new shortest path.

37:05.340 --> 37:07.220
 And so what we realized time and time again

37:07.220 --> 37:08.060
 when we're doing the math,

37:08.060 --> 37:11.260
 the shortest path is intrinsic, is fundamental,

37:11.260 --> 37:14.300
 and is measurable, which is kind of mind blowing.

37:14.300 --> 37:17.380
 So what we're talking about, some basic ingredients,

37:17.380 --> 37:20.580
 maybe we'll talk about that, what those basic ingredients

37:20.580 --> 37:23.860
 could be and how many steps, when you say shortest path,

37:23.860 --> 37:28.340
 how many steps it takes to turn those basic ingredients

37:28.340 --> 37:31.140
 into the final meal.

37:32.180 --> 37:35.660
 So how to make a, what's the shortest way to make a pizza?

37:35.660 --> 37:36.500
 Or a pie.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.340
 Or a pie.

37:37.340 --> 37:38.180
 An apple pie.

37:38.180 --> 37:39.020
 That's right.

37:39.020 --> 37:40.340
 And a pizza and a pie together.

37:40.340 --> 37:41.780
 Or a scratch.

37:41.780 --> 37:43.380
 So there's a lot of ways.

37:44.980 --> 37:46.180
 There's the shortest way,

37:46.180 --> 37:48.940
 and then you take the full spectrum of ways

37:48.940 --> 37:53.300
 and there's probably an average duration

37:53.300 --> 37:55.500
 for a noob to make an apple pie.

37:56.380 --> 37:58.340
 Is the average interesting still?

37:58.340 --> 38:01.980
 If you measure the average length of the path

38:01.980 --> 38:05.100
 to assemble a thing, does that tell you something

38:05.100 --> 38:07.180
 about the way nature usually does it?

38:08.620 --> 38:13.620
 Versus something fundamental about the object,

38:13.900 --> 38:15.460
 which I think is what you're aiming at

38:15.460 --> 38:16.420
 with the assembly index.

38:16.420 --> 38:19.420
 Yeah, I mean, look, we all have to quantify things.

38:19.420 --> 38:21.140
 The minimum path gives you the lower bounds.

38:21.140 --> 38:22.340
 You know you're detecting something.

38:22.340 --> 38:24.060
 You know you're inferring something.

38:24.060 --> 38:26.900
 The average tells you about really how the objects

38:26.900 --> 38:30.980
 are existing in the ecosystem or the technology.

38:30.980 --> 38:34.780
 And there has to be more paths explored

38:34.780 --> 38:39.780
 because then you can happen upon other memories

38:39.980 --> 38:41.500
 and then condense them down.

38:41.500 --> 38:44.020
 I'm not making too much sense, but if you look and say,

38:44.020 --> 38:45.700
 let's just say, I mean, maybe we're gonna get

38:45.700 --> 38:47.260
 to alien civilizations later, right?

38:47.260 --> 38:49.540
 But I would argue very strongly

38:49.540 --> 38:52.740
 that alien civilization A and alien civilization B,

38:54.180 --> 38:55.660
 they're different assembly spaces.

38:55.660 --> 38:57.140
 So they're kind of gonna be a bit messed up

38:57.140 --> 38:59.060
 if they happen to come one another,

38:59.060 --> 39:02.340
 only when they find some joint overlap in their technology,

39:02.340 --> 39:05.020
 because if aliens come to us and they don't share

39:05.020 --> 39:06.620
 any of the causal graph we've showed,

39:06.620 --> 39:09.220
 but hopefully they share the periodic table

39:09.220 --> 39:11.460
 and bonds and things,

39:11.460 --> 39:14.060
 that we're gonna have to really think about the language

39:14.060 --> 39:16.860
 to talk to us aliens by inferring,

39:16.860 --> 39:21.700
 by using assembly theory to infer their language,

39:21.700 --> 39:23.780
 their technology, and other bits and bobs.

39:23.780 --> 39:26.140
 And the shortest path will help you do that quickly.

39:26.140 --> 39:29.540
 All right, so all aliens in this causality graphs

39:29.540 --> 39:32.220
 have a common ancestor in the...

39:32.220 --> 39:33.980
 If the building blocks are the same,

39:33.980 --> 39:35.700
 which means they live in the same universe as us.

39:35.700 --> 39:36.540
 So this is the assumption.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.580
 It depends on how far back in time you go, though.

39:38.580 --> 39:42.060
 But the universe has all the same building blocks.

39:42.060 --> 39:42.900
 Yeah.

39:42.900 --> 39:44.540
 And we have to assume that.

39:45.740 --> 39:49.340
 So at least there's not different classes

39:49.340 --> 39:53.060
 of causality graphs, right?

39:53.060 --> 39:53.900
 No.

39:53.900 --> 39:55.420
 The universe doesn't just say like,

39:55.420 --> 39:58.420
 here you get the red causality graph,

39:58.420 --> 39:59.420
 and you get the blue one.

39:59.420 --> 40:00.780
 These basic ingredients,

40:00.780 --> 40:02.740
 and they're geographically constrained,

40:02.740 --> 40:06.100
 or constrained in space or time, or something like that.

40:06.100 --> 40:07.300
 They're constrained in time

40:07.300 --> 40:09.860
 because only by the virtue of the fact

40:09.860 --> 40:12.820
 that you need enough time to have passed

40:12.820 --> 40:14.580
 for some things to exist.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.260
 So the universe has to be big enough in time

40:16.260 --> 40:17.180
 for some things.

40:17.180 --> 40:18.780
 So just one point on the shortest path

40:18.780 --> 40:19.780
 versus the average path,

40:19.780 --> 40:20.780
 which I think we'll get to this,

40:20.780 --> 40:22.980
 is you had a nice way of saying it's like

40:22.980 --> 40:25.180
 the minimal compression is the shortest path

40:25.180 --> 40:26.620
 for the universe to produce that.

40:26.620 --> 40:28.100
 But it's also like the first time

40:28.100 --> 40:29.900
 in the ordering of events

40:29.900 --> 40:32.500
 that you might expect to see that object.

40:32.500 --> 40:35.780
 But the average path tells you something

40:35.780 --> 40:39.100
 about the actual steps that were realized,

40:39.100 --> 40:40.940
 and that becomes an emergent property

40:40.940 --> 40:43.740
 of that object's interaction with other objects.

40:43.740 --> 40:45.500
 So it's not an intrinsic feature of that object.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.780
 It's a feature of the interactions with other things.

40:47.780 --> 40:49.900
 And so one of the nice features of assembly

40:49.900 --> 40:51.260
 is you've basically gotten rid of,

40:51.260 --> 40:52.700
 you just look at the things that exist,

40:52.700 --> 40:54.260
 and you've gotten rid of the mechanisms

40:54.260 --> 40:56.260
 for constructing them in some sense.

40:56.260 --> 41:00.780
 Like the machines are not as important

41:00.780 --> 41:02.580
 in the current construction of the theory,

41:02.580 --> 41:04.260
 although I would like to bridge it

41:04.260 --> 41:06.580
 to some ideas about constructors.

41:08.020 --> 41:11.260
 But then you can only communicate with things

41:11.260 --> 41:12.500
 as Lee was saying,

41:12.500 --> 41:15.020
 if you have some overlap in the past history.

41:15.020 --> 41:16.900
 So if you had an alien species

41:16.900 --> 41:18.780
 that had absolutely no overlap,

41:18.780 --> 41:21.260
 then there would be no means of communication.

41:21.260 --> 41:25.260
 But as we progress further and further in time

41:25.260 --> 41:26.740
 and more things become possible

41:26.740 --> 41:29.500
 because the assembly spaces are larger,

41:29.500 --> 41:31.740
 because you can have a larger assembly space

41:31.740 --> 41:34.180
 in terms of index and also just the size of the space,

41:34.180 --> 41:36.300
 because it's exponentially growing,

41:36.300 --> 41:38.100
 then more things can happen in the future.

41:38.100 --> 41:40.580
 And the example I like to give is actually

41:40.580 --> 41:43.700
 when we made first contact with gravitational waves,

41:43.700 --> 41:46.060
 because that's an alien phenomenon

41:46.060 --> 41:47.180
 that's been permeating our planet,

41:47.180 --> 41:48.740
 not alien in life phenomenon,

41:48.740 --> 41:51.900
 but alien like something we had never knew existed.

41:51.900 --> 41:55.140
 It's been like there's gravitational waves

41:55.140 --> 41:57.340
 rippling through this room right now,

41:57.340 --> 42:00.180
 but we had to advance to the level of Einstein

42:00.180 --> 42:03.100
 writing down his theory of relativity

42:03.100 --> 42:05.820
 and then 100 years of technological development

42:05.820 --> 42:08.540
 to even quote unquote see that phenomena.

42:08.540 --> 42:12.060
 So the, okay, to see that phenomena,

42:12.060 --> 42:16.020
 our causal graph have to start intersecting.

42:16.020 --> 42:17.940
 Yeah, we needed the idea to emerge first,

42:17.940 --> 42:18.940
 the abstraction, right?

42:18.940 --> 42:20.580
 And then we had to build the technology

42:20.580 --> 42:23.740
 that could actually observe features of that abstraction.

42:23.740 --> 42:26.500
 So the nice promising thing is over time,

42:26.500 --> 42:29.460
 the graph can grow so we can start overlapping eventually.

42:29.460 --> 42:31.380
 Yeah, so the interesting feature of that graph

42:31.380 --> 42:34.460
 is there was an event 1.4 billion years away

42:34.460 --> 42:38.460
 of a black hole merger that we detected on our detector.

42:38.460 --> 42:41.540
 And now suddenly we're connected

42:41.540 --> 42:42.980
 through this communication channel

42:42.980 --> 42:45.020
 with this distant event in our universe

42:45.020 --> 42:48.020
 that if you think about 1.4 billion years ago,

42:48.020 --> 42:49.260
 what was happening on this planet

42:49.260 --> 42:51.020
 or even further back in time,

42:51.900 --> 42:55.020
 that there's common physics underlying all of those events,

42:55.020 --> 42:56.900
 but even for those two events to communicate.

42:56.900 --> 42:58.300
 Now I understand what you were going on about

42:58.300 --> 42:59.140
 the other week.

42:59.140 --> 43:01.180
 Yeah, I'm sorry, this is a really abstract example,

43:01.180 --> 43:03.140
 but it's sort of.

43:03.140 --> 43:05.700
 Your causal graphs are now overlapping.

43:05.700 --> 43:07.940
 Well, let's just say now our causal graphs

43:07.940 --> 43:10.100
 are overlapping in the deep past.

43:10.100 --> 43:10.940
 Yeah, sorry.

43:10.940 --> 43:11.780
 No, I like it, so you made it.

43:11.780 --> 43:12.600
 I totally missed it.

43:12.600 --> 43:13.440
 Oh, the 1.6 billion.

43:13.440 --> 43:14.280
 Yeah.

43:14.280 --> 43:15.100
 You made a connection with it.

43:15.100 --> 43:15.940
 No, I do like that.

43:15.940 --> 43:17.540
 No, no, you can tell me what your epiphany is now.

43:17.540 --> 43:18.420
 That's good.

43:18.420 --> 43:19.260
 Because I was.

43:19.260 --> 43:22.860
 And I should get the jokes before 30 seconds after, so.

43:22.860 --> 43:23.980
 Oh, I get it now.

43:25.100 --> 43:25.940
 No, it's all right.

43:25.940 --> 43:26.780
 I was slow.

43:26.780 --> 43:27.620
 The joke from two minutes ago.

43:27.620 --> 43:28.660
 I'm slow on the uptake here.

43:28.660 --> 43:29.900
 I wasn't able to comprehend

43:29.900 --> 43:31.300
 what you were talking about when saying

43:31.300 --> 43:32.900
 the channel communicating to the past.

43:32.900 --> 43:36.460
 But what you're saying is we were able to infer

43:36.460 --> 43:40.340
 what happened 1.4 billion years ago.

43:40.340 --> 43:41.700
 We detected the gravity wave.

43:41.700 --> 43:43.700
 I mean, I think it's amazing that at that time,

43:43.700 --> 43:46.100
 we weren't even, we were just becoming multicellular,

43:46.100 --> 43:46.940
 right?

43:46.940 --> 43:48.460
 It's like insane.

43:48.460 --> 43:51.780
 And then we progressed from multicellularity

43:51.780 --> 43:55.380
 through to technology and built the detector

43:55.380 --> 43:58.020
 and then we just extrapolate backwards.

43:58.020 --> 44:01.580
 So, although we didn't do anything back to the graph

44:01.580 --> 44:03.420
 back in time, we understood this existence

44:03.420 --> 44:04.500
 then overlapped going forward.

44:04.500 --> 44:05.340
 And that.

44:05.340 --> 44:06.620
 Well, that's because our graphs are larger.

44:06.620 --> 44:09.180
 Yeah, but that means that has a consequence.

44:09.180 --> 44:13.780
 One of the things I was trying to say is I think,

44:13.780 --> 44:15.860
 I don't know, Sarah might be, she can correct me,

44:15.860 --> 44:19.660
 information first and I'm a object first kind of guy.

44:19.660 --> 44:21.820
 So, I mean, there's things that get constructed.

44:21.820 --> 44:25.340
 There has to be this transition in random constructions.

44:25.340 --> 44:30.340
 So when the object that's being constructed by the process

44:30.780 --> 44:33.580
 bakes in that memory and those memories then add on

44:33.580 --> 44:35.500
 and add on and add on.

44:35.500 --> 44:39.060
 So as it becomes more competent and life is about

44:39.060 --> 44:41.020
 taking those memories and compressing them,

44:41.020 --> 44:42.900
 increasing their autonomy.

44:42.900 --> 44:46.300
 And so I think that, like the cell that we have

44:46.300 --> 44:48.180
 in biology on earth is our way of doing that,

44:48.180 --> 44:51.260
 that really the maximum ability to take memories

44:51.260 --> 44:53.060
 and to act on the future.

44:53.060 --> 44:55.620
 Oh, I think that's mathematics.

44:55.620 --> 44:58.460
 No, mathematics doesn't exist.

44:58.460 --> 44:59.500
 No, but that's the point.

44:59.500 --> 45:01.940
 The point is that abstractions do exist.

45:01.940 --> 45:03.100
 They're real physical things.

45:03.100 --> 45:05.740
 We call them abstractions.

45:05.740 --> 45:08.780
 But the point about mathematics that I think is,

45:08.780 --> 45:11.780
 so I don't disagree that I think you're object first

45:11.780 --> 45:14.060
 and I'm information first, but I think I'm only

45:14.060 --> 45:16.460
 information first in the sense that I think the thing

45:16.460 --> 45:20.500
 that we need to explain is what abstractions are

45:20.500 --> 45:22.060
 and what they are as physical things

45:22.060 --> 45:23.780
 because of all of human history,

45:23.780 --> 45:25.660
 we've thought that there were these properties

45:25.660 --> 45:29.500
 that are disembodied, exist outside of the universe

45:29.500 --> 45:32.460
 and really they do exist in the universe

45:32.460 --> 45:34.900
 and we just don't understand what their physics is.

45:34.900 --> 45:36.780
 So I think mathematics is a really good example.

45:36.780 --> 45:39.340
 We do theoretical physics with math,

45:39.340 --> 45:42.580
 but imagine doing physics of math

45:42.580 --> 45:44.860
 and then thinking about math as a physical object.

45:44.860 --> 45:46.380
 And math is super interesting.

45:46.380 --> 45:48.780
 I think this is why we think it describes reality so well

45:48.780 --> 45:50.940
 because it's the most copyable kind of information.

45:50.940 --> 45:52.380
 It retains its properties

45:52.380 --> 45:54.220
 when you move it between physical media,

45:54.220 --> 45:56.180
 which means that it's very deep.

45:56.180 --> 45:59.180
 And so it seems to describe the universe really well,

45:59.180 --> 46:00.500
 but it probably is because it's information

46:00.500 --> 46:02.020
 that's very deep in our past.

46:02.020 --> 46:06.460
 And it's just, we invented a way of communicating it

46:06.460 --> 46:08.020
 very effectively between us.

46:08.980 --> 46:11.180
 Isn't math more fundamental?

46:11.180 --> 46:13.380
 Isn't the assembly of the graph,

46:13.380 --> 46:16.260
 isn't basically, I sound completely boring.

46:16.260 --> 46:20.020
 It's like math, assembly theory invented math, but it did.

46:20.020 --> 46:20.860
 It has to be.

46:20.860 --> 46:21.700
 Okay.

46:23.860 --> 46:28.860
 So what is math exactly?

46:28.940 --> 46:33.940
 It's a nice simplification,

46:34.780 --> 46:38.060
 a simple description of what?

46:38.060 --> 46:39.340
 So we have a computer scientist,

46:39.340 --> 46:41.300
 a physicist, and a chemist here.

46:41.300 --> 46:42.140
 Walking to a bar.

46:42.140 --> 46:43.860
 I think the chemist is gonna define math

46:43.860 --> 46:45.620
 and you guys can correct me.

46:45.620 --> 46:46.500
 Go for it.

46:46.500 --> 46:47.340
 I would say.

46:47.340 --> 46:48.460
 Lay in on us, Lee.

46:48.460 --> 46:50.900
 We're ready.

46:50.900 --> 46:54.980
 I think the ability to label objects

46:54.980 --> 46:57.420
 and place them into classes

46:57.420 --> 47:00.020
 and then do operations on the objects is what math is.

47:01.020 --> 47:02.380
 So on that point,

47:02.380 --> 47:04.660
 what does it mean to be object first

47:04.660 --> 47:07.020
 versus information first?

47:07.020 --> 47:09.620
 So what's the difference between object and information

47:09.620 --> 47:11.980
 when you get to that low fundamental level?

47:11.980 --> 47:14.020
 Well, I might change my view.

47:14.020 --> 47:16.460
 So I'm stuff first, the stuff.

47:16.460 --> 47:18.780
 And then when stuff becomes objects,

47:18.780 --> 47:21.460
 it has to invent information.

47:21.460 --> 47:23.820
 And then the information acts on more stuff

47:23.820 --> 47:24.860
 and becomes more objects.

47:24.860 --> 47:27.700
 So I think there is a transition to information

47:27.700 --> 47:29.780
 that occurs when you go from stuff to objects.

47:29.780 --> 47:30.620
 You mean time though, I think.

47:30.620 --> 47:31.460
 Yeah.

47:31.460 --> 47:33.460
 Information is emergent.

47:33.460 --> 47:34.380
 Not emergent.

47:34.380 --> 47:39.380
 Information is actionable memories from the universe.

47:40.420 --> 47:44.820
 So when memories become actionable, that's information.

47:44.820 --> 47:48.300
 But there's always memory, but it's not actionable.

47:48.300 --> 47:49.140
 Yeah.

47:49.140 --> 47:49.980
 And then it's not information.

47:49.980 --> 47:50.820
 Great.

47:50.820 --> 47:52.340
 And actionable is what you can create.

47:52.340 --> 47:53.660
 You can use it.

47:53.660 --> 47:55.820
 If you can't use it, then it's not information.

47:55.820 --> 47:56.900
 If you can't transmit it,

47:56.900 --> 47:59.460
 if it doesn't have any causal consequence.

47:59.460 --> 48:00.460
 Falls in the forest.

48:00.460 --> 48:01.660
 I don't understand.

48:01.660 --> 48:03.500
 Why is that not information?

48:03.500 --> 48:04.460
 It's not information.

48:04.460 --> 48:07.340
 It's stuff.

48:07.340 --> 48:10.260
 It's stuff happening, but it's not causal.

48:10.260 --> 48:11.700
 Yeah, yeah, we can.

48:11.700 --> 48:12.540
 This is cool.

48:12.540 --> 48:13.380
 But it's happening.

48:13.380 --> 48:15.180
 Happening requires information.

48:15.180 --> 48:16.860
 No, no, no, no, no.

48:16.860 --> 48:18.260
 Stuff is always happening.

48:18.260 --> 48:19.980
 No, this is where the physicists

48:19.980 --> 48:21.740
 and the math petitions get themselves in a loop

48:21.740 --> 48:24.620
 because I think the universe, I mean,

48:24.620 --> 48:28.020
 I think say Max Tegmark is very playful

48:28.020 --> 48:30.220
 and say like the universe is just math.

48:30.220 --> 48:31.340
 Well, the universe is just math.

48:31.340 --> 48:34.140
 Then we might as well not bother having any conversation

48:34.140 --> 48:35.140
 because the conversation already written,

48:35.140 --> 48:36.220
 we just might as well go to the future and say,

48:36.220 --> 48:38.740
 can you just give us the conversations happened already?

48:38.740 --> 48:41.420
 So I think the problem is that math petitions

48:41.420 --> 48:43.460
 are so successful at labeling stuff

48:43.460 --> 48:45.220
 and so successful understanding the stuff

48:45.220 --> 48:46.300
 through those labels,

48:46.300 --> 48:49.540
 they forget that actually those labels had to emerge

48:49.540 --> 48:52.980
 and that information had to be built on those memories.

48:52.980 --> 48:56.740
 So memory in the universe, so constraints, graph,

48:56.740 --> 48:57.580
 when they become actionable

48:57.580 --> 48:59.780
 and the graph can loop back on itself

48:59.780 --> 49:02.820
 or interact with other graphs and they can intersect,

49:02.820 --> 49:04.420
 those memories become actionable

49:04.420 --> 49:05.940
 and therefore they're information.

49:05.940 --> 49:09.180
 And I think you just changed my mind

49:09.180 --> 49:11.060
 on something pretty big, but I don't have a pen.

49:11.060 --> 49:12.460
 So I can't write, I'm gonna write it down later,

49:12.460 --> 49:17.100
 but roughly the idea is like you've got these two graphs

49:17.100 --> 49:20.540
 of objects of stuff that you have memories

49:20.540 --> 49:22.460
 and then when they intersect

49:22.460 --> 49:24.460
 and then they can act on each other,

49:24.460 --> 49:27.540
 that's maybe the mechanism by which information is then,

49:27.540 --> 49:29.300
 so then you can then abstract.

49:29.300 --> 49:32.300
 So when one graph can then build another graph and say,

49:32.300 --> 49:33.860
 hey, you don't have to go through the nonsense

49:33.860 --> 49:34.700
 we had to go through.

49:34.700 --> 49:36.100
 Here's literally the way to do it.

49:36.100 --> 49:37.860
 Stuff always comes first,

49:37.860 --> 49:39.500
 but then when stuff builds the abstraction,

49:39.500 --> 49:41.260
 the abstractions can be then teleported

49:41.260 --> 49:42.100
 onto other stuff.

49:42.100 --> 49:45.020
 And the abstractions is the looping back power.

49:45.020 --> 49:45.860
 Okay.

49:45.860 --> 49:47.620
 Am I making, I don't know, I got stuck.

49:47.620 --> 49:51.260
 Yeah, so first, God made stuff.

49:52.300 --> 49:54.740
 Then after that, when you start to be able

49:54.740 --> 49:56.980
 to form abstractions, that's when the information.

49:56.980 --> 50:00.500
 God is the memory the universe can remember.

50:00.500 --> 50:02.980
 God is the memory the universe can remember.

50:02.980 --> 50:03.820
 Otherwise, there's no, wait, did you?

50:03.820 --> 50:05.460
 Someone's gonna be deciphering that statement

50:05.460 --> 50:07.900
 hundreds of years from now, what the hell does that mean?

50:07.900 --> 50:09.660
 What does the humans mean by this?

50:09.660 --> 50:12.660
 Look, don't diss my one liners.

50:12.660 --> 50:16.660
 I took me 15 seconds to come up with that.

50:16.660 --> 50:17.700
 I don't know what it means.

50:17.700 --> 50:18.660
 What does it mean?

50:19.700 --> 50:23.380
 Okay, wait, we need to, how do we get onto this?

50:24.380 --> 50:29.380
 We were time, causality, mathematics.

50:30.580 --> 50:34.540
 So what is mathematics in this picture of stuff,

50:34.540 --> 50:39.540
 objects, memory, and information?

50:43.180 --> 50:44.980
 What exactly is mathematics?

50:44.980 --> 50:47.020
 It's the most efficient labeling scheme

50:47.020 --> 50:49.540
 that you can apply to lots of different graphs.

50:49.540 --> 50:52.420
 Labeling scheme doesn't make it sound useful.

50:52.420 --> 50:53.380
 Can I try?

50:53.380 --> 50:54.700
 Yep, sure, please.

50:54.700 --> 50:56.780
 Have you rejected my definition of mathematics?

50:56.780 --> 50:57.820
 I'm shocked.

50:57.820 --> 50:59.260
 Yeah, no, it's all right.

50:59.260 --> 51:00.100
 But it's correct.

51:01.300 --> 51:02.140
 Go on, sorry.

51:02.140 --> 51:03.420
 Excellent.

51:03.420 --> 51:06.420
 No, I mean, I think we have a problem, right?

51:06.420 --> 51:08.540
 Cause we can't not be us,

51:08.540 --> 51:10.340
 like we're stuck in the shells we are

51:10.340 --> 51:11.460
 and we're trying to observe the world.

51:11.460 --> 51:13.820
 And so mathematics looks like it has certain properties.

51:13.820 --> 51:16.180
 And I guess the thought experiment I find is useful

51:16.180 --> 51:19.060
 is to try to imagine if you were outside of us

51:19.060 --> 51:22.300
 looking at us as physical systems using mathematics,

51:22.300 --> 51:24.900
 what would be the specific features you associate

51:24.900 --> 51:28.820
 to the property of understanding mathematics

51:28.820 --> 51:32.020
 and being able to implement it in the universe, right?

51:32.020 --> 51:34.300
 And when you do that,

51:34.300 --> 51:36.860
 mathematics seems to have some really interesting properties

51:36.860 --> 51:39.180
 relative to other kinds of abstraction

51:39.180 --> 51:42.820
 we might talk about like language or artistic expression.

51:42.820 --> 51:45.140
 One of those properties is the one I mentioned already

51:45.140 --> 51:48.060
 that is really easy to copy between physical media.

51:48.060 --> 51:50.340
 So if I give you a mathematical statement,

51:50.340 --> 51:51.900
 you almost immediately know what I mean.

51:51.900 --> 51:53.100
 If I tell you the sky is blue,

51:53.100 --> 51:54.860
 you might say, is it gold ball blue?

51:54.860 --> 51:55.700
 Is it azure blue?

51:55.700 --> 51:56.740
 What color blue do you mean?

51:56.740 --> 52:00.260
 And you have a harder time visualizing what I actually mean.

52:00.260 --> 52:01.940
 So mathematics carries a lot of meaning with it

52:01.940 --> 52:03.420
 when it's copied between physical systems.

52:03.420 --> 52:06.900
 It's also the reason we use it to communicate with computers.

52:06.900 --> 52:10.100
 And then the second one is it retains its property

52:10.100 --> 52:13.780
 of actually what it can do in the universe when it's copied.

52:13.780 --> 52:16.060
 So the example I like to give there

52:16.060 --> 52:18.460
 is think about like Newton's law of gravitation.

52:19.500 --> 52:22.100
 It's actually, it's a compressed regularity

52:22.100 --> 52:25.460
 of a bunch of phenomena that we observe in the universe,

52:25.460 --> 52:28.700
 but then that information actually is causal in a sense

52:28.700 --> 52:30.500
 that it allows us to do things we wouldn't be able to do

52:30.500 --> 52:31.940
 without that particular knowledge

52:31.940 --> 52:33.420
 and that particular abstraction.

52:33.420 --> 52:35.180
 And in this case, like launch satellites to space

52:35.180 --> 52:37.180
 or send people to Mars or whatever it is.

52:38.180 --> 52:41.340
 So if you look at us from the outside and you say,

52:41.340 --> 52:42.820
 what is it for physical systems

52:42.820 --> 52:44.860
 to invent a thing called mathematics

52:44.860 --> 52:49.860
 and then to use and then it to become a physical observable,

52:51.300 --> 52:52.900
 mathematics is kind of like

52:52.900 --> 52:55.580
 the universally copyable information

52:55.580 --> 52:58.500
 that allows new possibility spaces

52:58.500 --> 52:59.380
 to be open in the future

52:59.380 --> 53:01.380
 because it allows this kind of ability

53:01.380 --> 53:03.100
 to map one physical system to another

53:03.100 --> 53:05.700
 and actually understand that the general principles.

53:05.700 --> 53:10.660
 So is it helping the overlap of causal graphs then

53:10.660 --> 53:11.620
 by mapping?

53:11.620 --> 53:14.140
 Oh, I think that's the explanation for what it is

53:14.140 --> 53:16.020
 in terms of the physical theory of assembly

53:16.020 --> 53:18.220
 would be some feature of the structure

53:18.220 --> 53:20.660
 of the assembly spaces of causal graphs

53:20.660 --> 53:22.140
 and their relationship to each other.

53:22.140 --> 53:25.420
 So for example, and I mean, this is things

53:25.420 --> 53:27.220
 that we're gonna have to work out over the next few years.

53:27.220 --> 53:29.540
 I mean, we're in totally uncharted conceptual territory

53:29.540 --> 53:34.540
 here, but as is usual, diving off the deep end,

53:35.380 --> 53:38.060
 but I would expect that we would be able to come up

53:38.060 --> 53:40.740
 with a theory of like, why is it that some physical systems

53:40.740 --> 53:43.100
 can communicate with each other?

53:43.100 --> 53:45.420
 Like language, language is basically

53:45.420 --> 53:47.220
 because we're objects extended over time

53:47.220 --> 53:49.820
 and some of the history of that assembly space

53:49.820 --> 53:51.060
 actually overlaps.

53:51.060 --> 53:52.220
 And when we communicate,

53:52.220 --> 53:53.780
 it's because we actually have shared structure

53:53.780 --> 53:55.020
 in our causal history.

53:55.020 --> 53:56.500
 Let me have another quick go at this, right?

53:56.500 --> 53:57.420
 So I think we all agree.

53:57.420 --> 54:01.460
 So I think we take mathematics for granted

54:01.460 --> 54:02.940
 because we've gone through this chain, right?

54:02.940 --> 54:06.460
 Of, you know, we all share a language now, okay?

54:06.460 --> 54:07.660
 And we can, well, we share language,

54:07.660 --> 54:11.460
 so we have languages that we can make interoperable.

54:11.460 --> 54:14.940
 And so whether you're speaking, I don't know,

54:14.940 --> 54:17.500
 all the different dialects of Chinese,

54:17.500 --> 54:20.740
 all the different dialects of English, French, German,

54:20.740 --> 54:22.780
 whatever, you can interconvert them.

54:22.780 --> 54:24.300
 The interesting thing about mathematics now

54:24.300 --> 54:26.540
 is that everybody on planet Earth, every human being

54:26.540 --> 54:29.740
 and computers share that common language.

54:29.740 --> 54:33.380
 That language was constructed by a process in time.

54:33.380 --> 54:35.380
 So what I'm trying to say is assembly invented math

54:35.380 --> 54:37.940
 is those, right from the, you know,

54:37.940 --> 54:41.420
 mathematics didn't occur, it didn't exist before life.

54:41.420 --> 54:44.100
 Abstraction was invented by life, right?

54:44.100 --> 54:46.060
 That doesn't mean that the universe wasn't capable

54:46.060 --> 54:47.300
 of mathematical things.

54:47.300 --> 54:50.740
 Wait a minute, can we just ask that old famous question,

54:50.740 --> 54:52.820
 is math invented or discovered?

54:52.820 --> 54:56.700
 So when you say assembly invented, or whatever.

54:58.020 --> 54:58.860
 It means it's just.

54:58.860 --> 54:59.700
 Well, someone might just say assembly

54:59.700 --> 55:01.500
 is a mathematical theory, but sorry.

55:01.500 --> 55:02.340
 Right.

55:02.340 --> 55:03.160
 Are we arguing? Exactly.

55:03.160 --> 55:04.000
 Are we arguing now?

55:04.000 --> 55:05.020
 That's what it sounds like.

55:05.020 --> 55:06.940
 Are we discovering mathematics?

55:06.940 --> 55:08.500
 No, well, yes and no.

55:08.500 --> 55:09.340
 I would say.

55:09.340 --> 55:11.940
 And you call mathematics a language

55:11.940 --> 55:13.020
 that we're developing. I would say that,

55:13.020 --> 55:17.060
 look, I'm pretty sure that there are some very common

55:17.060 --> 55:19.820
 seeds of mathematics in the universe, right?

55:19.820 --> 55:23.860
 But actually not the mathematics that we are finding now

55:23.860 --> 55:27.220
 is not discovered, it's invented.

55:27.220 --> 55:29.100
 And, but even though I think those two terms

55:29.100 --> 55:30.460
 are very triggering, and I don't think

55:30.460 --> 55:31.940
 they're necessarily useful,

55:31.940 --> 55:33.860
 because I think that what people do,

55:33.860 --> 55:38.100
 the mathematicians that say, oh, mathematics was discovered

55:38.100 --> 55:40.620
 because they live in a universe where there is no time

55:40.620 --> 55:42.500
 and it just all exists.

55:42.500 --> 55:45.300
 But what I'm saying is, and I think in the same way

55:45.300 --> 55:47.380
 you can create, let's say I'm gonna go and create

55:47.380 --> 55:52.380
 and make a piece of art, did I make that piece of art

55:53.740 --> 55:56.060
 or did I discover it?

55:56.060 --> 55:57.460
 Like inventing the aeroplane.

55:57.460 --> 55:58.780
 Did I invent the aeroplane?

55:58.780 --> 55:59.620
 Let's stick with the aeroplane.

55:59.620 --> 56:00.780
 The aeroplane is a good one.

56:00.780 --> 56:03.180
 Let's say, did I discover the aeroplane?

56:03.180 --> 56:04.860
 Well, in a way, the universe discovered the aeroplane

56:04.860 --> 56:06.300
 because it's just chucked a load of atoms together

56:06.300 --> 56:08.260
 and a load of random human beings want to do stuff

56:08.260 --> 56:10.660
 and then we discover the aeroplane

56:10.660 --> 56:12.180
 in the space of all the possibilities.

56:12.180 --> 56:14.980
 But here's the thing, when the space of possibilities

56:14.980 --> 56:19.980
 is so vast, infinite almost, and you're able to actualize

56:21.700 --> 56:24.620
 one of those in an object, then you are inventing it.

56:24.620 --> 56:27.140
 So in mathematics, because there are infinite number

56:27.140 --> 56:29.420
 of theorems, the fact you're actually pulling,

56:29.420 --> 56:31.540
 there's no difference between inventing

56:31.540 --> 56:34.300
 a mathematical structure and inventing the aeroplane.

56:34.300 --> 56:36.340
 They're the same thing, but that doesn't mean

56:36.340 --> 56:38.500
 that now the aeroplane exists in the universe,

56:38.500 --> 56:40.340
 it's something weird about the universe.

56:40.340 --> 56:43.620
 So I think that the more, this is the thing

56:43.620 --> 56:47.080
 that you probably, the more memory required

56:47.080 --> 56:50.300
 for the object, the more invented it is.

56:50.300 --> 56:54.340
 So when a mathematical theorem needs more bytes

56:54.340 --> 56:56.780
 to store it, the more invented it is,

56:56.780 --> 57:00.020
 and the less bytes, the more discovered it is.

57:00.020 --> 57:02.060
 But everything then is invented.

57:02.060 --> 57:03.820
 It's just more or less invented.

57:03.820 --> 57:04.940
 Absolutely.

57:04.940 --> 57:05.780
 Okay.

57:05.780 --> 57:07.860
 The universe has to generate everything as it goes.

57:07.860 --> 57:08.700
 Yeah.

57:09.620 --> 57:11.060
 And it wasn't there in the beginning.

57:11.060 --> 57:12.780
 And the way we're thinking it,

57:12.780 --> 57:14.220
 when you're thinking about the difference

57:14.220 --> 57:15.500
 between invented and discovered,

57:15.500 --> 57:17.820
 is because we're throwing away all the memory.

57:17.820 --> 57:18.660
 Yeah.

57:18.660 --> 57:22.260
 So if you start to think in terms of causality and time,

57:22.260 --> 57:23.700
 then those things become the same.

57:23.700 --> 57:24.860
 Everything is invented.

57:25.980 --> 57:27.600
 And the idea is to make everything intrinsic

57:27.600 --> 57:28.440
 to the universe.

57:28.440 --> 57:30.580
 So I think one of the features of assembly theory

57:30.580 --> 57:32.520
 is we don't wanna have external observers.

57:32.520 --> 57:33.980
 There's been this long tradition in physics

57:33.980 --> 57:35.660
 of trying to describe the universe from the outside

57:35.660 --> 57:36.620
 and not the inside.

57:37.500 --> 57:40.100
 And the universe has to generate everything itself

57:40.100 --> 57:41.060
 if you do it from the inside.

57:41.060 --> 57:44.600
 Assembly theory describes how the universe builds itself.

57:46.540 --> 57:48.540
 Did it take you 15 seconds to say that?

57:48.540 --> 57:49.380
 Yeah.

57:49.380 --> 57:50.220
 And to come up with that also?

57:50.220 --> 57:51.300
 No, I've thought of that before.

57:51.300 --> 57:52.140
 Okay.

57:52.140 --> 57:52.980
 That's a good line.

57:52.980 --> 57:53.800
 It's a, it's like.

57:53.800 --> 57:54.860
 Oh, you're making fun of me.

57:54.860 --> 57:56.540
 No, I'm not making fun, I'm having fun.

57:56.540 --> 57:57.380
 There's a difference.

57:57.380 --> 57:58.200
 Oh, that's good.

57:58.200 --> 57:59.040
 All right.

57:59.040 --> 57:59.880
 She's inventing fun.

57:59.880 --> 58:01.020
 I'm not all intimidated.

58:01.020 --> 58:01.860
 Yes.

58:01.860 --> 58:05.060
 And there's a causal history to that fun.

58:06.240 --> 58:08.880
 You mentioned that there's no way to communicate

58:08.880 --> 58:12.680
 with aliens until there's overlap in the causal graph.

58:14.160 --> 58:17.760
 Communication includes being able to see them.

58:18.660 --> 58:21.920
 And like, what are we, this is the question is,

58:23.760 --> 58:26.380
 is communication any kind of detection?

58:26.380 --> 58:29.740
 And if so, what do aliens look like

58:29.740 --> 58:33.100
 as you get more and more overlap on the causal graph?

58:33.100 --> 58:35.880
 You're assuming, let's assume that aliens,

58:35.880 --> 58:39.100
 so when you see them and they see you,

58:39.100 --> 58:40.820
 you're assuming they have vision,

58:40.820 --> 58:43.900
 they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time.

58:43.900 --> 58:45.780
 That's a lot of assumptions they're making.

58:45.780 --> 58:46.620
 What detection?

58:46.620 --> 58:47.540
 All right, let's step back.

58:47.540 --> 58:49.140
 So yes, okay, you're right.

58:49.140 --> 58:50.740
 So when, in the English language,

58:50.740 --> 58:53.260
 when we say the word see, we mean visually,

58:53.260 --> 58:54.820
 they show up to a party and it's like,

58:54.820 --> 58:56.260
 oh, wow, that's an alien.

58:56.260 --> 58:59.520
 That's visual, that's 3D, that's, okay.

58:59.520 --> 59:02.100
 And that's also assuming scale,

59:03.120 --> 59:05.620
 spatial scale of something that's visible to you.

59:05.620 --> 59:08.420
 So it can't be microscopic or it can't be so big

59:08.420 --> 59:10.740
 that you don't even realize that's an entity.

59:10.740 --> 59:14.120
 Okay, but other kinds of detection too.

59:14.120 --> 59:15.660
 I would make it more abstract and go down.

59:15.660 --> 59:18.520
 I was thinking this morning about how to rewrite

59:18.520 --> 59:21.180
 the Arecibo message in assembly theory

59:21.180 --> 59:23.140
 and also to abandon binary.

59:23.140 --> 59:25.140
 Because I don't think aliens necessarily,

59:25.140 --> 59:27.240
 why should they have binary?

59:27.240 --> 59:29.860
 Well, they have some basic elements

59:29.860 --> 59:32.820
 with which to do information exchange.

59:32.820 --> 59:37.180
 Let's make it more fundamental, more universal.

59:37.180 --> 59:38.940
 So we need to think about what is the universal way

59:38.940 --> 59:40.860
 of making a memory and then we should

59:40.860 --> 59:43.380
 reencode Arecibo in that way.

59:43.380 --> 59:45.660
 What's more basic than zeros and ones?

59:45.660 --> 59:47.460
 Well, it's really difficult to get out

59:47.460 --> 59:48.860
 that causal chain because we're so,

59:48.860 --> 59:51.780
 so let's erase the idea of zero for a moment.

59:51.780 --> 59:53.260
 It took human beings a long time

59:53.260 --> 59:54.360
 to come up with the idea of zero.

59:54.360 --> 59:56.780
 Now you got the idea of zero, you can't throw it away.

59:56.780 --> 59:57.620
 It's so useful.

59:57.620 --> 59:59.100
 To discover the idea of zero.

59:59.100 --> 1:00:00.740
 To discover or invent.

1:00:00.740 --> 1:00:02.620
 I don't know, but it took a long time

1:00:02.620 --> 1:00:04.940
 so it was invented, that's right.

1:00:04.940 --> 1:00:07.820
 Yeah, I think zero was invented, exactly.

1:00:07.820 --> 1:00:10.860
 So it's not a given that aliens know what zero is.

1:00:10.860 --> 1:00:13.540
 That's a massive assumption.

1:00:13.540 --> 1:00:16.020
 It's a useful discovery.

1:00:16.020 --> 1:00:18.100
 You're saying if you break the causal chain

1:00:18.100 --> 1:00:20.580
 there might be some other more efficient way of representing.

1:00:20.580 --> 1:00:23.100
 That's why I wanna meet him and ask him.

1:00:23.100 --> 1:00:24.340
 For a shortcut.

1:00:24.340 --> 1:00:27.620
 But you won't be able to ask him until.

1:00:27.620 --> 1:00:29.940
 So I interrupted you and I think you're making good point.

1:00:29.940 --> 1:00:31.100
 I was just gonna say, well look.

1:00:31.100 --> 1:00:32.100
 Thank you.

1:00:32.100 --> 1:00:32.940
 Sorry.

1:00:34.220 --> 1:00:35.060
 Rather than saying.

1:00:35.060 --> 1:00:37.820
 Please internet, tweet at him for the rude interruptions.

1:00:37.820 --> 1:00:38.860
 Oh, go ahead, I'm sorry.

1:00:38.860 --> 1:00:40.020
 No, it's okay.

1:00:40.020 --> 1:00:41.220
 Maybe it's change.

1:00:41.220 --> 1:00:44.980
 How do we, so, oh, I don't know what it's like

1:00:44.980 --> 1:00:46.000
 to be an alien.

1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:47.360
 I would like to know.

1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:50.380
 What is the full spectrum of what aliens

1:00:50.380 --> 1:00:52.280
 might look like to us?

1:00:53.260 --> 1:00:57.300
 Now that we've laid this all on the table of like,

1:00:57.300 --> 1:00:59.620
 all right, so there has to be some overlap

1:00:59.620 --> 1:01:03.740
 in this causal chain that led to them.

1:01:03.740 --> 1:01:05.740
 What are we looking for?

1:01:05.740 --> 1:01:06.980
 What do you think we should be looking for?

1:01:06.980 --> 1:01:09.180
 So you mentioned mass spec.

1:01:09.180 --> 1:01:11.900
 Measuring certain objects that aliens could create

1:01:11.900 --> 1:01:13.820
 or are aliens themselves.

1:01:15.140 --> 1:01:17.620
 We show up to a planet or maybe not a planet.

1:01:17.620 --> 1:01:20.420
 Or maybe, what the hell is the basic object

1:01:20.420 --> 1:01:23.020
 we're trying to measure the assembly index of?

1:01:23.020 --> 1:01:23.980
 Let's cut ourselves a break.

1:01:23.980 --> 1:01:27.580
 Let's assume that they are metabolized.

1:01:27.580 --> 1:01:29.140
 They've got an energy source.

1:01:29.140 --> 1:01:32.980
 And they're a size that we can recognize.

1:01:32.980 --> 1:01:34.140
 Let's give ourselves a break.

1:01:34.140 --> 1:01:36.340
 Because there could be aliens that are so big

1:01:36.340 --> 1:01:38.060
 we won't recognize we're seeing them.

1:01:38.060 --> 1:01:39.360
 There might be aliens that are so small

1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:40.980
 we don't yet have the ability to,

1:01:40.980 --> 1:01:44.060
 we don't have microscopes that can see far enough away

1:01:44.060 --> 1:01:45.380
 that just wouldn't be able to see them.

1:01:45.380 --> 1:01:46.500
 So what's a good range?

1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:47.900
 So let's just make a range.

1:01:47.900 --> 1:01:50.540
 Let's just be very anthropocentric and say,

1:01:50.540 --> 1:01:52.460
 we're gonna look for aliens roughly our size

1:01:52.460 --> 1:01:53.860
 and technology our size.

1:01:53.860 --> 1:01:56.460
 Because we know it's possible on Earth, right?

1:01:56.460 --> 1:01:57.660
 I mean, a reasonable thing to do would be

1:01:57.660 --> 1:02:01.060
 to find exoplanets that are in the same zone as Earth

1:02:01.060 --> 1:02:03.180
 in terms of heat and stuff.

1:02:03.180 --> 1:02:06.300
 And then say, hey, if there's that same kind of gravity,

1:02:06.300 --> 1:02:09.820
 same kind of stuff, we could reasonably assume

1:02:09.820 --> 1:02:13.740
 that alien life there might use a similar kind

1:02:13.740 --> 1:02:15.980
 of physical infrastructure.

1:02:15.980 --> 1:02:16.820
 And then we're good.

1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:19.540
 So then your question becomes really relevant.

1:02:19.540 --> 1:02:22.220
 Say, right, let's use vision, sound, touch.

1:02:23.260 --> 1:02:24.100
 And then.

1:02:24.100 --> 1:02:24.940
 So okay, that's really nice.

1:02:24.940 --> 1:02:27.820
 So that if there's a lot of aliens out there,

1:02:27.820 --> 1:02:32.500
 there's a good likelihood if you match to the planet

1:02:32.500 --> 1:02:35.460
 that they're going to be in the same spatial

1:02:35.460 --> 1:02:38.340
 and temporal, operating in the same spatial

1:02:38.340 --> 1:02:40.460
 and temporal domain as humans.

1:02:40.460 --> 1:02:45.460
 Okay, within that, what do they look like visually?

1:02:47.980 --> 1:02:49.660
 What do they sound like?

1:02:49.660 --> 1:02:52.020
 What do they, oh god, this sounds creepy.

1:02:52.020 --> 1:02:56.460
 Tastes like, what do they, oh, smell like, smell like.

1:02:56.460 --> 1:02:57.540
 That sounds like our clubhouse.

1:02:57.540 --> 1:02:59.300
 We was like, can we have sex with aliens?

1:02:59.300 --> 1:03:01.020
 Which was basically me saying.

1:03:01.020 --> 1:03:01.860
 Passionate, passionate love.

1:03:01.860 --> 1:03:02.780
 But it wasn't actually about sex.

1:03:02.780 --> 1:03:04.900
 It was about, is our chemistry compatible, right?

1:03:04.900 --> 1:03:05.780
 Is there some?

1:03:05.780 --> 1:03:06.620
 Yeah.

1:03:06.620 --> 1:03:09.580
 Yeah, can we, yeah.

1:03:09.580 --> 1:03:10.820
 Are they edible too?

1:03:10.820 --> 1:03:12.180
 They could be very edible.

1:03:12.180 --> 1:03:13.020
 They could be delicious.

1:03:13.020 --> 1:03:14.740
 That's why I want to see some aliens, right?

1:03:14.740 --> 1:03:17.700
 Because I think, are there, I think evolution,

1:03:19.660 --> 1:03:21.540
 I mean, evolution exploits symmetry, right?

1:03:21.540 --> 1:03:23.380
 Because why generate memory?

1:03:23.380 --> 1:03:26.020
 Why generate storage, the need for storage space

1:03:26.020 --> 1:03:27.660
 when you can use symmetry?

1:03:27.660 --> 1:03:30.580
 So, and symmetry is quite, may be quite effective

1:03:30.580 --> 1:03:33.020
 in allowing you to mechanically design stuff, right?

1:03:33.020 --> 1:03:36.180
 So maybe alien, you could be reasonable to assume

1:03:36.180 --> 1:03:39.900
 that aliens could have, they could be bipedal.

1:03:39.900 --> 1:03:42.420
 They could be symmetric in the same way.

1:03:42.420 --> 1:03:44.860
 Might have a couple of eyes or a couple of senses.

1:03:44.860 --> 1:03:47.980
 We can make them, perhaps there's this whole zoo

1:03:47.980 --> 1:03:49.100
 of different aliens out there.

1:03:49.100 --> 1:03:50.740
 And we'll never get to be able to classify

1:03:50.740 --> 1:03:52.620
 some of the weird aliens we can't interact with

1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:55.660
 because they have made such weird stuff.

1:03:55.660 --> 1:03:57.220
 But we are just going to look at,

1:03:57.220 --> 1:03:59.140
 we're going to find aliens that look most like us.

1:03:59.140 --> 1:04:00.380
 Why not?

1:04:00.380 --> 1:04:02.260
 Because those are the first ones we're likely to see.

1:04:02.260 --> 1:04:03.100
 Yeah.

1:04:03.100 --> 1:04:03.940
 Yeah.

1:04:03.940 --> 1:04:06.060
 But I think it's really hard to imagine

1:04:06.060 --> 1:04:09.420
 what the space of aliens is because the space is huge.

1:04:09.420 --> 1:04:11.180
 Because, you know, like one of the arguments

1:04:11.180 --> 1:04:13.260
 that you can make about why life emerges in chemistry

1:04:13.260 --> 1:04:16.540
 is because chemistry is the first scale

1:04:16.540 --> 1:04:17.900
 in terms of like, you know,

1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:21.380
 building up objects from elementary objects.

1:04:21.380 --> 1:04:23.380
 That the number of possible things that could exist

1:04:23.380 --> 1:04:25.740
 is larger than the universe can possibly make all at once.

1:04:25.740 --> 1:04:26.580
 Right?

1:04:26.580 --> 1:04:29.380
 So imagine you have two planets

1:04:29.380 --> 1:04:31.700
 and they're cooking some geochemistry.

1:04:31.700 --> 1:04:34.860
 You know, our planet invented one kind of biochemistry.

1:04:34.860 --> 1:04:37.140
 And presumably as you start building up

1:04:37.140 --> 1:04:38.860
 the complexity of the molecules,

1:04:38.860 --> 1:04:41.300
 the chances of the overlap in those trajectories,

1:04:41.300 --> 1:04:44.900
 those causal chains being built up is probably very low.

1:04:44.900 --> 1:04:47.700
 And it gets lower and lower as it gets further advanced

1:04:47.700 --> 1:04:49.140
 along its evolutionary path.

1:04:49.140 --> 1:04:51.500
 So I think it's very difficult to imagine

1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:54.560
 predicting the technologies that aliens are gonna have.

1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:57.420
 I mean, it's so, you're looking at basically

1:04:57.420 --> 1:04:59.680
 planets have kind of convergent chemistry,

1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:00.840
 but there's some variability.

1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:02.720
 And then you're looking basically at the outgrowth

1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:04.540
 into the possibility space for chemistry.

1:05:04.540 --> 1:05:07.460
 So do you think we would detect the technology,

1:05:07.460 --> 1:05:11.540
 the objects created by aliens before we detect the aliens?

1:05:11.540 --> 1:05:12.380
 Possibly.

1:05:12.380 --> 1:05:15.820
 So when you're talking about measuring assembly index,

1:05:15.820 --> 1:05:19.260
 don't you think we would detect the garbage first?

1:05:19.260 --> 1:05:21.780
 Like at the outskirts of alien civilizations,

1:05:21.780 --> 1:05:23.380
 isn't this just gonna be trash?

1:05:26.140 --> 1:05:28.040
 I think I would come back to Arecibo.

1:05:28.040 --> 1:05:30.380
 The Arecibo message sent from the Arecibo telescope

1:05:30.380 --> 1:05:33.500
 built by Drake, I think, and Sagan.

1:05:33.500 --> 1:05:35.560
 How's Arecibo spelled?

1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:37.100
 A R E C I B O.

1:05:37.100 --> 1:05:37.940
 Yes, thank you.

1:05:37.940 --> 1:05:40.020
 And there we go, they've got that up there.

1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:41.900
 That's the telescope that sent the message

1:05:41.900 --> 1:05:42.740
 that you're talking about.

1:05:42.740 --> 1:05:45.540
 So that message was sent where?

1:05:45.540 --> 1:05:48.540
 It was beamed at a star, a specific star,

1:05:48.540 --> 1:05:51.340
 and it was sent out many years ago.

1:05:52.300 --> 1:05:55.160
 And what they did, so this is why I was pushing on binary,

1:05:55.160 --> 1:05:56.960
 it's a binary message.

1:05:56.960 --> 1:05:59.980
 I think it's a semi prime length number of characters.

1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:03.820
 So I think 73 by 23, I think.

1:06:03.820 --> 1:06:07.100
 And it basically represents human bit proton,

1:06:07.100 --> 1:06:10.500
 binary, human beings, DNA, male and female.

1:06:10.500 --> 1:06:12.660
 And it's really cool.

1:06:12.660 --> 1:06:17.660
 But I'm just wondering if it could be done

1:06:18.520 --> 1:06:19.860
 not making any,

1:06:19.860 --> 1:06:22.880
 cause it made assumptions that aliens speak binary.

1:06:22.880 --> 1:06:24.180
 Why make that assumption?

1:06:24.180 --> 1:06:27.660
 Why not just assume that if the difference between physics,

1:06:27.660 --> 1:06:29.860
 chemistry and biology is the amount of memory

1:06:29.860 --> 1:06:33.860
 that's instead that's recordable by the substrates,

1:06:33.860 --> 1:06:36.860
 then surely the universal thing,

1:06:36.860 --> 1:06:38.780
 I'm gonna make some sacrilegious statement,

1:06:38.780 --> 1:06:42.420
 which I think is pretty awesome for people to argue with.

1:06:42.420 --> 1:06:44.740
 So this is, we're looking at an image

1:06:44.740 --> 1:06:49.660
 where it's the entirety of the message encoded in binary.

1:06:49.660 --> 1:06:52.220
 And then there's a probably interpretation

1:06:52.220 --> 1:06:53.820
 of different parts of that image.

1:06:53.820 --> 1:06:57.900
 There's a person, there's green parts.

1:06:57.900 --> 1:06:59.600
 It looks like for people just listening,

1:06:59.600 --> 1:07:01.620
 like a game of Tetris.

1:07:01.620 --> 1:07:03.620
 So it's encoding in minimal ways,

1:07:03.620 --> 1:07:05.700
 a bunch of cool information, probably.

1:07:05.700 --> 1:07:06.780
 Representing all of us.

1:07:06.780 --> 1:07:08.940
 So the topic's kind of teaching us how to count

1:07:08.940 --> 1:07:10.040
 and then it all goes all the way down

1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:12.340
 teaching you chemistry and then just says,

1:07:12.340 --> 1:07:14.020
 but it makes so many assumptions.

1:07:14.020 --> 1:07:16.080
 And I think if we can actually,

1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:19.220
 so look, I think, I mean, Sarah's much more eloquent

1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:20.500
 in expressing this, but I'll have a go

1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:21.900
 and you can correct it if you want,

1:07:21.900 --> 1:07:25.380
 which is like one of the things that Sarah has had

1:07:25.380 --> 1:07:29.500
 a profound effect on the way I look at the origin of life.

1:07:29.500 --> 1:07:31.580
 And this is one of the reasons why we're working together

1:07:31.580 --> 1:07:34.180
 because we don't really care about the origin of life.

1:07:34.180 --> 1:07:37.580
 We wanna make life, make aliens and find aliens.

1:07:37.580 --> 1:07:38.840
 Make aliens, find aliens.

1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:40.740
 I think we might have to make aliens in the lab

1:07:40.740 --> 1:07:42.860
 before we find aliens in the universe, right?

1:07:42.860 --> 1:07:45.460
 I think that would be a cool way to do it.

1:07:45.460 --> 1:07:48.340
 So what is it about the universe that creates aliens?

1:07:48.340 --> 1:07:51.620
 Well, it's selection through assembly theory,

1:07:51.620 --> 1:07:53.620
 creating memories, because when you create memories,

1:07:53.620 --> 1:07:57.100
 you can then command your domain.

1:07:57.100 --> 1:07:58.380
 You can basically do stuff.

1:07:58.380 --> 1:07:59.940
 You can command matter.

1:08:00.800 --> 1:08:03.600
 So we need to find a way by understanding what life is

1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:05.980
 of how the minimal way to command matter,

1:08:05.980 --> 1:08:08.220
 how that would emerge in the universe.

1:08:08.220 --> 1:08:10.000
 And if we want to communicate,

1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:11.020
 I mean, maybe we don't want

1:08:11.020 --> 1:08:13.660
 to necessarily uniformly communicate.

1:08:13.660 --> 1:08:15.340
 What I would do perhaps if I had,

1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:18.140
 is I would send out lots of probes away from Earth

1:08:18.140 --> 1:08:20.060
 that have this magic way of communicating with aliens,

1:08:20.060 --> 1:08:23.540
 get them quite a far away from Earth, plausibly deniable,

1:08:23.540 --> 1:08:25.700
 and then send out the message

1:08:25.700 --> 1:08:27.220
 that would then attract all the aliens,

1:08:27.220 --> 1:08:29.620
 and then basically work out if they were friend or foe

1:08:29.620 --> 1:08:30.660
 and how they wanna hang out.

1:08:30.660 --> 1:08:33.020
 The messages being something has to do with the memories.

1:08:33.020 --> 1:08:36.820
 Yes, like the assembly version of Arecibo,

1:08:36.820 --> 1:08:38.420
 so that everyone in the universe

1:08:38.420 --> 1:08:40.980
 that has been understands what life is.

1:08:40.980 --> 1:08:43.300
 So aliens need to work out what they are.

1:08:43.300 --> 1:08:44.900
 Once they've worked out what they are,

1:08:44.900 --> 1:08:47.220
 they then can work out how to encode what they are,

1:08:47.220 --> 1:08:48.660
 and then they can go out and send messages.

1:08:48.660 --> 1:08:52.820
 It's like the universal, the Rosetta Stone

1:08:52.820 --> 1:08:55.940
 for life in the universe is working out

1:08:55.940 --> 1:08:56.940
 how the memories are built.

1:08:56.940 --> 1:08:59.140
 I don't know, Sarah, you have any, well,

1:09:01.180 --> 1:09:02.880
 whether you would agree with that.

1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:06.140
 No, I wanted to raise a different point,

1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:09.500
 which is about the fact that we can't see the aliens yet

1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:11.660
 because we haven't gotten the technology.

1:09:11.660 --> 1:09:14.060
 And presumably we think assembly theory

1:09:14.060 --> 1:09:15.140
 is the right way of doing it,

1:09:15.140 --> 1:09:16.500
 but I don't think that we know how to go

1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:18.900
 from the kind of data you're describing, Lex,

1:09:18.900 --> 1:09:21.280
 like visual data or smell

1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:23.500
 to construct the assembly spaces yet.

1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:25.660
 And in some ways, I think that the problem

1:09:25.660 --> 1:09:28.460
 of life detection really is the same problem

1:09:28.460 --> 1:09:31.660
 at the foundations of AI that we don't understand

1:09:31.660 --> 1:09:35.100
 how to get machines to see causal graphs,

1:09:35.100 --> 1:09:36.980
 to see reality in terms of causation.

1:09:37.860 --> 1:09:40.340
 And so I think assembly and AI

1:09:40.340 --> 1:09:43.660
 are gonna intersect in interesting ways, hopefully,

1:09:43.660 --> 1:09:46.100
 but the sort of key point,

1:09:46.100 --> 1:09:49.660
 and I've been trying to make this argument more recently,

1:09:49.660 --> 1:09:50.820
 I might write an essay on it,

1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:53.460
 is people talk about the great filter, right?

1:09:53.460 --> 1:09:55.540
 And which is, again, this doomsday thing

1:09:55.540 --> 1:09:57.820
 that people wanna say there's no aliens out there

1:09:57.820 --> 1:10:00.140
 because something terrible happened to them.

1:10:00.140 --> 1:10:03.820
 And it matters whether that's in our past or our future

1:10:03.820 --> 1:10:06.460
 as to the longevity of our species, presumably,

1:10:06.460 --> 1:10:07.980
 which is why people find it interesting.

1:10:07.980 --> 1:10:10.780
 But I think it's not a physical filter.

1:10:10.780 --> 1:10:11.980
 It's not like things go extinct.

1:10:11.980 --> 1:10:12.800
 I think it's literally,

1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:15.700
 we don't have the technology to see them.

1:10:15.700 --> 1:10:17.020
 And you could see that with microscopes.

1:10:17.020 --> 1:10:18.660
 I mean, we didn't know there were microbes on this table

1:10:18.660 --> 1:10:21.760
 or tables for thousands of years or telescopes.

1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:23.460
 Like there's so much of the universe we can't see.

1:10:23.460 --> 1:10:25.700
 And then basically what we have done as a species

1:10:25.700 --> 1:10:29.280
 is outsource our physical perceptions to technology,

1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:31.180
 building microscopes based on our eyes,

1:10:31.180 --> 1:10:34.920
 and building seismometers based on our sense of feelings,

1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:36.240
 like feel earthquakes and things.

1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:38.120
 And AI is basically we're trying to outsource

1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:40.560
 what's actually happening in our thinking apparatus

1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:43.120
 into machines now and to technological devices.

1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:45.100
 And maybe that's the key technology

1:10:45.100 --> 1:10:47.220
 that's gonna allow us to see things like us

1:10:47.220 --> 1:10:48.800
 and see the universe in a totally different way.

1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:50.240
 But you kind of mentioned the great filter.

1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:52.280
 Do you think there's a way through technology

1:10:52.280 --> 1:10:54.000
 to stop being able to see stuff?

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:55.760
 So can you take a step backwards?

1:10:55.760 --> 1:10:56.600
 I think so, yeah.

1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:58.640
 Did you imply that with the great, so like?

1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:01.080
 Well, no, I mean, I think there's a great perceptual filter

1:11:01.080 --> 1:11:06.080
 in the sense that a example of life evolving on a planet

1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:08.800
 over billions of years has to acquire

1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:11.000
 a certain amount of knowledge and technology

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.640
 to actually recognize the phenomena that it is.

1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:17.040
 Well, that's the sense I have is,

1:11:17.880 --> 1:11:20.640
 I mean, you talk with physicists, engineers in general,

1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:23.760
 there's this kind of idea that we have

1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:27.960
 most of the tools already to hear the signal.

1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:31.800
 But to me, it feels like we don't have any of the tools

1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:32.640
 to see the signal.

1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:33.680
 No, we don't know what we're doing, yeah, I agree.

1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:35.840
 That's the biggest, like to hear.

1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:37.840
 We don't have the tools to really hear, to see.

1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:39.200
 Yeah.

1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:40.160
 Aliens are everywhere.

1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:44.960
 We just don't have the, yeah, well, oh, that's.

1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:46.320
 I mean, I got this in part, actually,

1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:47.460
 because you were like, you know,

1:11:47.460 --> 1:11:49.480
 last time I was here, he was like, look at the carpet.

1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:51.160
 You know, if you had an alien detector

1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:52.600
 where the carpet be aliens.

1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:54.560
 I mean, I think we really don't.

1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:56.080
 I think it would be.

1:11:56.080 --> 1:11:58.960
 But the aliens would nevertheless have a high assembly index

1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:01.240
 or produce things of high assembly index.

1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:03.280
 And those things of high assembly index,

1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:07.120
 you have to have a detector that can recognize

1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:09.160
 high assembly index in all its forms.

1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:10.080
 Yeah. Yes.

1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:10.920
 That's it, that's it.

1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:13.760
 Take data, construct assembly space.

1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:15.240
 Yeah. Those patterns, basically.

1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:17.480
 So one way to think about high assembly index

1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:21.560
 is interesting patterns of basic ingredients.

1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:23.240
 I can give you an example,

1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:24.360
 because I mean, in molecules,

1:12:24.360 --> 1:12:25.480
 we've been talking about in objects,

1:12:25.480 --> 1:12:29.080
 but we're also trying to do it in spatial trajectories.

1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:30.980
 Like, imagine you're just,

1:12:30.980 --> 1:12:33.660
 like, I always get bothered by the fact that, like,

1:12:33.660 --> 1:12:35.400
 when you look at birds flocking,

1:12:35.400 --> 1:12:37.460
 you can describe that with like a simple Boyd's model,

1:12:37.460 --> 1:12:38.960
 or like, you know, people use spin glass

1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:40.120
 to describe animal behavior.

1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:42.100
 And those are like really simple physics models.

1:12:42.100 --> 1:12:46.740
 Yet you're looking at a system that you know has agency

1:12:46.740 --> 1:12:48.840
 and there's intelligence in those birds.

1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:52.000
 And basically, like, you can't help but think

1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:53.920
 there must be some statistical signatures

1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:55.720
 of the fact that they're,

1:12:55.720 --> 1:12:58.120
 that's a group of agents versus, you know, like,

1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:00.200
 I don't know, you know, the physics example,

1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:03.720
 maybe like, I don't know, Brownian motion or something.

1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:04.640
 And so what we're trying to do

1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:06.640
 is actually apply assembly to trajectory data

1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:09.920
 to try to say there's a minimal amount of causal history

1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:12.880
 to build up certain trajectories for observed agents

1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:15.160
 that's like an agency detector for behavior.

1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:17.880
 Do you think it's possible to do some like Boyd's

1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:21.740
 or those kinds of things, like artificial,

1:13:21.740 --> 1:13:25.000
 like cellular automata, play with those ideas

1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:28.300
 with assembly, with assembly theory?

1:13:28.300 --> 1:13:32.100
 Have you found any useful, really simple mathematical,

1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:36.040
 like, simulation tools that allow you

1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:38.040
 to play with these concepts?

1:13:38.040 --> 1:13:40.840
 So like one, of course, you're doing mass spec

1:13:40.840 --> 1:13:44.280
 in this physical space with chemistry,

1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:45.760
 but it just seems, well, I mean,

1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:47.360
 computer science person, maybe,

1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:48.760
 it seems easier to just.

1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:49.600
 I agree with you.

1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:53.320
 It seems even sexier in terms of tweeting visual information

1:13:53.320 --> 1:13:56.600
 on Twitter or Instagram, more importantly,

1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:01.120
 to play like, here's an organism of a low assembly index

1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:03.560
 and here's an organism of a high assembly index

1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:07.320
 and let's watch them create more and more memories

1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:09.300
 and more and more complex objects.

1:14:09.300 --> 1:14:11.040
 And so like, in mathematics,

1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:12.920
 you get to observe what that looks like

1:14:12.920 --> 1:14:15.760
 to build up an intuition what assembly index is like.

1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:17.840
 We are building a toolkit right now.

1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:19.680
 So I think it's a really good idea,

1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:22.080
 but what we've got to do is I'm kind of still obsessed

1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:24.220
 with the infrastructure required.

1:14:24.220 --> 1:14:27.040
 And one of the reasons why I was pushing on information

1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:29.500
 and mathematics when human beings,

1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:31.800
 when human beings, we take a lot of the infrastructure

1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:33.000
 for granted.

1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.120
 And I think we have to strip that back a bit

1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:36.840
 for going forward, but you're absolutely right.

1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:40.520
 I would agree that I think the fact that we exist

1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:42.480
 in the universe, this is like,

1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:44.480
 I can see that lots of people would disagree

1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:47.080
 with the statement, but I don't think Sarah will,

1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:48.440
 but I don't know.

1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:50.480
 The fact that objects exist,

1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:53.500
 I don't think anyone on earth will disagree

1:14:53.500 --> 1:14:55.860
 that objects can exist elsewhere, right?

1:14:55.860 --> 1:14:58.880
 But they will disagree that life can exist elsewhere.

1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:01.200
 But what perhaps I'm trying to say is that

1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:06.200
 the acquisition, the universe's ability to acquire memory

1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:10.120
 is the very first step for building life.

1:15:10.120 --> 1:15:14.120
 And that must be, that's so easy to happen.

1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:16.640
 So therefore alien life is everywhere

1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:18.800
 because all alien life is,

1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:22.120
 is those memories being compressed and minimalized

1:15:22.120 --> 1:15:24.800
 and the alien equivalent of the cell working.

1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:27.800
 So I think that we will build new technologies

1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:32.280
 to find aliens, but we need to understand what we are first

1:15:32.280 --> 1:15:35.440
 and how we go from physics to chemistry to biology.

1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:38.640
 The most interesting thing,

1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:40.960
 as you're saying to these two organisms,

1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:43.640
 different assemblies, there's one you get into biology.

1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:45.000
 Biology gets more and more weird,

1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:46.520
 more and more contingent.

1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:48.840
 Physics is, chemistry is less weird

1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:50.200
 cause the rules of chemistry are smaller

1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:51.040
 than the rules of biology.

1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:53.920
 And then going away to physics where you have a very

1:15:56.040 --> 1:16:00.280
 nicely tangible number of ways of arranging things.

1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:03.880
 And I think assembly theory just helps you appreciate that.

1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:04.800
 And so once we get there,

1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:08.280
 my dream is that we are just gonna be able to suddenly,

1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:10.600
 I mean, I'm maybe just being really arrogant here.

1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:11.600
 I don't mean to be arrogant.

1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:14.080
 It's just, I've got this hammer called assembly

1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:15.400
 and everything's a nail.

1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:17.400
 But I think that once we crack it,

1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:20.120
 we'll be able to use assembly theory plus telescopes

1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:20.960
 to find aliens.

1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:25.680
 Do you have, Sarah, do you have disagreements with Lee

1:16:25.680 --> 1:16:28.920
 on the number of aliens that are out there?

1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:30.440
 I do actually, yeah, well.

1:16:30.440 --> 1:16:31.640
 And what they look like.

1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:33.240
 So any of the things we've been talking about,

1:16:33.240 --> 1:16:38.240
 is there nuanced, it's always nice to discover wisdom

1:16:40.920 --> 1:16:43.520
 through nuanced disagreement.

1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:47.360
 Yeah, I don't wholly disagree, but I think,

1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:48.640
 but I do think I disagree.

1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:51.360
 It's kind of, there's nuance there.

1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:52.200
 But Lee made it.

1:16:52.200 --> 1:16:53.040
 You can disagree.

1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:54.640
 No, it's fine.

1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:55.720
 It is nuanced, right?

1:16:55.720 --> 1:16:58.160
 So you made the point earlier that you think,

1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:02.000
 once we discover what life is,

1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.400
 we'll see alien life everywhere.

1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:06.440
 And I think I agree on some levels in the sense

1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:09.160
 that I think the physics that governs us is universal.

1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:11.360
 But I don't know how far I would go to say,

1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:12.960
 to say that we're a likely phenomenon

1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:15.920
 because we don't understand all of the features

1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:17.680
 of the transition at the origin of life,

1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:19.720
 which we would just say in assembly,

1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:22.680
 as you go from the no memory physics

1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:26.120
 to there's like a critical transition

1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:27.160
 around the assembly index

1:17:27.160 --> 1:17:28.760
 where assembliness starts to increase.

1:17:28.760 --> 1:17:30.280
 And that's what we call the evolution of the biosphere

1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:32.920
 and complexification of the biosphere.

1:17:32.920 --> 1:17:34.760
 So there's a principle of increasing assembliness

1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:35.840
 where that goes back to what I was saying

1:17:35.840 --> 1:17:38.040
 at the very beginning about the physics of the possible,

1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:40.760
 that the universe basically gets in this mode

1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:44.080
 of trying to make as much possibilities as possible.

1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:48.960
 Now, how often that transition happens

1:17:48.960 --> 1:17:50.600
 that you get the kind of cascading effect

1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:53.080
 that we get in our biosphere, I think we don't know.

1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:54.680
 If we did, we would know the likelihood of life

1:17:54.680 --> 1:17:55.520
 in the universe.

1:17:55.520 --> 1:17:57.120
 And a lot of people wanna say life is common,

1:17:57.120 --> 1:17:58.400
 but I don't think that we can say that yet

1:17:58.400 --> 1:17:59.880
 till we have the empirical data,

1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:01.360
 which I think you would agree with.

1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:04.480
 But then there's this other kind of thought experiment I have

1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:07.960
 which I don't like, but I did have it,

1:18:07.960 --> 1:18:11.800
 which is if life emerges on one planet

1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:13.440
 and you get this real high density of things

1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:14.680
 that can exist on that planet,

1:18:14.680 --> 1:18:17.880
 is it sort of dominating the density of creation

1:18:17.880 --> 1:18:19.360
 that the universe can actually generate?

1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:21.480
 So like if you're thinking about counting entropy, right?

1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:23.840
 Like the universe has a certain amount of stuff in it.

1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:27.920
 And then assembly is kind of like an entropic principle.

1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:29.080
 It's not entropy.

1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:33.000
 But the idea is that now transformations among stuff

1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:36.200
 or the actual physical histories of things

1:18:36.200 --> 1:18:37.680
 now become things that you have to count

1:18:37.680 --> 1:18:40.160
 as far as saying that these things exist

1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:42.880
 and we're increasing the number of things that exist.

1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:45.520
 And if you think about that cosmologically,

1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:47.720
 maybe Earth is sucking up all the life potential

1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:49.440
 of the whole universe, I don't know.

1:18:49.440 --> 1:18:50.280
 But I haven't.

1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:51.960
 How's that, can you expand that a little bit?

1:18:51.960 --> 1:18:54.400
 Why can any one geographical region

1:18:54.400 --> 1:18:57.640
 suck up the creative capacity of the universe?

1:18:57.640 --> 1:19:00.280
 Just like, I know it's a ridiculous thought.

1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:01.600
 I don't actually agree with it,

1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:02.440
 but it was just a thought experiment.

1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:04.640
 I love that you can have thoughts

1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:07.000
 that you don't like and don't agree with,

1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:09.040
 but you have to think through them anyway.

1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:11.960
 The human mind is fascinating.

1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:15.400
 Yeah, I think these sort of counterfactual

1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:16.440
 thought experiments are really good

1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:17.640
 when you're trying to build new theories

1:19:17.640 --> 1:19:19.960
 because you have to think through all the consequences.

1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:23.480
 And there are people that want to try to account for,

1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:25.240
 say, the degrees of freedom on our planet

1:19:25.240 --> 1:19:28.560
 in cosmological inventories of talking about

1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:29.680
 the entropy of the universe.

1:19:29.680 --> 1:19:32.200
 And when we're thinking about cosmological

1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:33.600
 arrow of time and things like that.

1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:35.480
 Now, I think those are pretty superficial proposals

1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:37.120
 as they stand now, but assembly would give you

1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:38.320
 a way of counting it.

1:19:38.320 --> 1:19:40.200
 And then the question is if there's a certain

1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:43.160
 maximal capacity of the universe's speed

1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:45.480
 of generating stuff, which Lee always has this argument

1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:47.600
 that assembly is about time.

1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:49.280
 The universe is generating more states.

1:19:49.280 --> 1:19:52.920
 Really what it's generating is more assembly possibilities.

1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:56.120
 And then dark energy might be one manifestation of that,

1:19:56.120 --> 1:19:58.280
 that the universe is accelerating its expansion

1:19:58.280 --> 1:20:00.080
 because that makes more physical space.

1:20:00.080 --> 1:20:02.440
 And what's happening on our planet is it's accelerating

1:20:02.440 --> 1:20:05.200
 in the expansion of possible things that exist.

1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:07.120
 And maybe the universe just has a maximal rate

1:20:07.120 --> 1:20:09.360
 of what it can do to generate things.

1:20:09.360 --> 1:20:11.080
 And then if there is a maximal rate,

1:20:11.080 --> 1:20:12.400
 maybe only a certain number of planets

1:20:12.400 --> 1:20:13.600
 can actually do that.

1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:16.160
 Or there's a trade off about the pace of growth

1:20:16.160 --> 1:20:18.080
 on certain planets versus others.

1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:19.240
 I have a million questions there,

1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:20.840
 but do you have thoughts on?

1:20:20.840 --> 1:20:22.560
 Just a quick, yeah, I'll just say something very quick.

1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:23.400
 It's a thought experiment.

1:20:23.400 --> 1:20:24.320
 No, it's good, I think I get it.

1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:25.160
 I think I get it.

1:20:25.160 --> 1:20:29.000
 So what I want to say is when I mean aliens are everywhere,

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:34.000
 I mean memories are the prerequisite

1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.960
 for aliens via selection

1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:39.000
 and then concentration of selection

1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:40.320
 when selection becomes autonomous.

1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:42.440
 So what I would love to do is to build,

1:20:42.440 --> 1:20:45.440
 say a magical telescope that was a memory,

1:20:45.440 --> 1:20:48.040
 a magical one, or a real one,

1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:51.320
 that would be a memory detector to see selection.

1:20:51.320 --> 1:20:54.080
 So you could get to exoplanets and say that exoplanet

1:20:54.080 --> 1:20:56.160
 looks like there's lots of selection going on there.

1:20:56.160 --> 1:20:58.720
 Maybe there's evolution and maybe there's going to be life.

1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:00.120
 So what I'm trying to say is narrow down

1:21:00.120 --> 1:21:01.640
 the regions of space where you say

1:21:01.640 --> 1:21:05.320
 there's definitely evidence of memory as high assembly there

1:21:05.320 --> 1:21:07.000
 or not high assembly, because that would be life,

1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:11.120
 but where it's capable of happening.

1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:14.400
 And then that would also help us frame the search for aliens.

1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:16.920
 I don't know how likely it is to make the transition

1:21:16.920 --> 1:21:18.840
 to cells and all the other things.

1:21:18.840 --> 1:21:20.200
 I think you're right.

1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:23.360
 But I think that we just need to get more data.

1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:24.800
 Well, I didn't like the thought experiment

1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:25.960
 because I don't like the idea

1:21:25.960 --> 1:21:27.560
 that if the universe has a maximal limit

1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:29.640
 on the amount it can generate per unit time

1:21:29.640 --> 1:21:31.800
 that our existence is actually precluding the existence

1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:32.640
 of other things.

1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:33.480
 Well, I'll just say one thing.

1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:34.320
 But I think that's probably true anyway

1:21:34.320 --> 1:21:35.520
 because of the resource limitations.

1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:37.320
 So I don't like your thought experiment

1:21:37.320 --> 1:21:39.280
 because I think it's wrong.

1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:41.400
 Well, no, no, I do like the thought experiment.

1:21:41.400 --> 1:21:42.320
 So what you're trying to say is like,

1:21:42.320 --> 1:21:44.040
 there is a chain of events that goes back

1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:48.120
 that's manifestly culminated with life on Earth.

1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:50.120
 And you're not saying that life isn't possible elsewhere.

1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:52.320
 You say that there has been these number of things,

1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:53.560
 contingent things that have happened

1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:55.680
 that have allowed life to merge here.

1:21:56.640 --> 1:21:58.200
 That doesn't mean that life can't emerge elsewhere,

1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:00.400
 but you're saying that the intersection of events

1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:03.040
 may be concentrated here, right?

1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:05.000
 And I think there's...

1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:06.240
 Not exactly.

1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:10.720
 It's more like if you look at,

1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:12.200
 say the causal graphs are fundamental,

1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:14.080
 maybe space is an emergent property,

1:22:14.080 --> 1:22:16.680
 which is consistent with some proposals on quantum gravity,

1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:18.960
 but also how we talk about things in assembly theory.

1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:22.200
 Then the universe is causal graphs generating

1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:24.200
 more structure in causal graphs, right?

1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:26.160
 So this is how the universe is unfolding.

1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:30.040
 And maybe there's a cap on the rate of generation.

1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:31.640
 Like there's only so much stuff

1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:34.600
 that gets made per update of the universe.

1:22:34.600 --> 1:22:36.360
 And then if there's a lot of stuff being made

1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:38.480
 in a particular region that happens

1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:40.920
 to look the same locally, spatially,

1:22:40.920 --> 1:22:43.280
 that's an after effect of the fact

1:22:43.280 --> 1:22:45.360
 that the whole causal graph is updating.

1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:47.600
 Like it's...

1:22:47.600 --> 1:22:49.240
 Yeah, I don't know that.

1:22:49.240 --> 1:22:51.000
 I think that that doesn't work.

1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:51.920
 I don't think it works either,

1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:53.720
 but I don't have a good argument in my mind about.

1:22:53.720 --> 1:22:55.960
 But I do like the idea of the capacity that universe,

1:22:55.960 --> 1:22:57.600
 cause you've got the number of states.

1:22:57.600 --> 1:22:59.320
 Yeah, we can come back to it.

1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:00.360
 Let me ask real quick.

1:23:00.360 --> 1:23:04.680
 Like why does different like local pockets

1:23:04.680 --> 1:23:07.400
 of the universe start remembering stuff?

1:23:07.400 --> 1:23:10.480
 How does memory emerge exactly?

1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:15.480
 So at the origin of the universe, it was very forgetful.

1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:17.680
 That's when the physicists were happiest.

1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:19.680
 It was low memory objects,

1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:23.880
 which is like ultra low memory objects,

1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:26.520
 which is what the definition of stuff.

1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:29.080
 Okay, so how does memory emerge?

1:23:29.080 --> 1:23:34.080
 How does the temporal stickiness of objects emerge?

1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:42.000
 I'm gonna take a very chemocentric point of view

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000
 because I can't imagine any other way of doing it.

1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.040
 You could think of other ways maybe.

1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:52.120
 But I would say heterogeneity in matter

1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:53.400
 is where the memory...

1:23:53.400 --> 1:23:55.560
 So you must have enough different ways

1:23:55.560 --> 1:23:58.560
 of rearranging matter for there to be a memory.

1:23:58.560 --> 1:23:59.400
 So what that means,

1:23:59.400 --> 1:24:01.080
 if you've got particles colliding in a box,

1:24:01.080 --> 1:24:05.920
 let's just take some elements in a box.

1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:10.320
 Those elements can combine in a combinatorial set of ways.

1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:11.840
 So there's a combinatorial explosion

1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:15.320
 of the number of molecules or minerals or solid objects,

1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:17.000
 bonds being made.

1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:19.360
 Because there's such a large number,

1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:22.280
 the population of different objects that are possible,

1:24:22.280 --> 1:24:23.800
 this goes back to assembly theory

1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:27.480
 where assembly theory, there's four types of universes.

1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:30.840
 So you've got basically, and this is what one was up earlier

1:24:30.840 --> 1:24:33.520
 where one universe where you've just got

1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:34.480
 everything is possible.

1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:35.600
 So you can take all the atoms

1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:37.480
 and combine them and make everything.

1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:42.360
 Then you've got basically what is the assembly combinatorial

1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:46.000
 where you basically have to accrue information in steps.

1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:49.240
 Then you've got assembly observed,

1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:51.520
 and then you've got the object assembly going back.

1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:53.640
 So what I'm trying to say is like,

1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:55.400
 if you can take atoms and make bonds,

1:24:55.400 --> 1:24:57.440
 let's say you take a nitrogen atom and add it

1:24:57.440 --> 1:24:59.600
 to a carbon atom, you find an amino acid,

1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:01.000
 then you add another carbon atom on

1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:02.160
 in a particular configuration,

1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:04.280
 then another one, all different molecules.

1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:07.720
 They all represent different histories.

1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:10.200
 So I would say for me right now,

1:25:10.200 --> 1:25:13.160
 the most simple route into life seems to be

1:25:13.160 --> 1:25:16.080
 through recording memories and chemistry.

1:25:16.080 --> 1:25:18.200
 But that doesn't mean there can't be other ways

1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:20.680
 and can't be other emergent effects.

1:25:20.680 --> 1:25:22.520
 But I think if you can make bonds

1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:24.240
 and lots of different bonds,

1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:29.240
 and those molecules can have a causal effect on the future.

1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:31.200
 So imagine a box of atoms,

1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:35.000
 and then you combine those atoms in some way.

1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:40.000
 So you make molecule A from load of atoms,

1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:43.160
 and then molecule A can go back to the box

1:25:43.160 --> 1:25:44.960
 and influence the box.

1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:49.720
 Then you make A prime or AB or ABC.

1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:51.160
 And that process keeps going,

1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:53.240
 and that's where the memories come from,

1:25:53.240 --> 1:25:57.160
 is that heterogeneity in the universe from bonding.

1:25:57.160 --> 1:25:58.000
 I don't know if that makes any sense.

1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:03.000
 And it's beginning to flourish at the chemistry level.

1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:05.120
 Yeah.

1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:09.160
 So the physicists have no, like not enough.

1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:11.000
 Yeah, I mean.

1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.040
 They're like desperately begging

1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:20.040
 for more freedom and heterogeneous components to play with.

1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:23.120
 Yeah, that's exactly it.

1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:24.760
 What do you think about that, Sarah?

1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:26.800
 I mentioned already, I think it's significant

1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:28.560
 that whatever physics governs life

1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:30.120
 emerges actually in chemistry.

1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:32.880
 It's not relevant at the subatomic scale

1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:34.920
 or even at the atomic scale.

1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:37.960
 It's in, well, atomic scale because chemistry.

1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:40.880
 But like when you get into this combinatorial diversity

1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:44.400
 that you get from combining things on the periodic table,

1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:47.600
 that's when selection actually matters

1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:49.000
 or the fact that some things can exist

1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:52.080
 and others can't exist actually starts to matter.

1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:55.840
 So I think of it like you don't study gravity

1:26:55.840 --> 1:26:57.120
 inside the atomic nucleus.

1:26:57.120 --> 1:26:59.000
 You study it in terms of large scale structure

1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:01.320
 of the universe or black holes or things like that.

1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:04.320
 And whatever we're talking about as physics of information

1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:06.160
 or physics of assembly becomes relevant

1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:08.040
 at a certain scale of reality.

1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:11.080
 And the transition that you're talking about,

1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:15.120
 I would think of as just when you get a sufficient density

1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:16.840
 in terms of the assembly space

1:27:16.840 --> 1:27:18.560
 of like the relationship of the overlap

1:27:18.560 --> 1:27:20.680
 and the assembly space,

1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:23.200
 which is like a feature of common memory,

1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:27.560
 there is this transition to assembly dominated physics,

1:27:27.560 --> 1:27:29.000
 whatever that is.

1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:30.480
 Oh, like when we're talking about,

1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:31.920
 and we're trying to map out exactly

1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:33.120
 what that transition looks like.

1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:36.240
 We're pretty sure of some of its features,

1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:37.720
 but we haven't done all of the...

1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:39.560
 Do you think if you were there in the early universe,

1:27:39.560 --> 1:27:41.080
 you would have been able to predict

1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:43.200
 the emergence of chemistry and biology?

1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:46.880
 And I ask that because at this stage as humans,

1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:51.280
 do you think we can possibly predict the length of memory

1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:55.640
 that might be able to be formed later on

1:27:55.640 --> 1:27:56.920
 in this pocket of the universe?

1:27:56.920 --> 1:28:01.920
 Like how complex is, what is the ceiling of assembly?

1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:04.920
 I think as much time as you have in the past

1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:06.800
 is how much you can predict in the future.

1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:09.400
 Because it's actually physical in the system

1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:10.840
 and you have to have enough time

1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:15.840
 for features of that structure to exist.

1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:17.360
 Wait, let me push back on that.

1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:19.920
 Isn't there somewhere in the universe

1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:21.900
 that's like a shortest path that's been,

1:28:21.900 --> 1:28:23.920
 that stretches all the way to the beginning?

1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:24.760
 Yeah.

1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:26.720
 That's building some giant monster?

1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:27.720
 Maybe, yeah.

1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:28.560
 Yeah.

1:28:28.560 --> 1:28:29.400
 So you can't predict.

1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:30.560
 The universe has as much memory

1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:32.520
 as the largest assembly object in the universe.

1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:33.360
 Yeah. Right.

1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:35.320
 But so you can't predict.

1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:37.480
 You can't predict any deeper than that, no.

1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:38.320
 Right.

1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:40.800
 So like that, I guess what I'm saying is,

1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:43.560
 like what intuition do you have about complexity

1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:46.280
 living in the world that you'd have today?

1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:49.040
 Right, because you just, you can,

1:28:49.040 --> 1:28:54.040
 I mean I guess how long does it get more fun?

1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:55.880
 Like isn't there gonna be at some point,

1:28:55.880 --> 1:28:57.960
 because there's a heat death in the universe,

1:28:57.960 --> 1:29:01.760
 isn't there going to be a point of the most,

1:29:01.760 --> 1:29:04.320
 of the highest assembly of object,

1:29:04.320 --> 1:29:07.080
 with the highest probability being generated?

1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:08.560
 When is the universe gonna be the most fun,

1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:10.160
 and can we freeze ourselves and then live then?

1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:11.000
 Exactly.

1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:14.280
 And will you know when you're having the most fun

1:29:14.280 --> 1:29:16.800
 that this is the best time, you're in your prime?

1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:18.080
 Are you going to do what everyone does,

1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:19.920
 which is deny that you're in your prime,

1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:21.840
 and the best years are still ahead of you?

1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:23.160
 I don't know.

1:29:23.160 --> 1:29:24.400
 What option do you have?

1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:29.760
 I don't, I mean the problem is there's lots of,

1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:31.360
 lots of really interesting features here.

1:29:31.360 --> 1:29:33.600
 I just wanna mention one thing that might be,

1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:36.160
 is I do think assembly theory applies all the way back

1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:37.800
 to subatomic particles.

1:29:37.800 --> 1:29:40.360
 And I also think that cosmological selection

1:29:40.360 --> 1:29:42.720
 might've been actually, there might've been,

1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:43.840
 I would say it's a really boring bit,

1:29:43.840 --> 1:29:45.960
 but it's really important for a cosmologist

1:29:45.960 --> 1:29:47.600
 that universes have gone through.

1:29:47.600 --> 1:29:49.400
 Was it Lee Smolin who proposed this?

1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:50.760
 Maybe that there is this,

1:29:50.760 --> 1:29:52.200
 that basically a universe evolves,

1:29:52.200 --> 1:29:54.920
 you've got the wrong constants, we'll start again.

1:29:54.920 --> 1:29:56.280
 And the most productive constants

1:29:56.280 --> 1:29:59.120
 where you can allow particles to form in a certain way,

1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:01.160
 propagate to the next universe, and we go again.

1:30:01.160 --> 1:30:03.200
 So actually selection goes all the way back,

1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:04.720
 and there's this cycle of universes.

1:30:04.720 --> 1:30:06.560
 And now this universe has been selected

1:30:06.560 --> 1:30:10.400
 because life can occur, and it carries on.

1:30:10.400 --> 1:30:12.480
 But I've really butchered that.

1:30:12.480 --> 1:30:13.320
 There is a much more.

1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:17.480
 So this is some aspect where through the selection process

1:30:17.480 --> 1:30:19.320
 there's parameters that are being fine tuned,

1:30:19.320 --> 1:30:20.680
 and we happen to be living in one

1:30:20.680 --> 1:30:22.840
 where there's some level of fine tuning.

1:30:22.840 --> 1:30:27.560
 Is there, given that, can you steel man the case

1:30:27.560 --> 1:30:31.280
 that we humans are alone in the universe?

1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:34.960
 We are the highest assembly index object in the universe.

1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:36.160
 Yeah, I can, I guess.

1:30:36.160 --> 1:30:37.280
 Sad though.

1:30:37.280 --> 1:30:38.120
 I mean, so from a.

1:30:38.120 --> 1:30:39.200
 Is it possible?

1:30:39.200 --> 1:30:41.440
 Yes, it's possible.

1:30:41.440 --> 1:30:43.320
 Let's assume.

1:30:43.320 --> 1:30:44.280
 Well, we know.

1:30:45.240 --> 1:30:46.440
 I mean, it's possible.

1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:50.880
 So let me, so okay, so there is a particular

1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:53.680
 set of elements on Earth in a particular ratio,

1:30:54.920 --> 1:30:57.360
 and the right gravitational constant,

1:30:57.360 --> 1:30:59.720
 and the right viscosity, you know,

1:30:59.720 --> 1:31:01.800
 of stuff being able to move around,

1:31:01.800 --> 1:31:04.280
 the right distance from our sun,

1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:06.720
 right number of events where we have a moon,

1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:09.120
 the Earth is rotating.

1:31:10.720 --> 1:31:14.080
 The late heavy bombardment produced a lot of,

1:31:14.080 --> 1:31:16.040
 brought in the right stuff.

1:31:16.040 --> 1:31:19.920
 And Mars was cooking up, you know,

1:31:19.920 --> 1:31:21.360
 the right molecules first.

1:31:21.360 --> 1:31:23.280
 So it was habitable before Earth.

1:31:23.280 --> 1:31:25.920
 It was actually doing the combinatorial search.

1:31:25.920 --> 1:31:29.600
 And before Mars kind of became uninhabitable,

1:31:29.600 --> 1:31:34.600
 it seeded Earth with the right molecular replicators.

1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:36.360
 And there was just the right stuff on Earth,

1:31:36.360 --> 1:31:39.240
 and that's how the miracle of life occurred.

1:31:40.680 --> 1:31:43.440
 Although I find I'm very uncomfortable with that

1:31:43.440 --> 1:31:48.240
 because actually, because life came so quickly

1:31:48.240 --> 1:31:49.600
 in the Earth's past.

1:31:50.680 --> 1:31:55.560
 But that doesn't mean that life is easy elsewhere.

1:31:55.560 --> 1:31:57.880
 It just might mean that,

1:31:57.880 --> 1:32:00.160
 because chemistry is actually not a long term thing.

1:32:00.160 --> 1:32:01.280
 Chemistry can happen quickly.

1:32:01.280 --> 1:32:04.200
 So maybe going on with the steel manning of the argument

1:32:04.200 --> 1:32:06.960
 to say actually, the fact that life emerged quickly

1:32:06.960 --> 1:32:08.360
 doesn't mean that life is easy.

1:32:08.360 --> 1:32:11.720
 It just means that the chemistry was right on Earth,

1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:13.760
 and Earth is very special.

1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:15.160
 And that's why there's no life

1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:17.000
 anywhere else in the universe.

1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:21.640
 Yeah, so Sarah mentioned this kind of cascading thing.

1:32:21.640 --> 1:32:24.920
 So what if that's the reason we're lucky,

1:32:24.920 --> 1:32:29.600
 is that we got to have a rare cascading of,

1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:31.920
 like an accelerating cascading effect

1:32:31.920 --> 1:32:34.480
 in terms of the complexity of things.

1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:36.600
 So like, maybe most of the universe

1:32:36.600 --> 1:32:39.720
 is trying to get sticky with the memory,

1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:41.360
 and it's not able to really form it.

1:32:41.360 --> 1:32:43.040
 And then we got really lucky in that.

1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:44.560
 And it has nothing,

1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:47.400
 like there's a lot of Earth like conditions, let's say,

1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:51.640
 but it's just you really, really have to get lucky on this.

1:32:51.640 --> 1:32:54.160
 But I'm doing experiments right now.

1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:56.560
 In fact, experiments that Sarah and I are working on,

1:32:56.560 --> 1:32:58.360
 because we have some joint funding for this,

1:32:58.360 --> 1:33:00.040
 where we're seeing that the universe

1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:01.440
 can get sticky really quickly.

1:33:01.440 --> 1:33:04.440
 Now, of course, we're being very anthropocentric,

1:33:04.440 --> 1:33:06.480
 we're using laboratory tools, we're using theory,

1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:10.400
 but actually, the phenomena of selection,

1:33:10.400 --> 1:33:14.120
 the process of developing heterogeneity,

1:33:14.120 --> 1:33:15.080
 we can do in the lab.

1:33:15.080 --> 1:33:17.640
 We're just seeing the very first hints of it.

1:33:17.640 --> 1:33:22.520
 And wouldn't it be great if we can start to pin down

1:33:22.520 --> 1:33:27.520
 a bit more precisely becoming good Bayesianists for this,

1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:30.200
 for the origin of life and the emergence of life,

1:33:30.200 --> 1:33:31.960
 to finding out what kind of chemistries

1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:33.440
 we really need to look for.

1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:36.080
 And I'm becoming increasingly confident

1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:37.840
 we'll be able to do that in the next few years.

1:33:37.840 --> 1:33:41.400
 Make life in the lab or make some selection in the lab

1:33:41.400 --> 1:33:44.160
 from inorganic stuff, from sand, from rocks,

1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:45.760
 from dead stuff, from moon.

1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:48.040
 Wouldn't it be great to get stuff from the moon,

1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:51.160
 put it in our origin of life experiment,

1:33:51.160 --> 1:33:53.080
 and make moon life?

1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:56.000
 And restrict ourselves to interesting self replicating

1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:57.600
 stuff that we find on the moon.

1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:00.680
 Sarah, what do you think about this approach

1:34:00.680 --> 1:34:03.680
 of engineering life in order to understand life?

1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:05.800
 So building life in the machine.

1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:09.160
 Yeah, so, I mean, Lee and I are trying right now

1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:14.160
 to build a vision for a large institute

1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:17.640
 or experimental program, basically, to do this problem.

1:34:17.640 --> 1:34:21.000
 But I think of it as like, we need to simulate a planet.

1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:23.400
 So like the Large Hadron Collider was supposed

1:34:23.400 --> 1:34:26.280
 to be simulating conditions just after the Big Bang.

1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:27.960
 Lee's built a lot of technology in his lab

1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:30.000
 to do these kind of selection engines.

1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:33.000
 But the question you're asking is,

1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:34.920
 how many experiments do you need to run?

1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:37.640
 What volume of chemical space do you need to explore

1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:40.640
 before you actually see an event?

1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:41.880
 And I like to make an analogy

1:34:41.880 --> 1:34:43.680
 to one of my favorite particle physics experiments,

1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:45.280
 which is Super Kamiakande that's looking

1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:46.640
 for the decay of the proton.

1:34:46.640 --> 1:34:49.080
 So this is something that we predicted theoretically,

1:34:49.080 --> 1:34:51.200
 but we've never observed in our universe.

1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:53.320
 And basically what they're doing is every time

1:34:53.320 --> 1:34:55.360
 they don't see a proton decay event,

1:34:55.360 --> 1:34:57.760
 they have a longer bound on the lifetime of a proton.

1:34:57.760 --> 1:35:00.720
 So imagine we built an experiment with the idea in mind

1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:03.600
 of trying to simulate planetary conditions,

1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:04.480
 physically simulate.

1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:06.320
 You can't simulate origin life in a computer.

1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:08.400
 You have to do it in an experiment.

1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:10.880
 Simulate enough planetary conditions

1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:12.800
 to explore the space of what's possible

1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:15.040
 and bound the probability for an origin life event.

1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:16.200
 Even if you're not observing it,

1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:17.520
 you can talk about the probability.

1:35:17.520 --> 1:35:22.520
 But we, hopefully, life is not exponentially rare

1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:26.160
 and we would then be able to evolve

1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:31.760
 in an automated system alien life in the lab.

1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:34.240
 And if we can do that, then we understand the physics

1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:35.880
 as well as we understand what we can do

1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:37.480
 in particle accelerators.

1:35:37.480 --> 1:35:40.640
 So keep expanding physically the simulation,

1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:44.560
 the physical simulation, until something happens.

1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:46.540
 Yeah, or just build a big enough volume

1:35:46.540 --> 1:35:48.600
 of chemical experiments and evolve them.

1:35:48.600 --> 1:35:50.840
 So if you say volume, you mean like literally volume?

1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:53.280
 I mean physical volume in terms of space,

1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:54.720
 but I actually mean volume in terms

1:35:54.720 --> 1:35:57.480
 of the combinatorial space of chemistry.

1:35:57.480 --> 1:35:58.300
 So like.

1:35:58.300 --> 1:36:01.640
 How do you nicely control the combinatorial exploration,

1:36:01.640 --> 1:36:05.520
 the search space, such that it's always like

1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:08.040
 you keep grabbing the low hanging fruit?

1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:10.520
 Yeah, how do you build a search engine for chemistry?

1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:11.620
 It's like for aliens. I think you explained it really well.

1:36:11.620 --> 1:36:12.460
 We should carry on doing this.

1:36:12.460 --> 1:36:14.400
 I should pretend the physics, be the physicist,

1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:15.240
 you be the chemist.

1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:18.800
 So the way to do it is I will always play a joke.

1:36:18.800 --> 1:36:23.800
 Cause I like writing grants to ask for money

1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:24.760
 to do cool stuff.

1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:29.080
 But years ago I started wanting to build.

1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:30.740
 So I actually wanted the weather.

1:36:30.740 --> 1:36:32.880
 So I built this robot in my lab called the computer,

1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:35.480
 which is this robot you can program to do chemistry.

1:36:36.660 --> 1:36:37.520
 Now it's a pro.

1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:39.640
 I made a programming language for the computer

1:36:39.640 --> 1:36:43.620
 and made it operate chemical equipment.

1:36:43.620 --> 1:36:46.060
 Originally I wrote grants to say,

1:36:46.060 --> 1:36:48.980
 Hey, I want to make an origin of life system.

1:36:48.980 --> 1:36:51.740
 And no one would give me any money for this.

1:36:51.740 --> 1:36:53.540
 They said, what this is ridiculous.

1:36:53.540 --> 1:36:55.220
 Why are you wanting to make, oh, it's really hard.

1:36:55.220 --> 1:36:56.140
 It takes forever.

1:36:56.140 --> 1:36:58.380
 You're not a very good origin of life chemist anyway.

1:36:58.380 --> 1:37:00.140
 Why would we give you any money?

1:37:00.140 --> 1:37:02.340
 And so I turned it around and said, can you,

1:37:02.340 --> 1:37:05.580
 can instead, can you give me money to make robots,

1:37:05.580 --> 1:37:07.400
 to make molecules are interesting.

1:37:07.400 --> 1:37:09.540
 And everyone went, yeah, okay, you can do that.

1:37:09.540 --> 1:37:13.540
 And that's, so actually the funny thing is the computer

1:37:13.540 --> 1:37:18.260
 project, which I have in my lab, which is very briefly,

1:37:18.260 --> 1:37:20.300
 it's just basically, it's like literally an automated

1:37:20.300 --> 1:37:21.140
 test tube.

1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:22.960
 And we've made a programming language for the test tube,

1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:27.960
 which is cool, has come as literally came from this.

1:37:28.700 --> 1:37:29.720
 I went to my lab one day.

1:37:29.720 --> 1:37:32.140
 So I want to make a search engine to get origin of life

1:37:32.140 --> 1:37:33.580
 because they don't have a planet.

1:37:33.580 --> 1:37:36.220
 And I thought about doing in a microfluidic format.

1:37:36.220 --> 1:37:39.580
 So microfluidic is very nano, very small channels

1:37:39.580 --> 1:37:41.660
 in device where you can basically have all the pipes

1:37:41.660 --> 1:37:43.940
 lit dump produced by lithography.

1:37:43.940 --> 1:37:46.700
 And you can have a chamber, maybe say between say 10

1:37:46.700 --> 1:37:48.420
 and a hundred microns in volume.

1:37:48.420 --> 1:37:50.580
 And we slot them all together like Lego,

1:37:50.580 --> 1:37:52.860
 and we can make an origin of life system.

1:37:52.860 --> 1:37:55.380
 And I could never get it to work.

1:37:55.380 --> 1:37:59.340
 And I realized I had to make, do chemistry at the kind of

1:37:59.340 --> 1:38:03.140
 test tube level and what you want to be able to do.

1:38:03.140 --> 1:38:06.420
 Yeah, it goes back to that tweet in 1981.

1:38:06.420 --> 1:38:10.220
 1981, the computer, we're looking at a tweet from Lee.

1:38:10.220 --> 1:38:13.700
 In 1981, the computer was a distant dream in,

1:38:13.700 --> 1:38:15.980
 oh wow, this is the scientist looking back.

1:38:15.980 --> 1:38:19.260
 It is the young boy who dreamed.

1:38:19.260 --> 1:38:23.500
 In 2018, it was realized, spelled in a British way,

1:38:23.500 --> 1:38:25.660
 realized, which is the wrong way.

1:38:25.660 --> 1:38:27.900
 Yeah, I'm starting with Z, but not.

1:38:27.900 --> 1:38:30.480
 So now there's a system that does the physical

1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:33.100
 manifestation or whatever the programming language,

1:38:34.460 --> 1:38:37.140
 the spec tells you to do.

1:38:37.140 --> 1:38:40.580
 Yeah, well in 1981, I got my first computer, ZX81.

1:38:40.580 --> 1:38:41.700
 What was the computer?

1:38:41.700 --> 1:38:42.540
 ZX81.

1:38:42.540 --> 1:38:44.180
 ZX81.

1:38:44.180 --> 1:38:46.060
 Sinclair ZX81.

1:38:46.060 --> 1:38:48.120
 It was, and I got a chemistry set.

1:38:49.220 --> 1:38:53.420
 And I liked the chemistry set and I liked the computer

1:38:53.420 --> 1:38:54.980
 and I just wanted to put them together.

1:38:54.980 --> 1:38:56.580
 I thought, wouldn't it be cool if I could just use

1:38:56.580 --> 1:38:58.860
 the computer to control the chemistry set.

1:38:58.860 --> 1:39:00.780
 And obviously that was insane.

1:39:00.780 --> 1:39:04.340
 And I was like, you know, eight years old, right?

1:39:04.340 --> 1:39:06.100
 Nine years old, going on nine years old.

1:39:06.100 --> 1:39:11.100
 And then I invented the computer

1:39:12.500 --> 1:39:15.780
 just because I wanted to build this origin of life grid.

1:39:15.780 --> 1:39:17.940
 Which is like literally a billion test tubes

1:39:17.940 --> 1:39:20.880
 connected together in real time and real space,

1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:23.380
 basically throwing a chemical dice.

1:39:23.380 --> 1:39:24.860
 Throw dice, throw dice, throw dice.

1:39:24.860 --> 1:39:26.120
 You're gonna get lucky.

1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:28.300
 And that's what we, I think Sarah and I

1:39:28.300 --> 1:39:30.580
 have been thinking very deeply about.

1:39:30.580 --> 1:39:32.940
 Because, you know, there's more money being spent

1:39:32.940 --> 1:39:37.060
 on the origin of the gravity

1:39:37.060 --> 1:39:39.580
 or looking at the Higgs boson than the origin of life, right?

1:39:39.580 --> 1:39:43.740
 And the origin of life is the, I think the biggest question

1:39:43.740 --> 1:39:46.260
 or not the biggest question, it is a big question.

1:39:46.260 --> 1:39:47.100
 Let's put it that way.

1:39:47.100 --> 1:39:48.100
 It is the biggest question.

1:39:48.100 --> 1:39:49.100
 You're okay saying that.

1:39:49.100 --> 1:39:50.740
 Okay, all right.

1:39:50.740 --> 1:39:52.940
 Isn't it possible once you figure out the origin of life

1:39:52.940 --> 1:39:54.540
 that that's not going to solve,

1:39:55.940 --> 1:39:58.020
 that's not actually gonna solve

1:39:58.020 --> 1:39:59.700
 the question of what is life?

1:39:59.700 --> 1:40:02.780
 Because you're kind of putting a lot of.

1:40:02.780 --> 1:40:04.600
 Yeah, I think they're the same problem.

1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:06.660
 But you're putting, is it possible

1:40:06.660 --> 1:40:08.800
 that you're putting too many,

1:40:09.940 --> 1:40:12.020
 too much bets into this origin part?

1:40:12.020 --> 1:40:14.060
 Maybe the origin thing isn't,

1:40:14.060 --> 1:40:16.460
 isn't there always a turtle underneath the turtle?

1:40:16.460 --> 1:40:17.740
 Isn't there a stack of turtles?

1:40:17.740 --> 1:40:19.600
 Because then if you create it in the lab,

1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:21.740
 maybe you need some other stuff.

1:40:21.740 --> 1:40:23.180
 Well, let's not think about the origin.

1:40:23.180 --> 1:40:27.100
 Like in the lab, there's still memory.

1:40:27.100 --> 1:40:28.180
 Yeah, yes.

1:40:28.180 --> 1:40:29.020
 Right?

1:40:29.020 --> 1:40:31.660
 So the experiment is already the product of evolution.

1:40:31.660 --> 1:40:33.900
 Right, in some maybe really deep way,

1:40:33.900 --> 1:40:36.060
 not an obvious way, in some very deep way.

1:40:36.060 --> 1:40:39.560
 So maybe the haters are always going to be like,

1:40:39.560 --> 1:40:42.140
 well, you have to reconstruct the fold.

1:40:42.140 --> 1:40:42.980
 You have to build a new script.

1:40:42.980 --> 1:40:44.620
 Fortunately for us, the haters are not aware

1:40:44.620 --> 1:40:45.520
 of that argument.

1:40:46.860 --> 1:40:48.260
 Well, no, I know, I just.

1:40:48.260 --> 1:40:51.100
 We're the one making that argument usually, but yeah.

1:40:51.100 --> 1:40:54.420
 I just think that if we create life in the lab,

1:40:54.420 --> 1:40:56.540
 it's not obvious that you'll get

1:40:56.540 --> 1:40:59.660
 to the deep, deep understanding of necessarily,

1:41:00.700 --> 1:41:03.100
 what is the line between life and non life?

1:41:03.100 --> 1:41:05.020
 No, I think, so there's so much here.

1:41:05.020 --> 1:41:06.340
 I'm just like playing devil.

1:41:06.340 --> 1:41:08.580
 So much here, but let me play devil's advocate

1:41:08.580 --> 1:41:10.460
 back in a previous conversation, right?

1:41:10.460 --> 1:41:14.400
 And say, yeah, I will.

1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:15.240
 Why not?

1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:16.060
 Why not?

1:41:16.060 --> 1:41:16.900
 We've got time.

1:41:16.900 --> 1:41:17.740
 Yeah, let's go.

1:41:17.740 --> 1:41:18.560
 Cellular automata.

1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:21.980
 Cellular automata, these very, very simple things

1:41:21.980 --> 1:41:24.740
 where you color squares black or white

1:41:24.740 --> 1:41:26.620
 and implement rules and play them in time.

1:41:26.620 --> 1:41:30.580
 And you can get these very, very complex patterns coming out.

1:41:30.580 --> 1:41:31.780
 You know, there's nice rules.

1:41:31.780 --> 1:41:36.780
 There are Turing complete rules and I would argue

1:41:36.860 --> 1:41:41.580
 that cellular automata don't really exist on their own.

1:41:41.580 --> 1:41:45.040
 They have to exist in a computing device.

1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:46.380
 If that, well, that's computing devices,

1:41:46.380 --> 1:41:47.540
 a piece of paper and abstraction,

1:41:47.540 --> 1:41:52.540
 a mathematician drawing a grid or a framework.

1:41:52.540 --> 1:41:56.960
 Now, so I would argue CAs are beautiful things,

1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:59.960
 simple, going complex, but the complexity is all borrowed

1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:02.340
 from the lithography, the numbers.

1:42:03.480 --> 1:42:05.160
 Right, now let's take that same argument

1:42:05.160 --> 1:42:09.240
 with the chemistry experiment origin of life.

1:42:11.040 --> 1:42:12.480
 What you need to be able to do is go,

1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:13.720
 and I'm inspired to do this,

1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:17.700
 to go out and look for CAs occur in nature.

1:42:17.700 --> 1:42:21.840
 You know, let's kind of, let's find some CAs

1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:24.800
 that just emerge in our universe and.

1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:26.080
 For people just, sorry to interrupt,

1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:29.280
 for people just listening and in general,

1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:33.480
 I think what we're looking at is a cellular automata

1:42:33.480 --> 1:42:35.080
 where again, as Lee described,

1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:38.360
 there is just binary black or white squares

1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:40.200
 and they only have local information

1:42:40.200 --> 1:42:42.640
 and they're born and they die.

1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:45.340
 And you would think nothing interesting would emerge,

1:42:45.340 --> 1:42:47.360
 but actually what we're looking at is something

1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:49.360
 that I believe is called glider guns

1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:54.360
 or a glider gun, which is moving objects

1:42:54.580 --> 1:42:58.660
 in this multi cell space that look like they're organisms

1:42:58.660 --> 1:43:01.200
 that have much more information,

1:43:01.200 --> 1:43:03.780
 that have much more complexity

1:43:03.780 --> 1:43:05.940
 than the individual building components.

1:43:05.940 --> 1:43:08.460
 In fact, look like they have a long term memory

1:43:09.860 --> 1:43:12.300
 while the individual components don't seem like

1:43:12.300 --> 1:43:15.100
 they have any memory at all, which is fascinating.

1:43:15.100 --> 1:43:17.940
 The argument here is that has to exist

1:43:17.940 --> 1:43:20.140
 on all this layer of infrastructure, right?

1:43:20.140 --> 1:43:21.620
 And though it looks simple.

1:43:21.620 --> 1:43:23.260
 And then what I would make, the argument I would make

1:43:23.260 --> 1:43:26.220
 if I were you, say, well, I think CAs are really simple

1:43:26.220 --> 1:43:28.700
 and everywhere, is say, show me how they emerge

1:43:28.700 --> 1:43:29.580
 in a substrate.

1:43:29.580 --> 1:43:32.620
 Now this goes to the origin of life, machine.

1:43:32.620 --> 1:43:34.980
 I don't think we want to do the origin of life,

1:43:34.980 --> 1:43:36.540
 just any origin is good.

1:43:36.540 --> 1:43:39.260
 So we do, so we literally have our sand shaker,

1:43:39.260 --> 1:43:42.220
 shake the sand like massive grid of chemistry experiments,

1:43:42.220 --> 1:43:43.880
 shaking sand, shaking whatever.

1:43:45.260 --> 1:43:47.360
 And then because we know what we've put in,

1:43:47.360 --> 1:43:49.380
 so we know how we've cheated and the same way with CA,

1:43:49.380 --> 1:43:50.220
 we know how we've cheated,

1:43:50.220 --> 1:43:52.300
 we know the number of operations needed,

1:43:52.300 --> 1:43:54.580
 we know how big a grid we want to get this.

1:43:54.580 --> 1:43:56.900
 If we could then say, okay,

1:43:56.900 --> 1:44:01.460
 how can we generate this recipe in the lab

1:44:01.460 --> 1:44:03.240
 and make a life form?

1:44:03.240 --> 1:44:06.180
 What contingency did we need to put in?

1:44:06.180 --> 1:44:09.380
 And we're upfront about how we cheated, okay?

1:44:09.380 --> 1:44:12.180
 Say, oh, you had to shake it, it was a periodic,

1:44:12.180 --> 1:44:15.780
 planet rotates, it's tried, comes in and out.

1:44:15.780 --> 1:44:17.700
 So, and then we can start to basically say,

1:44:17.700 --> 1:44:22.700
 okay, how difficult is it for these features to be found?

1:44:23.180 --> 1:44:25.300
 And then we can look for extra planets and other features.

1:44:25.300 --> 1:44:27.460
 So I think Sarah is absolutely right.

1:44:27.460 --> 1:44:29.340
 We want to explain to people we're cheating.

1:44:29.340 --> 1:44:30.660
 In fact, we have to cheat.

1:44:30.660 --> 1:44:32.660
 No one has given, I'm good at writing grants,

1:44:32.660 --> 1:44:34.060
 well, I used to be, I'm not very good right now,

1:44:34.060 --> 1:44:35.260
 I keep getting rejected,

1:44:35.260 --> 1:44:38.020
 but writing a grant for a planet in 100 million years,

1:44:38.020 --> 1:44:39.860
 no grant fund there is going to give me that,

1:44:39.860 --> 1:44:42.740
 but maybe money to make a kind of a grid,

1:44:42.740 --> 1:44:45.940
 a computer grid, origin of life computer grid.

1:44:45.940 --> 1:44:46.860
 In physical space.

1:44:46.860 --> 1:44:49.180
 In physical space, and just do it.

1:44:49.180 --> 1:44:51.180
 So Sarah said something which is,

1:44:51.180 --> 1:44:56.180
 you can't simulate the origin of life in a computer,

1:44:56.320 --> 1:44:59.580
 so like in simulation, why not?

1:44:59.580 --> 1:45:02.380
 What are your, you said it very confidently,

1:45:02.380 --> 1:45:07.060
 so is it possible and why would it be very difficult?

1:45:07.060 --> 1:45:08.880
 Like what's your intuition there?

1:45:08.880 --> 1:45:12.120
 I think it's very difficult right now

1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:13.140
 because we don't know the physics,

1:45:13.140 --> 1:45:15.220
 but if you go based on principles of assembly theory

1:45:15.220 --> 1:45:17.340
 and you think every molecule is actually

1:45:17.340 --> 1:45:20.100
 a very large causal graph, not just the molecule,

1:45:20.100 --> 1:45:21.560
 then you have to simulate all the features

1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:22.580
 of those causal graphs,

1:45:22.580 --> 1:45:24.820
 and I think it becomes computationally intractable.

1:45:24.820 --> 1:45:26.900
 You might as well just build the experiment.

1:45:26.900 --> 1:45:28.660
 Because you have, in the physical space,

1:45:28.660 --> 1:45:31.660
 you have all the objects with all the memories.

1:45:31.660 --> 1:45:32.500
 Yes.

1:45:32.500 --> 1:45:35.400
 In the computer, you would have to copy them

1:45:35.400 --> 1:45:36.240
 or reconstruct them.

1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:37.060
 Yes.

1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:38.620
 Yeah, that's a beautifully put,

1:45:38.620 --> 1:45:41.700
 and I would say that lots of people,

1:45:41.700 --> 1:45:44.980
 you just don't have enough resources.

1:45:44.980 --> 1:45:47.940
 It's easier to actually do the physical experiment

1:45:47.940 --> 1:45:49.820
 because we are literally,

1:45:49.820 --> 1:45:51.380
 I would view the physical experiment

1:45:51.380 --> 1:45:53.540
 almost like a computational experiment.

1:45:53.540 --> 1:45:55.060
 We're just outsourcing, it's just basically,

1:45:55.060 --> 1:45:57.700
 we're just outsourcing all the matrix algebra.

1:45:57.700 --> 1:46:00.180
 And on your point about the experiment

1:46:00.180 --> 1:46:03.940
 being also an example of life,

1:46:03.940 --> 1:46:05.340
 it's almost like you want to design,

1:46:05.340 --> 1:46:08.420
 it's like all of us are lineages

1:46:08.420 --> 1:46:10.300
 of propagating information across time,

1:46:10.300 --> 1:46:12.300
 and so everything we do becomes part of life

1:46:12.300 --> 1:46:14.180
 because it's part of that causal chain.

1:46:14.180 --> 1:46:15.900
 So it's like you want to try to pinch off

1:46:15.900 --> 1:46:17.740
 as much as you can of the information

1:46:17.740 --> 1:46:20.220
 from your causal chain that goes into the experiment,

1:46:20.220 --> 1:46:21.980
 but you can't pinch off all of it

1:46:21.980 --> 1:46:23.700
 to move it to a different timeline.

1:46:23.700 --> 1:46:25.300
 It's always going to be part of your timeline.

1:46:25.300 --> 1:46:26.360
 But at least if you can control

1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:27.460
 how much information you put in,

1:46:27.460 --> 1:46:30.540
 you can try to see how much does that particular trajectory

1:46:30.540 --> 1:46:33.940
 you've set up start generating its own assembly.

1:46:33.940 --> 1:46:36.100
 So you know where it starts,

1:46:36.100 --> 1:46:38.700
 and then you want to try to see it take off on its own

1:46:38.700 --> 1:46:41.140
 when you try to pinch it off as much as possible.

1:46:42.140 --> 1:46:43.700
 Got it.

1:46:43.700 --> 1:46:45.260
 Quick pause, bathroom break.

1:46:45.260 --> 1:46:46.100
 Yes.

1:46:46.100 --> 1:46:47.580
 All right, cool.

1:46:47.580 --> 1:46:49.540
 And now we're back.

1:46:49.540 --> 1:46:50.940
 All right.

1:46:50.940 --> 1:46:53.580
 We talked about the early days of the universe

1:46:53.580 --> 1:46:55.940
 when there was just stuff and no memory,

1:46:55.940 --> 1:46:57.260
 not even causality.

1:46:57.260 --> 1:46:58.580
 I think Lee at least implied

1:46:58.580 --> 1:47:00.580
 that causality is immersion somehow.

1:47:00.580 --> 1:47:01.940
 We could discuss this.

1:47:01.940 --> 1:47:06.940
 What happened before this all originated?

1:47:06.940 --> 1:47:09.080
 What's outside the universe?

1:47:10.660 --> 1:47:12.140
 Divided by zero.

1:47:12.140 --> 1:47:16.380
 Okay, so it's not relevant, not understandable.

1:47:16.380 --> 1:47:18.580
 Is it useful to even ask the question?

1:47:18.580 --> 1:47:19.420
 No.

1:47:19.420 --> 1:47:22.220
 Just because it's so hard?

1:47:22.220 --> 1:47:23.380
 No, it's not hard.

1:47:23.380 --> 1:47:24.860
 It's just not a question.

1:47:24.860 --> 1:47:27.300
 If I can't do an experiment or even think of an experiment,

1:47:27.300 --> 1:47:28.620
 the question doesn't exist.

1:47:29.620 --> 1:47:32.360
 Well, no, you can't think of a lot of experiments,

1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:33.200
 no offense.

1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:35.060
 What I mean is I can't.

1:47:35.060 --> 1:47:36.860
 Your causality graph is like,

1:47:36.860 --> 1:47:38.980
 this is what we're talking about.

1:47:38.980 --> 1:47:43.980
 It's like there is limits to your ability

1:47:43.980 --> 1:47:45.700
 to construct experiments.

1:47:45.700 --> 1:47:48.300
 I agree, but I was trying to be facetious

1:47:48.300 --> 1:47:49.300
 and I'm trying to make a point

1:47:49.300 --> 1:47:54.300
 because I think that if there is a causal bottleneck

1:47:56.660 --> 1:48:00.140
 through which information can't propagate in principle,

1:48:00.140 --> 1:48:03.940
 then it's very hard to think of an experiment,

1:48:03.940 --> 1:48:05.460
 even in principle, even one that's beyond

1:48:05.460 --> 1:48:08.620
 my mediocre intellect, right?

1:48:08.620 --> 1:48:09.460
 Which is fine.

1:48:09.460 --> 1:48:10.900
 I'm happy to accept that.

1:48:10.900 --> 1:48:12.860
 But this is one of the things I actually do think

1:48:12.860 --> 1:48:14.860
 there was something before the Big Bang

1:48:14.860 --> 1:48:17.580
 because I would say that I think the Big Bang

1:48:17.580 --> 1:48:19.540
 just couldn't occur and create time.

1:48:19.540 --> 1:48:21.240
 Time created the Big Bang.

1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:23.420
 So there was time before the Big Bang.

1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:24.260
 Yeah.

1:48:24.260 --> 1:48:25.420
 There was no space, but there was time.

1:48:25.420 --> 1:48:26.740
 Yeah.

1:48:26.740 --> 1:48:27.700
 Yeah.

1:48:27.700 --> 1:48:29.620
 But I mean, I'm just making that stuff up

1:48:29.620 --> 1:48:31.020
 just to make all the physicists happy,

1:48:31.020 --> 1:48:32.580
 but I think it's...

1:48:32.580 --> 1:48:33.860
 Do you think that would make them happy

1:48:33.860 --> 1:48:35.780
 because they would be quite upset, actually.

1:48:35.780 --> 1:48:37.100
 And why would they be upset?

1:48:37.100 --> 1:48:40.780
 Because they would say that time can't exist

1:48:40.780 --> 1:48:41.620
 before the Big Bang.

1:48:41.620 --> 1:48:43.540
 Yeah, I mean, this goes back to an argument

1:48:43.540 --> 1:48:46.220
 that you might not want to have the argument here.

1:48:46.220 --> 1:48:48.500
 I was talking to Sarah earlier today

1:48:48.500 --> 1:48:51.380
 about an argument we had about time a long time ago.

1:48:51.380 --> 1:48:52.220
 Yeah.

1:48:52.220 --> 1:48:53.040
 A long time in time.

1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:55.680
 And what I would, it's like, I think there is this thing

1:48:55.680 --> 1:48:57.260
 called time or state creation.

1:48:57.260 --> 1:49:00.980
 The universe is creating states and it's outside of space,

1:49:00.980 --> 1:49:02.180
 but they create space.

1:49:02.180 --> 1:49:04.180
 So what I mean is you can imagine there are states

1:49:04.180 --> 1:49:05.860
 being created all the time.

1:49:05.860 --> 1:49:08.380
 And there is this thing called time.

1:49:08.380 --> 1:49:11.100
 Time is a clock, which you can use to measure

1:49:11.100 --> 1:49:13.980
 when things happen, but that doesn't mean,

1:49:13.980 --> 1:49:15.200
 because you can't measure something,

1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:17.220
 that states aren't being created.

1:49:17.220 --> 1:49:22.220
 And so you might locally refer to the Big Bang

1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:25.780
 and the Big Bang occurred at some point

1:49:25.780 --> 1:49:27.480
 when those states were there.

1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:28.880
 Probably there had to be enough states

1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:30.740
 for the Big Bang to occur.

1:49:30.740 --> 1:49:34.580
 And then, but I think that there is something wrong

1:49:34.580 --> 1:49:37.020
 with our conception of how the universe was created

1:49:37.020 --> 1:49:40.820
 and the Big Bang because we don't really get time.

1:49:40.820 --> 1:49:44.140
 Because again, I don't want to become boring

1:49:44.140 --> 1:49:48.980
 and sound like a broken record, but time is a real thing.

1:49:48.980 --> 1:49:52.740
 And until I can really explain that more elegantly,

1:49:52.740 --> 1:49:54.260
 I'm just gonna get into more trouble.

1:49:54.260 --> 1:49:55.860
 Well, we're gonna talk about time

1:49:55.860 --> 1:49:59.420
 because time is a useful measuring device for experiments,

1:49:59.420 --> 1:50:02.180
 but also time is an ideal, okay.

1:50:02.180 --> 1:50:05.460
 But let me first ask Sarah, what do you think?

1:50:05.460 --> 1:50:07.860
 Is it a useful question to ask what happened

1:50:07.860 --> 1:50:08.860
 before the Big Bang?

1:50:08.860 --> 1:50:13.200
 Is it a useful question to ask what's outside the universe?

1:50:14.940 --> 1:50:17.660
 So I would think about it as the Big Bang

1:50:17.660 --> 1:50:19.620
 is an event that we reconstructed

1:50:19.620 --> 1:50:21.900
 as probably happening in the past of our universe

1:50:21.900 --> 1:50:24.220
 based on current observational data.

1:50:24.220 --> 1:50:25.940
 And so the way I like to think about it

1:50:25.940 --> 1:50:30.940
 is we exist locally in something called the universe.

1:50:33.020 --> 1:50:35.880
 So, and going back to like the physics of existence,

1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:39.140
 we exist locally in the space of all things that could exist

1:50:39.140 --> 1:50:42.300
 and we can infer certain properties of the structure

1:50:42.300 --> 1:50:43.560
 of where we exist locally.

1:50:43.560 --> 1:50:46.020
 And one of the properties that we've inferred in the past

1:50:46.020 --> 1:50:50.820
 is that there is a thing we call the Big Bang.

1:50:50.820 --> 1:50:52.940
 There's some signatures of our local environment

1:50:52.940 --> 1:50:57.380
 that indicate that there was a very low information event

1:50:58.740 --> 1:50:59.920
 that started our universe.

1:50:59.920 --> 1:51:02.040
 I think that's actually just an artifact

1:51:02.040 --> 1:51:05.120
 of the structure of the assembly space

1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:10.120
 that when you start losing all the memory in the objects,

1:51:10.220 --> 1:51:12.380
 it looks like what we call a Big Bang.

1:51:13.320 --> 1:51:14.880
 So I think it makes sense to talk about

1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:16.300
 where you are locally.

1:51:16.300 --> 1:51:18.220
 I think it makes sense to talk about

1:51:18.220 --> 1:51:20.260
 counterfactual possibilities,

1:51:20.260 --> 1:51:22.100
 what could exist outside the universe

1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:24.780
 in the sense that they become part of our reasoning

1:51:24.780 --> 1:51:26.380
 and therefore part of our causal chain

1:51:26.380 --> 1:51:27.660
 of things that we can do.

1:51:28.500 --> 1:51:31.700
 So like the multiverse in my mind exists,

1:51:31.700 --> 1:51:33.360
 but it doesn't exist as a multiverse

1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:34.540
 of possible universes.

1:51:34.540 --> 1:51:36.260
 It exists as an idea in our minds

1:51:36.260 --> 1:51:38.380
 that allows us to reason about how physics works

1:51:38.380 --> 1:51:39.560
 and then to do physics differently

1:51:39.560 --> 1:51:42.100
 because we reason about it that way.

1:51:42.100 --> 1:51:47.100
 So I always like to recenter it on things exist,

1:51:47.220 --> 1:51:50.460
 but they don't always exist like we think they exist.

1:51:50.460 --> 1:51:53.100
 So when we're thinking about things outside the universe,

1:51:53.100 --> 1:51:55.380
 they absolutely exist because we're thinking about them,

1:51:55.380 --> 1:51:59.780
 but they don't look like the projections in our minds.

1:51:59.780 --> 1:52:00.620
 They're something else.

1:52:00.620 --> 1:52:02.100
 And something you said just gave an idea

1:52:02.100 --> 1:52:04.620
 to go back to your question.

1:52:04.620 --> 1:52:09.620
 If there was, I mean, if something caused the Big Bang,

1:52:09.740 --> 1:52:12.180
 if there was some memory or some artifact of that,

1:52:12.180 --> 1:52:13.780
 then of course, to answer your question,

1:52:13.780 --> 1:52:15.260
 it's worth going back to that

1:52:15.260 --> 1:52:17.460
 because that would imply there is something

1:52:17.460 --> 1:52:19.660
 beyond that barrier, that filter.

1:52:19.660 --> 1:52:21.780
 And that's what you were saying, I guess, right?

1:52:21.780 --> 1:52:23.820
 I'm agnostic to what exists outside the universe.

1:52:23.820 --> 1:52:24.860
 I just don't think that.

1:52:24.860 --> 1:52:26.900
 I think the most interesting things for us to be doing

1:52:26.900 --> 1:52:31.020
 are finding explanations that allow us to do more,

1:52:31.020 --> 1:52:32.620
 like that optimism.

1:52:32.620 --> 1:52:35.540
 So I tend to draw the boundary on questions I ask

1:52:35.540 --> 1:52:38.100
 as being scientific ones because I find

1:52:38.100 --> 1:52:40.660
 that that's where the most creative potential is

1:52:40.660 --> 1:52:42.660
 to impact the future trajectory

1:52:42.660 --> 1:52:43.940
 of what we're doing on this planet.

1:52:43.940 --> 1:52:45.540
 It's an interesting thing about the Big Bang

1:52:45.540 --> 1:52:48.700
 is basically from our current perspective

1:52:48.700 --> 1:52:50.820
 of what we're able to detect,

1:52:50.820 --> 1:52:52.980
 it's the time when things were forgotten.

1:52:52.980 --> 1:52:54.220
 Yes.

1:52:54.220 --> 1:52:58.500
 It's the time to reset from our limited perspective.

1:52:58.500 --> 1:53:01.860
 And so the question is, is it useful to ever study

1:53:01.860 --> 1:53:03.460
 the thing that was forgotten?

1:53:05.100 --> 1:53:07.500
 Or should we focus just on the memories

1:53:07.500 --> 1:53:08.340
 that are still there?

1:53:08.340 --> 1:53:10.140
 Well, the point I was trying to make about the experiment

1:53:10.140 --> 1:53:11.780
 is I was trying to say both things.

1:53:11.780 --> 1:53:14.180
 And I think perhaps yes, from the portfolio point of view,

1:53:14.180 --> 1:53:17.580
 if you could then imagine what was forgotten

1:53:17.580 --> 1:53:19.180
 and then work forwards,

1:53:19.180 --> 1:53:20.900
 you will have different consequences.

1:53:20.900 --> 1:53:22.660
 So then it becomes testable.

1:53:22.660 --> 1:53:24.700
 So as long as we can find tests,

1:53:24.700 --> 1:53:26.420
 then it's definitely worth thinking about.

1:53:26.420 --> 1:53:28.380
 What I don't like is when physicists say

1:53:28.380 --> 1:53:29.740
 what happened before the Big Bang

1:53:29.740 --> 1:53:31.220
 and before, before, before,

1:53:31.220 --> 1:53:34.620
 without giving me any credible conjecture

1:53:34.620 --> 1:53:38.260
 about how would we know the difference?

1:53:38.260 --> 1:53:39.700
 But the way you framed it is quite nice.

1:53:39.700 --> 1:53:40.540
 I like that.

1:53:40.540 --> 1:53:43.540
 It's like, what have we forgotten?

1:53:43.540 --> 1:53:47.700
 Is there room for God in assembly theory?

1:53:47.700 --> 1:53:48.580
 Who's God?

1:53:49.620 --> 1:53:52.740
 I like arguments for a necessary being better than God.

1:53:52.740 --> 1:53:53.580
 Well, I think I said it earlier.

1:53:53.580 --> 1:53:54.420
 What's a necessary being?

1:53:54.420 --> 1:53:55.260
 What's a necessary?

1:53:55.260 --> 1:53:56.660
 Like something that has to exist.

1:53:58.340 --> 1:54:01.140
 Oh, so you like, I mean, you like the shortest path.

1:54:01.140 --> 1:54:02.220
 Like does God need?

1:54:02.220 --> 1:54:03.060
 No, no, no.

1:54:03.060 --> 1:54:05.540
 I mean, well, you can go back to like Thomas Aquinas

1:54:05.540 --> 1:54:08.740
 and arguments for the existence of God.

1:54:08.740 --> 1:54:11.860
 But I think most of the interesting theological arguments

1:54:11.860 --> 1:54:14.900
 are always about whether something has to exist

1:54:14.900 --> 1:54:17.140
 or there was a first thing that had to exist.

1:54:17.140 --> 1:54:19.020
 But I think there's a lot of logical loopholes

1:54:19.020 --> 1:54:19.940
 in those kind of arguments.

1:54:19.940 --> 1:54:23.100
 Well, so God here, meaning the machine

1:54:24.140 --> 1:54:29.140
 that creates, that generates the stuff.

1:54:29.340 --> 1:54:31.500
 But God, so what I was trying to say earlier is that.

1:54:31.500 --> 1:54:32.660
 Isn't that just the universe though?

1:54:32.660 --> 1:54:33.500
 Yeah, yeah.

1:54:33.500 --> 1:54:36.580
 Well, yeah, well, but there's a difference between,

1:54:36.580 --> 1:54:40.420
 I sort of imagine like a black box, like a machine.

1:54:40.420 --> 1:54:41.260
 Yeah.

1:54:41.260 --> 1:54:44.420
 I mean, I would be more comfortable calling that God

1:54:44.420 --> 1:54:45.260
 because it's a machine.

1:54:45.260 --> 1:54:47.660
 You go into a room and there's a thing with a button.

1:54:47.660 --> 1:54:50.460
 Yeah, I don't like the great programmer in the sky version.

1:54:50.460 --> 1:54:54.420
 Yeah, but if it's more kind of like,

1:54:54.420 --> 1:54:57.540
 I don't like to think of, if you look at a cellular automata,

1:54:59.820 --> 1:55:03.020
 if it's the cells and the rules,

1:55:03.020 --> 1:55:04.440
 that doesn't feel like God

1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:06.220
 that generates a bunch of stuff.

1:55:06.220 --> 1:55:10.400
 But if there's a machine like that does,

1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:13.680
 that runs the cellular automata and set the rules,

1:55:13.680 --> 1:55:15.020
 then that feels like God.

1:55:15.860 --> 1:55:19.220
 That sort of, in terms of terminology.

1:55:19.220 --> 1:55:21.060
 So I wonder if there's like a machine

1:55:21.060 --> 1:55:23.260
 that's required to generate this universe.

1:55:23.260 --> 1:55:26.820
 That's very sort of important for running this in the lab.

1:55:26.820 --> 1:55:29.420
 So as I said earlier, I think I said this earlier,

1:55:29.420 --> 1:55:32.060
 that I can't remember the phrase, but something like,

1:55:32.060 --> 1:55:34.060
 I mean, does God exist in our universe?

1:55:34.060 --> 1:55:35.220
 Yes.

1:55:35.220 --> 1:55:36.980
 Where does God exist?

1:55:36.980 --> 1:55:40.980
 God at least exists in abstraction in our minds,

1:55:40.980 --> 1:55:44.100
 particularly of people who have religious faith

1:55:44.100 --> 1:55:45.140
 they believe in.

1:55:45.140 --> 1:55:47.500
 But let's then take, but you're talking a little bit more

1:55:47.500 --> 1:55:49.140
 about generics, say, well,

1:55:49.140 --> 1:55:51.900
 is there a mechanism beyond the universe you're calling God?

1:55:51.900 --> 1:55:55.920
 I would say God did not exist at the beginning,

1:55:55.920 --> 1:55:58.460
 but he or she does now.

1:55:59.780 --> 1:56:00.620
 Because I'm saying the mechanism.

1:56:00.620 --> 1:56:03.460
 Well, you don't know that he didn't exist in the beginning.

1:56:03.460 --> 1:56:07.900
 So like this could be us in our minds trying to,

1:56:07.900 --> 1:56:10.960
 like just listening to gravitational waves,

1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:12.260
 detecting gravitational waves.

1:56:12.260 --> 1:56:13.100
 It's the same thing.

1:56:13.100 --> 1:56:16.900
 It's us trying to go back further and further

1:56:16.900 --> 1:56:19.900
 into our memories to try to understand the machines

1:56:19.900 --> 1:56:23.260
 that make up, that make up us.

1:56:23.260 --> 1:56:27.100
 And so it's possible that we're trying to grasp

1:56:27.100 --> 1:56:32.100
 at possible kind of what kind of machines could create.

1:56:32.100 --> 1:56:33.980
 There's always a tweet.

1:56:33.980 --> 1:56:36.540
 There's always a tweet.

1:56:36.540 --> 1:56:39.180
 If the universe is a computer, then God must have built it

1:56:39.180 --> 1:56:41.140
 because computers need creators.

1:56:41.140 --> 1:56:42.040
 There you go.

1:56:43.180 --> 1:56:46.380
 And then Joshe Bach replied,

1:56:46.380 --> 1:56:48.620
 since there's something rather than nothing,

1:56:48.620 --> 1:56:50.820
 perhaps existence is the default.

1:56:52.340 --> 1:56:56.340
 If existence is the default, then many computers exist.

1:56:56.340 --> 1:56:59.020
 Creator gods are necessary computers,

1:56:59.020 --> 1:57:00.740
 unnecessarily computers too.

1:57:00.740 --> 1:57:03.180
 I'm very confused by that, but that's an interesting idea

1:57:03.180 --> 1:57:05.780
 that existence is the default versus nonexistence.

1:57:05.780 --> 1:57:07.620
 I agree with that, but the rest is not.

1:57:07.620 --> 1:57:08.620
 And then Lee responds,

1:57:08.620 --> 1:57:11.820
 perhaps this reasoning is incomplete.

1:57:11.820 --> 1:57:14.580
 That's how scientists talk trash each other

1:57:14.580 --> 1:57:16.060
 on Twitter apparently.

1:57:16.060 --> 1:57:18.700
 Which part don't you agree with?

1:57:18.700 --> 1:57:20.620
 When he said if existence is default,

1:57:20.620 --> 1:57:22.100
 then many computers exist,

1:57:22.100 --> 1:57:25.200
 this comes back to the inventor and discovery argument.

1:57:26.300 --> 1:57:29.740
 I would say the universe at the beginning wasn't capable

1:57:29.740 --> 1:57:33.340
 of computation because there wasn't enough technology,

1:57:33.340 --> 1:57:34.820
 enough states.

1:57:34.820 --> 1:57:38.520
 So what you're saying is if God is a mechanism,

1:57:38.520 --> 1:57:40.620
 so I might actually agree,

1:57:40.620 --> 1:57:43.500
 but then the thing is lots of people see God

1:57:43.500 --> 1:57:44.540
 as more than a mechanism.

1:57:44.540 --> 1:57:47.760
 For me, God could be the causal graph in assembly theory

1:57:47.760 --> 1:57:50.020
 that creates all the stuff that the memories we know.

1:57:50.020 --> 1:57:52.740
 And the fact that we can even relate to each other

1:57:52.740 --> 1:57:54.840
 is because we have the same, we share that heritage.

1:57:54.840 --> 1:57:56.820
 And why we love each other

1:57:56.820 --> 1:57:58.700
 or we like to see God in each other

1:57:58.700 --> 1:58:03.700
 is it's just we know we have a shared existence.

1:58:04.740 --> 1:58:06.540
 So if the God is the mechanism

1:58:06.540 --> 1:58:08.500
 that created this whole thing,

1:58:08.500 --> 1:58:12.140
 I think a lot of people see God in a religious sense

1:58:12.140 --> 1:58:15.980
 as that mechanism also being able to communicate

1:58:15.980 --> 1:58:18.020
 with the objects it creates.

1:58:18.020 --> 1:58:19.620
 And if it's just the mechanism,

1:58:19.620 --> 1:58:23.540
 we won't be able to communicate with the objects it creates.

1:58:23.540 --> 1:58:24.580
 It can only create.

1:58:24.580 --> 1:58:29.060
 You can't interact with the...

1:58:29.060 --> 1:58:30.780
 Well, there's versions of God that create the universe

1:58:30.780 --> 1:58:31.620
 and then left.

1:58:33.620 --> 1:58:35.340
 Yeah, like spark.

1:58:35.340 --> 1:58:36.180
 For some religions.

1:58:36.180 --> 1:58:37.820
 The first spark, yeah.

1:58:37.820 --> 1:58:40.060
 But I think I liked your analogy

1:58:40.060 --> 1:58:42.300
 of the machine and the rules, right?

1:58:42.300 --> 1:58:47.300
 But I think part of the problem is,

1:58:47.420 --> 1:58:48.620
 I mean, we have this conception

1:58:48.620 --> 1:58:50.500
 that we can disentangle the rules

1:58:50.500 --> 1:58:51.860
 from the physical substrate, right?

1:58:51.860 --> 1:58:53.920
 And that's the whole thing about software and hardware

1:58:53.920 --> 1:58:56.140
 being separate or the way Newton wrote his laws

1:58:56.140 --> 1:58:57.220
 that there was some,

1:58:57.220 --> 1:58:58.620
 like they exist outside the universe.

1:58:58.620 --> 1:59:00.060
 They're not actually a feature of the universe.

1:59:00.060 --> 1:59:03.100
 They don't have to emerge out of the universe itself.

1:59:03.100 --> 1:59:06.500
 So I think if you merge your two views,

1:59:06.500 --> 1:59:08.620
 then it gets back to the God is the universe.

1:59:08.620 --> 1:59:10.220
 And then I think the deeper question

1:59:10.220 --> 1:59:12.900
 is why does it seem like there's meaning and purpose?

1:59:12.900 --> 1:59:16.320
 And if I think about the features of the universe

1:59:16.320 --> 1:59:17.880
 that give it the most meaning and purpose,

1:59:17.880 --> 1:59:19.380
 those are what we would call

1:59:19.380 --> 1:59:21.100
 the living components of the universe.

1:59:21.100 --> 1:59:24.180
 So if you wanted to say God is a physically real thing,

1:59:24.180 --> 1:59:25.220
 which you were saying

1:59:25.220 --> 1:59:26.740
 is like an emergent property of our minds,

1:59:26.740 --> 1:59:30.020
 but I would just say the way the universe

1:59:30.020 --> 1:59:31.420
 creates meaning and purpose,

1:59:31.420 --> 1:59:32.860
 there is really a physics there.

1:59:32.860 --> 1:59:35.020
 It's not like a illusory thing.

1:59:35.020 --> 1:59:37.460
 And that is just what the physics of life is.

1:59:39.140 --> 1:59:41.780
 Is it possible that we've forgotten

1:59:41.780 --> 1:59:44.540
 much of the mechanisms that created the universe?

1:59:45.660 --> 1:59:48.580
 So like, so basically, you know,

1:59:48.580 --> 1:59:50.740
 whatever, if God is that mechanism,

1:59:50.740 --> 1:59:52.340
 we just leave parts of that behind.

1:59:52.340 --> 1:59:54.700
 Well, but the universe is constantly generating itself.

1:59:54.700 --> 1:59:56.000
 So if God is that mechanism,

1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:58.340
 it would be that that would still be active today.

1:59:58.340 --> 2:00:00.260
 I don't, like, I'm agnostic,

2:00:00.260 --> 2:00:05.100
 but if I recall the things I believe in God

2:00:05.100 --> 2:00:07.620
 in the way that some people talk about God,

2:00:07.620 --> 2:00:09.940
 I would say that God is, you know,

2:00:09.940 --> 2:00:13.660
 like in the universe now, it's not an absent thing.

2:00:16.260 --> 2:00:18.020
 So I think there's a mislabeling here

2:00:18.020 --> 2:00:23.020
 because you're, I mean, I mean, I'm a professional idiot,

2:00:25.060 --> 2:00:27.660
 actually, but, but, um.

2:00:27.660 --> 2:00:29.220
 You should put that on your CV.

2:00:29.220 --> 2:00:30.060
 Yeah.

2:00:30.060 --> 2:00:33.820
 Professionally, not recreationally or amateur,

2:00:33.820 --> 2:00:36.300
 but professionally, you're paid for it.

2:00:36.300 --> 2:00:38.300
 I would say if you were talking about God,

2:00:38.300 --> 2:00:40.260
 I mean, again, I'm way out, way out of my depth here,

2:00:40.260 --> 2:00:41.620
 and I almost feel uncomfortable.

2:00:41.620 --> 2:00:43.820
 Yeah, but I feel quite uncomfortable articulating,

2:00:43.820 --> 2:00:45.020
 but I'll try.

2:00:45.020 --> 2:00:47.700
 For me, a lot of people that think of God as a consciousness

2:00:47.700 --> 2:00:52.540
 and a reasoning entity that actually has causal power,

2:00:52.540 --> 2:00:56.220
 and you're, and so you're, it's like,

2:00:56.220 --> 2:00:57.860
 then you're saying like gravity could be God

2:00:57.860 --> 2:00:58.820
 or time could be God.

2:00:58.820 --> 2:01:02.820
 I mean, I think for me, for my conception of time

2:01:02.820 --> 2:01:04.620
 is probably as fundamental as God

2:01:04.620 --> 2:01:07.700
 because it gave rise to human intelligence and consciousness

2:01:07.700 --> 2:01:10.500
 in which we can have this abstract notion of God.

2:01:12.060 --> 2:01:15.420
 So I think that you're maybe talking about God

2:01:15.420 --> 2:01:19.580
 in a very mechanistic, kind of unsophisticated sense,

2:01:19.580 --> 2:01:21.740
 whereas other people say that God is more sophisticated

2:01:21.740 --> 2:01:23.620
 and got all this, you know, feelings and love

2:01:23.620 --> 2:01:27.060
 and, you know, and this abstracting ability.

2:01:27.060 --> 2:01:29.660
 So is that what, or do you mean that?

2:01:29.660 --> 2:01:32.420
 Do you mean God as in this conscious entity

2:01:32.420 --> 2:01:35.200
 that decided to flick the universe into existence?

2:01:36.100 --> 2:01:40.540
 Well, one of the features that God would have

2:01:40.540 --> 2:01:45.540
 is the ability to flick the universe into existence.

2:01:46.740 --> 2:01:49.180
 I, you know, like Windows 95,

2:01:49.180 --> 2:01:52.140
 I don't know if God is Windows 95 or Windows XP

2:01:52.140 --> 2:01:55.620
 or Windows 10, I don't know the full feature set.

2:01:55.620 --> 2:01:58.580
 So at the very least, you have to flick the universe

2:01:58.580 --> 2:02:03.220
 into existence, and then other features might include

2:02:03.220 --> 2:02:07.640
 ability to interact with that universe in interesting ways,

2:02:07.640 --> 2:02:11.020
 and then how do you interact with the universe

2:02:11.020 --> 2:02:11.860
 in interesting ways?

2:02:11.860 --> 2:02:13.300
 You have to be able to speak the language

2:02:13.300 --> 2:02:15.140
 of its different components.

2:02:15.140 --> 2:02:17.620
 So in order to interact with humans,

2:02:17.620 --> 2:02:22.220
 you have to know how to act humanlike.

2:02:24.260 --> 2:02:29.260
 So I don't know, but it seems like

2:02:31.420 --> 2:02:33.660
 whatever mechanism created the universe

2:02:33.660 --> 2:02:38.660
 might want to also generate local pockets of mechanisms

2:02:40.780 --> 2:02:42.500
 that can interact with that.

2:02:42.500 --> 2:02:44.380
 Like inject.

2:02:44.380 --> 2:02:46.660
 Like God was lonely?

2:02:46.660 --> 2:02:49.180
 Yeah, I mean, it could be just a teenager

2:02:49.180 --> 2:02:51.740
 and another just playing a video game.

2:02:51.740 --> 2:02:52.580
 Yeah, maybe.

2:02:52.580 --> 2:02:54.460
 Well, I was gonna say, I mean, I don't,

2:02:54.460 --> 2:02:57.700
 so this is referring to our origin of life engine.

2:02:57.700 --> 2:02:59.160
 It's like, I don't believe in God,

2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:01.580
 but that doesn't mean I don't wanna be one.

2:03:01.580 --> 2:03:02.420
 Right.

2:03:02.420 --> 2:03:04.420
 I don't wanna make a universe and make a life form,

2:03:04.420 --> 2:03:07.420
 but that may be rude to people who have

2:03:07.420 --> 2:03:08.580
 dear religious beliefs.

2:03:08.580 --> 2:03:13.500
 What I mean by that is if we are able to create

2:03:13.500 --> 2:03:16.460
 an entirely new life form, different chemistry,

2:03:16.460 --> 2:03:20.980
 different culture, what does it make us?

2:03:20.980 --> 2:03:23.260
 By that definition, it makes us gods, right?

2:03:23.260 --> 2:03:24.100
 Well, there is.

2:03:24.100 --> 2:03:24.940
 I mean, like when you have children,

2:03:24.940 --> 2:03:28.140
 you're like one of the magical things of that

2:03:28.140 --> 2:03:29.620
 is you're kind of mini gods.

2:03:29.620 --> 2:03:32.940
 I mean, first of all, from a child's perspective,

2:03:32.940 --> 2:03:34.900
 parents are gods for quite a while.

2:03:34.900 --> 2:03:38.720
 And then, I mean, in the positive sense,

2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:39.560
 there's a magic to that.

2:03:39.560 --> 2:03:41.220
 That's why I love robotics,

2:03:41.220 --> 2:03:43.380
 is you instill life into something,

2:03:43.380 --> 2:03:48.380
 and that makes you feel godlike in a sort of positive way.

2:03:50.340 --> 2:03:51.620
 Being a creator is a positive feeling.

2:03:51.620 --> 2:03:54.280
 Creator, yeah, exactly, on a small scale.

2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:57.060
 And then God would be a creator

2:03:57.060 --> 2:03:59.700
 at the largest possible scale, I suppose.

2:03:59.700 --> 2:04:03.900
 Okay, you mentioned offline the Assembletron.

2:04:05.260 --> 2:04:06.100
 Assembletron.

2:04:06.100 --> 2:04:07.140
 Assembletron.

2:04:07.140 --> 2:04:08.220
 Yep.

2:04:08.220 --> 2:04:09.460
 What's an Assembletron?

2:04:09.460 --> 2:04:12.900
 This is an early idea of something you're thinking about.

2:04:12.900 --> 2:04:15.580
 So Sarah's team, well, I think Sarah's team

2:04:15.580 --> 2:04:19.420
 are interested in using AI to understand life.

2:04:19.420 --> 2:04:23.560
 My team is, and I'm wondering if we could apply

2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:25.420
 the principles of assembly theory,

2:04:25.420 --> 2:04:28.420
 that is the causal structure that you get

2:04:28.420 --> 2:04:30.940
 with assembly theory, and hybridize it,

2:04:30.940 --> 2:04:34.740
 and make a new type of neuron, if you like.

2:04:34.740 --> 2:04:37.940
 I mean, there are causal neural networks out there,

2:04:37.940 --> 2:04:40.580
 but they are not quite the architecture

2:04:40.580 --> 2:04:41.940
 of what I would like.

2:04:41.940 --> 2:04:45.820
 I would like to associate memory bits with,

2:04:45.820 --> 2:04:47.580
 basically, I'd like to make a,

2:04:47.580 --> 2:04:50.380
 rather than having an ASIC for neural networks,

2:04:50.380 --> 2:04:54.720
 I wanna make an ASIC for assembly networks, right?

2:04:54.720 --> 2:04:56.100
 And.

2:04:56.100 --> 2:04:57.100
 So can you say that again?

2:04:57.100 --> 2:04:58.960
 Assembly networks.

2:05:00.660 --> 2:05:05.460
 So what is a thing with an input and an output,

2:05:05.460 --> 2:05:07.500
 and it's like a neural network type of thing,

2:05:07.500 --> 2:05:08.340
 what does it do exactly?

2:05:08.340 --> 2:05:09.720
 What's the input, what's the output?

2:05:09.720 --> 2:05:11.980
 So in this case, so if you're talking about

2:05:11.980 --> 2:05:13.540
 a general neural network, I mean,

2:05:13.540 --> 2:05:15.700
 in general neural network, you can train it

2:05:15.700 --> 2:05:20.260
 on any sort of data, right, depending on the framework,

2:05:20.260 --> 2:05:25.260
 whether it's like text, or image data, or whatnot.

2:05:25.940 --> 2:05:30.100
 And that's fine, but there's no causal structure

2:05:30.100 --> 2:05:31.340
 associated with that data.

2:05:31.340 --> 2:05:33.880
 Now just imagine, rather than, you know,

2:05:33.880 --> 2:05:35.100
 let's say we're gonna classify a difference

2:05:35.100 --> 2:05:36.100
 between cat and dog, right?

2:05:36.100 --> 2:05:38.040
 Classic cat and dog neural network.

2:05:38.040 --> 2:05:42.340
 What about if the system understood the assembly space,

2:05:42.340 --> 2:05:43.940
 it created the cat and the dog,

2:05:44.980 --> 2:05:47.920
 and rather than guessing what was happening,

2:05:47.920 --> 2:05:49.420
 and training on those images,

2:05:49.420 --> 2:05:51.220
 and not understanding those features,

2:05:53.860 --> 2:05:56.620
 you almost like, you could imagine doing a,

2:05:56.620 --> 2:05:59.300
 going back a step and doing, and training,

2:05:59.300 --> 2:06:01.020
 going back a step and doing the training,

2:06:01.020 --> 2:06:02.860
 going back a step, back a step, back a step,

2:06:02.860 --> 2:06:06.620
 and I wonder if that is actually the origin of intelligence,

2:06:06.620 --> 2:06:08.900
 or how we'll crack intelligence.

2:06:08.900 --> 2:06:11.820
 Because we need to, because we'll create

2:06:11.820 --> 2:06:16.820
 the entire graph of events, and be able to kind of

2:06:17.340 --> 2:06:19.140
 look at cause and effect across those graphs.

2:06:19.140 --> 2:06:20.420
 I'm explaining it really badly,

2:06:20.420 --> 2:06:23.700
 but it's a gene of an idea, and I'm guessing

2:06:23.700 --> 2:06:28.700
 very smart, very rich people in AI are already doing this.

2:06:28.860 --> 2:06:31.480
 Trying to not generate cats and dogs,

2:06:31.480 --> 2:06:35.060
 but trying to generate things of high assembly index.

2:06:35.060 --> 2:06:39.340
 Yeah, and I think, and also using causal graphs

2:06:39.340 --> 2:06:42.820
 in neural networks, and machine learning, and deep learning,

2:06:42.820 --> 2:06:44.300
 maybe building a new architecture.

2:06:44.300 --> 2:06:45.960
 I'm just wondering, is there something

2:06:45.960 --> 2:06:47.100
 we can get out of assembly theory

2:06:47.100 --> 2:06:49.940
 that allows us to rebuild current machine learning

2:06:49.940 --> 2:06:54.940
 architectures to give causation more cheaply?

2:06:54.940 --> 2:06:56.540
 I mean, I don't know if that's what you,

2:06:56.540 --> 2:06:58.240
 we've been inventing this for a little while,

2:06:58.240 --> 2:07:00.500
 but we're trying to finish the theory paper first

2:07:00.500 --> 2:07:01.580
 before we do anything else.

2:07:01.580 --> 2:07:05.420
 Yeah, you also wanna have, say, goal directed behavior

2:07:05.420 --> 2:07:07.340
 in neural networks, then assembly theory

2:07:07.340 --> 2:07:08.580
 is a good framework for doing that.

2:07:08.580 --> 2:07:10.500
 Daniel's been thinking about that a lot.

2:07:10.500 --> 2:07:12.300
 And I think it's a really interesting idea

2:07:12.300 --> 2:07:16.180
 that you can map concepts from how neural networks learn

2:07:16.180 --> 2:07:18.780
 to thinking about goal directed behavior

2:07:18.780 --> 2:07:20.020
 as a learning process.

2:07:20.020 --> 2:07:21.300
 That you're learning a specific goal.

2:07:21.300 --> 2:07:22.580
 The universe is learning a goal

2:07:22.580 --> 2:07:24.180
 when it generates a particular structure,

2:07:24.180 --> 2:07:25.980
 and that you can map that physical structure

2:07:25.980 --> 2:07:27.100
 in a neural network.

2:07:29.100 --> 2:07:30.080
 What's the goal?

2:07:31.780 --> 2:07:34.180
 Well, in a neural network, you're designing the goal.

2:07:34.180 --> 2:07:39.180
 In biology, I mean, people are not supposed to use

2:07:39.420 --> 2:07:41.780
 teleological language in biology, which is ridiculous,

2:07:41.780 --> 2:07:45.140
 but, because goals are real things.

2:07:45.140 --> 2:07:47.300
 They're just post selected.

2:07:47.300 --> 2:07:49.520
 So you can talk about goals after the fact.

2:07:51.060 --> 2:07:52.740
 Once a goal emerges in the universe,

2:07:52.740 --> 2:07:54.740
 that physical entity has a goal.

2:07:54.740 --> 2:07:57.600
 But Lee and I came up with a test for,

2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:00.380
 like a Turing test for goal directed behavior

2:08:00.380 --> 2:08:01.940
 based on the idea of assembly.

2:08:01.940 --> 2:08:03.000
 We have to formalize it still,

2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:04.540
 but I would like to write a paper on it.

2:08:04.540 --> 2:08:09.140
 But the basic idea is if you had two systems

2:08:09.140 --> 2:08:11.080
 that were completely equivalent,

2:08:11.080 --> 2:08:14.400
 you know, like in the instantaneous,

2:08:14.400 --> 2:08:16.080
 like physical experimental setup.

2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:18.280
 So Lee has to figure out how to do this.

2:08:18.280 --> 2:08:19.980
 But there was something that would be different

2:08:19.980 --> 2:08:21.720
 in their future.

2:08:21.720 --> 2:08:23.520
 And there was a symmetry breaking you observe

2:08:23.520 --> 2:08:25.320
 in the present based on that possibility

2:08:25.320 --> 2:08:26.560
 of that future outcome.

2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:28.240
 Then you could say that that system

2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:31.000
 had some representation of some kind of goal in mind

2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:33.080
 about what it wanted to do in the future.

2:08:33.080 --> 2:08:35.820
 And I, so goals are interesting

2:08:35.820 --> 2:08:38.840
 because they don't exist as instantaneous things.

2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:40.040
 They exist across time,

2:08:40.040 --> 2:08:42.720
 which is one of the reasons that assembly theories

2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:45.880
 may be more naturally able to account

2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:47.340
 for the existence of goals.

2:08:48.220 --> 2:08:52.280
 So goals are, they only exist in time,

2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:55.160
 or they manifest themselves in time

2:08:55.160 --> 2:08:58.660
 through, you said, symmetry breaking.

2:08:58.660 --> 2:09:01.840
 So it's almost like, imagine,

2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:05.560
 like if representations in your mind are real, right?

2:09:05.560 --> 2:09:08.120
 And you can imagine future possibilities,

2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:11.080
 but imagine everything else is physically equivalent.

2:09:11.080 --> 2:09:13.160
 And the only thing that you actually change

2:09:13.160 --> 2:09:15.480
 your decision based on is what you model

2:09:15.480 --> 2:09:17.200
 as being the future outcome.

2:09:17.200 --> 2:09:20.200
 Then somehow that representation in your mind

2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:21.680
 of the future outcome becomes causal

2:09:21.680 --> 2:09:22.520
 to what you're doing now.

2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:24.520
 So there's kind of like retro causal effect,

2:09:24.520 --> 2:09:25.960
 but it's not actually retro causal.

2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:28.560
 It's just that your assembly space

2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:31.680
 is actually includes those possibilities

2:09:31.680 --> 2:09:32.640
 as part of the structure.

2:09:32.640 --> 2:09:34.160
 It's just, you're not observing all the features

2:09:34.160 --> 2:09:36.080
 of the assembly space in the current moment.

2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:40.560
 Or the possibilities exist, but they don't become a goal

2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:42.120
 until they're realized.

2:09:42.120 --> 2:09:44.140
 So one of the features of assembly space

2:09:44.140 --> 2:09:45.560
 that's super interesting,

2:09:45.560 --> 2:09:48.960
 and it's easier to envision with like Legos, for example,

2:09:48.960 --> 2:09:50.800
 is if you're thinking about an assembly space,

2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:52.880
 you can't observe the entire assembly space

2:09:52.880 --> 2:09:54.020
 in any instant in time.

2:09:54.020 --> 2:09:55.800
 So if you imagine a stack of Legos,

2:09:55.800 --> 2:09:58.740
 and you wanna look at the assembly space of a stack of Legos,

2:09:58.740 --> 2:10:00.600
 you have to break the Legos apart,

2:10:00.600 --> 2:10:03.200
 and then you look at all the possible ways

2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:05.560
 of building up the original object.

2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:06.880
 So now you have in your mind

2:10:06.880 --> 2:10:08.480
 the goal of building that object,

2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:10.720
 and you have all the possible ways of doing it.

2:10:10.720 --> 2:10:13.120
 And those are actual physical features of that object,

2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:14.800
 but that object doesn't always exist.

2:10:14.800 --> 2:10:17.600
 What exists is the possibility of generating it.

2:10:17.600 --> 2:10:20.460
 And the possibilities are always infinite.

2:10:20.460 --> 2:10:22.760
 Well, for that particular object,

2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:25.280
 like it has a well defined assembly space.

2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:27.220
 And I guess what I'm saying is that object

2:10:27.220 --> 2:10:28.840
 is the assembly space,

2:10:28.840 --> 2:10:31.760
 but you actually have to unpack that object across time

2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:33.280
 to view that feature of it.

2:10:33.280 --> 2:10:35.160
 It's only an observable across time.

2:10:35.160 --> 2:10:39.360
 The term goal is such a important

2:10:39.360 --> 2:10:41.960
 and difficult to explain concept, right?

2:10:41.960 --> 2:10:44.580
 Because what you want is a way is like,

2:10:44.580 --> 2:10:47.820
 I think only conscious beings can have conscious goals.

2:10:49.240 --> 2:10:51.600
 Everything else is doing selection.

2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:53.560
 And but selection does invent goals.

2:10:53.560 --> 2:10:58.560
 And in a way that the way that biology reinterprets the past

2:10:58.560 --> 2:11:03.520
 in the present is kind of helped you to understand

2:11:03.520 --> 2:11:05.400
 there was a goal in the past now, right?

2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:08.260
 It's kind of like goals only exist back in time.

2:11:09.280 --> 2:11:14.280
 So first of all, only conscious beings

2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:17.280
 can have conscious goals.

2:11:17.280 --> 2:11:19.200
 I'm not even gonna touch that one.

2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:20.040
 Why?

2:11:21.720 --> 2:11:23.320
 Go for it, come on.

2:11:23.320 --> 2:11:25.200
 The line between conscious goals

2:11:25.200 --> 2:11:28.880
 and non conscious goals, exactly.

2:11:28.880 --> 2:11:31.080
 And also maybe just on top of that,

2:11:31.080 --> 2:11:33.960
 you said a Turing test for goal directed behavior.

2:11:33.960 --> 2:11:38.960
 What does a Turing test potentially look like?

2:11:39.100 --> 2:11:40.920
 So if you've got two objects, we were thinking about this.

2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:42.800
 So we actually got some funding

2:11:42.800 --> 2:11:43.840
 to work to go on two teams.

2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:46.200
 So I'm trying to do, and part of this

2:11:46.200 --> 2:11:47.720
 is I'm trying to do a bit of theory

2:11:47.720 --> 2:11:49.560
 and Sarah is teaching me a bit of theory

2:11:49.560 --> 2:11:51.520
 and Sarah is trying to design experiments

2:11:51.520 --> 2:11:52.360
 and I'm teaching experiments.

2:11:52.360 --> 2:11:53.760
 Cause I think it's really good for us to have that.

2:11:53.760 --> 2:11:58.540
 So say, when would a, so that's good.

2:11:58.540 --> 2:12:02.040
 I like this, I'm sure we're using Dan Dennett essay.

2:12:02.040 --> 2:12:04.040
 Yeah, and I can explain why we wouldn't want to call it

2:12:04.040 --> 2:12:05.840
 a Turing test after, but Dan Dennett.

2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:07.840
 So Dan Dennett wrote this really nice essay

2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:11.840
 about herding cats and freewill inflation.

2:12:12.720 --> 2:12:14.040
 The title is so brilliant.

2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:14.880
 That's the actual title?

2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:15.700
 That's the title, yeah.

2:12:15.700 --> 2:12:18.120
 Herding cats and freewill inflation.

2:12:18.120 --> 2:12:19.040
 Yeah, something like that.

2:12:19.040 --> 2:12:20.320
 I mean, it's not, maybe not.

2:12:20.320 --> 2:12:21.160
 And so.

2:12:21.160 --> 2:12:22.000
 No, I think that's right.

2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:23.880
 So if you've got a, let's imagine you've got two objects

2:12:23.880 --> 2:12:26.040
 on a hillside, okay?

2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:28.160
 And it just happens to be a snowy hill

2:12:28.160 --> 2:12:29.640
 and let's just say you see an object

2:12:29.640 --> 2:12:31.480
 get rolling down the hill.

2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:34.680
 Or you, and the rock rolls down the hill

2:12:34.680 --> 2:12:36.720
 but the start goes to the end.

2:12:36.720 --> 2:12:38.000
 How do you know that object's had a goal?

2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:39.560
 Now you unveil the object

2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:41.780
 and you'll see it's actually a skier.

2:12:41.780 --> 2:12:44.320
 And the skier starts at the top and goes down the bottom.

2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:45.640
 Great.

2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:46.700
 Then you look at the rock.

2:12:46.700 --> 2:12:48.680
 Rock rolls down the hill and goes to the bottom.

2:12:48.680 --> 2:12:51.240
 How can you tell the difference between the two?

2:12:51.240 --> 2:12:54.200
 So, and what Dan says is like, well, this is clear.

2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:56.340
 The skier's in control.

2:12:56.340 --> 2:12:58.840
 And because they're adjusting the trajectory,

2:12:58.840 --> 2:13:00.600
 so there's some updating going on.

2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:01.800
 Then the only way you could really do that

2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:04.240
 is if you put the skier back to the top of the hill again,

2:13:04.240 --> 2:13:06.140
 they would tend to start roughly in the same space

2:13:06.140 --> 2:13:09.760
 and probably take all that complex set of trajectories

2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:12.000
 and end up pretty much at the same finish point, right?

2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:13.420
 With plus or minus a few meters.

2:13:13.420 --> 2:13:15.400
 Whereas if it was just a random rock

2:13:15.400 --> 2:13:18.000
 going down to a random trajectory, that wouldn't happen.

2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.320
 And so what Sarah and I were kind of doing

2:13:20.320 --> 2:13:21.560
 when we were writing this grant,

2:13:21.560 --> 2:13:25.560
 we were like, we need to somehow instantiate the skier

2:13:25.560 --> 2:13:27.760
 and the rock in an experiment.

2:13:27.760 --> 2:13:31.040
 And then say, okay, when does the object,

2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:34.320
 so for an object to have a goal, it has to have an update.

2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:36.560
 It has to have some sensing and some kind of,

2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:41.440
 you know, inbuilt actuation to respond to the environment.

2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:44.120
 And then we just have to iterate on that.

2:13:44.120 --> 2:13:47.120
 And maybe Sarah, you can then fill in the Turing test part.

2:13:47.120 --> 2:13:49.080
 Well, yeah, I guess the motivation for me

2:13:49.080 --> 2:13:50.000
 was slightly different.

2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.220
 So I get really frustrated about conversations

2:13:52.220 --> 2:13:54.580
 about consciousness as most people do.

2:13:54.580 --> 2:13:56.080
 You know, a lot of people are,

2:13:56.080 --> 2:13:59.080
 which is not necessarily related to free will directly

2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:01.040
 or to this goal directed behavior.

2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:03.080
 But I think there's a whole set of bundled

2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:04.680
 and related topics here.

2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:07.000
 But I think for me, I was, you know,

2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:09.360
 everybody's always interested in explaining

2:14:09.360 --> 2:14:12.220
 intrinsic experience and quantifying intrinsic experience.

2:14:12.220 --> 2:14:14.800
 And there's all sorts of problems with that

2:14:14.800 --> 2:14:17.320
 because you can never actually be another physical system.

2:14:17.320 --> 2:14:18.200
 So you can't know what it's like

2:14:18.200 --> 2:14:20.400
 to be another physical system.

2:14:20.400 --> 2:14:21.760
 So I always thought there must be some way

2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:23.620
 of getting at this problem about

2:14:23.620 --> 2:14:26.200
 if an agent or an entity is conscious

2:14:26.200 --> 2:14:28.840
 or at least has internal representations

2:14:28.840 --> 2:14:30.920
 and those are real physical things,

2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:34.600
 that it must have causal consequences.

2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:38.200
 So the way I would ask the question of consciousness

2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:40.820
 is not, you know, what is it like intrinsically?

2:14:40.820 --> 2:14:43.680
 But if things have intrinsic experience,

2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:45.700
 is there any observable difference from the outside

2:14:45.700 --> 2:14:47.800
 about the kind of causation

2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:50.200
 that that physical system would enact in?

2:14:50.200 --> 2:14:52.800
 And for me, the most interesting thing that humans do

2:14:52.800 --> 2:14:53.840
 is have imagination.

2:14:53.840 --> 2:14:56.200
 So like we can imagine rockets centuries

2:14:56.200 --> 2:14:57.360
 before we build them.

2:14:57.360 --> 2:14:59.040
 They've become real physical things

2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:00.680
 because we imagine them.

2:15:00.680 --> 2:15:02.880
 And people might disentangle that from conscious experience,

2:15:02.880 --> 2:15:04.780
 but I think a lot of the sort of imagination we do

2:15:04.780 --> 2:15:06.960
 is actually a conscious process.

2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:09.820
 So then this becomes a question of

2:15:09.820 --> 2:15:12.280
 if I were observing systems and I said,

2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:15.200
 one had an internal representation,

2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:16.220
 which is slightly different

2:15:16.220 --> 2:15:17.780
 than a conscious experience, obviously.

2:15:17.780 --> 2:15:19.240
 So I'm entangling some concepts,

2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:22.260
 but it's a loose set of thought experiments.

2:15:22.260 --> 2:15:24.840
 Then how, and I set them up

2:15:24.840 --> 2:15:27.480
 in a physically equivalent situation.

2:15:28.380 --> 2:15:30.240
 Would it be the case that

2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:34.800
 there would be experimental observables associated with it?

2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:38.280
 And that became the idea of trying to actually

2:15:38.280 --> 2:15:40.120
 measure for internal representation and conscious.

2:15:40.120 --> 2:15:42.400
 So Turing basically didn't wanna do that.

2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:44.520
 You just wanted the machine that could emulate

2:15:44.520 --> 2:15:46.000
 and trick you into having the behavior,

2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:48.580
 but never dealt with the internal experience

2:15:48.580 --> 2:15:51.040
 because he didn't know how to do that.

2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:53.080
 And I guess I was wondering,

2:15:53.080 --> 2:15:55.240
 is there a way to set up the experiment

2:15:55.240 --> 2:15:57.600
 where you could actually test for that?

2:15:57.600 --> 2:16:00.840
 For imagination that led to the thing.

2:16:00.840 --> 2:16:02.760
 That there was something internal going on,

2:16:02.760 --> 2:16:06.360
 some kind of inner world, as people say,

2:16:06.360 --> 2:16:09.920
 or you could say, it actually is an agent,

2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:13.800
 it's making decisions, it has an internal representation.

2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:15.660
 And whether you say that's experience or not

2:16:15.660 --> 2:16:18.160
 is a different thing, but at least the feature

2:16:18.160 --> 2:16:20.400
 that there's some abstraction it's doing

2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:23.240
 that's not obvious from looking at the physical substrates.

2:16:23.240 --> 2:16:25.200
 Do you think it's possible to do that kind of thing?

2:16:25.200 --> 2:16:27.980
 One of the compelling things about the Turing test

2:16:27.980 --> 2:16:30.360
 is that defining intelligence,

2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:32.640
 defining any complicated concept

2:16:32.640 --> 2:16:37.640
 as a thing like observing it from the surface

2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:40.480
 and not caring about what's going on deep inside

2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:42.640
 because how do you know?

2:16:42.640 --> 2:16:43.680
 That's the point.

2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:45.000
 So the idea is exactly that.

2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:46.440
 So what we're trying to do,

2:16:46.440 --> 2:16:47.800
 the Turing test for goal directedness

2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:50.520
 is literally take some objects

2:16:50.520 --> 2:16:52.360
 that clearly don't have any internal representation,

2:16:52.360 --> 2:16:54.920
 grains of sand blowing on the beach or something,

2:16:55.840 --> 2:16:59.400
 and I don't know, a crab wandering around on the beach

2:16:59.400 --> 2:17:00.760
 and then generating an experiment

2:17:00.760 --> 2:17:04.320
 where literally the experiment generates an entity

2:17:04.320 --> 2:17:07.800
 that literally has no internal representation to sand,

2:17:07.800 --> 2:17:08.940
 these are oil droplets actually,

2:17:08.940 --> 2:17:11.640
 what we've got in mind, a robot that makes oil droplets.

2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:13.280
 But then what we wanna try and do

2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:16.120
 is train the oil droplets to be like crabs,

2:17:16.120 --> 2:17:18.120
 give them an internal representation,

2:17:18.120 --> 2:17:21.640
 give them the ability to integrate information

2:17:21.640 --> 2:17:25.260
 from the environment so they remember the past,

2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:31.080
 are in the present, and can imagine a future.

2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:33.600
 And in a very limited way, their kind of game engine,

2:17:33.600 --> 2:17:36.280
 their limited simulation of the world

2:17:36.280 --> 2:17:38.320
 allows them to then make a decision.

2:17:38.320 --> 2:17:40.320
 They're objects across time.

2:17:40.320 --> 2:17:43.040
 So then you would run a bunch of crabs

2:17:43.040 --> 2:17:44.600
 like over and over and over and over?

2:17:44.600 --> 2:17:45.960
 How many crabs, Lee?

2:17:45.960 --> 2:17:47.480
 How many, is there, what's,

2:17:47.480 --> 2:17:49.320
 because you have to have a large number of crabs,

2:17:49.320 --> 2:17:52.560
 what does your theory say, is there a mathematical?

2:17:52.560 --> 2:17:54.160
 We're working on it, I mean, this is literally.

2:17:54.160 --> 2:17:55.800
 Limit, crab limit.

2:17:55.800 --> 2:17:57.040
 There's literally a.

2:17:57.040 --> 2:17:57.880
 Excellent.

2:17:57.880 --> 2:17:58.720
 There's literally a.

2:17:58.720 --> 2:17:59.960
 What's the herding cats have to do?

2:17:59.960 --> 2:18:02.480
 Oh, that's random, wait, what's cats,

2:18:02.480 --> 2:18:04.520
 in the title by Daniel Dennett,

2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:06.720
 Herding Cats and the Free Will Inflation.

2:18:06.720 --> 2:18:07.680
 So, I love this.

2:18:07.680 --> 2:18:08.920
 What does herding cats mean,

2:18:08.920 --> 2:18:10.800
 what does free will inflation mean?

2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:13.080
 So this, I love this essay,

2:18:13.080 --> 2:18:14.440
 because it explained to me

2:18:14.440 --> 2:18:17.080
 how I can live in a deterministic universe,

2:18:18.640 --> 2:18:22.480
 but have, not free will, but have freedom.

2:18:24.200 --> 2:18:26.640
 And also it helped me explain

2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:30.920
 that time needed to be a real thing in this universe.

2:18:30.920 --> 2:18:33.840
 So what basically Dan was saying here is like,

2:18:33.840 --> 2:18:35.800
 how do you, how do these cats appear

2:18:35.800 --> 2:18:38.440
 to just do what they want, right?

2:18:38.440 --> 2:18:41.240
 And if you live in a deterministic universe,

2:18:41.240 --> 2:18:43.280
 why do the cats do these things?

2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:46.280
 You know, aren't they just, isn't it all obvious?

2:18:46.280 --> 2:18:48.720
 And how does free will inflate the universe?

2:18:48.720 --> 2:18:51.560
 And for me, I mean, probably I love the essay

2:18:51.560 --> 2:18:53.800
 because my interpretation of the essay

2:18:53.800 --> 2:18:56.200
 in assembly theory makes complete sense.

2:18:57.520 --> 2:19:00.600
 Because you need an expanding universe

2:19:00.600 --> 2:19:04.720
 in assembly theory to create novelty

2:19:04.720 --> 2:19:07.240
 that you search for,

2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:09.080
 that then when you find something interesting

2:19:09.080 --> 2:19:10.840
 and you keep doing it because it's cool

2:19:10.840 --> 2:19:13.280
 and it gives you an advantage,

2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:15.480
 then it appears in the past to be a goal.

2:19:15.480 --> 2:19:17.200
 So what does, in assembly theory,

2:19:17.200 --> 2:19:19.840
 the expansion of the universe look like?

2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:22.280
 What are we talking about?

2:19:22.280 --> 2:19:26.520
 Why does the expansion of the universe

2:19:26.520 --> 2:19:30.440
 give you more possibilities of novelty and cool stuff?

2:19:30.440 --> 2:19:32.280
 So for me, I don't think about the universe

2:19:32.280 --> 2:19:34.160
 in terms of big bang and space.

2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:37.800
 I think about it in terms of the big memory expansion.

2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:39.360
 That you have one, you only have the ability

2:19:39.360 --> 2:19:41.400
 to store one bit of information,

2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:43.000
 so then you can't do very much.

2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:46.640
 So what the universe has been doing since forever,

2:19:46.640 --> 2:19:49.000
 it's been creating more,

2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:53.280
 it's been increasing the size of its RAM, okay?

2:19:53.280 --> 2:19:55.400
 So it's like one megabyte, two megabyte,

2:19:55.400 --> 2:19:57.520
 three megabyte, four megabytes, all the way up.

2:19:57.520 --> 2:20:00.720
 And so the more RAM you have,

2:20:00.720 --> 2:20:04.280
 the more you can remember about the past,

2:20:04.280 --> 2:20:07.120
 which allows you to do cooler things in the future.

2:20:07.120 --> 2:20:09.680
 So if you can remember how to launch a rocket,

2:20:09.680 --> 2:20:12.680
 then you might be able to imagine how to land a rocket,

2:20:12.680 --> 2:20:15.040
 and then relaunch, reland, and carry on.

2:20:15.040 --> 2:20:19.800
 And so you're able to expand the space

2:20:19.800 --> 2:20:21.080
 and remember the past.

2:20:21.080 --> 2:20:23.720
 And so that's why I think it's very important.

2:20:23.720 --> 2:20:25.320
 But not a perfect memory.

2:20:25.320 --> 2:20:27.000
 It's an interesting question,

2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:28.880
 whether there's some forgetting that happens

2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:30.480
 that might increase.

2:20:30.480 --> 2:20:34.200
 Is the expansion of the forgetting, at some point,

2:20:34.200 --> 2:20:37.120
 accelerate faster than the remembering?

2:20:37.120 --> 2:20:38.960
 I think that that's a very important thing

2:20:38.960 --> 2:20:40.800
 that probably intelligence does,

2:20:40.800 --> 2:20:42.360
 and we're gonna learn in machine learning about,

2:20:42.360 --> 2:20:44.400
 because you want machine learning right now,

2:20:44.400 --> 2:20:45.720
 or artificial intelligence right now,

2:20:45.720 --> 2:20:47.280
 doesn't have memory right,

2:20:47.280 --> 2:20:49.120
 but you want the ability to,

2:20:49.120 --> 2:20:52.760
 or not for, if you want to get to human like consciousness,

2:20:52.760 --> 2:20:55.400
 you need to have the ability, I suppose, to remember stuff

2:20:55.400 --> 2:20:57.040
 and then to selectively forget stuff

2:20:57.040 --> 2:20:59.520
 so you can re remember it and compress it.

2:20:59.520 --> 2:21:02.160
 Arguably, the way that we come up with new physical laws.

2:21:02.160 --> 2:21:07.160
 I think that there is a great deal to be gained

2:21:12.520 --> 2:21:15.960
 from having the ability to remember things,

2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:18.000
 but then when you forget them,

2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:18.960
 you can then have a,

2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:20.800
 you can basically do the simulation again

2:21:20.800 --> 2:21:23.920
 and work out if you get to that compressed representation.

2:21:23.920 --> 2:21:25.280
 So that's in cycles.

2:21:25.280 --> 2:21:29.560
 So cycles of remembering and forgetting

2:21:29.560 --> 2:21:31.080
 are probably important,

2:21:31.080 --> 2:21:33.640
 but there shouldn't be excuse to have a universe

2:21:33.640 --> 2:21:34.480
 with no memory in it.

2:21:34.480 --> 2:21:37.120
 The universe is gonna remember that it forgot,

2:21:37.120 --> 2:21:38.200
 but just not tell you.

2:21:40.300 --> 2:21:42.260
 I'm looking at this paper

2:21:42.260 --> 2:21:44.760
 and it's talking about a puppet controlling a puppet

2:21:44.760 --> 2:21:46.960
 controlling a puppet controlling a puppet controlling

2:21:46.960 --> 2:21:48.200
 a puppet controlling a puppet,

2:21:48.200 --> 2:21:49.480
 conceptually easy to understand,

2:21:49.480 --> 2:21:50.640
 but physically impossible,

2:21:50.640 --> 2:21:53.600
 as physically impossible as predicting a fair coin toss.

2:21:53.600 --> 2:21:54.960
 I don't know what he's talking about,

2:21:54.960 --> 2:21:58.600
 but there's pictures of puppets controlling puppets.

2:21:58.600 --> 2:21:59.640
 Let me ask you,

2:21:59.640 --> 2:22:01.760
 there's a few things I wanna ask,

2:22:01.760 --> 2:22:04.600
 but we brought up time quite a bit.

2:22:04.600 --> 2:22:07.100
 You guys tweet about time quite a bit.

2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:10.760
 What is time in all of this?

2:22:10.760 --> 2:22:12.400
 We kind of mentioned it a bunch.

2:22:13.440 --> 2:22:15.840
 Is it not important at all in terms of,

2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:16.880
 is it just a word?

2:22:16.880 --> 2:22:18.840
 Should we be talking about causality mostly?

2:22:18.840 --> 2:22:20.360
 Like Sarah, what do you think?

2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:24.160
 Is, we've talked about like memories.

2:22:24.160 --> 2:22:25.440
 Is that the fundamental thing

2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:26.560
 that we should be thinking about?

2:22:26.560 --> 2:22:29.680
 And time is just a useful measurement device or something

2:22:29.680 --> 2:22:30.580
 like that.

2:22:30.580 --> 2:22:32.360
 Well, there's different concepts of time, right?

2:22:32.360 --> 2:22:33.720
 So I think in assembly theory,

2:22:33.720 --> 2:22:34.560
 when we're talking about time,

2:22:34.560 --> 2:22:36.200
 we're talking about the ordering of things.

2:22:36.200 --> 2:22:38.280
 So that's the causal graph part.

2:22:38.280 --> 2:22:40.720
 And so then the fundamental structure of the universe

2:22:40.720 --> 2:22:42.840
 is that there is a certain ordering

2:22:42.840 --> 2:22:44.660
 and certain things can't happen till other things happen.

2:22:44.660 --> 2:22:48.600
 But usually when we colloquially talk about time,

2:22:48.600 --> 2:22:50.440
 we're talking about the flow of time.

2:22:51.440 --> 2:22:52.960
 And I guess Lee and I were actually debating

2:22:52.960 --> 2:22:53.920
 about this this morning.

2:22:53.920 --> 2:22:56.680
 So in talking on it, walking on the river here,

2:22:56.680 --> 2:23:00.080
 which is a very lovely spot for talking about time,

2:23:00.080 --> 2:23:02.540
 but that when the universe is updating,

2:23:02.540 --> 2:23:05.840
 it's transitioning between things that exist now

2:23:05.840 --> 2:23:07.140
 and things that exist now.

2:23:09.140 --> 2:23:11.720
 That's really the flow of time.

2:23:11.720 --> 2:23:15.700
 So you have to separate out those concepts at bare minimum.

2:23:15.700 --> 2:23:17.880
 And then there's also an arrow of time

2:23:17.880 --> 2:23:19.360
 that people talk about in physics,

2:23:19.360 --> 2:23:21.960
 which is that time doesn't appear to have a directionality

2:23:21.960 --> 2:23:25.200
 in fundamental physics, but it does to us, right?

2:23:25.200 --> 2:23:26.840
 Like we can't go backwards in time.

2:23:26.840 --> 2:23:29.260
 And usually that would be explained in physics

2:23:29.260 --> 2:23:32.160
 in terms of, well, there's a cosmological arrow of time,

2:23:32.160 --> 2:23:33.880
 but there's also the thermodynamic arrow of time

2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:35.040
 of increasing entropy.

2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:37.840
 But what we would say in assembly theory

2:23:37.840 --> 2:23:39.320
 is that there is a clear directionality.

2:23:39.320 --> 2:23:40.960
 The universe only runs in one direction,

2:23:40.960 --> 2:23:42.840
 which is why some things, it's easy to make,

2:23:42.840 --> 2:23:45.440
 if the universe runs in one direction,

2:23:45.440 --> 2:23:47.600
 it's easy to make processes look reversible.

2:23:47.600 --> 2:23:49.580
 For example, if they have no memory,

2:23:49.580 --> 2:23:51.040
 they're easy to run forward and backwards,

2:23:51.040 --> 2:23:52.960
 which is why the laws of physics that we have now

2:23:52.960 --> 2:23:55.640
 look the way they do, because they involve objects

2:23:55.640 --> 2:23:56.600
 that have no memory.

2:23:56.600 --> 2:23:58.320
 But when you get to things like us,

2:23:58.320 --> 2:23:59.840
 it becomes very clear that the universe

2:23:59.840 --> 2:24:01.480
 has a directionality associated to it.

2:24:01.480 --> 2:24:03.120
 So it's not reversible at all.

2:24:03.120 --> 2:24:06.400
 It's the no man ever steps in the same river.

2:24:06.400 --> 2:24:07.400
 I just have to bring that out

2:24:07.400 --> 2:24:08.400
 because you walked on the river.

2:24:08.400 --> 2:24:11.160
 No man ever steps in the same river twice

2:24:11.160 --> 2:24:14.360
 before he's not the same river and he's not the same man.

2:24:14.360 --> 2:24:16.840
 So it's not reversible, any of the same.

2:24:16.840 --> 2:24:19.520
 No, but reversibility is an emergent property, right?

2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:22.160
 So we think of the reversibility laws as being fundamental

2:24:22.160 --> 2:24:23.960
 and the irreversibility as being emergent.

2:24:23.960 --> 2:24:26.880
 But I think what we would say from how we think about it,

2:24:26.880 --> 2:24:28.640
 and it certainly seems to be the case

2:24:28.640 --> 2:24:29.680
 for our perception of time,

2:24:29.680 --> 2:24:33.380
 but also what's happening in biological evolution,

2:24:33.380 --> 2:24:35.400
 you can make things reversible,

2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:37.280
 but it requires work to do it.

2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:39.000
 And it requires certain machines

2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:40.520
 to run it forward and backward.

2:24:40.520 --> 2:24:42.840
 And Chiara Marletto is working some interesting ideas

2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:44.720
 on constructor theory related to that,

2:24:44.720 --> 2:24:46.400
 which is a totally different set of ideas.

2:24:46.400 --> 2:24:49.680
 You can travel back in time sometimes.

2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:50.520
 Yes.

2:24:52.520 --> 2:24:54.160
 You can't travel actually back in time,

2:24:54.160 --> 2:24:56.360
 but you could reconstruct things

2:24:56.360 --> 2:24:58.000
 that have existed in the past.

2:24:58.000 --> 2:24:59.400
 You're always moving forward in time,

2:24:59.400 --> 2:25:01.240
 but you can cycle through.

2:25:01.240 --> 2:25:02.080
 Like, I mean, I can...

2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:02.900
 Can I clarify what you just said?

2:25:02.900 --> 2:25:03.740
 Yeah, yeah, go for it.

2:25:03.740 --> 2:25:06.260
 Quickly, you travel forward in time to travel back.

2:25:06.260 --> 2:25:07.460
 Yes.

2:25:07.460 --> 2:25:09.720
 Thank you, that really clarified it.

2:25:09.720 --> 2:25:12.480
 What Sarah's saying is you don't go back in time,

2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:14.840
 you recreate what happened in the past in the future

2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:15.880
 and inspect it again.

2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:17.400
 So in that local pocket of time,

2:25:17.400 --> 2:25:19.160
 it's as if you travel back in time.

2:25:19.160 --> 2:25:20.360
 So I don't...

2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:22.280
 How is that not traveling back in time?

2:25:22.280 --> 2:25:23.120
 Because you're not going back

2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:24.860
 to your same self back in time.

2:25:24.860 --> 2:25:27.280
 You're creating that in the future.

2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:29.580
 But everything else is the same as it was in the past.

2:25:29.580 --> 2:25:32.800
 No, no, no, no, it's not in registry.

2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:35.180
 I mean, it goes back to the big question I'm saying.

2:25:35.180 --> 2:25:38.480
 I mean, this is something I was trying to look up today

2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:40.400
 when we first had this discussion

2:25:40.400 --> 2:25:42.240
 and I was talking to Sarah on Skype and said,

2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:45.920
 by the way, time is the fundamental thing in the universe.

2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:47.440
 She almost hung up on me.

2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:48.600
 Right, but you can even...

2:25:48.600 --> 2:25:51.040
 I mean, if you wanna make an analogy to computation,

2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:52.920
 and I think Charles Bennett actually has a paper on this

2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:55.100
 like about reversible computation

2:25:55.100 --> 2:25:57.000
 and reversible Turing machines.

2:25:57.000 --> 2:25:58.160
 In order to make it reversible,

2:25:58.160 --> 2:26:01.240
 you have to store memory to run the process backwards.

2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:04.560
 So time is always running forward in that

2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:05.400
 because you have to write the memory.

2:26:05.400 --> 2:26:06.640
 You can't erase the memory.

2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:08.120
 You can erase the memory,

2:26:08.120 --> 2:26:11.300
 but the point when you go back to zero, right?

2:26:11.300 --> 2:26:15.320
 But the whole point is that in order to have a process

2:26:15.320 --> 2:26:17.400
 that even runs in both directions,

2:26:17.400 --> 2:26:19.080
 you have to start talking about memory

2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:21.740
 to store the information to run it backwards.

2:26:21.740 --> 2:26:22.580
 I got it.

2:26:22.580 --> 2:26:24.640
 So you can't really then...

2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:27.080
 You can't have it exactly how it was in the past.

2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:27.920
 Yeah, exactly.

2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:30.960
 You have extra stuff, extra baggage always.

2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:31.800
 Okay.

2:26:31.800 --> 2:26:33.400
 A really important thing that I want to say on this,

2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:34.240
 I think if I try and get it right,

2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:36.480
 I have to say that if you can think

2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:38.280
 that the universe is expanding

2:26:38.280 --> 2:26:41.400
 in terms of the number of boxes

2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:44.960
 that it has to store states, right?

2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:47.240
 And this is where the directionality of the universe

2:26:47.240 --> 2:26:48.960
 comes from, everything comes from.

2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:51.140
 You could erase what's in those boxes,

2:26:51.140 --> 2:26:54.240
 but the fact you've now got so many boxes at time now

2:26:54.240 --> 2:26:56.640
 in this present, there's more of those boxes

2:26:56.640 --> 2:26:57.840
 than there were in the past.

2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:00.820
 See, but the boxes aren't physical boxes.

2:27:00.820 --> 2:27:03.440
 They're not space or time.

2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:05.720
 Why is the number of boxes always expanding?

2:27:05.720 --> 2:27:07.840
 It's very hard to imagine this

2:27:07.840 --> 2:27:09.640
 because we live in space.

2:27:09.640 --> 2:27:14.400
 So what I'm saying, which is I think probably correct,

2:27:14.400 --> 2:27:17.800
 is that we just, let's just imagine for a second,

2:27:17.800 --> 2:27:20.560
 there is a nonlocal situation,

2:27:20.560 --> 2:27:23.420
 but there are these things called states

2:27:23.420 --> 2:27:26.960
 and that the universe irrespective

2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:28.920
 of whether you measure anything,

2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:31.520
 there is a universal, let's call it a clock

2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:33.440
 or a state creator.

2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:36.480
 Maybe we can call it, that's why maybe you can call it God,

2:27:36.480 --> 2:27:37.920
 but let's call it a state creator

2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:39.540
 where the universe is expanding

2:27:39.540 --> 2:27:41.600
 in the number of states it has.

2:27:41.600 --> 2:27:43.280
 Why are you saying it's expanding though?

2:27:43.280 --> 2:27:44.680
 Is that obvious that it's expanding?

2:27:44.680 --> 2:27:46.360
 It's obvious because that's where the,

2:27:46.360 --> 2:27:49.080
 because we, we.

2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:50.300
 That's a source of novelty.

2:27:50.300 --> 2:27:51.860
 It's a source of novelty

2:27:51.860 --> 2:27:55.100
 and it also explains why the universe is not predictable.

2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:57.680
 How do you know it's not predictable?

2:27:57.680 --> 2:27:59.160
 I just like interrupting you.

2:27:59.160 --> 2:28:01.480
 Sorry, it's fun, because you're struggling.

2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:03.680
 I'm struggling because I'm trying to be

2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:06.720
 as concrete as possible and not sound like I'm insane.

2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:07.680
 Yeah.

2:28:07.680 --> 2:28:08.640
 And I'm not insane.

2:28:08.640 --> 2:28:10.520
 It's obvious because you,

2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:14.320
 I'm a chemist.

2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:17.320
 So as a chemist, I grew into the world

2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:19.440
 understanding irreversibility.

2:28:19.440 --> 2:28:21.120
 Irreversibility is all I knew.

2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:24.600
 And when people start telling me

2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:27.320
 the universe is actually reversible, it's a magic trick.

2:28:27.320 --> 2:28:28.560
 We can use time to do it.

2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:32.680
 So what I mean is that the second law

2:28:32.680 --> 2:28:37.680
 is really the magical.

2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:40.000
 But why does it need to be magical?

2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:41.560
 The universe is just asymmetric.

2:28:41.560 --> 2:28:43.680
 All I'm saying is the universe is asymmetric

2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:48.040
 in the state production and we can erase those states,

2:28:48.040 --> 2:28:50.440
 but we just have more computational power.

2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:53.520
 So what I'm saying is that the universe's

2:28:53.520 --> 2:28:55.640
 deterministic horizon,

2:28:55.640 --> 2:28:57.460
 this is one of the reasons we can't live in a simulation,

2:28:57.460 --> 2:29:01.120
 by the way, you can't live in a simulation.

2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:02.800
 The irreversibility.

2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:04.080
 Yeah, yeah, so basically every time

2:29:04.080 --> 2:29:06.120
 you try and simulate the universe,

2:29:06.120 --> 2:29:07.600
 in this, you know, I live in a simulation,

2:29:07.600 --> 2:29:09.160
 the universe is expanded in states.

2:29:09.160 --> 2:29:10.000
 You're like, oh damn it,

2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:11.320
 I need to make my computer bigger again.

2:29:11.320 --> 2:29:13.480
 And every time you try and contain the universe

2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:14.620
 in the computation,

2:29:14.620 --> 2:29:16.680
 because it's got bigger in number of states.

2:29:16.680 --> 2:29:21.360
 And so I'm saying the fact the universe has novelty in it

2:29:21.360 --> 2:29:25.280
 is going to turn out experimentally to be proof

2:29:25.280 --> 2:29:30.240
 that time, as I've labeled it, is fundamental

2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:34.960
 and exists as a physical thing that creates space.

2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:37.720
 Okay, so if you can prove that novelty

2:29:37.720 --> 2:29:39.640
 is always being created,

2:29:39.640 --> 2:29:41.920
 you're saying that it's possible to also then prove

2:29:41.920 --> 2:29:45.520
 that it's always expanding in the state space.

2:29:45.520 --> 2:29:48.200
 Those are things that have to be proven.

2:29:48.200 --> 2:29:50.000
 That's what we're working on experiments for, yeah.

2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:52.680
 And you're trying to, like by looking at the sliver

2:29:52.680 --> 2:29:56.400
 of reality, show that there's always novelty being generated.

2:29:56.400 --> 2:29:59.160
 Yeah, because if we go live in a universe

2:29:59.160 --> 2:30:01.760
 that conventional physicists would live in,

2:30:01.760 --> 2:30:05.000
 it's a big lookup table of stuff and everything exists.

2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:10.000
 I want to prove that that book doesn't exist,

2:30:10.080 --> 2:30:12.320
 it's continuously being added pages on.

2:30:12.320 --> 2:30:14.540
 So all I'm saying, if the universe is a book,

2:30:14.540 --> 2:30:17.600
 we started, the universe at the beginning only had no pages

2:30:17.600 --> 2:30:19.940
 and had one page, another page, another page.

2:30:19.940 --> 2:30:22.360
 Whereas a physicist would now say all the pages exist

2:30:22.360 --> 2:30:24.680
 and we could in principle access them.

2:30:24.680 --> 2:30:27.160
 I'm saying that is fundamentally incorrect.

2:30:27.160 --> 2:30:29.240
 Do you know what's written in this book?

2:30:29.240 --> 2:30:30.520
 The free will question.

2:30:32.200 --> 2:30:35.760
 Is there room for free will in this view

2:30:38.440 --> 2:30:40.680
 of the universe is generating novelty

2:30:40.680 --> 2:30:45.680
 and getting greater and greater assembly structures built?

2:30:45.740 --> 2:30:46.840
 Sarah.

2:30:46.840 --> 2:30:48.160
 Yes.

2:30:48.160 --> 2:30:49.000
 Okay.

2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:49.920
 Done.

2:30:49.920 --> 2:30:51.040
 Next question.

2:30:51.040 --> 2:30:53.120
 Why, what's the source of free will in this?

2:30:53.120 --> 2:30:58.120
 Well, I think it depends on what you mean by free will, but.

2:30:58.320 --> 2:31:00.640
 Yeah, well, please, there's a lot.

2:31:00.640 --> 2:31:02.500
 I think what I'm interested in

2:31:02.500 --> 2:31:06.720
 as far as the phenomena of free will is,

2:31:06.720 --> 2:31:10.560
 do we have individual autonomy and agency?

2:31:10.560 --> 2:31:13.580
 And when I do things, is it really me

2:31:13.580 --> 2:31:15.480
 or is it my atoms that did it?

2:31:16.520 --> 2:31:19.200
 And that's the part that's interesting to me.

2:31:19.200 --> 2:31:23.160
 I guess there's also the determinism versus randomness part.

2:31:23.160 --> 2:31:25.620
 But the way I think about it is like each of us

2:31:25.620 --> 2:31:30.140
 are like a thread or like an assembly space

2:31:30.140 --> 2:31:33.640
 through this giant possibility space.

2:31:33.640 --> 2:31:37.080
 And it's like we're moving on our own trajectory

2:31:37.080 --> 2:31:39.640
 through that space and that is defined by our history.

2:31:39.640 --> 2:31:42.640
 So we're sort of causally contingent on our past,

2:31:42.640 --> 2:31:46.680
 but also because of the sort of intersection

2:31:46.680 --> 2:31:50.800
 of novelty generation, it's not completely predetermined

2:31:50.800 --> 2:31:52.160
 by the past.

2:31:52.160 --> 2:31:55.840
 And so then you have the causal control

2:31:55.840 --> 2:31:59.480
 of the determinism part that you are your causal history

2:31:59.480 --> 2:32:01.580
 and there's some determinism from that past,

2:32:01.580 --> 2:32:04.480
 but there's also room for creativity.

2:32:04.480 --> 2:32:06.760
 And I think it's actually necessary

2:32:06.760 --> 2:32:08.780
 that something like free will exists

2:32:08.780 --> 2:32:11.420
 if the universe is gonna be as creative as possible.

2:32:11.420 --> 2:32:16.400
 Because if I were all intelligent being,

2:32:16.400 --> 2:32:19.960
 inventing a universe, and I wanted it to have

2:32:19.960 --> 2:32:22.520
 maximum number of interesting things happen,

2:32:22.520 --> 2:32:25.560
 again, we should come up with the metric of interesting,

2:32:25.560 --> 2:32:28.100
 but generating, yes, I know,

2:32:28.100 --> 2:32:31.840
 generating maximal possibilities,

2:32:31.840 --> 2:32:33.780
 then I would want the agents to have free will

2:32:33.780 --> 2:32:38.300
 because it means that they're more individual,

2:32:38.300 --> 2:32:41.860
 like each entity actually is a different causal force

2:32:41.860 --> 2:32:43.400
 in the universe.

2:32:43.400 --> 2:32:46.620
 And it's intrinsic and local property of that system.

2:32:46.620 --> 2:32:50.480
 There's a greater number of distributed agents?

2:32:50.480 --> 2:32:54.540
 Like are you always creating more and more individuality?

2:32:54.540 --> 2:32:56.040
 Kind of.

2:32:56.040 --> 2:32:59.000
 I would say you're creating more causal power, but.

2:32:59.000 --> 2:33:01.680
 So causal power, the word consciousness,

2:33:01.680 --> 2:33:05.200
 is the causal power somehow correlated with consciousness?

2:33:05.200 --> 2:33:07.200
 I mean, that's why I have this conception

2:33:07.200 --> 2:33:09.120
 of consciousness being related to imagination,

2:33:09.120 --> 2:33:11.320
 because the more that we can imagine can happen

2:33:11.320 --> 2:33:14.760
 and the more counterfactual possibilities you have in mind,

2:33:14.760 --> 2:33:16.280
 the more you can actually implement.

2:33:16.280 --> 2:33:18.200
 And somehow free will is also at the intersection

2:33:18.200 --> 2:33:20.400
 of the counterfactual becoming the actual.

2:33:21.440 --> 2:33:23.660
 So can you elaborate on that a little bit,

2:33:23.660 --> 2:33:25.800
 that consciousness is imagination?

2:33:25.800 --> 2:33:27.600
 I don't know exactly how to articulate it,

2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:31.360
 and I'm sure people will aim at certain things I'm saying,

2:33:31.360 --> 2:33:33.120
 but I think the language is really imprecise,

2:33:33.120 --> 2:33:35.440
 so I'm not the best way to.

2:33:35.440 --> 2:33:37.600
 It's really interesting, like what is imagination

2:33:37.600 --> 2:33:42.600
 and what role does it play in the human experience,

2:33:42.920 --> 2:33:44.520
 in the experience of any agent?

2:33:44.520 --> 2:33:46.360
 Yes, I love imagination.

2:33:46.360 --> 2:33:49.480
 I think it's like the most amazing thing we do.

2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:51.420
 But I guess one way I would think about it is,

2:33:51.420 --> 2:33:52.880
 we talked about the transition to life

2:33:52.880 --> 2:33:55.000
 being the universe acquiring memory,

2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:56.680
 and life does something really interesting.

2:33:56.680 --> 2:33:58.660
 You just think about biology generally.

2:33:58.660 --> 2:34:00.620
 It remembers states of the past to adapt

2:34:00.620 --> 2:34:01.960
 to things that happen in the future.

2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:04.760
 So the longer life has evolved on this planet,

2:34:04.760 --> 2:34:06.600
 the deeper that past is, the more memory we have,

2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:08.760
 the more kinds of organisms and things.

2:34:08.760 --> 2:34:11.540
 But what human level intelligence has done

2:34:11.540 --> 2:34:12.700
 is quite different.

2:34:12.700 --> 2:34:14.640
 It's not just that we remember states

2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:16.920
 that the universe has existed in before,

2:34:16.920 --> 2:34:19.640
 it's that we can imagine ones that have never existed,

2:34:19.640 --> 2:34:22.560
 and we can actually make them come into existence.

2:34:22.560 --> 2:34:25.240
 And I think that's the most unique feature

2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:27.520
 about the transition to whatever we are

2:34:27.520 --> 2:34:30.300
 from what life on this planet has been doing

2:34:30.300 --> 2:34:32.000
 for the last four billion years.

2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:33.760
 And I think it's deeply related to the phenomenon

2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:34.880
 we call consciousness.

2:34:34.880 --> 2:34:36.280
 Yeah, I was gonna, I mean, just agree with that.

2:34:36.280 --> 2:34:38.300
 I think that consciousness is the ability

2:34:38.300 --> 2:34:40.400
 to generate those counterfactuals.

2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:41.560
 Now, whether you can say, you know,

2:34:41.560 --> 2:34:43.080
 are there degrees of consciousness?

2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:47.740
 I mean, I'm sorry, panpsychist,

2:34:47.740 --> 2:34:49.960
 but electrons don't have counterfactuals,

2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:51.480
 although they do have some kind of,

2:34:51.480 --> 2:34:53.440
 they are able to search a space and pathways.

2:34:53.440 --> 2:34:58.140
 But I think that there is a very concrete,

2:34:58.140 --> 2:35:01.640
 or concrete, there's a very specific property

2:35:01.640 --> 2:35:05.100
 that humans have, and I don't know if it's unique to humans.

2:35:05.100 --> 2:35:09.000
 I mean, maybe dogs can do it, and birds can do it, right?

2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:11.700
 And where they are basically solving a problem,

2:35:11.700 --> 2:35:13.700
 because consciousness was invented,

2:35:13.700 --> 2:35:16.360
 or this abstraction was invented by evolution

2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:18.180
 for a specific reason.

2:35:19.280 --> 2:35:23.080
 And so look, one of the reasons why I came to the conclusion

2:35:23.080 --> 2:35:26.360
 that time was fundamental was actually because

2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:30.240
 Sarah and I had a completely different.

2:35:30.240 --> 2:35:32.520
 The most heated debate on Skype chat ever.

2:35:32.520 --> 2:35:34.200
 No, no, no, we had to, I was like.

2:35:34.200 --> 2:35:35.040
 Stop it.

2:35:35.040 --> 2:35:37.600
 No, no, it goes back to the free will thing.

2:35:37.600 --> 2:35:40.600
 So I think that, although I've changed my view a bit,

2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:42.480
 because there's some really interesting physicists

2:35:42.480 --> 2:35:45.840
 out there who talks about how the measurement problem

2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:49.280
 in Newtonian space, but I don't want to go there just now,

2:35:49.280 --> 2:35:50.400
 because I think I'll mess it up.

2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:54.760
 But briefly, I could not see how the universe,

2:35:54.760 --> 2:35:56.040
 how we can have free will.

2:35:56.040 --> 2:35:57.120
 And I mean, this is really boring,

2:35:57.120 --> 2:35:59.480
 because this is like, this is a well trodden path,

2:35:59.480 --> 2:36:01.800
 but I mean, not so boring.

2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:04.160
 I suppose it's kind of, we just want to be precise.

2:36:04.160 --> 2:36:05.920
 If the universe is deterministic,

2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:07.960
 how can we have free will, right?

2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:11.080
 So Sarah's a physicist.

2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:15.360
 I think she, not believe, can show that most of the laws

2:36:15.360 --> 2:36:17.840
 we have are deterministic to some degree.

2:36:17.840 --> 2:36:20.280
 Quantum mechanics onto Newtonian stuff.

2:36:20.280 --> 2:36:22.360
 And yet there's Sarah telling me she believes in free will.

2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:26.840
 And I'm like, your belief system's broken here, right?

2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:29.720
 Because you're demanding free will

2:36:29.720 --> 2:36:32.160
 in a deterministic universe.

2:36:32.160 --> 2:36:36.400
 And then I realized that I agreed with her

2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:39.240
 that I do think that free will is a thing

2:36:39.240 --> 2:36:41.440
 because we are able to search for novelty.

2:36:41.440 --> 2:36:43.120
 And then that's where I came to the conclusion

2:36:43.120 --> 2:36:46.400
 that time, the universe is expanding in terms of novelty.

2:36:46.400 --> 2:36:48.400
 And it goes back to that Dan Dennett essay

2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:51.200
 that we're talking about, the free will inflation.

2:36:51.200 --> 2:36:54.680
 Free will, so you have, so the past,

2:36:55.600 --> 2:36:56.840
 it did not exist in the past.

2:36:56.840 --> 2:36:58.760
 The past exists in the present.

2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:01.640
 What I mean is like, you are the, there was no past.

2:37:01.640 --> 2:37:02.760
 There is only present.

2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:05.200
 So that means you are the sum total.

2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:06.840
 Everything that's occurs in the past

2:37:06.840 --> 2:37:09.680
 is manifestly here in the present.

2:37:09.680 --> 2:37:12.640
 And then you have this little echo state

2:37:12.640 --> 2:37:14.760
 in your consciousness because you're able to,

2:37:14.760 --> 2:37:18.240
 you're able to imagine something without actualization.

2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:20.800
 But the fact you imagine it, that occurs in electrons

2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:23.720
 and potassium ion flows in your neural network

2:37:23.720 --> 2:37:24.680
 in your brain.

2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:27.280
 Maybe consciousness is just the present.

2:37:27.280 --> 2:37:31.560
 So somehow you imagine that, and then by imagining,

2:37:31.560 --> 2:37:33.280
 oh, that's good, yeah.

2:37:33.280 --> 2:37:36.280
 I'm gonna make a robot to do this thing and program it.

2:37:36.280 --> 2:37:39.040
 And then you physically then go and do it.

2:37:39.040 --> 2:37:42.080
 So that then changes the future, sorry.

2:37:42.080 --> 2:37:43.240
 What's imagination?

2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:46.000
 Does it require the past?

2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:47.680
 Does it require the future?

2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:48.880
 Does it require memory?

2:37:48.880 --> 2:37:49.720
 Does it?

2:37:49.720 --> 2:37:51.320
 It's imagination.

2:37:51.320 --> 2:37:53.080
 Does it only exist in the moment?

2:37:53.080 --> 2:37:57.120
 So imagination is, well, yeah, probably

2:37:57.120 --> 2:37:59.200
 it's an instantaneous readout of what's going on.

2:37:59.200 --> 2:38:01.320
 You can maybe, your subconscious brain

2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:03.640
 has been generating all the bits for it,

2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:07.400
 but no, imagination occurs when you,

2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:10.000
 in your game engine, you remember the past

2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:11.680
 and you integrate sensory to the present

2:38:11.680 --> 2:38:14.200
 and you try and work out what you want to do in the future.

2:38:14.200 --> 2:38:16.080
 And then you go and make that happen.

2:38:16.080 --> 2:38:19.200
 So the imagination is this, it's like, imagine,

2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:22.160
 asking what imagination is about, asking what surfing is.

2:38:22.160 --> 2:38:26.240
 You can see, you can surfboard, surfer, wave coming in.

2:38:26.240 --> 2:38:28.480
 When you're on that wave and you're surfing,

2:38:28.480 --> 2:38:31.320
 that's where the imagination is.

2:38:31.320 --> 2:38:34.160
 I think imagination is just accessing things

2:38:34.160 --> 2:38:36.120
 that aren't the present moment in the present moment.

2:38:36.120 --> 2:38:38.800
 So like I'm sitting here and I'm looking at the table

2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:43.280
 and I can imagine the river and things or whatever it was.

2:38:43.280 --> 2:38:45.680
 And so it seems to be that it's like,

2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:50.600
 it's our ability to access things that aren't present.

2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:53.880
 So conjure up worlds, some of them might be akin

2:38:53.880 --> 2:38:57.320
 to something that happened to you recently.

2:38:57.320 --> 2:38:58.960
 Right, but they don't have to be things

2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:00.680
 that actually happened in your past.

2:39:00.680 --> 2:39:02.520
 And I think this gets back to assembly theory.

2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:04.920
 Like the way I would think about imagination

2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:06.600
 from an assembly theoretic standpoint

2:39:06.600 --> 2:39:11.600
 is I'm a giant causal graph and I exist in a present moment

2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:14.040
 as a particular configuration of Sarah.

2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:18.640
 But there's a lot of, I carry a lot of evolutionary baggage.

2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:20.000
 I have that whole causal history

2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:22.360
 and I can access parts of it.

2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:24.240
 Now, when you talk about getting to something

2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:27.080
 as complex as us, having as large assembly space as us,

2:39:27.080 --> 2:39:29.680
 there's ways of, like, there's a lot of things

2:39:29.680 --> 2:39:33.560
 in that causal graph that have ever actually never existed

2:39:33.560 --> 2:39:35.440
 in the past history of the universe

2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:36.680
 because like the universe got big enough

2:39:36.680 --> 2:39:40.920
 to contain the three of us in this room in time,

2:39:40.920 --> 2:39:45.520
 but not all the features of each one of us individually

2:39:45.520 --> 2:39:48.880
 have come into existence as physical objects

2:39:48.880 --> 2:39:50.440
 we would recognize as individual objects.

2:39:50.440 --> 2:39:51.280
 This goes back to your point

2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:52.440
 that we actually have to explain

2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:56.120
 why things actually even look like objects

2:39:56.120 --> 2:39:58.720
 and aren't just a smear of mass.

2:40:00.800 --> 2:40:03.320
 And just on the free will and physics thing,

2:40:03.320 --> 2:40:05.280
 when you were talking, I was, I just wanna bring this up

2:40:05.280 --> 2:40:06.680
 because I think it's a really interesting viewpoint

2:40:06.680 --> 2:40:09.840
 that Nicholas Jisen has that, you know,

2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:11.320
 like we wanna use the laws of physics

2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:12.640
 and then say you can't have free will.

2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:15.080
 And his point is you have to have free will

2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:17.120
 in order to even choose to set up an experiment

2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:18.160
 to test the laws of physics.

2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:20.720
 So in some sense, free will should be more fundamental

2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:23.320
 than physics is because to even do science,

2:40:23.320 --> 2:40:28.320
 there's some assumption that the agents have free will.

2:40:28.320 --> 2:40:30.080
 And I always thought it was really perplexing

2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:33.960
 that, you know, physics wants to remove agency

2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:35.960
 because the idea that I could do an experiment here

2:40:35.960 --> 2:40:38.160
 on this part of earth and then I can move somewhere else

2:40:38.160 --> 2:40:39.880
 and prepare an identically, you know,

2:40:39.880 --> 2:40:43.040
 identically prepared experiment, run an experiment again,

2:40:43.040 --> 2:40:45.680
 seems to imply something about the structure of our universe

2:40:45.680 --> 2:40:47.200
 that is not encoded in the laws

2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:49.800
 that we're testing in those experiments.

2:40:49.800 --> 2:40:51.400
 So this kind of dream of physics

2:40:51.400 --> 2:40:53.600
 that you can do multiple experiments, different locations

2:40:53.600 --> 2:40:55.760
 and then validate each other,

2:40:55.760 --> 2:40:59.160
 you're saying that's an illusion?

2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:01.840
 No, I'm saying that requires decision making

2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:04.120
 and free will to be a real thing, I think.

2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:06.200
 Like I think the fact that we can do science

2:41:06.200 --> 2:41:08.000
 is not arbitrary.

2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:09.880
 And I think people, you know,

2:41:09.880 --> 2:41:11.680
 the standard canon in physics would be,

2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:12.920
 well, you could trace all of that back

2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:14.240
 to the initial condition of the universe,

2:41:14.240 --> 2:41:16.040
 but the whole point of science is

2:41:16.040 --> 2:41:18.360
 I can imagine doing the experiment and I can do it

2:41:18.360 --> 2:41:19.720
 and then I can do it again and again and again

2:41:19.720 --> 2:41:20.640
 all over the planet.

2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:23.000
 To you, imagination is somehow fundamentally

2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:25.120
 generative of novelty.

2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:25.960
 Yes.

2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:27.600
 So it's not like the universe could have predicted

2:41:27.600 --> 2:41:28.880
 the things you imagined.

2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:31.240
 Imagination, so coming back to novelty,

2:41:31.240 --> 2:41:33.480
 I think novelty can exist outside of imagination,

2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:36.320
 but it supercharges it, it's another transition, I think.

2:41:36.320 --> 2:41:37.640
 I mean, I would say,

2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:39.040
 I mean, this may be a boring statement,

2:41:39.040 --> 2:41:40.760
 but I would say the fact that, sorry?

2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:42.680
 I'm not sure, these are hard questions.

2:41:42.680 --> 2:41:45.000
 Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that objects exist

2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:48.440
 is yet another proof that time is fundamental

2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:50.480
 and novelty exists, right?

2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:53.000
 Because I think, again, if you ask a physicist

2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:55.600
 to write down in their infinite Bible of the universe,

2:41:55.600 --> 2:41:58.200
 let's call it the Bible, the Mac, you know.

2:41:58.200 --> 2:41:59.040
 The book.

2:41:59.040 --> 2:42:01.600
 Yeah, well, I mean, the mathematical universe,

2:42:01.600 --> 2:42:03.880
 whether you're Max Tegmark or Sean Carroll

2:42:03.880 --> 2:42:05.120
 or Frank Wilczek.

2:42:08.440 --> 2:42:11.320
 Or Stephen Wolfram, okay?

2:42:11.320 --> 2:42:12.160
 I like that book.

2:42:12.160 --> 2:42:13.360
 Yeah, I love it too.

2:42:13.360 --> 2:42:15.080
 It's lots of pretty pictures.

2:42:15.080 --> 2:42:18.240
 It's really interesting that they cope with the enormity

2:42:18.240 --> 2:42:19.320
 of the universe by saying,

2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:22.080
 well, it's all there, mathematics, it all exists, right?

2:42:22.080 --> 2:42:25.360
 And I would say that that's why I'm excited

2:42:25.360 --> 2:42:26.480
 about the future of the universe

2:42:26.480 --> 2:42:31.400
 because although it is somehow dependent upon the past,

2:42:31.400 --> 2:42:35.700
 it is not constrained just by the past,

2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:38.680
 which is kind of mad.

2:42:38.680 --> 2:42:40.880
 Yeah, that's what free will is.

2:42:40.880 --> 2:42:42.520
 It's not constrained by the past.

2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:44.400
 It's dependent on the past.

2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:46.440
 This moment, it's not just dependent,

2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:48.240
 this moment is the past,

2:42:48.240 --> 2:42:49.600
 and yet it has the capacity

2:42:49.600 --> 2:42:52.960
 to generate a totally unpredictable future.

2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:54.040
 I mean, the other thing I would say

2:42:54.040 --> 2:42:56.360
 that's super important for human beings, right?

2:42:56.360 --> 2:42:59.200
 Human beings have actually very little causal control

2:42:59.200 --> 2:43:00.680
 in the future.

2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:02.280
 I realized this the other week.

2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:03.440
 Oh, the immediate future immediately.

2:43:03.440 --> 2:43:04.920
 Yeah, yeah, so what happened,

2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:06.220
 so this is what I think it is.

2:43:06.220 --> 2:43:09.160
 The way, by reinterpreting your past,

2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:11.320
 I mean, talk about from a kind of cognitive,

2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:13.060
 psychological cognitive point of view,

2:43:13.060 --> 2:43:17.880
 by reinterpreting your past in your current mind,

2:43:17.880 --> 2:43:21.280
 you could actually help you shape your future again.

2:43:21.280 --> 2:43:25.280
 So you have much more freedom to interpret your past,

2:43:25.280 --> 2:43:28.220
 to act in the present, to change your future,

2:43:28.220 --> 2:43:29.560
 than you do to change your future.

2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:31.720
 It may sound weird, so I'm saying to everybody,

2:43:31.720 --> 2:43:33.820
 imagine your past, think about your past,

2:43:33.820 --> 2:43:37.520
 reinterpret your past in the nicest way you can,

2:43:37.520 --> 2:43:39.400
 then imagine what you can do next,

2:43:39.400 --> 2:43:41.240
 or imagine your past in a more negative way

2:43:41.240 --> 2:43:42.060
 and what you do next,

2:43:42.060 --> 2:43:45.160
 and look at those two counterfactuals, they're different.

2:43:45.160 --> 2:43:46.000
 Yeah, it's fascinating.

2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:47.120
 I mean, Daniel Kahneman talks about this

2:43:47.120 --> 2:43:49.600
 that most of our life is lived in our memories.

2:43:49.600 --> 2:43:51.560
 It's interesting, because you can essentially,

2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:53.880
 in imagination, choose the life you live.

2:43:53.880 --> 2:43:56.680
 So maybe free will exists in imagination.

2:43:57.560 --> 2:44:00.400
 Choices are made in your imagination,

2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:03.640
 and that results in you basically able to control

2:44:03.640 --> 2:44:06.920
 how the future unrolls, because you're like,

2:44:06.920 --> 2:44:10.160
 imagining, like reinterpreting constantly

2:44:10.160 --> 2:44:11.440
 the things that happen to you.

2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:13.680
 Exactly, so if you want to increase

2:44:13.680 --> 2:44:16.400
 your amount of free will, those people that have,

2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:18.720
 I don't think everyone has equal amounts of agency,

2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:22.480
 because of our sad constraints,

2:44:22.480 --> 2:44:26.580
 where they're happenstance, health, economic,

2:44:26.580 --> 2:44:29.280
 born in a certain place, right?

2:44:29.280 --> 2:44:33.080
 But those of us that have the ability to go back

2:44:33.080 --> 2:44:38.040
 and reinterpret our past and use that to change the future

2:44:38.040 --> 2:44:42.040
 are the ones that exert most agency in the present,

2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:47.040
 and I want to achieve higher degrees of agency

2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:49.280
 and enable everyone else to do that as well,

2:44:49.280 --> 2:44:51.960
 to have more fun in the universe.

2:44:51.960 --> 2:44:54.400
 Then we'll hit that peak, the maximum fun point.

2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:56.520
 I don't think there's ever gonna be a maximum,

2:44:56.520 --> 2:44:58.800
 I think the wonderful thing about the future

2:44:58.800 --> 2:45:00.420
 is there's always gonna be more fun.

2:45:00.420 --> 2:45:04.720
 Yeah, you, I think, again, going back to Twitter,

2:45:04.720 --> 2:45:06.920
 I think you, Lee, tweeted something

2:45:06.920 --> 2:45:08.520
 about being a life maximalist,

2:45:08.520 --> 2:45:10.880
 that you want to maximize the number of life,

2:45:10.880 --> 2:45:13.560
 the amount of life in the universe, so,

2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:18.480
 and that's the more general version of that goal,

2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:20.440
 is to maximize the amount of fun in the universe,

2:45:20.440 --> 2:45:23.080
 because life is a subset of fun, there are all kinds of,

2:45:23.080 --> 2:45:25.960
 I suppose they're either correlated or exactly equal,

2:45:25.960 --> 2:45:27.000
 I don't know.

2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:28.760
 Anyway, speaking of fun,

2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:30.980
 let me ask you about alien sightings.

2:45:32.260 --> 2:45:34.320
 So there's been quite a bit of UFO sightings

2:45:34.320 --> 2:45:36.160
 and all that kind of stuff.

2:45:36.160 --> 2:45:41.160
 What do you think would be the first time

2:45:41.540 --> 2:45:45.220
 when humans sight aliens, see aliens,

2:45:45.220 --> 2:45:48.300
 in a sort of unquestionable way?

2:45:49.360 --> 2:45:52.680
 This extremely strong and arguable way

2:45:54.240 --> 2:45:56.980
 we've made contact with aliens.

2:45:56.980 --> 2:45:59.040
 Sarah, what would it look like?

2:45:59.040 --> 2:46:03.080
 Obviously, the space of possibilities is huge here,

2:46:03.080 --> 2:46:06.240
 but if you were to kind of look into the future,

2:46:06.240 --> 2:46:07.200
 what would that look like?

2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:10.280
 Would it be inklings of UFOs here and there

2:46:10.280 --> 2:46:13.600
 that slowly unravel a mystery?

2:46:13.600 --> 2:46:18.600
 Or would it be like an obvious, overwhelming signal?

2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:20.800
 So I think we have an obsession

2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:23.120
 with making contact with events.

2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:26.520
 So what do I mean by that is,

2:46:26.520 --> 2:46:29.080
 like people have a UFO sighting, they make contact.

2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:32.480
 And I always think, you know,

2:46:32.480 --> 2:46:36.680
 what's interesting to me about the UFO narratives right now

2:46:36.680 --> 2:46:38.160
 is not that I have a disbelief

2:46:38.160 --> 2:46:40.640
 about what people are experiencing or feeling,

2:46:40.640 --> 2:46:42.240
 but like the discussion right now

2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:45.160
 is sort of at the level of modern mythology.

2:46:45.160 --> 2:46:48.720
 Aliens are our mythos in modern culture.

2:46:48.720 --> 2:46:50.460
 And when you treat it like that,

2:46:50.460 --> 2:46:54.180
 then I wanna think about when do things

2:46:54.180 --> 2:46:57.960
 that we traditionally only regularize through mythology

2:46:57.960 --> 2:47:00.240
 actually become things that become standard knowledge?

2:47:00.240 --> 2:47:02.800
 So, you know, like it used to be, you know,

2:47:02.800 --> 2:47:04.560
 variations in the climate were described

2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:05.840
 by some kind of gods or something.

2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:06.840
 And now it's like, you know,

2:47:06.840 --> 2:47:08.560
 our technology picks up an anomaly

2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:11.160
 or someone sees something, we say it's aliens.

2:47:11.160 --> 2:47:15.160
 And I think the real thing is it's not contact with events,

2:47:15.160 --> 2:47:17.240
 but like first contact is actually contact

2:47:17.240 --> 2:47:19.960
 with knowledge of the phenomenon or the explanation.

2:47:19.960 --> 2:47:23.060
 And so this is very subtle and very abstract,

2:47:23.060 --> 2:47:25.040
 but when does it become something

2:47:25.040 --> 2:47:27.240
 that we actually understand what it is

2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:28.280
 that we're talking about?

2:47:28.280 --> 2:47:29.400
 That's first contact.

2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:30.240
 It's not.

2:47:30.240 --> 2:47:31.400
 Would you make the myth,

2:47:31.400 --> 2:47:33.120
 would you give credit to the myth,

2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:35.760
 the mythology as first contact?

2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:36.600
 Cause you might.

2:47:36.600 --> 2:47:37.420
 I think, yes.

2:47:37.420 --> 2:47:38.480
 I think it's the rudimentary

2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:40.800
 that we have some understanding that there's a phenomenon

2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:42.920
 that we have to understand and regularize.

2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:43.760
 So I think.

2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:45.280
 Right, to understand that there is weather.

2:47:45.280 --> 2:47:46.120
 Yes.

2:47:46.120 --> 2:47:47.760
 You have to construct a pathology around that weather.

2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:48.600
 Yes, yes.

2:47:48.600 --> 2:47:50.800
 It's something that's controllable.

2:47:50.800 --> 2:47:51.640
 Right.

2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:54.940
 I see mythology basically as like baby knowledge.

2:47:54.940 --> 2:47:56.380
 Right, right.

2:47:56.380 --> 2:47:57.980
 It could be that, you know,

2:47:57.980 --> 2:48:01.060
 although there's lots of alien sight,

2:48:01.060 --> 2:48:03.180
 so called alien sightings, right?

2:48:03.180 --> 2:48:04.380
 So there is a number of things you can do.

2:48:04.380 --> 2:48:06.020
 You could just dismiss them and say they're not true.

2:48:06.020 --> 2:48:07.460
 They're kind of made up.

2:48:07.460 --> 2:48:09.740
 Or you say, well, there's something interesting here, right?

2:48:09.740 --> 2:48:11.660
 We keep seeing a commonality, right?

2:48:11.660 --> 2:48:14.300
 We see the same phenomenon again and again and again.

2:48:14.300 --> 2:48:15.460
 Also, there's this interesting thing

2:48:15.460 --> 2:48:17.320
 about human imagination.

2:48:17.320 --> 2:48:20.040
 Even if they are, let's not say made up,

2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:23.760
 but misappropriated kind of other inputs,

2:48:23.760 --> 2:48:25.640
 the fact that human consciousness

2:48:25.640 --> 2:48:29.260
 is capable of imagining a contact with aliens.

2:48:29.260 --> 2:48:30.660
 Does that not tell us about something

2:48:30.660 --> 2:48:32.100
 about where we are in our position,

2:48:32.100 --> 2:48:33.980
 in our culture, in our technology?

2:48:33.980 --> 2:48:35.380
 It tells us about where in time we are.

2:48:35.380 --> 2:48:37.940
 Could it be that we're making contact with,

2:48:37.940 --> 2:48:39.860
 let's say that, so let's say,

2:48:39.860 --> 2:48:41.500
 let's take the most miserable version.

2:48:41.500 --> 2:48:42.660
 There are no aliens in the universe.

2:48:42.660 --> 2:48:44.640
 Life is only on Earth.

2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:46.220
 That then, the interpretation of that

2:48:46.220 --> 2:48:48.140
 is we're desperate to kind of understand

2:48:48.140 --> 2:48:50.520
 why we're the only life in the universe, right?

2:48:50.520 --> 2:48:51.860
 The other one is the other most extreme

2:48:51.860 --> 2:48:53.380
 is that aliens are visiting all the time.

2:48:53.380 --> 2:48:57.100
 We're just not able to capture them coherently,

2:48:57.100 --> 2:48:59.940
 or there's a big conspiracy and there's Area 51

2:48:59.940 --> 2:49:03.060
 and there are lizards everywhere and there's that.

2:49:04.060 --> 2:49:06.180
 Or I'm kind of in favor of the idea

2:49:06.180 --> 2:49:08.380
 that maybe humanity is waking up to the idea

2:49:08.380 --> 2:49:09.740
 that we aren't alone in the universe

2:49:09.740 --> 2:49:12.100
 and we're just running the simulation

2:49:12.100 --> 2:49:14.660
 and we're seeing some evidence.

2:49:14.660 --> 2:49:17.020
 We don't know what life is yet.

2:49:17.020 --> 2:49:19.740
 We do have some anomalies out there.

2:49:19.740 --> 2:49:21.240
 We can't explain everything.

2:49:21.240 --> 2:49:26.240
 And over time, you know, we will start to unpack that.

2:49:28.560 --> 2:49:30.920
 One very plausible thing we might do,

2:49:30.920 --> 2:49:35.920
 which might be boring for the average alien observer

2:49:35.920 --> 2:49:37.400
 or believes that aliens are,

2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:39.640
 as in intelligent aliens are visiting Earth,

2:49:39.640 --> 2:49:42.680
 it could be that we might go to the outer solar system

2:49:42.680 --> 2:49:44.400
 and find a new type of life

2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:46.600
 that has completely new chemistry,

2:49:46.600 --> 2:49:48.560
 bring these cells back to Earth,

2:49:48.560 --> 2:49:49.880
 where you could say in my hand,

2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:52.840
 on Earth, here's RNA, DNA, and proteins,

2:49:52.840 --> 2:49:54.900
 and look, cells self replicate.

2:49:54.900 --> 2:49:57.440
 From Titan, we got this new set of molecules,

2:49:57.440 --> 2:50:01.340
 new set of cells, and we feed it stuff and it grows.

2:50:01.340 --> 2:50:04.000
 That for me, if we were able to do that,

2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:07.560
 which would be like the most,

2:50:07.560 --> 2:50:09.120
 that would be my UFO sign.

2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:10.000
 That's a good test.

2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.560
 So you feed it and it grows.

2:50:12.560 --> 2:50:13.400
 Yeah.

2:50:13.400 --> 2:50:18.400
 We've made, so not until you know how to feed the thing,

2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:22.680
 it grows somehow.

2:50:22.680 --> 2:50:23.800
 We can make a comic book, you know,

2:50:23.800 --> 2:50:26.400
 the tiger that came for tea, the alien that came for tea.

2:50:26.400 --> 2:50:30.760
 What would you say is between the two of you

2:50:30.760 --> 2:50:34.920
 is the biggest disagreement about alien life out there?

2:50:35.880 --> 2:50:39.160
 Is it from the basic framework of thinking about

2:50:39.160 --> 2:50:41.960
 what is life to maybe what aliens look like

2:50:41.960 --> 2:50:45.840
 to alien civilizations, to UFO sightings?

2:50:45.840 --> 2:50:47.360
 What would you think?

2:50:47.360 --> 2:50:50.040
 So I would say the biggest one is that

2:50:50.040 --> 2:50:53.340
 the emergence of life does not have to be,

2:50:55.040 --> 2:50:57.480
 that it can't just happen once on the planet,

2:50:57.480 --> 2:50:59.480
 that it could be two or more life forms

2:50:59.480 --> 2:51:01.360
 present on the planet at once.

2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:03.520
 And I think Sarah doesn't agree with that.

2:51:03.520 --> 2:51:07.680
 I think that's like logically inconsistent.

2:51:07.680 --> 2:51:08.600
 That's really polite.

2:51:08.600 --> 2:51:10.560
 You're saying it's nonsense.

2:51:10.560 --> 2:51:11.400
 Because you think that, yeah.

2:51:11.400 --> 2:51:12.880
 So likely is that, so the idea that,

2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:14.720
 what does it look like?

2:51:14.720 --> 2:51:18.160
 Let's imagine two alien civilizations

2:51:18.160 --> 2:51:19.480
 coexisting on a planet.

2:51:19.480 --> 2:51:21.240
 What's that look like exactly?

2:51:21.240 --> 2:51:26.240
 So I would say, I think I've got to get around your argument.

2:51:26.240 --> 2:51:28.480
 Yeah, let's say that on this planet,

2:51:28.480 --> 2:51:31.760
 there's just like, there's lots of available chemistry

2:51:31.760 --> 2:51:35.600
 and one life form gets some emerges based on carbon

2:51:35.600 --> 2:51:38.720
 and interacts and there's an ecosystem based on carbon.

2:51:38.720 --> 2:51:43.440
 And there's an orthogonal, and so it's planetary phenomena,

2:51:43.440 --> 2:51:45.200
 which is what you, I think, right?

2:51:45.200 --> 2:51:47.600
 But there's also one that carries on silicon.

2:51:47.600 --> 2:51:52.140
 And because there's enough energy and there's enough stuff,

2:51:52.140 --> 2:51:54.360
 that these life forms might not actually

2:51:54.360 --> 2:51:58.000
 necessarily compete evolutionarily.

2:51:58.000 --> 2:51:59.880
 Yeah, but they would have to not interact at all

2:51:59.880 --> 2:52:01.480
 because they're going to be co constructing

2:52:01.480 --> 2:52:02.720
 each other's causal chains.

2:52:02.720 --> 2:52:04.000
 I think that's what you just got me, yeah.

2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:09.000
 So there's no overlap in terms of their causal chains

2:52:09.200 --> 2:52:10.240
 or a very limited overlap.

2:52:10.240 --> 2:52:12.080
 Yeah, so I think the only way I can get away with that

2:52:12.080 --> 2:52:15.400
 is to say, right, life can emerge on a planet underneath.

2:52:15.400 --> 2:52:16.240
 And, okay.

2:52:16.240 --> 2:52:18.680
 The lizard people under the crust of the earth.

2:52:18.680 --> 2:52:21.200
 I think, I think, I think we, let's go to,

2:52:21.200 --> 2:52:24.400
 I think, but look, as you can see, we disagree.

2:52:24.400 --> 2:52:27.020
 So, and I think Sarah actually has convinced me

2:52:27.020 --> 2:52:30.240
 because of the life is a planetary,

2:52:30.240 --> 2:52:32.260
 the emergence of life is a planetary phenomena.

2:52:32.260 --> 2:52:36.880
 And actually, because of the way evolution selection works,

2:52:36.880 --> 2:52:38.180
 then nothing occurs in isolation.

2:52:38.180 --> 2:52:39.360
 The causal chains interact.

2:52:39.360 --> 2:52:41.640
 So there is a common, there's a consensus model

2:52:41.640 --> 2:52:42.560
 for life on the earth.

2:52:42.560 --> 2:52:47.160
 But you don't think you can place aliens from elsewhere

2:52:47.160 --> 2:52:51.480
 onto the, can't you just place multiple alien civilizations

2:52:51.480 --> 2:52:52.320
 on one planet?

2:52:52.320 --> 2:52:56.840
 Right, but I think, so you can take two origin life events

2:52:56.840 --> 2:52:59.080
 that were independent and co mingle them.

2:52:59.080 --> 2:53:03.920
 But I don't think when you're talking about, when you,

2:53:03.920 --> 2:53:06.040
 when you look at the interaction of that structure,

2:53:06.040 --> 2:53:10.100
 it's like the same idea as like an experiment

2:53:10.100 --> 2:53:11.520
 being an example of life, right?

2:53:11.520 --> 2:53:13.760
 That's a really abstract and subtle concept.

2:53:13.760 --> 2:53:16.920
 And I guess what I'm saying is life is information

2:53:16.920 --> 2:53:18.240
 propagating through matter.

2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:21.200
 So once you start having things interacting,

2:53:21.200 --> 2:53:24.200
 they in some sense co mingle and they become part

2:53:24.200 --> 2:53:27.000
 of the same chain.

2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:30.680
 So the co mingling starts quickly, proceeds,

2:53:30.680 --> 2:53:32.360
 we proceed to co mingle quickly.

2:53:32.360 --> 2:53:36.560
 Right, right, so you could say, so the question is then,

2:53:36.560 --> 2:53:37.920
 the more interesting question is,

2:53:37.920 --> 2:53:39.840
 are there two distinct origins events?

2:53:39.840 --> 2:53:41.840
 And I still think that there's reasons that

2:53:41.840 --> 2:53:44.700
 on a single planet, you would have one origins event

2:53:44.700 --> 2:53:49.000
 because of the timescales of cycling of geochemistry

2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:51.140
 on a planet and also the fact that I don't think

2:53:51.140 --> 2:53:53.320
 that the origin of life happens in a pool

2:53:53.320 --> 2:53:56.060
 and like radiates outward through evolutionary processes.

2:53:56.060 --> 2:53:58.160
 I think it's a multi scale phenomenon happens

2:53:58.160 --> 2:54:00.520
 at the level of individual molecules interacting,

2:54:00.520 --> 2:54:02.120
 collections of molecules interacting

2:54:02.120 --> 2:54:04.160
 and entire planetary scale cycles.

2:54:04.160 --> 2:54:07.960
 So life as we know it has always been multi scale

2:54:07.960 --> 2:54:11.600
 and there's brilliant examples of individual mutations

2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:14.380
 at the genome level changing global climate, right?

2:54:14.380 --> 2:54:17.920
 So there's a tight coupling between things that happen

2:54:17.920 --> 2:54:21.840
 at the largest scale, our planetary scale

2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:24.200
 and the smallest scale that life mediates.

2:54:24.200 --> 2:54:26.720
 But it still might be difficult within something

2:54:26.720 --> 2:54:29.720
 you would call as a single alien civilization.

2:54:29.720 --> 2:54:31.920
 You know, there's species and stuff.

2:54:31.920 --> 2:54:34.320
 And they might not be able to communicate.

2:54:34.320 --> 2:54:36.880
 But you're asking about life, not species, right?

2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:41.880
 What's the difference between one living civilization?

2:54:43.080 --> 2:54:45.960
 This is almost like a category question.

2:54:45.960 --> 2:54:49.080
 Versus species, because it can be very different.

2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:53.200
 Because there's like literally islands

2:54:53.200 --> 2:54:55.680
 that you can evolve different kinds of turtles and stuff.

2:54:55.680 --> 2:54:57.120
 And they can.

2:54:57.120 --> 2:54:59.240
 So I guess what I'm saying is weird.

2:54:59.240 --> 2:55:00.520
 If you look at the structure

2:55:00.520 --> 2:55:05.440
 of two interacting living things, populations,

2:55:05.440 --> 2:55:07.000
 and you look in their past

2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:10.160
 and they have independent origins for their causal chain,

2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:12.080
 then you would say one was alien.

2:55:12.080 --> 2:55:14.920
 You know, they have different independent origins events.

2:55:14.920 --> 2:55:15.960
 But if you look at their future

2:55:15.960 --> 2:55:18.200
 by virtue of the fact they're interacting,

2:55:18.200 --> 2:55:20.160
 their causal chains have become commingled.

2:55:20.160 --> 2:55:24.500
 So then in the future, they are not independent.

2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:28.480
 So that's why you would even define them as alien.

2:55:28.480 --> 2:55:32.520
 So the structure across time is two examples of life

2:55:32.520 --> 2:55:33.720
 become one example of life

2:55:33.720 --> 2:55:36.320
 because life is the entire structure across time.

2:55:36.320 --> 2:55:39.320
 Right, but there could be a lot of variation within.

2:55:39.320 --> 2:55:41.160
 Yeah, so the question we're all interested in

2:55:41.160 --> 2:55:44.240
 is how many independent origins

2:55:44.240 --> 2:55:48.920
 of a complexifying causal chain are there in the universe?

2:55:48.920 --> 2:55:53.920
 See, but the idea of origin is easy for you to define?

2:55:55.160 --> 2:55:58.760
 Because like, when the species split

2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:00.640
 in the evolutionary process,

2:56:00.640 --> 2:56:05.640
 and you get like a dolphin versus a human

2:56:06.280 --> 2:56:10.520
 or a Neanderthal versus Homo sapiens, isn't there?

2:56:10.520 --> 2:56:12.880
 Let me make a distinction here quickly.

2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:16.160
 So I think, sorry to interrupt.

2:56:16.160 --> 2:56:20.080
 What we're saying, I mean, Sarah won that argument

2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:21.200
 because I think she's right,

2:56:21.200 --> 2:56:24.400
 that once the causal chains interact and going forward,

2:56:24.400 --> 2:56:25.800
 so we're talking about a number of things.

2:56:25.800 --> 2:56:27.720
 Let's go all the way back before origin of life.

2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:28.600
 Origin of life.

2:56:28.600 --> 2:56:29.440
 On Earth.

2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:30.360
 On Earth.

2:56:30.360 --> 2:56:32.640
 Chemistry emerges, so there's all these,

2:56:32.640 --> 2:56:35.400
 I would say there's probably mechanistically,

2:56:35.400 --> 2:56:37.040
 the chemistry is desperately trying to find any way

2:56:37.040 --> 2:56:38.440
 to get replicators.

2:56:38.440 --> 2:56:41.600
 The ribosome kind of was really rubbish at the beginning

2:56:41.600 --> 2:56:42.920
 and they just competed, competed, competed,

2:56:42.920 --> 2:56:44.040
 and you got better and better ribosome.

2:56:44.040 --> 2:56:46.280
 Suddenly that was a technology.

2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:48.880
 The ribosome is the technology that, boom,

2:56:48.880 --> 2:56:51.520
 allowed evolution to start.

2:56:51.520 --> 2:56:53.960
 So what I was trying to, why I interrupted you,

2:56:53.960 --> 2:56:55.960
 is say that once evolution has started

2:56:55.960 --> 2:57:00.240
 using that technology, then you can speciate.

2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:03.160
 And I was trying to, and I think what Sarah said

2:57:03.160 --> 2:57:05.560
 was, convinced me of, because I was like, no,

2:57:05.560 --> 2:57:06.840
 we're gonna have lots of different chemistry,

2:57:06.840 --> 2:57:09.600
 shadow biosphere on Earth, and she's like, no, no, no.

2:57:09.600 --> 2:57:11.960
 You have to have this, you have to get to this

2:57:11.960 --> 2:57:16.280
 minimum evolutionary machine.

2:57:16.280 --> 2:57:18.440
 And then when that occurs, speciation occurs.

2:57:18.440 --> 2:57:21.360
 Exactly what it's like, dolphins, humans,

2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:22.640
 everything on Earth.

2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:26.160
 But when you're looking at aliens or alien life,

2:57:27.240 --> 2:57:28.800
 there's not gonna be two different types of chemistry

2:57:28.800 --> 2:57:31.720
 because they compete and interact and cooperate

2:57:31.720 --> 2:57:33.200
 because the causal chains overlap.

2:57:33.200 --> 2:57:35.480
 One might kill the other, one might combine with the other,

2:57:35.480 --> 2:57:40.000
 and then you go on and then you have this average.

2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:42.000
 And sure, there might be respeciation.

2:57:42.000 --> 2:57:44.520
 It might have two types of emerging chemistry.

2:57:44.520 --> 2:57:46.760
 It almost looks like the origin of life on Earth

2:57:46.760 --> 2:57:50.120
 required two different prelife forms,

2:57:50.120 --> 2:57:52.380
 the peptide world and the RNA world.

2:57:52.380 --> 2:57:55.600
 Somehow they got together, and by combining,

2:57:55.600 --> 2:57:56.720
 you got the ribosome.

2:57:56.720 --> 2:58:00.200
 And that was the minimum competent entity for evolution.

2:58:00.200 --> 2:58:03.060
 And would all alien civilizations

2:58:03.060 --> 2:58:06.800
 have an evolutionary process on a planet?

2:58:06.800 --> 2:58:10.480
 So it's almost the definition of life.

2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:14.120
 To create all those memories, you have to have something.

2:58:14.120 --> 2:58:15.800
 Things have to change in time.

2:58:15.800 --> 2:58:17.600
 But there has to be selection.

2:58:19.620 --> 2:58:22.200
 That's like an efficient, there's no other way to do it.

2:58:22.200 --> 2:58:25.000
 No, well, never say never, because soon as I say that.

2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:26.760
 That's the part that depresses me, though,

2:58:26.760 --> 2:58:29.920
 going back to the earlier discussion on violence

2:58:29.920 --> 2:58:32.400
 and things, and I don't know where,

2:58:32.400 --> 2:58:34.020
 somebody was tweeting about this recently,

2:58:34.020 --> 2:58:37.360
 but how much death had to die.

2:58:37.360 --> 2:58:38.420
 Maybe it was you.

2:58:38.420 --> 2:58:39.260
 Yeah.

2:58:39.260 --> 2:58:40.080
 Ah, yeah.

2:58:40.080 --> 2:58:41.720
 So, yeah, sorry.

2:58:41.720 --> 2:58:43.460
 We're talking about life.

2:58:43.460 --> 2:58:44.300
 Yeah.

2:58:44.300 --> 2:58:48.480
 And I guess a lot of murder had to occur.

2:58:48.480 --> 2:58:51.720
 Right, so selection means things had to be weeded out,

2:58:51.720 --> 2:58:52.680
 right, so.

2:58:52.680 --> 2:58:53.920
 Well, we can celebrate that.

2:58:53.920 --> 2:58:55.400
 Death makes way for a tulip.

2:58:55.400 --> 2:58:58.860
 Yeah, I mean, and also one of the most interesting features

2:58:58.860 --> 2:59:01.760
 of major extinction events in the history of our planet

2:59:01.760 --> 2:59:05.960
 is how much novelty emerged immediately after, right?

2:59:05.960 --> 2:59:08.300
 So, and of course, a lot of people make arguments

2:59:08.300 --> 2:59:10.780
 we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs didn't go extinct.

2:59:10.780 --> 2:59:15.600
 So, in some ways, we can attribute our existence

2:59:15.600 --> 2:59:16.640
 to all of that.

2:59:16.640 --> 2:59:19.320
 But I guess I was just wondering and sort of like,

2:59:19.320 --> 2:59:22.720
 if I was gonna build a universe myself

2:59:22.720 --> 2:59:25.040
 in the most optimistic way, would I retain that feature?

2:59:25.040 --> 2:59:25.880
 But it does seem to be a universe.

2:59:25.880 --> 2:59:26.840
 I think you have to.

2:59:26.840 --> 2:59:28.960
 I mean, I think we're probably being

2:59:28.960 --> 2:59:31.320
 over anthropomorphizing.

2:59:31.320 --> 2:59:32.880
 I remember watching the blue,

2:59:32.880 --> 2:59:33.880
 I think it was the blue planet,

2:59:33.880 --> 2:59:35.320
 David Attenborough was showing these seals

2:59:35.320 --> 2:59:36.520
 and because of climate change,

2:59:36.520 --> 2:59:38.640
 some seals were falling off a cliff.

2:59:38.640 --> 2:59:39.560
 And how tragic that was.

2:59:39.560 --> 2:59:43.040
 I was like, I'm saying my son, that's pretty cool.

2:59:43.040 --> 2:59:44.360
 Look at those ones down there.

2:59:44.360 --> 2:59:46.180
 They've obviously got some kind of mutations,

2:59:46.180 --> 2:59:48.040
 some and they're not doing that Darth thing.

2:59:48.040 --> 2:59:51.320
 And so that poor gene will be weeded out.

2:59:51.320 --> 2:59:54.800
 Of course, at the individual level, it looks tragic.

2:59:54.800 --> 2:59:56.320
 And of course, as human beings have the ability

2:59:56.320 --> 2:59:57.920
 to abstract and we empathize,

2:59:57.920 --> 3:00:00.040
 we don't wanna cause suffering on other human beings

3:00:00.040 --> 3:00:01.520
 and we should retain that.

3:00:01.520 --> 3:00:03.400
 But we shouldn't look back in time

3:00:03.400 --> 3:00:08.400
 and say, how many butterflies had to die?

3:00:08.480 --> 3:00:10.000
 I remember making this,

3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:13.280
 how many, if you think about the caterpillar

3:00:13.280 --> 3:00:16.120
 become the chrysalis and then the butterfly getting out,

3:00:16.120 --> 3:00:18.820
 how many, if that suffering, we call it suffering,

3:00:18.820 --> 3:00:21.740
 if that process of pruning had not occurred,

3:00:21.740 --> 3:00:22.940
 we have no butterflies.

3:00:22.940 --> 3:00:25.360
 So none of the butterfly beauty in the world

3:00:25.360 --> 3:00:26.720
 without all that pruning.

3:00:26.720 --> 3:00:28.880
 So pruning is required,

3:00:28.880 --> 3:00:30.280
 but we shouldn't anthropomorphize

3:00:30.280 --> 3:00:32.640
 and feel sorry for the biological entities,

3:00:33.600 --> 3:00:36.920
 because that seems to be a backwards way of looking at it.

3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:38.880
 What we should do is project forward

3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:42.600
 and maybe think about what values we have across our species

3:00:42.600 --> 3:00:45.080
 and our ecosystem and our fellow human beings.

3:00:45.080 --> 3:00:47.840
 You know, now that we know that animals suffer

3:00:47.840 --> 3:00:51.320
 at some level, think about humane farming.

3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:53.160
 When we find that plants can, in fact,

3:00:53.160 --> 3:00:55.200
 are conscious and can think and have pain,

3:00:55.200 --> 3:00:58.520
 then we'll do humane gardening.

3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:01.160
 Until that point, we won't do it, right?

3:01:01.160 --> 3:01:02.060
 I like this.

3:01:03.120 --> 3:01:07.400
 Famous chemist endorses the majestic nature of murder.

3:01:07.400 --> 3:01:09.340
 That's the title.

3:01:10.680 --> 3:01:12.080
 I didn't say that, but any case.

3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:13.880
 Well, I just inserted it.

3:01:13.880 --> 3:01:14.960
 I have a hard time with it, though.

3:01:14.960 --> 3:01:17.720
 I think the way you put it is kind of...

3:01:17.720 --> 3:01:22.220
 But it's the reality of, it is beautiful.

3:01:23.160 --> 3:01:24.520
 You know, there's an Instagram account

3:01:24.520 --> 3:01:25.820
 called natureismetal,

3:01:25.820 --> 3:01:29.260
 and I keep following it and unfollowing it

3:01:29.260 --> 3:01:32.060
 because I can't handle it for prolonged periods of time.

3:01:32.060 --> 3:01:34.520
 We evolve together, you die alone.

3:01:34.520 --> 3:01:35.360
 Yeah.

3:01:35.360 --> 3:01:38.420
 We evolve together, but you die alone.

3:01:38.420 --> 3:01:39.700
 We live alone, too.

3:01:39.700 --> 3:01:40.820
 It's the Gatsby thing.

3:01:40.820 --> 3:01:41.820
 I don't know.

3:01:41.820 --> 3:01:42.900
 We evolve together.

3:01:42.900 --> 3:01:43.800
 Where's the together?

3:01:43.800 --> 3:01:48.080
 The together is the murder and the sex, sex and murder.

3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:50.540
 My romantic vision of it is to try to make me happy, Sarah,

3:01:50.540 --> 3:01:51.620
 instead of sad Sarah.

3:01:52.700 --> 3:01:54.540
 I talk in third person when I think very abstractly.

3:01:54.540 --> 3:01:58.700
 Sorry, is, you know, like this whole,

3:01:58.700 --> 3:02:01.140
 like certain things can coexist,

3:02:01.140 --> 3:02:02.900
 so the universe is trying to maximize existence,

3:02:02.900 --> 3:02:03.740
 but there's some things

3:02:03.740 --> 3:02:08.740
 that just aren't the most productive trajectory together,

3:02:09.260 --> 3:02:10.700
 but it doesn't mean that they don't exist

3:02:10.700 --> 3:02:14.180
 on another timeline or another chain somewhere else.

3:02:14.180 --> 3:02:16.660
 Like, and maybe you would call that, like,

3:02:16.660 --> 3:02:18.260
 then some kind of multiverse or things,

3:02:18.260 --> 3:02:20.740
 but what am I saying?

3:02:20.740 --> 3:02:21.580
 I think you can't.

3:02:21.580 --> 3:02:22.900
 I just, you can't go down a level.

3:02:22.900 --> 3:02:23.740
 I'm just making stuff up.

3:02:23.740 --> 3:02:24.580
 No, you're not.

3:02:24.580 --> 3:02:25.400
 It makes me feel better.

3:02:25.400 --> 3:02:26.740
 I don't understand.

3:02:26.740 --> 3:02:27.980
 Is it logical?

3:02:27.980 --> 3:02:28.820
 And we need, we need.

3:02:28.820 --> 3:02:29.660
 No, I know, I know.

3:02:29.660 --> 3:02:31.620
 Yeah, if you look at bacteria, if you look at virus,

3:02:31.620 --> 3:02:34.980
 I mean, just the number of organisms that are constantly,

3:02:34.980 --> 3:02:37.460
 like looking at bacteria, they're just dying nonstop.

3:02:37.460 --> 3:02:38.580
 It's like a slaughter.

3:02:38.580 --> 3:02:39.540
 Right, right.

3:02:39.540 --> 3:02:41.100
 Well, and this goes back to the conversation about God.

3:02:41.100 --> 3:02:42.300
 I mean, like, there's the whole thing about, like,

3:02:42.300 --> 3:02:44.300
 why is the universe unable to suffering?

3:02:44.300 --> 3:02:46.220
 Individuals don't exist, right?

3:02:46.220 --> 3:02:48.300
 Individuals, so for this, I think,

3:02:48.300 --> 3:02:51.740
 if you think about life as an entity on Earth, right?

3:02:51.740 --> 3:02:53.740
 Let's just, let's just go back a second.

3:02:53.740 --> 3:02:55.700
 I mean, I like to, I'll be ludicrous for a second.

3:02:55.700 --> 3:02:56.540
 I don't exist.

3:02:56.540 --> 3:02:57.700
 You don't exist, right?

3:02:58.900 --> 3:03:00.740
 But you, but the actions you do,

3:03:00.740 --> 3:03:02.540
 the product of evolution exists, right?

3:03:02.540 --> 3:03:06.100
 The objects you create exist quantitatively

3:03:06.100 --> 3:03:07.460
 in the real world.

3:03:07.460 --> 3:03:10.260
 If you then understand life on Earth or alien life

3:03:10.260 --> 3:03:13.660
 or any life in the universe as this integrated entity

3:03:13.660 --> 3:03:16.020
 where you need, you need cells in your body to die.

3:03:16.020 --> 3:03:18.940
 Otherwise you'd just get really big

3:03:18.940 --> 3:03:20.740
 and you wouldn't be able to walk around, right?

3:03:20.740 --> 3:03:22.900
 So, you know, you do.

3:03:22.900 --> 3:03:24.900
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:03:24.900 --> 3:03:27.340
 So, so I think.

3:03:27.340 --> 3:03:29.340
 It's the patterns that persist, not the physical things.

3:03:29.340 --> 3:03:31.780
 And of course, we, you know, we have, we have,

3:03:31.780 --> 3:03:34.340
 we place immense values on fellow human beings

3:03:34.340 --> 3:03:37.620
 and I'm, majestic professor does like

3:03:37.620 --> 3:03:39.180
 other individual human beings.

3:03:39.180 --> 3:03:40.740
 Now you're talking in third person too.

3:03:40.740 --> 3:03:41.780
 I know, it happens, right?

3:03:41.780 --> 3:03:43.620
 So death, would you say, I mean,

3:03:43.620 --> 3:03:48.060
 because you said evolution is a fundamental part of life.

3:03:48.060 --> 3:03:49.940
 So death is a fundamental part of life.

3:03:49.940 --> 3:03:50.780
 Yeah.

3:03:51.860 --> 3:03:54.220
 It might, right now, it might not be in the future.

3:03:54.220 --> 3:03:56.780
 We might hack some aspects of death

3:03:56.780 --> 3:03:58.580
 because, and we'll evolve in different ways.

3:03:58.580 --> 3:04:00.660
 But isn't there, I think Sarah mentioned

3:04:00.660 --> 3:04:02.380
 like this life density.

3:04:04.300 --> 3:04:06.100
 Is it, can't that become a problem?

3:04:06.100 --> 3:04:09.420
 Like too much, too much bureaucracy,

3:04:09.420 --> 3:04:11.260
 too much baggage builds up.

3:04:11.260 --> 3:04:13.780
 Like you need to keep erasing stuff.

3:04:13.780 --> 3:04:15.460
 I think it's okay that we dissipate.

3:04:15.460 --> 3:04:16.940
 Like, I don't think of it like, like, I mean.

3:04:16.940 --> 3:04:18.140
 Dissipate, yes.

3:04:18.140 --> 3:04:20.500
 No, but I mean, like, like we're so fixated

3:04:20.500 --> 3:04:22.980
 on ourselves as individuals and agents.

3:04:22.980 --> 3:04:24.300
 And we were talking about this last night,

3:04:24.300 --> 3:04:27.300
 actually over dinner, but like,

3:04:27.300 --> 3:04:28.460
 you know, an individual persists

3:04:28.460 --> 3:04:30.140
 for a certain amount of time,

3:04:30.140 --> 3:04:31.340
 but what you want to do,

3:04:31.340 --> 3:04:33.420
 like if you're really concerned with immortality

3:04:33.420 --> 3:04:36.060
 is not to live indefinitely as an individual,

3:04:36.060 --> 3:04:37.740
 but maximize your causal impact.

3:04:37.740 --> 3:04:40.580
 So like, what are the traces of you that are left?

3:04:40.580 --> 3:04:43.740
 And you're still a real, I always think of Einstein,

3:04:43.740 --> 3:04:47.500
 like for a period of time, he was a real physical thing

3:04:47.500 --> 3:04:48.780
 we would identify as a human.

3:04:48.780 --> 3:04:50.700
 And now we just see echoes of that human

3:04:50.700 --> 3:04:53.060
 in all of the ways that we talk about his,

3:04:53.060 --> 3:04:54.980
 you know, causal impact are frankly great

3:04:54.980 --> 3:04:56.100
 is another great example.

3:04:56.100 --> 3:04:58.220
 How many Easter eggs could you leave in the future?

3:04:58.220 --> 3:04:59.900
 It's like, oh, I got you.

3:04:59.900 --> 3:05:01.420
 So I guess the question is,

3:05:01.420 --> 3:05:04.300
 how much do you want to control the localization

3:05:04.300 --> 3:05:08.300
 of certain features of say a prop,

3:05:08.300 --> 3:05:11.500
 a packet of propagating information we might call person

3:05:11.500 --> 3:05:12.620
 and keep them localized

3:05:12.620 --> 3:05:14.420
 to one individual physical structure?

3:05:14.420 --> 3:05:15.780
 Or do you want to, you know,

3:05:15.780 --> 3:05:18.620
 is there a time when that just becomes a dissipated feature

3:05:18.620 --> 3:05:22.020
 of the society that it once existed in?

3:05:22.020 --> 3:05:23.380
 And I'm okay with the dissipated feature

3:05:23.380 --> 3:05:25.680
 because I just think that makes more room

3:05:25.680 --> 3:05:28.180
 for more creativity in the future.

3:05:28.180 --> 3:05:31.520
 So you mentioned engineering life in the lab.

3:05:32.420 --> 3:05:34.680
 Let me take you to computer science world.

3:05:35.860 --> 3:05:38.000
 What about robots?

3:05:38.000 --> 3:05:42.540
 So is it possible to engineer,

3:05:42.540 --> 3:05:47.540
 so you're really talking about like engineering life

3:05:47.780 --> 3:05:49.900
 at the chemistry level,

3:05:49.900 --> 3:05:53.500
 but do you think it's possible to engineer a life

3:05:53.500 --> 3:05:57.940
 at the like humanoid level, at the dog level?

3:05:57.940 --> 3:06:01.160
 Like, or is that, like at which level can we instill

3:06:01.160 --> 3:06:05.380
 the magic of life into inanimate stuff?

3:06:05.380 --> 3:06:07.220
 No, I think you could do it at every level.

3:06:07.220 --> 3:06:09.060
 I just think that we're particularly interested

3:06:09.060 --> 3:06:14.060
 in chemistry because it's the origin of life transition

3:06:14.540 --> 3:06:16.540
 that presumably, or at least that's how I feel about it,

3:06:16.540 --> 3:06:20.260
 it's going to give you the most interesting

3:06:20.260 --> 3:06:22.640
 or deepest insights into the physics.

3:06:22.640 --> 3:06:25.780
 But presumably everything that we do and build

3:06:25.780 --> 3:06:26.780
 is an example of life.

3:06:26.780 --> 3:06:29.180
 And the question is just how much do you want to take

3:06:29.180 --> 3:06:31.840
 from things that we have now and put them into,

3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:35.340
 like examples of life and copy them into machines?

3:06:35.340 --> 3:06:38.740
 I saw that there was this tweet again.

3:06:38.740 --> 3:06:40.100
 I think you were at the Mars conference

3:06:40.100 --> 3:06:41.940
 and you were hanging out with a humanoid robot.

3:06:41.940 --> 3:06:43.860
 Yes, that was a fun time.

3:06:43.860 --> 3:06:46.820
 Making lots of new friends at Mars 2020.

3:06:46.820 --> 3:06:49.700
 Did you guys color match ahead of time with the robot

3:06:49.700 --> 3:06:52.060
 or did that accidentally happen?

3:06:52.060 --> 3:06:54.260
 Accidentally, I went up and I wanted to say hi.

3:06:54.260 --> 3:06:57.300
 Torpoise, would that be the correct name for the color?

3:06:57.300 --> 3:06:58.300
 I think so.

3:06:58.300 --> 3:07:00.780
 We didn't color coordinate our outfits.

3:07:00.780 --> 3:07:02.740
 Well, you didn't, maybe the robot did.

3:07:02.740 --> 3:07:05.260
 The robot probably did, much more stylish.

3:07:05.260 --> 3:07:06.580
 So for people who are just listening,

3:07:06.580 --> 3:07:09.740
 there's a picture of Sarah standing next

3:07:09.740 --> 3:07:10.980
 to a humanoid robot.

3:07:10.980 --> 3:07:14.860
 I guess you like them with a small head and perfect vision.

3:07:14.860 --> 3:07:16.580
 Actually, no, I just.

3:07:16.580 --> 3:07:19.620
 What did they perfectly, there's a LIDAR.

3:07:19.620 --> 3:07:21.820
 No, I mean, I think I was just deeply interested

3:07:21.820 --> 3:07:22.660
 because.

3:07:22.660 --> 3:07:25.020
 What was, sorry to interrupt, was it manual control?

3:07:25.020 --> 3:07:27.340
 Was it actually stabilizing itself?

3:07:27.340 --> 3:07:29.020
 Oh no, it was walking around.

3:07:29.020 --> 3:07:29.900
 Oh, nice.

3:07:29.900 --> 3:07:30.740
 Yeah.

3:07:30.740 --> 3:07:31.560
 Nice.

3:07:31.560 --> 3:07:32.580
 It was pretty impressive.

3:07:32.580 --> 3:07:34.380
 I mean, actually there's some videos online

3:07:34.380 --> 3:07:36.100
 of Jeff Bezos walking with one of those

3:07:36.100 --> 3:07:38.420
 across the lawn nearby there.

3:07:38.420 --> 3:07:39.260
 This is great.

3:07:39.260 --> 3:07:41.340
 Yeah.

3:07:41.340 --> 3:07:42.180
 So.

3:07:42.180 --> 3:07:42.980
 I wasn't invited.

3:07:47.100 --> 3:07:50.620
 Yeah, but there you go.

3:07:50.620 --> 3:07:51.940
 See?

3:07:51.940 --> 3:07:53.180
 That's incredible, isn't it?

3:07:53.180 --> 3:07:54.020
 Yeah.

3:07:54.020 --> 3:07:55.980
 See, you look at the walking robot.

3:07:55.980 --> 3:07:57.780
 Where did the idea for walking come from?

3:07:57.780 --> 3:07:59.940
 It was invented by evolution, right?

3:07:59.940 --> 3:08:02.620
 And us as human beings, able to conceptualize and design

3:08:02.620 --> 3:08:04.300
 and engineer the causal change.

3:08:04.300 --> 3:08:07.100
 So that robot is evidence of life.

3:08:07.100 --> 3:08:11.140
 And so I think what's going to happen is there's the,

3:08:11.140 --> 3:08:14.620
 we want to find where the spark comes from mechanistically.

3:08:14.620 --> 3:08:17.780
 How can you literally go from sand to cells?

3:08:17.780 --> 3:08:19.780
 So that's the first transition that I think,

3:08:19.780 --> 3:08:21.420
 there are a number of problems we want to do.

3:08:21.420 --> 3:08:22.500
 Make life in the lab.

3:08:23.540 --> 3:08:24.380
 Great.

3:08:24.380 --> 3:08:25.380
 Then we want to make life in the lab

3:08:25.380 --> 3:08:28.220
 and want to suddenly start to make intelligent life

3:08:28.220 --> 3:08:31.500
 or life that can solve, start to solve abstract problems.

3:08:31.500 --> 3:08:35.260
 And then we want to make life that is conscious.

3:08:35.260 --> 3:08:36.100
 Okay?

3:08:36.100 --> 3:08:36.980
 In that order?

3:08:36.980 --> 3:08:39.420
 I think it has to happen in that order.

3:08:39.420 --> 3:08:41.620
 Getting towards this artificial general intelligence.

3:08:41.620 --> 3:08:44.260
 I think that artificial general intelligence

3:08:44.260 --> 3:08:45.900
 can't exist in a vacuum.

3:08:45.900 --> 3:08:47.020
 It has to have a causal change

3:08:47.020 --> 3:08:48.900
 all the way back to Luca, right?

3:08:48.900 --> 3:08:49.740
 Yeah.

3:08:49.740 --> 3:08:50.900
 And so the question I think,

3:08:50.900 --> 3:08:52.900
 I really like the question is to say,

3:08:52.900 --> 3:08:54.980
 what are we, how is,

3:08:55.940 --> 3:08:59.180
 how is our pursuit of more and more lifelike?

3:08:59.180 --> 3:09:00.980
 I know you want to, you like your robots.

3:09:00.980 --> 3:09:02.020
 You want to project into them.

3:09:02.020 --> 3:09:03.660
 You want to interact with them.

3:09:03.660 --> 3:09:05.420
 I think you would want,

3:09:05.420 --> 3:09:07.140
 if you have a robot dog and the robot dog

3:09:07.140 --> 3:09:08.500
 does everything expected of a normal dog

3:09:08.500 --> 3:09:10.020
 and you can't tell the difference,

3:09:10.020 --> 3:09:11.740
 you're not really going to ask the question anymore.

3:09:11.740 --> 3:09:12.900
 If it's a real dog or not,

3:09:12.900 --> 3:09:15.980
 or you've got a personality, you're interacting with it.

3:09:15.980 --> 3:09:17.460
 And so I think what would be interesting

3:09:17.460 --> 3:09:20.260
 would be to kind of understand

3:09:20.260 --> 3:09:22.500
 the computational architecture, how that evolves.

3:09:22.500 --> 3:09:23.700
 Cause you could then, you know,

3:09:23.700 --> 3:09:26.540
 teleport the personality from one object to the other

3:09:26.540 --> 3:09:28.500
 and say, right, does it act the same?

3:09:28.500 --> 3:09:31.260
 And I think that as we go along,

3:09:31.260 --> 3:09:32.860
 we're going to get better and better

3:09:32.860 --> 3:09:37.860
 at integrating our consciousness into machines.

3:09:38.100 --> 3:09:41.500
 Well, let me ask you that question just to link on it.

3:09:42.380 --> 3:09:45.540
 I would, I would call that a living conscious thing

3:09:45.540 --> 3:09:48.900
 potentially, I as a human allegedly,

3:09:48.900 --> 3:09:53.660
 but would you, as a person trying to define life,

3:09:53.660 --> 3:09:56.900
 if you pass the Turing test, are you a life form?

3:09:56.900 --> 3:09:58.580
 One of the reasons I walked up to the robot

3:09:58.580 --> 3:10:02.900
 was because I wanted to meet the robot, right?

3:10:02.900 --> 3:10:07.100
 So I, it felt like I was,

3:10:07.100 --> 3:10:10.140
 and I abase a lot of my interaction with reality

3:10:10.140 --> 3:10:11.260
 on emotion and feeling,

3:10:11.260 --> 3:10:13.700
 but like how do you feel about an interaction?

3:10:13.700 --> 3:10:14.980
 And I always love your point about like,

3:10:14.980 --> 3:10:16.660
 is it enough to have that shared experience

3:10:16.660 --> 3:10:17.500
 with a robot, right?

3:10:17.500 --> 3:10:19.020
 So walking up to it,

3:10:19.020 --> 3:10:20.940
 does it feel like you're interacting with a living thing?

3:10:20.940 --> 3:10:24.340
 And it did to an extent, but in some degrees,

3:10:24.340 --> 3:10:26.900
 it feels like you're interacting with a baby living thing.

3:10:26.900 --> 3:10:29.300
 So I think our relationship with technology

3:10:29.300 --> 3:10:31.380
 and particularly robots we build is really interesting

3:10:31.380 --> 3:10:35.460
 because basically they exist as objects in our future

3:10:35.460 --> 3:10:38.860
 in some sense, like we're a much older evolutionary lineage

3:10:38.860 --> 3:10:42.380
 than robots are, but we're all part of the same causal chain

3:10:42.380 --> 3:10:47.340
 and presumably, you know, they're kind of in their infancy.

3:10:47.340 --> 3:10:49.860
 So it's almost like you're looking at the future of life

3:10:49.860 --> 3:10:50.820
 when you're looking at them,

3:10:50.820 --> 3:10:55.820
 but it hasn't really become life in a full manifestation

3:10:56.060 --> 3:10:58.260
 of whatever it is that they're gonna become.

3:10:59.700 --> 3:11:03.580
 And, you know, the example of the walking robot

3:11:03.580 --> 3:11:05.980
 was super interesting, but they also had a dolphin

3:11:05.980 --> 3:11:08.460
 that they put in the pool at the cocktail party at Mars,

3:11:08.460 --> 3:11:11.420
 and it looked just like a real dolphin swimming in the pool.

3:11:11.420 --> 3:11:14.780
 And, you know, it's in this kind of uncanny valley

3:11:14.780 --> 3:11:17.180
 because, and I was having this conversation

3:11:17.180 --> 3:11:21.180
 with a gentleman named Mutu who was super perceptive,

3:11:21.180 --> 3:11:22.540
 but he was basically saying like,

3:11:22.540 --> 3:11:24.580
 it made him feel really uncomfortable.

3:11:25.780 --> 3:11:26.620
 And I think.

3:11:26.620 --> 3:11:27.460
 The dolphin.

3:11:27.460 --> 3:11:29.540
 Yeah, and I think a lot of people would have that response.

3:11:29.540 --> 3:11:32.820
 And I guess my point about it is it is kind of interesting

3:11:32.820 --> 3:11:34.740
 because you're basically trying to make a thing

3:11:34.740 --> 3:11:38.340
 that you think is nonliving mimic a living thing.

3:11:38.340 --> 3:11:40.860
 And so the thought experiment I would wanna run in that case

3:11:40.860 --> 3:11:44.420
 is imagine we replaced every living thing on earth

3:11:44.420 --> 3:11:47.100
 with a robot equivalent, like all the dolphins and things.

3:11:47.100 --> 3:11:48.740
 And in some sense, then you're making,

3:11:48.740 --> 3:11:51.500
 if you think that the robots aren't experiencing reality,

3:11:51.500 --> 3:11:52.980
 for example, in the way that

3:11:52.980 --> 3:11:54.940
 a biologically evolved thing would,

3:11:54.940 --> 3:11:58.620
 you're basically making the philosophical zombie argument

3:11:58.620 --> 3:12:03.620
 become real and basically building reality into a simulation

3:12:03.740 --> 3:12:06.460
 because you've made everything quote unquote fake

3:12:06.460 --> 3:12:07.300
 in some sense.

3:12:07.300 --> 3:12:10.900
 You've replaced everything with a physical simulation of it.

3:12:10.900 --> 3:12:15.020
 So as opposed to being excited by the possibility

3:12:15.020 --> 3:12:17.860
 of creating something new,

3:12:17.860 --> 3:12:22.420
 you're terrified of humans being replaced.

3:12:22.420 --> 3:12:23.700
 I was just trying to run like what would be

3:12:23.700 --> 3:12:26.180
 the absolute thought experiment.

3:12:26.180 --> 3:12:29.460
 But I don't think that scenario would actually play out.

3:12:29.460 --> 3:12:32.700
 I guess what I think is weird for why we feel

3:12:32.700 --> 3:12:34.260
 this kind of uncanny valley interacting

3:12:34.260 --> 3:12:36.420
 with something like the robot dolphin

3:12:36.420 --> 3:12:38.300
 is we're looking at an object we know is kind of

3:12:38.300 --> 3:12:40.100
 in the future in the sense of like

3:12:40.100 --> 3:12:41.900
 if everything's ordered in time,

3:12:41.900 --> 3:12:43.440
 but it's borrowing from a structure

3:12:43.440 --> 3:12:45.260
 that we have common history with,

3:12:45.260 --> 3:12:48.240
 and it's basically copying in a kind of superficial way

3:12:48.240 --> 3:12:52.100
 things from one part of the causal chain to another.

3:12:52.100 --> 3:12:53.260
 Yeah.

3:12:53.260 --> 3:12:56.020
 Well, that's a video of...

3:12:56.020 --> 3:12:57.640
 Everybody believed it was real.

3:12:57.640 --> 3:12:59.240
 They look so real.

3:13:00.560 --> 3:13:04.300
 And obviously the technology was developed for movies, so.

3:13:04.300 --> 3:13:06.620
 Well, I think we're confusing our emotional response

3:13:06.620 --> 3:13:08.100
 and understanding the causal chain

3:13:08.100 --> 3:13:09.620
 of how we got there, right?

3:13:09.620 --> 3:13:11.900
 Because the philosophical dot zombie argument

3:13:11.900 --> 3:13:15.060
 thinks about objects just appearing, right,

3:13:15.060 --> 3:13:16.620
 that you're facsimile in some way,

3:13:16.620 --> 3:13:19.420
 whereas there is the causal, the chain of events

3:13:19.420 --> 3:13:22.340
 that caused the dolphin to be built went for a human being.

3:13:22.340 --> 3:13:23.740
 Yeah, would a philosophical zombie

3:13:23.740 --> 3:13:25.620
 still have a high assembly index?

3:13:25.620 --> 3:13:26.900
 Yeah.

3:13:26.900 --> 3:13:29.740
 Because it can't be, philosophical zombies can't,

3:13:29.740 --> 3:13:33.260
 like Boltzmann brains, just can't appear out of nowhere.

3:13:33.260 --> 3:13:35.180
 Well, I guess my question would be in that scenario

3:13:35.180 --> 3:13:36.020
 where you built all the robots

3:13:36.020 --> 3:13:37.500
 and replaced everything on Earth with robots,

3:13:37.500 --> 3:13:39.400
 would the biosphere be as creative

3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:40.900
 under that scenario or not?

3:13:40.900 --> 3:13:42.460
 Yeah, that's a good question.

3:13:42.460 --> 3:13:44.380
 Are there quantitative differences

3:13:44.380 --> 3:13:45.700
 you would notice over time?

3:13:45.700 --> 3:13:47.340
 And it's not obvious either way, right?

3:13:47.340 --> 3:13:48.460
 It's not obvious right now,

3:13:48.460 --> 3:13:50.780
 because we don't really, we don't understand,

3:13:50.780 --> 3:13:53.220
 we haven't built into machines how we work.

3:13:53.220 --> 3:13:56.540
 So that's, I think, one of the big missing things

3:13:56.540 --> 3:13:59.100
 that we're both looking for, right?

3:13:59.100 --> 3:14:01.100
 This is a robot, it's a cute robot.

3:14:01.100 --> 3:14:03.180
 But the point, Sarah, is that the biosphere

3:14:03.180 --> 3:14:05.660
 won't be as creative if you did it right now.

3:14:05.660 --> 3:14:07.820
 No, of course, I think that's why people don't like it.

3:14:07.820 --> 3:14:12.740
 But in the future, we will be able to solve the problem

3:14:12.740 --> 3:14:17.740
 of origin of life, intelligence, and consciousness

3:14:19.380 --> 3:14:21.180
 because they exist in physical substrates.

3:14:21.180 --> 3:14:22.620
 We just don't understand enough

3:14:22.620 --> 3:14:26.300
 about the material substrate and the causal chain.

3:14:26.300 --> 3:14:29.180
 But I'm very confident we will get to an AGI,

3:14:29.180 --> 3:14:30.220
 but it won't be what people think.

3:14:30.220 --> 3:14:34.040
 It won't be, solution won't be a, we'll get fooled a lot.

3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:36.480
 And so GPT3 is getting better at fooling us

3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:39.900
 and GPT153 might really fool us,

3:14:39.900 --> 3:14:42.700
 but it won't have the magic we're looking for.

3:14:42.700 --> 3:14:44.260
 It won't be a creative,

3:14:45.140 --> 3:14:48.700
 but it will help us understand the differences between.

3:14:48.700 --> 3:14:53.200
 Really though, because isn't that what love is, being fooled?

3:14:54.880 --> 3:14:57.540
 Like what, why are you not giving much value

3:14:57.540 --> 3:15:00.000
 to the emotional connection with objects,

3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:01.860
 with robots, with humans?

3:15:01.860 --> 3:15:03.660
 Emotion is a thing which happens

3:15:03.660 --> 3:15:08.660
 when your expectation function is dashed

3:15:09.220 --> 3:15:11.660
 and something else happens, right?

3:15:11.660 --> 3:15:13.460
 I mean, that's what emotion is.

3:15:13.460 --> 3:15:14.740
 Is that what love is too?

3:15:14.740 --> 3:15:15.900
 Yeah.

3:15:15.900 --> 3:15:18.780
 You were expecting one thing and something else happened.

3:15:18.780 --> 3:15:19.600
 Yeah.

3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:20.440
 I don't know.

3:15:20.440 --> 3:15:21.500
 I don't think that's true either.

3:15:21.500 --> 3:15:22.340
 Well, what is it then?

3:15:22.340 --> 3:15:25.140
 I think, no, emotion, look, I'm sorry, emotion is that,

3:15:25.140 --> 3:15:25.980
 but there's no more.

3:15:25.980 --> 3:15:28.340
 No, I think love is just fulfilling your purpose.

3:15:28.340 --> 3:15:30.100
 No, but, okay, I mean, look, look.

3:15:30.100 --> 3:15:30.940
 Like whatever that means.

3:15:30.940 --> 3:15:31.780
 That's the opposite of what's gonna happen.

3:15:31.780 --> 3:15:32.600
 I mean, really?

3:15:32.600 --> 3:15:33.440
 So, okay.

3:15:33.440 --> 3:15:34.280
 I think the happiest is like when you're doing.

3:15:34.280 --> 3:15:35.120
 All right, all right, all right.

3:15:35.120 --> 3:15:35.940
 Let me go back.

3:15:35.940 --> 3:15:36.780
 If you want me to define.

3:15:36.780 --> 3:15:37.620
 Follow your bliss.

3:15:37.620 --> 3:15:38.940
 Let me define love quickly.

3:15:38.940 --> 3:15:39.940
 Okay, go for it.

3:15:39.940 --> 3:15:42.060
 In terms of assembly space, right?

3:15:42.060 --> 3:15:42.900
 Okay?

3:15:42.900 --> 3:15:43.720
 Excellent.

3:15:43.720 --> 3:15:45.140
 I didn't think I'd be doing this today.

3:15:45.140 --> 3:15:47.620
 I can't wait till Assembly Theory 101 is taught

3:15:47.620 --> 3:15:49.980
 and the second lecture is Assembly Theory of Love.

3:15:49.980 --> 3:15:51.980
 No, no, but look, actually, but look, but.

3:15:53.620 --> 3:15:54.580
 It's being surprised.

3:15:54.580 --> 3:15:56.180
 The expectation is being broken.

3:15:56.180 --> 3:15:57.020
 I'm just, I'm not.

3:15:57.020 --> 3:15:57.860
 No, go for it.

3:15:57.860 --> 3:15:58.700
 I wanna hear you.

3:15:58.700 --> 3:16:00.780
 I'm not an emotional being, but I would say,

3:16:00.780 --> 3:16:02.780
 so let's talk, so we'll talk about emotion a bit,

3:16:02.780 --> 3:16:03.980
 but love is more complex.

3:16:03.980 --> 3:16:06.380
 Love is a very complex set of emotions together

3:16:06.380 --> 3:16:09.540
 and logical stuff, but if you've got this thing,

3:16:09.540 --> 3:16:11.700
 this person that's on this causal chain

3:16:11.700 --> 3:16:14.860
 that has this empathy for this other thing,

3:16:14.860 --> 3:16:18.260
 love is being able to project ahead in your assembly space

3:16:18.260 --> 3:16:20.100
 and work out what you're,

3:16:20.100 --> 3:16:22.620
 the person you're in love with has a need for

3:16:22.620 --> 3:16:26.620
 and to do that for them without selflessly, right?

3:16:26.620 --> 3:16:28.260
 Cause you can project ahead what they're gonna need

3:16:28.260 --> 3:16:30.060
 and they are there and maybe you can see

3:16:30.060 --> 3:16:31.540
 someone who's gonna fall over

3:16:31.540 --> 3:16:33.020
 and you catch them before they fall over

3:16:33.020 --> 3:16:35.540
 or maybe you can anticipate that someone's gonna be hungry

3:16:35.540 --> 3:16:38.100
 and without helping you, you just help them.

3:16:38.100 --> 3:16:38.940
 That's what love is.

3:16:38.940 --> 3:16:40.300
 That just sounds like empathy.

3:16:40.300 --> 3:16:42.020
 But it's more complex than that, right?

3:16:42.020 --> 3:16:42.940
 It's more complex.

3:16:42.940 --> 3:16:46.100
 It's more about not just empathy, it's understanding.

3:16:46.100 --> 3:16:48.580
 It's about kind of sharing that experience.

3:16:48.580 --> 3:16:49.580
 That's an expression of love though.

3:16:49.580 --> 3:16:51.220
 That's not what it's like to feel love.

3:16:51.220 --> 3:16:53.180
 Like feeling love is like,

3:16:53.180 --> 3:16:55.740
 I think it's like when you're aligned with things

3:16:55.740 --> 3:16:58.620
 that you feel like are your purpose

3:16:58.620 --> 3:17:00.540
 or your reason for existing.

3:17:00.540 --> 3:17:05.300
 So if you have those feelings towards a robot,

3:17:05.300 --> 3:17:06.260
 why is that robot?

3:17:06.260 --> 3:17:09.220
 I mean, cause you said like the AGI,

3:17:09.220 --> 3:17:10.340
 we'll build an AGI,

3:17:10.340 --> 3:17:12.860
 but there'll be a fundamental difference in AGI.

3:17:12.860 --> 3:17:13.700
 I don't think we'll build it.

3:17:13.700 --> 3:17:15.180
 It's gonna emerge from our technology.

3:17:15.180 --> 3:17:17.020
 I think you guys all argue the same thing.

3:17:17.020 --> 3:17:18.860
 I just said that GPT,

3:17:18.860 --> 3:17:23.260
 we do not correctly capture the causal chain that we have.

3:17:23.260 --> 3:17:24.700
 Within GPT.

3:17:24.700 --> 3:17:25.540
 Yeah, within AI.

3:17:25.540 --> 3:17:27.300
 But don't you think it captures,

3:17:27.300 --> 3:17:30.220
 because GPT3 is fundamentally trained

3:17:30.220 --> 3:17:33.340
 on a corpus of knowledge,

3:17:34.540 --> 3:17:35.900
 like the internet.

3:17:35.900 --> 3:17:38.580
 Don't you think it gets better and better and better

3:17:38.580 --> 3:17:39.980
 at capturing the memory of all the...

3:17:39.980 --> 3:17:42.060
 It will be better at fooling you.

3:17:42.060 --> 3:17:44.420
 And at some point you won't care.

3:17:44.420 --> 3:17:46.100
 But when it comes to,

3:17:46.100 --> 3:17:47.260
 my guess, this is a quick,

3:17:47.260 --> 3:17:49.260
 this is what I was getting to right before we got,

3:17:49.260 --> 3:17:51.340
 I got in the love trap.

3:17:51.340 --> 3:17:52.180
 Love trap, yeah.

3:17:52.180 --> 3:17:54.660
 It was like Lee Cronin in the love trap.

3:17:57.180 --> 3:17:58.860
 Sounds like a good fan name.

3:17:58.860 --> 3:18:01.700
 SAD, okay, SAD, assembly space of SAD.

3:18:01.700 --> 3:18:04.380
 No, is that, so sure.

3:18:04.380 --> 3:18:06.380
 But I think there are other features

3:18:06.380 --> 3:18:09.100
 that allow that we pull on innovation

3:18:09.100 --> 3:18:12.580
 that allow us to do more than what we just see in GPT3.

3:18:12.580 --> 3:18:14.300
 So if you're being fooled there.

3:18:14.300 --> 3:18:16.820
 So I think what I mean is human beings have this ability

3:18:16.820 --> 3:18:19.220
 to be surprising and creative.

3:18:19.220 --> 3:18:22.100
 Whereas is it Dali, this thing,

3:18:22.100 --> 3:18:27.100
 or if you take GPT3 is not gonna create a new verb.

3:18:27.100 --> 3:18:30.220
 Shakespeare created new verbs.

3:18:30.220 --> 3:18:31.740
 You're like, wow.

3:18:31.740 --> 3:18:35.260
 And that required Shakespeare to think outside of language

3:18:35.260 --> 3:18:36.580
 in a different domain.

3:18:36.580 --> 3:18:39.900
 So I think having that connections across multiple domains

3:18:39.900 --> 3:18:41.260
 is what you need for AGI.

3:18:41.260 --> 3:18:43.060
 Yeah, but I don't know if you need,

3:18:44.340 --> 3:18:46.660
 I don't know if there's any limitations to GPT

3:18:48.380 --> 3:18:51.660
 and not being able to be across domain.

3:18:51.660 --> 3:18:53.460
 The number one problem is,

3:18:53.460 --> 3:18:56.460
 it's instantiated in a resource limited substrate

3:18:56.460 --> 3:18:58.020
 and that we don't, in silicon.

3:19:00.820 --> 3:19:03.100
 The architectures used for training, for learning

3:19:03.100 --> 3:19:06.900
 is about fooling, it's not about understanding.

3:19:06.900 --> 3:19:10.860
 And I think that there is some understanding that we have

3:19:10.860 --> 3:19:13.740
 that is not yet symbolically representable.

3:19:13.740 --> 3:19:17.020
 Language, learning language and using language

3:19:17.020 --> 3:19:20.340
 seems to be fundamentally about fooling, not understanding.

3:19:22.020 --> 3:19:23.900
 Why do you use language exactly?

3:19:23.900 --> 3:19:27.540
 I might disagree with that quite fundamentally actually,

3:19:27.540 --> 3:19:30.100
 but I'm not sure I understand

3:19:30.100 --> 3:19:32.020
 how I make a coherent argument for that.

3:19:32.020 --> 3:19:37.020
 But my feeling is that there is comprehension in reality

3:19:39.900 --> 3:19:42.900
 in our consciousness below language.

3:19:42.900 --> 3:19:45.620
 And we use those for language,

3:19:45.620 --> 3:19:46.940
 for all sorts of expressions.

3:19:46.940 --> 3:19:49.020
 And we don't yet understand that there's a gap.

3:19:49.020 --> 3:19:51.100
 We will get there, but I'm saying,

3:19:51.100 --> 3:19:52.940
 wouldn't it be interesting, it's a bit like saying,

3:19:52.940 --> 3:19:57.940
 could I facsimile you or Sarah into a new human being?

3:19:57.940 --> 3:20:00.420
 And let's just say, I could copy all your atoms

3:20:00.420 --> 3:20:02.900
 and the positions of all your atoms and electrons

3:20:02.900 --> 3:20:05.940
 into this other person, they would be you.

3:20:05.940 --> 3:20:07.220
 The answer is no.

3:20:07.220 --> 3:20:10.020
 And it's quite easy to show using assembly theory

3:20:10.020 --> 3:20:12.260
 because actually the feature space that you have,

3:20:12.260 --> 3:20:14.820
 that graph, the only way to copy you

3:20:14.820 --> 3:20:16.780
 is to create you on that graph.

3:20:16.780 --> 3:20:18.660
 So everything that's happened to you in your past,

3:20:18.660 --> 3:20:20.220
 we have to have a faithful record for.

3:20:20.220 --> 3:20:21.580
 If you want another copy of Lex,

3:20:21.580 --> 3:20:22.500
 you have to do the exact thing.

3:20:22.500 --> 3:20:24.660
 Want another copy of Sarah, want another copy of Lee.

3:20:24.660 --> 3:20:27.340
 The exact past has to be replicated.

3:20:27.340 --> 3:20:28.780
 Let me push back on that a little bit.

3:20:28.780 --> 3:20:31.300
 That's maybe from an assembly theory perspective,

3:20:31.300 --> 3:20:34.580
 but I don't think it's that difficult

3:20:34.580 --> 3:20:37.480
 to recreate a version of me, like a clone,

3:20:37.480 --> 3:20:42.400
 that would make everybody exactly equally as happy.

3:20:43.380 --> 3:20:44.660
 They wouldn't care which one.

3:20:44.660 --> 3:20:49.020
 And there's two of me and then they get to pick which one

3:20:49.020 --> 3:20:50.900
 and they'll kill either one, they'll be fine.

3:20:50.900 --> 3:20:52.340
 As long as they're forced to kill.

3:20:52.340 --> 3:20:53.180
 They'll be fine.

3:20:53.180 --> 3:20:54.020
 But here's what will happen is,

3:20:54.020 --> 3:20:56.180
 let's say we make artificial Lex

3:20:56.180 --> 3:20:57.300
 and it was like, wow, so cool.

3:20:57.300 --> 3:20:58.720
 It looks the same interact.

3:20:58.720 --> 3:20:59.980
 Then there'll be this battle of like,

3:20:59.980 --> 3:21:01.260
 right, we're going to tell the difference.

3:21:01.260 --> 3:21:04.540
 We're going to basically keep nudging Lex

3:21:04.540 --> 3:21:09.260
 and artificial Lex until we get novelty from one

3:21:09.260 --> 3:21:10.620
 and we'll kill the other one.

3:21:10.620 --> 3:21:12.260
 And I think, thank God.

3:21:12.260 --> 3:21:14.540
 We're not, novelty is a fuzzy concept.

3:21:14.540 --> 3:21:16.380
 That's the whole problem of novelty.

3:21:16.380 --> 3:21:18.820
 So I will define novelty, it's not fuzzy.

3:21:18.820 --> 3:21:23.820
 Novelty is the ability for you to create architectures

3:21:26.120 --> 3:21:28.680
 that are, or create an architecture.

3:21:28.680 --> 3:21:30.740
 So let's say you've got a corpus of architectures known.

3:21:30.740 --> 3:21:32.940
 You can write down, you've got some distance measure.

3:21:32.940 --> 3:21:35.780
 And then I create a new one and the distance measure

3:21:35.780 --> 3:21:37.740
 so far away from what you'd expected.

3:21:38.940 --> 3:21:40.420
 There's no linear algebra going to get there.

3:21:40.420 --> 3:21:43.940
 It's like, that is creativity.

3:21:43.940 --> 3:21:47.500
 And we don't know how to do that yet on any level.

3:21:47.500 --> 3:21:49.100
 Well, I was also thinking about like your argument

3:21:49.100 --> 3:21:51.460
 about free will, like you wouldn't be able to know

3:21:51.460 --> 3:21:53.600
 it was, it doesn't work instantaneously.

3:21:53.600 --> 3:21:55.460
 It's not like a micro level thing,

3:21:55.460 --> 3:21:58.060
 but more a macro level thing over the scale of trajectories

3:21:58.060 --> 3:21:59.220
 or longer term decisions.

3:21:59.220 --> 3:22:02.440
 So if you think that the novelty manifests

3:22:02.440 --> 3:22:03.940
 over those longer timescales,

3:22:03.940 --> 3:22:08.100
 it might be the two Lexes diverge quite a bit

3:22:08.960 --> 3:22:11.740
 over certain timescales of their behavior.

3:22:11.740 --> 3:22:15.140
 But nobody would notice the difference.

3:22:15.140 --> 3:22:16.900
 They might not.

3:22:16.900 --> 3:22:20.100
 And the universe, the earth won't notice the difference.

3:22:20.100 --> 3:22:20.940
 The universe won't notice the difference.

3:22:20.940 --> 3:22:22.580
 The universe would notice the difference.

3:22:22.580 --> 3:22:24.920
 No, the universe doesn't know about its novelty

3:22:24.920 --> 3:22:25.760
 that's being generated.

3:22:25.760 --> 3:22:27.740
 That's the whole point of novelty.

3:22:27.740 --> 3:22:29.260
 Yeah, but this is what selection is, right?

3:22:29.260 --> 3:22:31.860
 It's like taking nearly equivalent ones

3:22:31.860 --> 3:22:34.780
 and then deciding like the universe selects, right?

3:22:34.780 --> 3:22:36.240
 So whatever selection is,

3:22:36.240 --> 3:22:38.140
 select some things to persist in time.

3:22:38.140 --> 3:22:40.420
 Yeah, it's gonna select the artificial one

3:22:40.420 --> 3:22:42.140
 just because it likes that one better.

3:22:42.140 --> 3:22:43.720
 Well, you're mixing up two arguments here.

3:22:43.720 --> 3:22:45.060
 So look, let's go back a second.

3:22:45.060 --> 3:22:47.260
 What are you basing this argument on, Lex?

3:22:47.260 --> 3:22:50.340
 I'm just saying that I kind of don't think,

3:22:50.340 --> 3:22:53.700
 cause at least said that it's not possible.

3:22:53.700 --> 3:22:58.700
 Like if you copy every single molecule in a person's body,

3:22:59.260 --> 3:23:01.760
 that's not going to be the same person.

3:23:01.760 --> 3:23:05.300
 That they won't have the same assembly index.

3:23:05.300 --> 3:23:07.220
 It won't be the same person.

3:23:07.220 --> 3:23:09.900
 And I just don't, I think copying, you can compress.

3:23:09.900 --> 3:23:11.920
 Not only do I disagree with that,

3:23:11.920 --> 3:23:15.440
 I just, I think you can even compress a person down

3:23:15.440 --> 3:23:17.920
 to some where you can fool the universe.

3:23:17.920 --> 3:23:19.840
 I'm saying, let me restate it.

3:23:19.840 --> 3:23:23.960
 It is not possible to copy somebody on,

3:23:23.960 --> 3:23:27.000
 because you, unless you copy the causal history.

3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:29.280
 Also, you can't have two identical.

3:23:29.280 --> 3:23:30.800
 I mean, actually I really like the idea

3:23:30.800 --> 3:23:32.040
 that everything in the universe is unique.

3:23:32.040 --> 3:23:33.760
 So even if like there were two Lex's.

3:23:33.760 --> 3:23:35.000
 I know you like that idea

3:23:35.000 --> 3:23:37.000
 cause you're human and you think you're unique.

3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:37.840
 Yeah, exactly.

3:23:37.840 --> 3:23:39.560
 But also I can make a logical argument for it

3:23:39.560 --> 3:23:42.280
 that even if we could copy all of your molecules

3:23:42.280 --> 3:23:44.560
 and all their positions, the other you would be there.

3:23:44.560 --> 3:23:47.480
 And you have a different position in space.

3:23:47.480 --> 3:23:48.300
 And the other thing.

3:23:48.300 --> 3:23:49.140
 You're distinguishable.

3:23:49.140 --> 3:23:49.960
 Yeah, the other thing I was gonna add.

3:23:49.960 --> 3:23:51.040
 How unique are you?

3:23:51.040 --> 3:23:53.000
 Just by the position in space really.

3:23:53.000 --> 3:23:55.960
 Sure, but then how much does that light translation

3:23:55.960 --> 3:23:58.920
 of Lex sitting there affect the future?

3:23:58.920 --> 3:24:02.320
 I see, but wait a minute.

3:24:02.320 --> 3:24:05.580
 Is part of the definition of something being interesting

3:24:05.580 --> 3:24:07.880
 is how much it affects the future?

3:24:07.880 --> 3:24:08.720
 Yes.

3:24:08.720 --> 3:24:09.560
 Yes.

3:24:09.560 --> 3:24:10.380
 But let me come back.

3:24:10.380 --> 3:24:11.220
 Don't you agree?

3:24:11.220 --> 3:24:12.060
 Do you disagree?

3:24:12.060 --> 3:24:12.880
 But let me come back one point quickly

3:24:12.880 --> 3:24:13.720
 that you were making.

3:24:13.720 --> 3:24:15.680
 Sure, I think I probably agree, yes.

3:24:15.680 --> 3:24:16.600
 There's two Lex's, right?

3:24:16.600 --> 3:24:18.560
 There's a robot Lex that you just basically,

3:24:18.560 --> 3:24:21.080
 it is a charade.

3:24:21.080 --> 3:24:22.700
 It's a facsimile.

3:24:22.700 --> 3:24:26.680
 It's just coded to emulate you.

3:24:27.640 --> 3:24:28.840
 Are you robot Lex?

3:24:28.840 --> 3:24:30.040
 I wouldn't know, right?

3:24:30.040 --> 3:24:30.860
 Let's get that.

3:24:30.860 --> 3:24:31.700
 But let's get that.

3:24:31.700 --> 3:24:32.540
 That's the point.

3:24:32.540 --> 3:24:33.360
 It's a very important point here

3:24:33.360 --> 3:24:35.440
 because he's ducking and diving between this eye.

3:24:35.440 --> 3:24:38.680
 So if I facsimile you into a robot,

3:24:38.680 --> 3:24:41.840
 then your robot might be,

3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:43.280
 would be a representation of you now,

3:24:43.280 --> 3:24:44.340
 but fundamentally be boring

3:24:44.340 --> 3:24:45.640
 because you go and have other ideas.

3:24:45.640 --> 3:24:47.740
 If, however, you built an architecture

3:24:47.740 --> 3:24:50.120
 that itself is capable of generating novelty,

3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:52.040
 you would diverge in your causal chain

3:24:52.040 --> 3:24:54.960
 and you'd both be equally interesting to interact with.

3:24:54.960 --> 3:24:56.360
 We don't know that mechanism.

3:24:56.360 --> 3:24:58.540
 All I'm trying to say is we don't yet know that mechanism.

3:24:58.540 --> 3:25:01.200
 We do not know the mechanism that generates novelty.

3:25:01.200 --> 3:25:05.280
 And at the moment in our AIs, we are emulating,

3:25:05.280 --> 3:25:07.280
 we are not generating.

3:25:07.280 --> 3:25:09.000
 You don't think we're sneaking up on that?

3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:11.960
 No, no, there is no ghost in the machine.

3:25:13.640 --> 3:25:15.200
 And I want there to be one.

3:25:15.200 --> 3:25:16.440
 I want the same thing you want.

3:25:16.440 --> 3:25:17.260
 Sorry, I was.

3:25:17.260 --> 3:25:18.360
 I know you want that as a human

3:25:18.360 --> 3:25:20.760
 because everything you just said

3:25:20.760 --> 3:25:22.240
 makes you feel more special.

3:25:22.240 --> 3:25:24.440
 I want to be, no, no, no, screw my specialness.

3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:26.100
 I just want to be surprised.

3:25:26.100 --> 3:25:26.940
 If I.

3:25:26.940 --> 3:25:28.280
 You don't think a robot can surprise you.

3:25:28.280 --> 3:25:30.600
 If I, if you can produce an algorithm

3:25:30.600 --> 3:25:32.760
 instantiated in a robot to surprise me,

3:25:32.760 --> 3:25:35.360
 I will, I will, I will, I will,

3:25:35.360 --> 3:25:37.520
 I will have one of those robots, it'll be brilliant.

3:25:37.520 --> 3:25:39.920
 But they won't, it won't surprise me.

3:25:39.920 --> 3:25:41.560
 But why, why is it a problem

3:25:41.560 --> 3:25:44.360
 to think that humans are special?

3:25:44.360 --> 3:25:45.880
 Maybe it's not the special, you're right.

3:25:45.880 --> 3:25:47.800
 It's the better than.

3:25:47.800 --> 3:25:48.640
 Yes.

3:25:48.640 --> 3:25:51.460
 Because then you start to not recognize

3:25:51.460 --> 3:25:53.320
 the magic in other life forms

3:25:53.320 --> 3:25:56.320
 that you either have created or you have observed.

3:25:56.320 --> 3:25:58.160
 Because I just think there is magic

3:25:58.160 --> 3:26:01.720
 in legged robots moving about.

3:26:01.720 --> 3:26:03.400
 And they are full of surprises.

3:26:03.400 --> 3:26:04.220
 Yeah.

3:26:04.220 --> 3:26:05.060
 So this is.

3:26:05.060 --> 3:26:06.000
 And functionality.

3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:07.040
 Yeah.

3:26:07.040 --> 3:26:08.400
 So I'm a little.

3:26:09.560 --> 3:26:11.640
 I know why you like cellular automata, right?

3:26:11.640 --> 3:26:14.480
 But the specialness in your robot

3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:17.680
 comes from the roboticist that built it.

3:26:19.240 --> 3:26:20.080
 Yeah.

3:26:20.080 --> 3:26:21.120
 It's part of the lineage.

3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:21.960
 Yeah.

3:26:21.960 --> 3:26:22.780
 And so that's fine.

3:26:22.780 --> 3:26:23.620
 I'm happy with that.

3:26:23.620 --> 3:26:25.280
 That's what I felt like looking at the standing robot

3:26:25.280 --> 3:26:27.160
 was I was looking at four billion years of evolution.

3:26:27.160 --> 3:26:28.000
 Yeah. Right.

3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:28.840
 If it wasn't.

3:26:28.840 --> 3:26:29.760
 So I think I'm happy.

3:26:29.760 --> 3:26:31.800
 I mean, I'm happy we're gonna coexist.

3:26:31.800 --> 3:26:33.560
 I'm just saying you're gonna get more excitement.

3:26:33.560 --> 3:26:34.400
 There's something missing

3:26:34.400 --> 3:26:36.000
 in our understanding of intelligence.

3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:38.360
 Intelligence isn't just training.

3:26:39.400 --> 3:26:41.560
 The way the neural network is conceived right now is great

3:26:41.560 --> 3:26:43.040
 and it's lovely and it'll be better

3:26:43.040 --> 3:26:44.080
 and we will argue forever.

3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:47.440
 But you want to know, wouldn't it be great if I said,

3:26:47.440 --> 3:26:49.620
 look, I know how to invent an architecture

3:26:49.620 --> 3:26:51.520
 and I can give it a soul.

3:26:51.520 --> 3:26:54.400
 And what I mean by a soul is some,

3:26:54.400 --> 3:26:58.800
 I know for real that there is internal reference.

3:26:58.800 --> 3:27:00.960
 Soon as I not fake internal reference.

3:27:00.960 --> 3:27:02.600
 And if we could generate that mechanism

3:27:02.600 --> 3:27:04.680
 for internal reference, that's why our goal direct.

3:27:04.680 --> 3:27:07.200
 That's why you have to develop a test for goal directness.

3:27:07.200 --> 3:27:08.240
 Get that goal directness.

3:27:08.240 --> 3:27:09.840
 You would love that robot more than the one

3:27:09.840 --> 3:27:12.960
 that's just made to look like it does

3:27:12.960 --> 3:27:14.280
 because you'll have more fun with it

3:27:14.280 --> 3:27:17.840
 because you better generate search, other problems,

3:27:17.840 --> 3:27:18.680
 get to more novelty.

3:27:18.680 --> 3:27:21.440
 Hell, you'd be able to fall in love with that robot for real,

3:27:21.440 --> 3:27:23.080
 but not the one that's faking it.

3:27:24.620 --> 3:27:26.600
 What about fake it till you make it?

3:27:26.600 --> 3:27:31.600
 Well, I think a lot of people fall in love with fake humans.

3:27:33.680 --> 3:27:36.760
 It's nice to fall in love with something

3:27:36.760 --> 3:27:38.720
 that's full of novelty, yes.

3:27:38.720 --> 3:27:41.540
 I could imagine all kinds of robots

3:27:41.540 --> 3:27:44.280
 that I would want to have a close relationship with.

3:27:44.280 --> 3:27:47.320
 And I don't mean like sexual, I mean like intimacy.

3:27:47.320 --> 3:27:52.320
 But I just don't think that novelty generation

3:27:52.380 --> 3:27:53.680
 is such a special.

3:27:53.680 --> 3:27:57.960
 Okay, there's like mathematical novelty

3:27:57.960 --> 3:27:58.800
 or something like that,

3:27:58.800 --> 3:28:00.760
 and then there's just humans being surprised.

3:28:00.760 --> 3:28:02.720
 I think we're easily surprised.

3:28:02.720 --> 3:28:04.040
 That's fine, but that's that.

3:28:04.040 --> 3:28:05.760
 But you don't think that's a good definition of novelty?

3:28:05.760 --> 3:28:06.600
 No, that's good.

3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:07.560
 I'm happy to be surprised,

3:28:09.760 --> 3:28:11.880
 but not globally surprised because someone else,

3:28:11.880 --> 3:28:14.360
 but I really want, I was wondering why I'm a scientist.

3:28:14.360 --> 3:28:18.480
 I really want to be the first to be surprised about something

3:28:18.480 --> 3:28:21.040
 and the first thing in the universe

3:28:21.040 --> 3:28:22.400
 to create that novelty

3:28:22.400 --> 3:28:24.000
 and to know for sure that that novelty

3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:26.120
 has never occurred anywhere else.

3:28:26.120 --> 3:28:27.520
 That's a real buzz, right?

3:28:27.520 --> 3:28:29.400
 Is there a way to really know that?

3:28:29.400 --> 3:28:31.480
 You have to have a really big lookup table.

3:28:31.480 --> 3:28:32.320
 Right.

3:28:32.320 --> 3:28:34.000
 Yeah, you're never going to be know for sure, right?

3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:36.760
 That's one of the hard things about being

3:28:36.760 --> 3:28:38.840
 a scientist searching for this type of novelty.

3:28:38.840 --> 3:28:43.400
 Maybe that's why mathematics, mathematicians love discovery,

3:28:43.400 --> 3:28:44.820
 but actually they are creating.

3:28:44.820 --> 3:28:48.860
 And then when they create a new mathematical structure

3:28:48.860 --> 3:28:52.160
 that they can then, you can write code to work out

3:28:52.160 --> 3:28:54.840
 whether that structure exists before that.

3:28:54.840 --> 3:28:57.240
 That's almost why I would love to have been a mathematician

3:28:57.240 --> 3:28:59.700
 from that regard to invent new math

3:28:59.700 --> 3:29:02.200
 that really I know pretty much for sure

3:29:02.200 --> 3:29:04.480
 does not exist anywhere else in the universe

3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:05.840
 because it's so contingent.

3:29:05.840 --> 3:29:08.600
 Right, but this gets into like you said a few times

3:29:08.600 --> 3:29:09.800
 that I still really don't understand

3:29:09.800 --> 3:29:11.500
 how you actually plan to do this,

3:29:11.500 --> 3:29:13.500
 to build an experiment that detects

3:29:13.500 --> 3:29:14.960
 how the universe is generating novelty

3:29:14.960 --> 3:29:16.760
 or that time is the mechanism.

3:29:16.760 --> 3:29:18.860
 So the problem that we all have,

3:29:18.860 --> 3:29:20.600
 which I think is what Lex is pushing against

3:29:20.600 --> 3:29:23.140
 is if I build the experiment,

3:29:23.140 --> 3:29:24.840
 you don't know what you put into it.

3:29:24.840 --> 3:29:27.200
 So you don't know what, like if you,

3:29:27.200 --> 3:29:29.280
 unless you can quantify everything you put in,

3:29:29.280 --> 3:29:31.720
 all of your agency, all the boundary conditions,

3:29:31.720 --> 3:29:36.020
 you don't know if you somehow biased it in some way.

3:29:36.020 --> 3:29:38.600
 So is the novelty actually intrinsic to that experiment

3:29:38.600 --> 3:29:40.920
 or to that robot, or is it something you gave it,

3:29:40.920 --> 3:29:41.760
 but you didn't realize you gave it?

3:29:41.760 --> 3:29:44.360
 It's gonna be, it's gonna asymptote towards that, right?

3:29:44.360 --> 3:29:45.740
 You're never gonna know for sure,

3:29:45.740 --> 3:29:47.280
 but you can start to take out,

3:29:47.280 --> 3:29:50.040
 you can use good Bayesian approaches

3:29:50.040 --> 3:29:52.360
 and just keep updating and updating and updating

3:29:52.360 --> 3:29:54.200
 until you point to one sense of purpose.

3:29:54.200 --> 3:29:56.720
 So you wanna bound on how much novelty generation

3:29:56.720 --> 3:29:59.000
 it could be, got it.

3:29:59.000 --> 3:30:01.080
 So the ability to generate novelty

3:30:01.080 --> 3:30:03.640
 is correlated with high assembly index,

3:30:03.640 --> 3:30:04.600
 with assembly index?

3:30:04.600 --> 3:30:05.600
 Yeah, and yeah.

3:30:07.720 --> 3:30:09.920
 Cause the space of possibilities is bigger.

3:30:11.440 --> 3:30:14.480
 So that's the key.

3:30:14.480 --> 3:30:17.040
 This could be a good, so I have a running joke

3:30:17.040 --> 3:30:18.480
 of like why Lex is single.

3:30:18.480 --> 3:30:20.480
 This could be a good part four.

3:30:22.400 --> 3:30:26.360
 So what you're looking for in a robot partner

3:30:26.360 --> 3:30:28.740
 is ability to generate novelty.

3:30:33.520 --> 3:30:35.240
 And that's, I suppose you would say

3:30:35.240 --> 3:30:37.360
 it's a good definition of intelligence too.

3:30:40.580 --> 3:30:45.580
 Boy, is novelty a fuzzy concept.

3:30:45.580 --> 3:30:46.940
 Is creativity better?

3:30:47.940 --> 3:30:50.620
 Yeah, I mean, that's all pretty fuzzy.

3:30:50.620 --> 3:30:52.340
 It's kind of the same.

3:30:52.340 --> 3:30:54.340
 Maybe that's why aliens haven't come yet

3:30:54.340 --> 3:30:55.980
 is cause we're not creating enough novelty.

3:30:55.980 --> 3:30:58.100
 Like there's some kind of a hierarchy

3:30:58.100 --> 3:30:59.420
 of novelty in the universe.

3:30:59.420 --> 3:31:02.060
 Well, I think novelty is like things surprise you, right?

3:31:02.060 --> 3:31:03.380
 So it's a very passive thing,

3:31:03.380 --> 3:31:05.660
 but I guess what I meant by saying creativity

3:31:05.660 --> 3:31:06.740
 is I think it's much more active.

3:31:06.740 --> 3:31:09.020
 Like you think there's like a mechanism

3:31:09.020 --> 3:31:11.660
 of like the things that exist are generating the creativity.

3:31:11.660 --> 3:31:14.140
 Novelty seems to be there's some spontaneousness

3:31:14.140 --> 3:31:16.980
 and it's completely decoupled from the things that exist.

3:31:16.980 --> 3:31:17.820
 No, I understand.

3:31:17.820 --> 3:31:22.020
 I think creativity is the mechanism

3:31:22.020 --> 3:31:23.860
 and novelty is the observable.

3:31:23.860 --> 3:31:24.900
 Yeah.

3:31:24.900 --> 3:31:26.660
 Novelty could just be surprising.

3:31:26.660 --> 3:31:29.140
 Your model of the world was broken

3:31:29.140 --> 3:31:31.260
 and not necessarily in a positive way.

3:31:31.260 --> 3:31:32.100
 That's surprise.

3:31:32.100 --> 3:31:32.940
 So there's three things now.

3:31:32.940 --> 3:31:33.780
 Let's go back.

3:31:33.780 --> 3:31:34.600
 It's cool.

3:31:34.600 --> 3:31:35.440
 All right, let's go.

3:31:35.440 --> 3:31:37.140
 You got surprise, which is basically,

3:31:37.140 --> 3:31:38.900
 I mean, I'm surprised all the time

3:31:38.900 --> 3:31:39.900
 cause I don't read very much.

3:31:39.900 --> 3:31:40.740
 I'm pretty dumb.

3:31:40.740 --> 3:31:42.060
 I was like, oh wow, this is,

3:31:42.060 --> 3:31:44.620
 I often used to invent new scientific, you know, ideas.

3:31:44.620 --> 3:31:46.380
 And I was really surprised by that.

3:31:46.380 --> 3:31:47.540
 And then I went and looked in literature properly

3:31:47.540 --> 3:31:48.380
 and it's there.

3:31:48.380 --> 3:31:50.260
 So surprise, that's to the extent

3:31:50.260 --> 3:31:52.180
 that you don't have full information.

3:31:53.300 --> 3:31:57.820
 Creativity, the act of pushing on that kind of

3:31:57.820 --> 3:32:01.540
 on the causal structure and novelty,

3:32:01.540 --> 3:32:04.580
 which is measuring that degree, right?

3:32:04.580 --> 3:32:07.540
 So, and I think that's pretty well defined in that regard.

3:32:07.540 --> 3:32:09.340
 So you want your robot, I mean,

3:32:09.340 --> 3:32:10.740
 and in the end, this is what I'm saying,

3:32:10.740 --> 3:32:13.620
 and in the end, that's why actually the way the internet

3:32:13.620 --> 3:32:16.620
 and the printing press share some,

3:32:16.620 --> 3:32:18.700
 I actually think creativity has dropped a bit

3:32:18.700 --> 3:32:21.620
 since the internet because everyone's just, you know,

3:32:21.620 --> 3:32:23.020
 just regurgitating stuff.

3:32:23.020 --> 3:32:26.140
 But of course, now it's beginning to accelerate again

3:32:26.140 --> 3:32:28.820
 cause everyone's using this tool to be creative

3:32:28.820 --> 3:32:31.260
 and boom, it's exploding.

3:32:31.260 --> 3:32:32.320
 I think that's what happens

3:32:32.320 --> 3:32:34.620
 when you create these new technologies.

3:32:34.620 --> 3:32:35.980
 That's really helpful.

3:32:35.980 --> 3:32:38.260
 There's a difference between novelty and surprise.

3:32:38.260 --> 3:32:40.980
 Okay, I think I was thinking about surprise.

3:32:40.980 --> 3:32:43.100
 If you give me a toy that surprises me for a bit,

3:32:43.100 --> 3:32:43.940
 it'd be great.

3:32:43.940 --> 3:32:45.740
 A robot that surprises me, you know.

3:32:45.740 --> 3:32:46.900
 An experiment that surprises you.

3:32:46.900 --> 3:32:48.580
 Yeah, I mean, that's why I love doing experiments

3:32:48.580 --> 3:32:49.540
 cause I'm, I can't.

3:32:49.540 --> 3:32:50.660
 It's still exciting.

3:32:50.660 --> 3:32:51.980
 Yeah. Surprise is exciting.

3:32:51.980 --> 3:32:53.060
 Yeah.

3:32:53.060 --> 3:32:54.220
 Even negative surprise,

3:32:54.220 --> 3:32:56.460
 like some people love drama in relationships.

3:32:56.460 --> 3:33:01.380
 Like, it's like, why the hell, why'd you do this?

3:33:01.380 --> 3:33:02.620
 That could be exciting too.

3:33:02.620 --> 3:33:04.420
 I could imagine companies selling updates

3:33:04.420 --> 3:33:05.980
 to their companion robots

3:33:05.980 --> 3:33:08.260
 that just basically generate negative surprise

3:33:08.260 --> 3:33:10.020
 just to spice things up a bit.

3:33:10.020 --> 3:33:11.580
 Yeah, it's the push and pull.

3:33:11.580 --> 3:33:13.980
 That's one of the components of love.

3:33:13.980 --> 3:33:16.580
 As you said, love is a complicated thing.

3:33:16.580 --> 3:33:17.700
 Oh, beauty.

3:33:17.700 --> 3:33:19.900
 I wanted to mention this cause you also tweeted,

3:33:19.900 --> 3:33:21.240
 I think this was Sarah.

3:33:21.240 --> 3:33:22.220
 No, it might've been Lee.

3:33:22.220 --> 3:33:23.180
 I don't remember.

3:33:23.180 --> 3:33:25.020
 But it was a survey published in Nature

3:33:25.020 --> 3:33:26.660
 showing that scientists find.

3:33:26.660 --> 3:33:27.540
 That was me, yeah.

3:33:27.540 --> 3:33:28.940
 Yeah.

3:33:28.940 --> 3:33:31.020
 Anyway, there's a plot.

3:33:31.020 --> 3:33:33.320
 This is published in Nature

3:33:33.320 --> 3:33:36.780
 of what scientists find beautiful in their work

3:33:36.780 --> 3:33:39.260
 and it separates biologists and physicists.

3:33:39.260 --> 3:33:41.780
 It'd be nice if you showed the full plot.

3:33:41.780 --> 3:33:44.660
 And there's simplicity, elegance, hidden order,

3:33:45.540 --> 3:33:48.340
 inner logic of systems, symmetry, complexity, harmony,

3:33:48.340 --> 3:33:49.580
 and so on.

3:33:49.580 --> 3:33:53.100
 Is there any interesting things that stand out to you?

3:33:53.100 --> 3:33:56.020
 I think the fact that biologists like complexity

3:33:56.020 --> 3:33:57.360
 and pleasing colors.

3:33:59.260 --> 3:34:00.440
 Oh, there's pleasing colors on there?

3:34:00.440 --> 3:34:01.280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:34:01.280 --> 3:34:02.120
 Or shapes.

3:34:02.120 --> 3:34:02.940
 Or shapes.

3:34:02.940 --> 3:34:03.780
 Pleasing colors or shapes.

3:34:03.780 --> 3:34:06.100
 And then physicists obviously love simplicity

3:34:06.100 --> 3:34:06.920
 above all else.

3:34:06.920 --> 3:34:07.760
 Simplicity and elegance.

3:34:07.760 --> 3:34:09.140
 Simplicity, elegance.

3:34:09.140 --> 3:34:09.980
 Yeah.

3:34:09.980 --> 3:34:11.180
 They love symmetry.

3:34:11.180 --> 3:34:14.640
 And then biologists love complexity.

3:34:14.640 --> 3:34:17.840
 And, well, they just love a little bit less.

3:34:17.840 --> 3:34:19.420
 They love everything a little bit less,

3:34:19.420 --> 3:34:21.020
 but complexity a little bit more.

3:34:21.020 --> 3:34:22.340
 A little bit more.

3:34:22.340 --> 3:34:23.220
 That's so interesting.

3:34:23.220 --> 3:34:25.220
 And pleasing colors or shapes.

3:34:25.220 --> 3:34:26.220
 Do you think it's a useful,

3:34:26.220 --> 3:34:27.540
 I forget what your tweet was

3:34:27.540 --> 3:34:29.220
 that this is missing some of the something.

3:34:29.220 --> 3:34:31.860
 Oh, no, I think it's because I think about

3:34:31.860 --> 3:34:36.460
 how explanations become causal to our future.

3:34:36.460 --> 3:34:39.060
 So I have this whole philosophy

3:34:39.060 --> 3:34:42.300
 that the theories we build

3:34:42.300 --> 3:34:44.380
 and the way we describe reality

3:34:44.380 --> 3:34:49.380
 should have the largest breadth of possibilities

3:34:49.380 --> 3:34:52.760
 for the future of what we can accomplish.

3:34:52.760 --> 3:34:55.840
 So in some sense, it's not like Occam's razor.

3:34:55.840 --> 3:34:56.920
 It's not for simplicity.

3:34:56.920 --> 3:35:00.060
 It's for optimism or the kind of future you can build.

3:35:00.060 --> 3:35:03.620
 And so I think you have to think this way

3:35:03.620 --> 3:35:05.800
 when you're thinking about life and alien life,

3:35:05.800 --> 3:35:07.780
 because ultimately we're trying to build,

3:35:07.780 --> 3:35:09.220
 I mean, science is just basically

3:35:09.220 --> 3:35:10.980
 our narratives about reality.

3:35:10.980 --> 3:35:12.180
 And now you're building a narrative

3:35:12.180 --> 3:35:14.260
 that is what we are as physical systems.

3:35:14.260 --> 3:35:16.300
 It seems to me it needs to be as positive as possible

3:35:16.300 --> 3:35:18.300
 because it's basically gonna shape

3:35:18.300 --> 3:35:20.020
 the future trajectory where we're going.

3:35:20.020 --> 3:35:22.460
 And we don't use that as a heuristic in theory building

3:35:22.460 --> 3:35:23.700
 because we think theories

3:35:25.700 --> 3:35:27.500
 are about predicting features of the world,

3:35:27.500 --> 3:35:28.820
 not causing them.

3:35:28.820 --> 3:35:30.660
 But if you look at the history of all of the development

3:35:30.660 --> 3:35:33.020
 of human thought, it's caused the things that happen next.

3:35:33.020 --> 3:35:35.460
 So it's not just about looking at the world

3:35:35.460 --> 3:35:36.340
 and observing it.

3:35:36.340 --> 3:35:41.220
 It's about actually that feedback loop that's missing.

3:35:41.220 --> 3:35:43.840
 And it's not in any of those categories.

3:35:46.060 --> 3:35:50.900
 What do you think is the most beautiful idea

3:35:50.900 --> 3:35:54.780
 in the physics of life, in the chemistry of life,

3:35:54.780 --> 3:35:57.420
 in this, through all your exploration

3:35:57.420 --> 3:36:02.420
 with assembly theory, what is the thing

3:36:03.840 --> 3:36:08.840
 that made you step back and say this idea is beautiful

3:36:09.340 --> 3:36:10.760
 or potentially beautiful?

3:36:11.700 --> 3:36:14.360
 For me, it's that the universe is a creative place.

3:36:14.360 --> 3:36:18.060
 I guess I want to think, and whether it's true or not,

3:36:18.060 --> 3:36:20.800
 is that we are special in some way

3:36:20.800 --> 3:36:24.940
 and it's not like an arbitrary added on epiphenomenon

3:36:24.940 --> 3:36:26.840
 or ad hoc feature of the universe that we exist,

3:36:26.840 --> 3:36:28.580
 but it's something deep and intrinsic

3:36:28.580 --> 3:36:30.060
 to the structure of reality.

3:36:31.100 --> 3:36:33.220
 And to me, the most beautiful ideas that come out of that

3:36:33.220 --> 3:36:37.380
 is that the reason we exist is for the universe

3:36:37.380 --> 3:36:40.420
 to generate more things and to think about itself

3:36:40.420 --> 3:36:45.420
 and use that as a mechanism for creating more stuff.

3:36:47.060 --> 3:36:48.660
 That's for me.

3:36:48.660 --> 3:36:53.660
 So like the life that this, however common it is,

3:36:53.660 --> 3:36:57.500
 is an intrinsic part, is a fundamental part

3:36:57.500 --> 3:36:59.940
 of this universe, at least, that we live in.

3:36:59.940 --> 3:37:00.780
 I think so.

3:37:00.780 --> 3:37:02.020
 I mean, it's always interesting to me

3:37:02.020 --> 3:37:06.460
 because we have theories of quantum mechanics and gravity

3:37:06.460 --> 3:37:07.620
 and they're supposed to be like

3:37:07.620 --> 3:37:09.700
 our most fundamental theories right now.

3:37:09.700 --> 3:37:12.060
 And they describe things like the interaction

3:37:12.060 --> 3:37:15.380
 of massive bodies or the way that charges accelerate

3:37:15.380 --> 3:37:17.300
 or all these kind of features.

3:37:17.300 --> 3:37:19.620
 And they're these really deep theories

3:37:19.620 --> 3:37:21.340
 and they tell us a lot about how reality works,

3:37:21.340 --> 3:37:24.060
 but they're completely agnostic to our existence.

3:37:24.060 --> 3:37:26.820
 And I can't help but think that whatever describes us

3:37:26.820 --> 3:37:28.420
 has to be even deeper than that.

3:37:29.420 --> 3:37:33.860
 And I think incorporating memory, I guess,

3:37:33.860 --> 3:37:35.860
 causality, whatever the term you want to use

3:37:35.860 --> 3:37:38.660
 into the physics view of the world might be.

3:37:38.660 --> 3:37:40.700
 That's the easiest way to do it.

3:37:40.700 --> 3:37:42.660
 It's the cleanest, so here we go again

3:37:42.660 --> 3:37:44.260
 with the physicist, I'm a physicist.

3:37:44.260 --> 3:37:45.980
 The cleanest, I was gonna say the simplest,

3:37:45.980 --> 3:37:49.100
 most elegant way of resolving all of the kind of ways

3:37:49.100 --> 3:37:53.060
 that we have these paradoxes associated with life

3:37:53.060 --> 3:37:55.380
 when you, it's not that life is not,

3:37:56.500 --> 3:37:59.260
 current physics is not incompatible with life,

3:37:59.260 --> 3:38:00.660
 but it doesn't explain life.

3:38:00.660 --> 3:38:04.260
 And then you want to know where are the explanatory gaps

3:38:04.260 --> 3:38:06.340
 and this idea that we have an assembly

3:38:06.340 --> 3:38:10.020
 that time is fundamental and objects actually

3:38:10.020 --> 3:38:12.940
 are extended in time and have physical extent in time

3:38:12.940 --> 3:38:14.180
 is the cleanest way of resolving

3:38:14.180 --> 3:38:16.540
 a lot of the explanatory gaps.

3:38:16.540 --> 3:38:20.060
 So I've been, I struggled with assembly theory

3:38:20.060 --> 3:38:22.900
 for many years, because I could see this gap.

3:38:24.220 --> 3:38:26.700
 And I think when I first met Sarah

3:38:26.700 --> 3:38:30.660
 and we realized we were kind of talking

3:38:30.660 --> 3:38:32.740
 about the same problem, but we were,

3:38:32.740 --> 3:38:34.620
 we understood another language.

3:38:34.620 --> 3:38:35.900
 It was quite hilarious actually,

3:38:35.900 --> 3:38:37.820
 because it's like, I have no idea what you're talking about,

3:38:37.820 --> 3:38:40.140
 but I think it sounds right.

3:38:40.140 --> 3:38:42.660
 So for me, the most beautiful thing about assembly theory

3:38:42.660 --> 3:38:45.620
 is I realized the assembly theory explains

3:38:45.620 --> 3:38:47.540
 why the universe, why life is the universe

3:38:47.540 --> 3:38:51.380
 developing a memory, but not only that poetically,

3:38:51.380 --> 3:38:53.460
 I could actually go and measure it.

3:38:53.460 --> 3:38:56.580
 And I was like, holy shit, we would just,

3:38:56.580 --> 3:38:59.180
 we physically measured this thing,

3:38:59.180 --> 3:39:01.860
 this abstract thing, and we could measure it.

3:39:01.860 --> 3:39:03.620
 And not only could we measure it,

3:39:03.620 --> 3:39:06.960
 but we can then start to quantify the causal consequences.

3:39:08.500 --> 3:39:13.500
 Because, I mean, I think as a kind of inventing this

3:39:13.500 --> 3:39:17.300
 together with Sarah and her team, I thought

3:39:17.300 --> 3:39:19.700
 there was a quite a high chance that,

3:39:19.700 --> 3:39:22.220
 we're doing science, there's such a high probability

3:39:22.220 --> 3:39:25.300
 we're wrong on this.

3:39:25.300 --> 3:39:30.300
 And I remember kind of trying to go to hard physicists,

3:39:31.300 --> 3:39:34.100
 mathematicians, complexity theorists,

3:39:34.100 --> 3:39:36.400
 and everyone just kind of giving me

3:39:36.400 --> 3:39:38.660
 such a hard time about it.

3:39:38.660 --> 3:39:40.860
 And so, this is kind of, you've just done this,

3:39:40.860 --> 3:39:43.980
 you've just done that, you've just recapitulated

3:39:43.980 --> 3:39:45.620
 an old theory.

3:39:45.620 --> 3:39:49.780
 And I was unable, I lacked the language to really explain,

3:39:49.780 --> 3:39:52.140
 and I had to, it was a real struggle.

3:39:52.140 --> 3:39:55.940
 So this realization that life, what life does

3:39:55.940 --> 3:39:58.840
 that physics cannot understand, or chemistry,

3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:00.780
 is the universe develops a memory

3:40:00.780 --> 3:40:04.780
 that's causally actionable, and then we can measure it,

3:40:04.780 --> 3:40:07.180
 but it isn't just a one thing,

3:40:07.180 --> 3:40:08.620
 there is this intrinsic property

3:40:08.620 --> 3:40:09.740
 of all the objects in the universe.

3:40:09.740 --> 3:40:13.260
 Like I've said before, but me holding up this water bottle,

3:40:13.260 --> 3:40:14.500
 it isn't any other water bottle,

3:40:14.500 --> 3:40:16.300
 but it is a sum total of all the water bottles

3:40:16.300 --> 3:40:18.920
 that have existed, right?

3:40:18.920 --> 3:40:22.700
 And will likely change the future of water bottles

3:40:22.700 --> 3:40:23.580
 and for other objects.

3:40:23.580 --> 3:40:26.580
 So it's this kind of, so for me,

3:40:26.580 --> 3:40:31.460
 assembly theory explains the soul in stuff.

3:40:31.460 --> 3:40:32.700
 The monology.

3:40:32.700 --> 3:40:34.740
 But it is the monology, it's not like

3:40:34.740 --> 3:40:36.300
 Sheldrake's morphic resonance,

3:40:36.300 --> 3:40:37.940
 where we have this kind of wooey thing

3:40:37.940 --> 3:40:40.900
 permeating the universe, it is the interaction

3:40:40.900 --> 3:40:42.540
 of objects of other objects.

3:40:42.540 --> 3:40:46.500
 And some objects have more instantaneous causal power,

3:40:46.500 --> 3:40:51.060
 that's life, living things, and some objects

3:40:51.060 --> 3:40:54.260
 are the instantaneous output of that causal power,

3:40:54.260 --> 3:40:56.260
 dead objects, but they're part of the lineage.

3:40:56.260 --> 3:40:58.980
 And that for me is fascinating and really beautiful.

3:40:58.980 --> 3:41:01.220
 And I think that even if we're determined

3:41:01.220 --> 3:41:04.940
 to be totally wrong, I think it will help us,

3:41:04.940 --> 3:41:07.420
 help hopefully understand what life is

3:41:07.420 --> 3:41:10.300
 and go into tech life elsewhere and make life in the lab.

3:41:10.300 --> 3:41:11.740
 How does that make you feel, by the way?

3:41:11.740 --> 3:41:13.600
 Does it make you feel less special,

3:41:13.600 --> 3:41:16.100
 that you're so deeply integrated,

3:41:16.100 --> 3:41:18.180
 interconnected to the lineage?

3:41:18.180 --> 3:41:20.460
 I mean, okay, on one level, I just wanted in my life

3:41:20.460 --> 3:41:23.020
 as a scientist, I wanted to have an interesting idea

3:41:23.020 --> 3:41:25.540
 just once or an original idea.

3:41:25.540 --> 3:41:29.680
 I mean, it was like, you know, so I think that was cool

3:41:29.680 --> 3:41:31.580
 that we had this idea and we were playing with it.

3:41:31.580 --> 3:41:34.740
 And I think also that I kind of, I mean,

3:41:34.740 --> 3:41:37.540
 it took me ages to realize that Sarah had also had

3:41:37.540 --> 3:41:40.300
 the same kind of form, coming towards the same formulation

3:41:40.300 --> 3:41:43.980
 just from a completely different point because I,

3:41:43.980 --> 3:41:45.340
 but no, it makes me feel special.

3:41:45.340 --> 3:41:47.020
 And it also makes me feel connected to the universe.

3:41:47.020 --> 3:41:50.980
 It also makes me feel not just humble about, you know,

3:41:50.980 --> 3:41:53.540
 being a living object in the universe,

3:41:53.540 --> 3:41:55.660
 but the fact that it makes me really optimistic

3:41:55.660 --> 3:41:58.180
 about what the universe is gonna do in the future

3:41:58.180 --> 3:42:02.780
 because we're not just isolated phenomena, we are connected.

3:42:02.780 --> 3:42:06.140
 I will be able to have, you know, one of my small objectives

3:42:06.140 --> 3:42:08.740
 in life is to change the future of the universe

3:42:08.740 --> 3:42:12.340
 in some profound way, just by existing.

3:42:12.340 --> 3:42:14.360
 Yeah, that's not ambitious at all.

3:42:14.360 --> 3:42:15.200
 Uh.

3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:21.980
 I think it's also good because it makes me feel less lonely

3:42:21.980 --> 3:42:23.340
 because I just realized I'm not like,

3:42:23.340 --> 3:42:24.940
 I mean, I'm a unique assembly structure,

3:42:24.940 --> 3:42:27.100
 but I have so much overlap with the other entities

3:42:27.100 --> 3:42:31.500
 I interact with that we're not completely individual, right?

3:42:31.500 --> 3:42:36.500
 And yet your existence does have a huge amount of impact

3:42:37.340 --> 3:42:41.420
 on how this whole thing unrolls on the future of the world.

3:42:41.420 --> 3:42:43.540
 As individuals, that's, yeah.

3:42:43.540 --> 3:42:45.860
 But I was gonna say. Local packets of agency.

3:42:45.860 --> 3:42:48.340
 I think we all have a profound impact on the future,

3:42:48.340 --> 3:42:49.460
 some more than others, right?

3:42:49.460 --> 3:42:50.900
 All human beings, all life.

3:42:50.900 --> 3:42:53.900
 And I mean, that's why I think it's a privilege

3:42:53.900 --> 3:42:55.500
 in a way for, you know, to say,

3:42:55.500 --> 3:42:59.100
 to assert some degree of ego and agency,

3:42:59.100 --> 3:43:00.460
 you know, I'm gonna make a computer

3:43:00.460 --> 3:43:02.740
 or make an origin life machine or we can do this thing.

3:43:02.740 --> 3:43:04.100
 But actually it's just like, you know,

3:43:04.100 --> 3:43:07.060
 my life's probably living, if there is a God

3:43:07.060 --> 3:43:08.660
 or there's a soul in everything,

3:43:08.660 --> 3:43:10.380
 it's really laughing at us going,

3:43:10.380 --> 3:43:12.420
 I fool these guys by giving them ego.

3:43:12.420 --> 3:43:14.500
 So they strive for this stuff and look what it does

3:43:14.500 --> 3:43:17.900
 for the assembly space of the universe.

3:43:17.900 --> 3:43:18.940
 And there's always a possibility

3:43:18.940 --> 3:43:20.380
 that science can't answer all of it.

3:43:20.380 --> 3:43:23.340
 So that part's challenging for me.

3:43:23.340 --> 3:43:25.440
 There might be a limit to this thing.

3:43:27.000 --> 3:43:29.660
 Let me ask you a bunch of ridiculous questions

3:43:29.660 --> 3:43:34.140
 and I demand relatively short answers.

3:43:34.140 --> 3:43:36.540
 Lee, what's the scariest thing you've ever done?

3:43:40.980 --> 3:43:43.840
 Or what's a scary thing that pops to mind?

3:43:45.020 --> 3:43:48.500
 Giving seminars in front of other scientists.

3:43:48.500 --> 3:43:50.940
 That's, yeah, that is terrifying.

3:43:50.940 --> 3:43:54.300
 I could, if I had more time,

3:43:54.300 --> 3:43:56.180
 I would ask you about the most embarrassing,

3:43:56.180 --> 3:43:57.460
 but we'll spare you.

3:43:57.460 --> 3:43:59.860
 What about you Sarah, scariest thing?

3:44:01.500 --> 3:44:04.240
 Up there, some of the scary things you've done.

3:44:05.880 --> 3:44:08.260
 Actually the scariest for me was deciding

3:44:08.260 --> 3:44:09.220
 I wanted to get divorced

3:44:09.220 --> 3:44:11.900
 because it was like a totally radical like.

3:44:11.900 --> 3:44:12.740
 Life transformation.

3:44:12.740 --> 3:44:16.100
 Yeah, because we had been married for a really long time.

3:44:16.100 --> 3:44:18.280
 And I think it was just so much like,

3:44:18.280 --> 3:44:21.240
 I realized like so much of my individual agency

3:44:21.240 --> 3:44:22.380
 I didn't realize I had before.

3:44:22.380 --> 3:44:24.920
 And that was just really like scary, like empowering scary,

3:44:24.920 --> 3:44:25.900
 but like terrifying.

3:44:25.900 --> 3:44:28.660
 Like you were living in a kind of one way

3:44:28.660 --> 3:44:29.500
 for your whole life.

3:44:29.500 --> 3:44:31.460
 And then you realized your life could be a different way.

3:44:31.460 --> 3:44:32.300
 And.

3:44:32.300 --> 3:44:33.780
 Yeah, there's a between humans.

3:44:33.780 --> 3:44:36.900
 I mean, that's the beautiful thing about love

3:44:36.900 --> 3:44:38.260
 is the connection you have,

3:44:38.260 --> 3:44:41.040
 but it's also becomes a dependency and breaking that.

3:44:41.040 --> 3:44:43.040
 Whether it's a mentor, what's your parents,

3:44:43.040 --> 3:44:43.880
 your close friends.

3:44:43.880 --> 3:44:44.900
 It's almost like waking up.

3:44:44.900 --> 3:44:46.820
 Like just there's a different reality.

3:44:46.820 --> 3:44:48.040
 Yeah, that was scary.

3:44:48.040 --> 3:44:49.680
 Reinventing yourself.

3:44:49.680 --> 3:44:51.860
 Okay, if you could, Lee,

3:44:51.860 --> 3:44:54.020
 maybe I'll actually we'll alternate.

3:44:54.020 --> 3:44:56.660
 Sarah, if you could be someone else for a day,

3:44:56.660 --> 3:44:57.940
 someone alive today,

3:44:57.940 --> 3:45:00.720
 you haven't met yet, haven't met yet.

3:45:00.720 --> 3:45:02.620
 Or maybe you could do one who you've met.

3:45:02.620 --> 3:45:03.940
 Who would it be?

3:45:03.940 --> 3:45:05.020
 Kim Kardashian.

3:45:06.020 --> 3:45:07.460
 No joke.

3:45:07.460 --> 3:45:08.420
 The woman's brilliant.

3:45:08.420 --> 3:45:09.660
 I would just like to experience,

3:45:09.660 --> 3:45:12.740
 like I just, I think she's got such an interesting

3:45:14.020 --> 3:45:16.660
 and very deep understanding of social reality.

3:45:16.660 --> 3:45:19.220
 But you also said you have appreciation

3:45:19.220 --> 3:45:20.340
 of love for fashion.

3:45:20.340 --> 3:45:21.340
 I do.

3:45:21.340 --> 3:45:22.900
 But that's actually the same.

3:45:22.900 --> 3:45:24.380
 Like I just think it's really interesting

3:45:24.380 --> 3:45:25.620
 because we live in a social reality

3:45:25.620 --> 3:45:27.860
 which is completely artificially constructed.

3:45:27.860 --> 3:45:30.220
 And some people are really genius about moving through that.

3:45:30.220 --> 3:45:31.620
 And I think she's particularly good at it.

3:45:31.620 --> 3:45:33.940
 I wonder if she's good at understanding or if she's just.

3:45:33.940 --> 3:45:35.620
 I think it's very deeply intrinsic to her.

3:45:35.620 --> 3:45:36.460
 So I don't know if she has much.

3:45:36.460 --> 3:45:37.700
 She's like surfing a wave.

3:45:37.700 --> 3:45:39.500
 How much cognitive awareness she has of it

3:45:39.500 --> 3:45:40.500
 or how strategic it is.

3:45:40.500 --> 3:45:42.160
 But I think it's deeply fascinating.

3:45:42.160 --> 3:45:44.740
 So I guess that's the first one that comes to mind.

3:45:44.740 --> 3:45:45.660
 What about you, Lee?

3:45:45.660 --> 3:45:47.820
 If you could be somebody for a day.

3:45:47.820 --> 3:45:48.940
 Don't say Yoshua Bach.

3:45:49.940 --> 3:45:51.700
 Don't say Kim Kardashian.

3:45:51.700 --> 3:45:53.020
 Let's do it off the table.

3:45:53.020 --> 3:45:53.980
 Off the table.

3:45:53.980 --> 3:45:56.260
 No, I was gonna say I would like to be a,

3:45:57.220 --> 3:45:58.100
 does it have to be here today?

3:45:58.100 --> 3:46:03.100
 I was gonna say I'd like to be the latest arm processor.

3:46:04.900 --> 3:46:06.300
 Interesting.

3:46:06.300 --> 3:46:07.740
 I would like to be the latest arm processor.

3:46:07.740 --> 3:46:09.980
 I'd like to understand.

3:46:09.980 --> 3:46:12.540
 I would like to know what it feel like to basically.

3:46:14.180 --> 3:46:15.180
 You like being objects.

3:46:15.180 --> 3:46:16.020
 I like being objects.

3:46:16.020 --> 3:46:17.460
 I've always obsessed with being objects

3:46:17.460 --> 3:46:18.460
 ever since I was a kid.

3:46:18.460 --> 3:46:21.180
 What's the best part of being an arm processor for a day?

3:46:21.180 --> 3:46:23.460
 I mean, I'd like to understand how I access my memory,

3:46:23.460 --> 3:46:25.900
 what it anticipates coming next in clock cycles.

3:46:25.900 --> 3:46:27.620
 What about how it feels like?

3:46:27.620 --> 3:46:30.260
 Yeah, I wanna know how it feels like to be.

3:46:30.260 --> 3:46:31.100
 To be useful.

3:46:33.020 --> 3:46:33.860
 Thanks for that.

3:46:37.420 --> 3:46:42.300
 All right, if, Lee, if everyone on Earth disappeared

3:46:42.300 --> 3:46:45.980
 and it was just you left, what would your days look like?

3:46:45.980 --> 3:46:46.820
 What would you do?

3:46:46.820 --> 3:46:48.820
 Nobody else left to impress.

3:46:48.820 --> 3:46:52.300
 Nobody, no, probably can't really do any real science

3:46:52.300 --> 3:46:53.380
 at scale.

3:46:53.380 --> 3:46:55.700
 What would you do with your remaining days?

3:46:55.700 --> 3:46:59.140
 Get every possible tool I could

3:46:59.140 --> 3:47:01.980
 and put it in my workshop and just make stuff.

3:47:01.980 --> 3:47:04.060
 As, so try to make stuff.

3:47:04.060 --> 3:47:05.180
 Just try and make stuff.

3:47:05.180 --> 3:47:06.020
 Make companions.

3:47:06.020 --> 3:47:08.660
 I'm pretty much making companions probably, yeah.

3:47:08.660 --> 3:47:09.900
 So in the physical space.

3:47:09.900 --> 3:47:11.420
 Yeah.

3:47:11.420 --> 3:47:12.300
 What about you, Sarah?

3:47:12.300 --> 3:47:15.180
 What would you, when you're just left alone on Earth,

3:47:15.180 --> 3:47:16.020
 you're the last person.

3:47:16.020 --> 3:47:17.980
 Are there animals in this scenario?

3:47:17.980 --> 3:47:19.340
 No living beings.

3:47:19.340 --> 3:47:21.020
 No plants?

3:47:21.020 --> 3:47:22.060
 No plants.

3:47:23.340 --> 3:47:24.180
 Oh, interesting.

3:47:24.180 --> 3:47:25.220
 I was gonna say, I would just,

3:47:25.220 --> 3:47:26.820
 I would try to walk the entire planet,

3:47:26.820 --> 3:47:28.900
 at least all the landmass.

3:47:28.900 --> 3:47:29.980
 Well, that's true.

3:47:29.980 --> 3:47:33.860
 So you probably don't know if there's stuff.

3:47:33.860 --> 3:47:36.500
 You could be searching for plants or other humans

3:47:36.500 --> 3:47:38.100
 or other animals. And what would I eat?

3:47:40.980 --> 3:47:44.860
 You just have daily just allotment.

3:47:44.860 --> 3:47:46.020
 I would just walk all the time, I think.

3:47:46.020 --> 3:47:46.900
 Of Soylent.

3:47:46.900 --> 3:47:47.860
 I don't know why.

3:47:47.860 --> 3:47:48.700
 Just walk.

3:47:48.700 --> 3:47:49.540
 That's just what came to mind.

3:47:49.540 --> 3:47:50.380
 You're the explorer.

3:47:50.380 --> 3:47:51.420
 I would just walk.

3:47:51.420 --> 3:47:53.020
 And I guess I would make a goal of covering

3:47:53.020 --> 3:47:54.740
 all of the entire Earth.

3:47:54.740 --> 3:47:56.380
 Because what else are you gonna do with your time?

3:47:56.380 --> 3:47:58.860
 What's an item on your bucket list, Sarah,

3:47:58.860 --> 3:48:01.220
 that you haven't done yet, but you hope to do?

3:48:02.780 --> 3:48:04.180
 Skydiving.

3:48:04.180 --> 3:48:05.420
 Travel to space.

3:48:08.460 --> 3:48:10.100
 I don't know.

3:48:10.100 --> 3:48:11.700
 You know what's funny with my bucket list?

3:48:11.700 --> 3:48:14.300
 I only know it was on my bucket list once I check it off.

3:48:14.300 --> 3:48:15.180
 Once you check it off.

3:48:15.180 --> 3:48:17.060
 So your bucket list is like a fog.

3:48:17.060 --> 3:48:20.020
 It's like a mystery almost by doing it.

3:48:20.020 --> 3:48:22.740
 Yeah, so it's very subconsciously driven.

3:48:22.740 --> 3:48:24.700
 So it's in your subconscious in there.

3:48:24.700 --> 3:48:25.540
 I think so.

3:48:25.540 --> 3:48:26.460
 You're bringing it to the surface.

3:48:26.460 --> 3:48:28.020
 I think most of the steering of our agency

3:48:28.020 --> 3:48:29.140
 is in our subconscious anyway,

3:48:29.140 --> 3:48:30.340
 so I just kind of go with the flow.

3:48:30.340 --> 3:48:33.340
 But I guess, no, seriously.

3:48:33.340 --> 3:48:35.060
 Yeah, no, I get it.

3:48:35.060 --> 3:48:35.900
 I don't know.

3:48:35.900 --> 3:48:37.180
 I guess, but I would like to go on a submarine,

3:48:37.180 --> 3:48:38.020
 like to the bottom of the ocean.

3:48:38.020 --> 3:48:38.980
 I think that'd be really cool.

3:48:38.980 --> 3:48:40.340
 To the bottom of the ocean.

3:48:40.340 --> 3:48:42.500
 Are you captivated by the mystery of the ocean?

3:48:42.500 --> 3:48:43.340
 Like how little you know.

3:48:43.340 --> 3:48:44.180
 I am, yeah.

3:48:44.180 --> 3:48:47.700
 Yeah, what about you, Lee?

3:48:47.700 --> 3:48:50.420
 What item on your bucket list?

3:48:50.420 --> 3:48:51.940
 I don't have a bucket list, but I've just made one.

3:48:51.940 --> 3:48:55.660
 I would love to take a computer to the moon or Mars

3:48:55.660 --> 3:48:57.500
 and make drugs off world.

3:48:57.500 --> 3:49:00.740
 Be the first chemist to make drugs off world.

3:49:00.740 --> 3:49:02.620
 The first drug manufacturer in space.

3:49:02.620 --> 3:49:03.700
 Yeah, why not?

3:49:03.700 --> 3:49:04.540
 Drugs in space.

3:49:04.540 --> 3:49:07.020
 Do they have to be somehow like be able to habitate,

3:49:07.020 --> 3:49:10.600
 like be able to survive on that particular space?

3:49:10.600 --> 3:49:13.420
 Or like what's the connection between being on Mars

3:49:13.420 --> 3:49:14.260
 and doing many things?

3:49:14.260 --> 3:49:15.100
 I just would like to be there.

3:49:15.100 --> 3:49:18.900
 I would like to take the ability to have command

3:49:18.900 --> 3:49:22.500
 and control over chemicals programmatically off earth

3:49:22.500 --> 3:49:24.180
 to somewhere else in the universe.

3:49:24.180 --> 3:49:26.140
 That just seems like you like difficulty

3:49:26.140 --> 3:49:28.740
 engineering problems.

3:49:28.740 --> 3:49:29.940
 Before I die, if I can do that, that's great.

3:49:29.940 --> 3:49:32.180
 Would you travel to space if you could?

3:49:32.180 --> 3:49:33.020
 Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3:49:33.020 --> 3:49:35.820
 I'd love to go into space, but not just to be a tourist.

3:49:35.820 --> 3:49:38.460
 I wanna take scientific experiment in space

3:49:38.460 --> 3:49:41.140
 and do a thing in space that's never been done before.

3:49:41.140 --> 3:49:42.940
 That's a real possibility.

3:49:42.940 --> 3:49:44.340
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:49:44.340 --> 3:49:46.420
 So that's why there's no point in listening

3:49:46.420 --> 3:49:48.980
 things I can't do, yeah.

3:49:48.980 --> 3:49:52.500
 All right, what small act of kindness

3:49:52.500 --> 3:49:54.900
 were you once shown that you will never forget?

3:49:56.220 --> 3:49:59.500
 Small act of kindness, not big.

3:49:59.500 --> 3:50:01.020
 Somebody was just kind to you.

3:50:01.020 --> 3:50:03.300
 Somebody did something sweet.

3:50:03.300 --> 3:50:08.300
 When I was a PhD student, someone helped me out

3:50:08.300 --> 3:50:13.300
 with just, basically, I needed a computer.

3:50:13.540 --> 3:50:15.420
 I needed some power, computation power,

3:50:15.420 --> 3:50:18.340
 and someone took pity on me and helped me.

3:50:18.340 --> 3:50:19.180
 I was really touched.

3:50:19.180 --> 3:50:20.180
 They didn't have to.

3:50:20.180 --> 3:50:23.020
 And they were actually quite, they were a disabled scientist

3:50:23.020 --> 3:50:24.180
 and they had other things to do

3:50:24.180 --> 3:50:26.340
 rather than help some random PhD student.

3:50:26.340 --> 3:50:29.140
 Gave me access, taught me a lot of stuff.

3:50:29.140 --> 3:50:30.900
 Yeah, actually, when you're a grad student

3:50:30.900 --> 3:50:33.340
 or when you're a student, when you're even a student,

3:50:33.340 --> 3:50:35.660
 the younger it is, the better.

3:50:35.660 --> 3:50:38.740
 The attention, the support, the love you get

3:50:38.740 --> 3:50:40.580
 from an older person, a teacher,

3:50:40.580 --> 3:50:42.660
 something like that is super powerful.

3:50:42.660 --> 3:50:43.580
 It's fascinating.

3:50:43.580 --> 3:50:45.500
 And from the perspective of the teacher,

3:50:45.500 --> 3:50:47.580
 they might not realize the impact they have,

3:50:47.580 --> 3:50:51.460
 but that little bit, those few words,

3:50:51.460 --> 3:50:54.660
 a little bit of help can have a lot of impact.

3:50:54.660 --> 3:50:55.700
 What about you, Sarah?

3:50:56.860 --> 3:50:59.300
 Somebody give you a free Starbucks at some point?

3:50:59.300 --> 3:51:00.500
 I love free Starbucks.

3:51:00.500 --> 3:51:03.300
 I like it when you're in the line at Starbucks

3:51:03.300 --> 3:51:05.020
 and somebody buys your coffee in front of you

3:51:05.020 --> 3:51:05.860
 and then you buy the next one.

3:51:05.860 --> 3:51:08.260
 I love those, but that's not my example.

3:51:08.260 --> 3:51:09.460
 Those are great.

3:51:09.460 --> 3:51:10.300
 It makes me happy.

3:51:10.300 --> 3:51:11.700
 And now my kids get all excited when we do it,

3:51:11.700 --> 3:51:14.020
 when we go in, we're the first ones in line doing it.

3:51:14.020 --> 3:51:19.020
 But I guess I can use a similar example

3:51:20.700 --> 3:51:21.980
 about just being a student.

3:51:22.980 --> 3:51:26.460
 So Paul Davies is a very well known theoretical physicist

3:51:26.460 --> 3:51:31.060
 and he was generous enough with his time

3:51:31.060 --> 3:51:32.980
 to take me on as a postdoc.

3:51:32.980 --> 3:51:34.500
 But before I became his postdoc,

3:51:34.500 --> 3:51:35.540
 he invited me to a workshop

3:51:35.540 --> 3:51:37.540
 at Arizona State University in the Beyond Center

3:51:37.540 --> 3:51:40.620
 and took a walk with me around campus

3:51:40.620 --> 3:51:42.220
 just to talk about ideas after.

3:51:42.220 --> 3:51:44.180
 And I think there were two things

3:51:44.180 --> 3:51:48.260
 that were completely generous about that.

3:51:48.260 --> 3:51:51.740
 One is Paul's philosophy is always interacting

3:51:51.740 --> 3:51:52.660
 with young people.

3:51:52.660 --> 3:51:54.980
 It's like you interact with a mind in the room.

3:51:54.980 --> 3:51:57.940
 It doesn't matter how well known or whatever.

3:51:57.940 --> 3:52:01.060
 It's like you evaluate the person for the person.

3:52:01.060 --> 3:52:02.780
 But he also gave me a book,

3:52:02.780 --> 3:52:05.620
 The Eerie Silence that he had written and he wrote in it,

3:52:05.620 --> 3:52:08.100
 This is How EE Gets to ET,

3:52:08.980 --> 3:52:10.700
 which was an antimeric excess,

3:52:10.700 --> 3:52:12.260
 which I worked on as a PhD student

3:52:12.260 --> 3:52:14.180
 was the origin of homochirality

3:52:14.180 --> 3:52:15.340
 all the way up to what the book was about,

3:52:15.340 --> 3:52:16.900
 which was are we alone in the universe

3:52:16.900 --> 3:52:19.100
 and is there intelligent life out there?

3:52:19.100 --> 3:52:24.100
 And it was just so much about the questions I wanted to ask

3:52:24.260 --> 3:52:26.620
 because it was just everything about,

3:52:26.620 --> 3:52:29.740
 just it was just really, really kind.

3:52:29.740 --> 3:52:32.340
 Like that it's okay to ask these questions

3:52:32.340 --> 3:52:35.100
 and you can actually have strong enough to answer them.

3:52:35.100 --> 3:52:37.140
 A lot of my career is mostly his encouragement

3:52:37.140 --> 3:52:38.100
 to ask deep questions.

3:52:38.100 --> 3:52:39.300
 Like he gave me the space to do it

3:52:39.300 --> 3:52:41.620
 in ways that a lot of previous mentors had.

3:52:41.620 --> 3:52:43.860
 I mean, I've had a good experience with mentors,

3:52:43.860 --> 3:52:46.180
 but it was like go off the deep end,

3:52:46.180 --> 3:52:47.940
 ask the hardest questions.

3:52:47.940 --> 3:52:50.580
 And I think that's the best gift you can give somebody.

3:52:50.580 --> 3:52:51.420
 What would you,

3:52:51.420 --> 3:52:53.040
 because you're both fascinating minds

3:52:53.040 --> 3:52:58.040
 and not, I would say, nonstandard in the best possible way.

3:52:58.040 --> 3:53:01.560
 Is there advice you can give to young folks

3:53:01.560 --> 3:53:04.360
 how to be nonstandard, how to stand out,

3:53:04.360 --> 3:53:06.080
 novelty, how to generate novelty?

3:53:06.080 --> 3:53:08.000
 That's what I want on my tombstone.

3:53:08.000 --> 3:53:08.840
 I have one.

3:53:08.840 --> 3:53:11.600
 He generated novelty.

3:53:11.600 --> 3:53:12.440
 No, no, how to.

3:53:12.440 --> 3:53:13.280
 Oh, how to.

3:53:13.280 --> 3:53:15.280
 How, how, still.

3:53:16.680 --> 3:53:18.080
 I just love doing science.

3:53:18.080 --> 3:53:21.280
 And so when I was younger, I was just,

3:53:21.280 --> 3:53:23.040
 just wanted to, I mean, I'm still not sure

3:53:23.040 --> 3:53:24.160
 I'm a real scientist, right?

3:53:24.160 --> 3:53:25.600
 So I want to try.

3:53:25.600 --> 3:53:27.080
 So my advice for the young people

3:53:27.080 --> 3:53:30.360
 is just, if you just, if you love asking questions,

3:53:30.360 --> 3:53:33.000
 then don't be afraid to ask the question,

3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:34.400
 even if it pisses people off,

3:53:34.400 --> 3:53:36.080
 because if you piss people off,

3:53:36.080 --> 3:53:39.040
 you're probably asking the right question.

3:53:39.040 --> 3:53:41.080
 What I would say though, is don't do what I did,

3:53:41.080 --> 3:53:43.600
 which is just piss everyone off.

3:53:43.600 --> 3:53:47.080
 Try and work out how to, you know, I think,

3:53:48.400 --> 3:53:51.000
 if other people are challenged by your questions,

3:53:51.960 --> 3:53:55.200
 you will get not only respect,

3:53:55.200 --> 3:53:57.760
 but people will give you, create space for you,

3:53:57.760 --> 3:54:00.600
 because you're doing something really new.

3:54:00.600 --> 3:54:03.680
 I really try to create space in my academic career,

3:54:03.680 --> 3:54:07.280
 with my team, really try and praise them

3:54:07.280 --> 3:54:08.760
 and push them to do new things.

3:54:08.760 --> 3:54:12.400
 So my advice is, try to do new things,

3:54:12.400 --> 3:54:15.560
 get feedback, and the universe will help you.

3:54:15.560 --> 3:54:17.800
 Excellent.

3:54:17.800 --> 3:54:19.120
 Because the universe likes novelty.

3:54:19.120 --> 3:54:19.960
 I think so.

3:54:19.960 --> 3:54:21.000
 I think so, right?

3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:23.200
 This one will keep them around.

3:54:23.200 --> 3:54:24.040
 Oh my God.

3:54:24.040 --> 3:54:26.240
 What about you, Sarah?

3:54:26.240 --> 3:54:29.800
 You too like to ask the really out there big questions.

3:54:29.800 --> 3:54:32.840
 Yeah, because I have a strong passion for them.

3:54:32.840 --> 3:54:36.160
 So I think it goes back to the love.

3:54:36.160 --> 3:54:38.520
 Like if you're doing the thing you're supposed to be doing,

3:54:38.520 --> 3:54:40.480
 you should really love it.

3:54:40.480 --> 3:54:42.080
 So I always tell people that they should do

3:54:42.080 --> 3:54:43.320
 the thing they're most passionate about.

3:54:43.320 --> 3:54:45.640
 But I think a flip side of that is,

3:54:45.640 --> 3:54:48.080
 that's when you become in some way,

3:54:48.080 --> 3:54:49.240
 like not to sound cheesy,

3:54:49.240 --> 3:54:51.000
 but like your best version of yourself.

3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:54.800
 So I guess for me, as I become more successful in my career,

3:54:54.800 --> 3:54:57.480
 I feel like I can be more myself as an individual.

3:54:57.480 --> 3:54:59.360
 And so there's this, I've always been following

3:54:59.360 --> 3:55:00.880
 the questions I'm most interested in,

3:55:00.880 --> 3:55:03.480
 which very early on I was discouraged

3:55:03.480 --> 3:55:04.840
 from doing by many people

3:55:04.840 --> 3:55:06.760
 because they thought they were unanswerable questions.

3:55:06.760 --> 3:55:08.160
 And I always just thought,

3:55:08.160 --> 3:55:10.560
 well, if no one's even trying to answer them,

3:55:10.560 --> 3:55:12.360
 of course they're gonna be unanswerable.

3:55:12.360 --> 3:55:13.800
 And then that was kind of an odd viewpoint.

3:55:13.800 --> 3:55:16.800
 But the more I found my way in that space,

3:55:16.800 --> 3:55:19.960
 the more I also made a space for myself as a person,

3:55:19.960 --> 3:55:23.080
 because you're basically generating the niche

3:55:23.080 --> 3:55:24.800
 that you wanna exist in.

3:55:24.800 --> 3:55:29.360
 And so I think that's part of it,

3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:30.760
 is not just to follow your passion,

3:55:30.760 --> 3:55:31.840
 but also think about like,

3:55:31.840 --> 3:55:34.720
 who do you wanna be and create that?

3:55:35.680 --> 3:55:38.080
 Yeah, who am I, who do you wanna be?

3:55:38.080 --> 3:55:40.880
 I mean, yeah, play temporally with it.

3:55:40.880 --> 3:55:41.760
 Yeah, who am I now?

3:55:41.760 --> 3:55:42.920
 Who do I wanna be now?

3:55:42.920 --> 3:55:44.240
 But who do I wanna be in the future?

3:55:44.240 --> 3:55:45.560
 They're not decoupled.

3:55:45.560 --> 3:55:48.240
 Yeah, I always wonder if that's like,

3:55:48.240 --> 3:55:52.680
 if I become something, am I finding myself

3:55:52.680 --> 3:55:54.960
 or am I creating myself?

3:55:54.960 --> 3:55:58.040
 And I think those are somehow the same kind of thing.

3:55:58.040 --> 3:56:00.480
 I do feel often like I was always meant

3:56:00.480 --> 3:56:02.160
 to be this kind of thing.

3:56:02.160 --> 3:56:06.160
 But is that created or discovered?

3:56:06.160 --> 3:56:07.000
 I don't know.

3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:09.560
 But basically go towards that direction.

3:56:09.560 --> 3:56:12.320
 If you were abducted by aliens, Sarah.

3:56:12.320 --> 3:56:15.320
 Excellent, I'm waiting, they can come find me.

3:56:15.320 --> 3:56:16.480
 They're on a spaceship.

3:56:16.480 --> 3:56:20.840
 And then they somehow figured out the language you speak

3:56:22.560 --> 3:56:25.760
 and ask you, what are you?

3:56:25.760 --> 3:56:29.080
 What is, explain yourself.

3:56:29.080 --> 3:56:31.320
 Not you, Sarah, but the species.

3:56:31.320 --> 3:56:32.160
 Oh.

3:56:33.400 --> 3:56:37.920
 Life on Earth, like we don't have time.

3:56:37.920 --> 3:56:41.120
 We're busy grad students from another planet.

3:56:41.120 --> 3:56:41.960
 I see.

3:56:41.960 --> 3:56:45.480
 What's interesting about human civilization?

3:56:45.480 --> 3:56:47.680
 What's interesting about you?

3:56:47.680 --> 3:56:49.040
 You specifically, too.

3:56:49.040 --> 3:56:51.640
 They could be very kind of personal, kind of pushy.

3:56:53.520 --> 3:56:57.840
 And yeah, how would you begin to describe?

3:56:57.840 --> 3:57:00.400
 Okay, I have one.

3:57:00.400 --> 3:57:03.440
 Because, you know, obviously I self identify

3:57:03.440 --> 3:57:04.680
 as a scientist and a physicist,

3:57:04.680 --> 3:57:06.360
 but intrinsically I feel more like an artist.

3:57:06.360 --> 3:57:07.920
 But it's almost like you're an artist

3:57:07.920 --> 3:57:09.840
 that you don't know what you're painting yet.

3:57:09.840 --> 3:57:12.600
 And I guess I feel like that's humanity,

3:57:12.600 --> 3:57:16.440
 like in some sense, we're creating something

3:57:16.440 --> 3:57:19.560
 I think is profound and potentially very beautiful

3:57:19.560 --> 3:57:20.840
 in existence of the universe.

3:57:20.840 --> 3:57:25.240
 But we're just so, not night, we're just early.

3:57:25.240 --> 3:57:26.880
 We're early, we're young.

3:57:26.880 --> 3:57:28.280
 We don't know what we're doing yet.

3:57:28.280 --> 3:57:30.120
 Yeah, what's with the nuclear weapons?

3:57:30.120 --> 3:57:31.560
 That'd be a question, too.

3:57:31.560 --> 3:57:32.800
 Like what are you guys, why?

3:57:32.800 --> 3:57:34.240
 What are we doing with them?

3:57:34.240 --> 3:57:36.600
 This creativity that you talk, it sounds very nice,

3:57:36.600 --> 3:57:37.760
 but it's, you're seem to be.

3:57:37.760 --> 3:57:39.080
 We're making things that are.

3:57:39.080 --> 3:57:41.560
 Like very destructive and like the rockets,

3:57:41.560 --> 3:57:43.640
 this seems very aggressive.

3:57:43.640 --> 3:57:45.080
 Yeah, I know.

3:57:45.080 --> 3:57:46.920
 This is my blinders on.

3:57:48.320 --> 3:57:49.160
 I don't know.

3:57:49.160 --> 3:57:50.560
 I mean, it goes back to the whole conversation

3:57:50.560 --> 3:57:51.400
 about suffering.

3:57:51.400 --> 3:57:53.920
 I have a hard time regularizing certain aspects

3:57:53.920 --> 3:57:56.600
 of reality into what I wanna envision.

3:57:56.600 --> 3:57:58.280
 And that's obviously problematic.

3:57:58.280 --> 3:58:02.520
 But nuclear power has also given us a lot of good things.

3:58:02.520 --> 3:58:03.880
 So.

3:58:03.880 --> 3:58:06.040
 So both, that's human nature.

3:58:06.040 --> 3:58:08.920
 Both human beings and the technology we create

3:58:08.920 --> 3:58:10.840
 has the capacity for evil and the capacity for good.

3:58:10.840 --> 3:58:12.680
 Yeah, and we can't all be good all the time.

3:58:12.680 --> 3:58:14.560
 I mean, there's like this huge misnomer

3:58:14.560 --> 3:58:17.040
 that you need to be liked by everyone universally.

3:58:17.040 --> 3:58:19.200
 And obviously that's like an ideal,

3:58:19.200 --> 3:58:21.120
 but it's physically impossible.

3:58:21.120 --> 3:58:23.080
 Like you can't get a group of people in a room

3:58:23.080 --> 3:58:25.520
 and have everyone like each other all the time.

3:58:25.520 --> 3:58:28.840
 So I think that kind of tension is actually really important

3:58:29.760 --> 3:58:33.480
 that we have different aesthetics, different goals.

3:58:34.880 --> 3:58:38.960
 And sometimes conflict comes out of that.

3:58:38.960 --> 3:58:41.920
 Speaking of which, do Yuli and Yoshua Bach

3:58:41.920 --> 3:58:43.760
 ever say anything nice to each other?

3:58:43.760 --> 3:58:45.400
 Or is it always conflict?

3:58:45.400 --> 3:58:46.400
 We never have conflict.

3:58:46.400 --> 3:58:50.000
 We argue, but I don't think arguments are bad.

3:58:50.000 --> 3:58:50.840
 It's love.

3:58:50.840 --> 3:58:52.240
 I mean, I think the problem I have,

3:58:52.240 --> 3:58:53.520
 not problem, I think.

3:58:53.520 --> 3:58:54.760
 Here we go.

3:58:54.760 --> 3:58:56.000
 And he's not here to defend himself.

3:58:56.000 --> 3:58:59.680
 No, I just, I don't necessarily understand the,

3:58:59.680 --> 3:59:02.320
 I mean, he's just talking at such a high level.

3:59:02.320 --> 3:59:05.240
 You know, I'm a dimwit, so I'm like, I spend some,

3:59:05.240 --> 3:59:08.080
 so I think a lot of our conflict is not conflict.

3:59:08.080 --> 3:59:10.120
 We actually, we actually have a, I think,

3:59:10.120 --> 3:59:10.960
 I mean, I can't speak for Yash,

3:59:10.960 --> 3:59:13.560
 I have a deep appreciation for him, he's brilliant.

3:59:13.560 --> 3:59:17.520
 But I think I'm kind of frustrated and I'm trying to,

3:59:17.520 --> 3:59:20.800
 he thinks the universe is a computer

3:59:20.800 --> 3:59:23.480
 and I want to turn the universe into a computer.

3:59:23.480 --> 3:59:25.840
 Yeah, that's a small disagreement.

3:59:25.840 --> 3:59:28.040
 So what would you, how would you defend your life

3:59:28.040 --> 3:59:30.400
 to an alien when you're being abducted?

3:59:30.400 --> 3:59:32.880
 Would you focus on the specifics of your life?

3:59:32.880 --> 3:59:34.440
 No, no, no, I would be, I would try to be

3:59:34.440 --> 3:59:37.040
 as random as possible and try and confuse them.

3:59:37.040 --> 3:59:39.520
 Oh, good, good.

3:59:42.560 --> 3:59:43.400
 Excellent.

3:59:43.400 --> 3:59:45.160
 That might be the wiser choice.

3:59:45.160 --> 3:59:46.520
 The Easter eggs in reality.

3:59:46.520 --> 3:59:47.360
 No, I mean, if aliens abducted me.

3:59:47.360 --> 3:59:48.200
 Would you play dumb?

3:59:48.200 --> 3:59:50.480
 No, no, no, I would try and be as random as possible.

3:59:50.480 --> 3:59:52.200
 I would try and do something that would surprise

3:59:52.200 --> 3:59:53.800
 the hell out of them, which I thought,

3:59:53.800 --> 3:59:55.400
 I mean, I'd probably risk it, they might kill me,

3:59:55.400 --> 3:59:56.800
 but I think that'd probably be funny.

3:59:56.800 --> 3:59:59.480
 That might, yeah, they might want to study you

3:59:59.480 --> 4:00:00.360
 for prolonged periods of time.

4:00:00.360 --> 4:00:03.000
 My reasoning is, if I wanted to stay alive, okay,

4:00:03.000 --> 4:00:05.040
 so if the thing is, if I wasn't going back to Earth

4:00:05.040 --> 4:00:07.160
 and the job was to stay alive, if I could be

4:00:07.160 --> 4:00:08.880
 as surprising as possible, they'd keep me around

4:00:08.880 --> 4:00:09.800
 like a pet, right?

4:00:11.600 --> 4:00:13.000
 Petly, on the aliens page book.

4:00:13.000 --> 4:00:14.720
 So you'd be okay being a pet?

4:00:14.720 --> 4:00:15.560
 Well, no, but I mean.

4:00:15.560 --> 4:00:18.440
 The last human that survives would just be

4:00:18.440 --> 4:00:19.560
 a pet to the aliens.

4:00:19.560 --> 4:00:22.720
 I don't know, but I mean, I think that might be fun

4:00:22.720 --> 4:00:25.040
 because then I might get some feedback

4:00:25.040 --> 4:00:26.760
 from their curiosity, but yeah.

4:00:26.760 --> 4:00:28.320
 Let me ask you this question.

4:00:28.320 --> 4:00:31.320
 Given our conversation has a very different meaning,

4:00:31.320 --> 4:00:33.280
 not a more profound meaning, perhaps,

4:00:33.280 --> 4:00:37.240
 but would you rather lose all of your old memories

4:00:37.240 --> 4:00:39.520
 or never be able to make new ones?

4:00:42.280 --> 4:00:46.760
 I would have to lose all my old memories.

4:00:47.640 --> 4:00:49.040
 Again, it's the novelty.

4:00:51.320 --> 4:00:52.320
 What about you, Sarah?

4:00:52.320 --> 4:00:54.480
 I'm the same because I don't think,

4:00:54.480 --> 4:00:56.360
 like, it's about the future experience, right?

4:00:56.360 --> 4:00:59.440
 And in some sense, like you were saying earlier,

4:00:59.440 --> 4:01:01.880
 most of our lived experience is actually in our memories.

4:01:01.880 --> 4:01:04.160
 So if you can't generate new memories,

4:01:04.160 --> 4:01:06.400
 it's like you're not alive anymore.

4:01:06.400 --> 4:01:07.960
 That's it, yeah.

4:01:07.960 --> 4:01:10.280
 What comforts you on bad days?

4:01:10.280 --> 4:01:11.960
 When you look at human civilization,

4:01:11.960 --> 4:01:14.120
 when you look at your own life,

4:01:14.120 --> 4:01:15.440
 what gives you hope?

4:01:15.440 --> 4:01:18.640
 What makes you feel good about what we're doing

4:01:18.640 --> 4:01:21.440
 about life at the small scale of you as a human

4:01:21.440 --> 4:01:24.440
 and at the big scale of us as a human civilization,

4:01:24.440 --> 4:01:26.440
 maybe the big scale of the universe?

4:01:29.200 --> 4:01:30.440
 Children, my kids.

4:01:30.440 --> 4:01:33.840
 But I also mean that in like a grand sense of like,

4:01:33.840 --> 4:01:38.040
 not a grand, but like future minds in some sense.

4:01:38.040 --> 4:01:40.680
 So for me, like the most bleak movie ever,

4:01:40.680 --> 4:01:42.280
 people worry about apocalyptic things

4:01:42.280 --> 4:01:44.440
 like AI existential risk and climate change,

4:01:44.440 --> 4:01:46.200
 which children of men.

4:01:46.200 --> 4:01:48.000
 The whole premise of the movie was

4:01:48.000 --> 4:01:50.680
 there can be no children born on the entire planet.

4:01:50.680 --> 4:01:52.360
 And the youngest person on the planet

4:01:52.360 --> 4:01:54.720
 is like 18 years old or something.

4:01:54.720 --> 4:01:56.720
 Like, can you imagine a world without children?

4:01:56.720 --> 4:01:58.960
 It's just, it's harrowing.

4:01:58.960 --> 4:02:00.080
 That's the scariest thing.

4:02:00.080 --> 4:02:03.680
 So I think what gives me hope is always youth

4:02:03.680 --> 4:02:07.080
 and the hope of children

4:02:07.080 --> 4:02:10.000
 and the possibilities of the future they see.

4:02:10.000 --> 4:02:12.280
 And they grow up in a completely different reality

4:02:12.280 --> 4:02:13.320
 than adults do.

4:02:14.320 --> 4:02:17.440
 And I think we have a hard time seeing

4:02:17.440 --> 4:02:19.560
 what their reality actually looks like.

4:02:19.560 --> 4:02:23.520
 But I think most of the time it's super interesting.

4:02:23.520 --> 4:02:26.280
 Yeah, they have dreams, they have imagination,

4:02:26.280 --> 4:02:27.800
 they have this kind of excitement.

4:02:27.800 --> 4:02:30.560
 It's so cool, it's so fun to watch.

4:02:31.480 --> 4:02:36.040
 And yeah, you feel like you're almost getting in the way

4:02:36.040 --> 4:02:38.760
 of all that imagination.

4:02:38.760 --> 4:02:39.800
 What about you, Lee?

4:02:39.800 --> 4:02:41.160
 What gives you hope?

4:02:41.160 --> 4:02:44.680
 So when I go back to my eight year old self,

4:02:44.680 --> 4:02:46.560
 the thing that I dreamed of as my eight year old self

4:02:46.560 --> 4:02:49.560
 was this world in which technology became programmable

4:02:49.560 --> 4:02:52.440
 and there was the internet and I'd get information

4:02:52.440 --> 4:02:54.920
 and I would expand my consciousness by just,

4:02:54.920 --> 4:02:59.920
 you know, getting access to everything that was going on.

4:03:00.120 --> 4:03:01.840
 And this happened in my lifetime.

4:03:01.840 --> 4:03:02.840
 I mean, we really do have that.

4:03:02.840 --> 4:03:04.120
 I mean, okay, there's some bad things.

4:03:04.120 --> 4:03:06.640
 You know, there's TikTok, everyone just, whatever,

4:03:06.640 --> 4:03:08.040
 all the bad things about social media.

4:03:08.040 --> 4:03:09.440
 But I think,

4:03:12.400 --> 4:03:16.760
 I mean, I can't quite believe my luck being born now.

4:03:16.760 --> 4:03:18.120
 So amazing.

4:03:18.120 --> 4:03:20.240
 Being able to program reality in some way.

4:03:20.240 --> 4:03:22.920
 Yeah, and the thing that I really find fascinating

4:03:22.920 --> 4:03:27.720
 about human beings is just how ingenious they are.

4:03:27.720 --> 4:03:31.120
 I'm, you know, whether it's from my kids,

4:03:31.120 --> 4:03:34.760
 my research group, my peers, other companies,

4:03:34.760 --> 4:03:37.360
 just how ingenious everyone is.

4:03:37.360 --> 4:03:40.160
 And I'm pretty sure humanity has,

4:03:40.160 --> 4:03:44.160
 or our causal chain in which humanity is a vital part

4:03:44.160 --> 4:03:46.480
 in the future is gonna have a lot of fun.

4:03:46.480 --> 4:03:50.040
 And I'm just, yeah, it's just mind blowing just to watch.

4:03:50.040 --> 4:03:53.480
 And, you know, so humans are ingenious

4:03:53.480 --> 4:03:56.840
 and I hope to help them be more ingenious if I can.

4:03:56.840 --> 4:03:58.160
 Well, what gives me hope,

4:03:58.160 --> 4:03:59.960
 what makes me feel good on bad days

4:03:59.960 --> 4:04:04.200
 is the existence of wild minds like yours,

4:04:04.200 --> 4:04:07.160
 novelty generators, assembly structures

4:04:07.160 --> 4:04:10.520
 that generate novelty and do so beautifully

4:04:10.520 --> 4:04:12.520
 and then tweet about it.

4:04:12.520 --> 4:04:15.200
 Sarah, I really, really enjoy talking to you.

4:04:15.200 --> 4:04:16.040
 I enjoy following you.

4:04:16.040 --> 4:04:17.440
 I'm a huge fan.

4:04:17.440 --> 4:04:20.000
 Sarah Lee, I hope to talk to you many times

4:04:20.000 --> 4:04:21.680
 in the future, maybe with Yoshua Bach.

4:04:21.680 --> 4:04:22.800
 You're just incredible people.

4:04:22.800 --> 4:04:24.000
 Thank you for everything you do.

4:04:24.000 --> 4:04:24.960
 You're awesome.

4:04:24.960 --> 4:04:26.000
 Thank you for talking today.

4:04:26.000 --> 4:04:27.400
 Really, really appreciate it.

4:04:27.400 --> 4:04:28.840
 Yeah, brilliant to be here.

4:04:29.760 --> 4:04:31.240
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

4:04:31.240 --> 4:04:33.080
 with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.

4:04:33.080 --> 4:04:34.400

 Now, let me leave you with some words from Arthur C. Clarke.

4:04:41.160 --> 4:04:43.440
 Two possibilities exist.

4:04:43.440 --> 4:04:48.440
 Either we are alone in the universe or we are not.

4:04:48.440 --> 4:04:50.880
 Both are equally terrifying.

4:04:52.200 --> 4:04:55.600
 And let me, if I may, add to that

4:04:55.600 --> 4:04:58.680
 by saying that both possibilities, at least to me,

4:04:58.680 --> 4:05:00.920
 are both terrifying and exciting.

4:05:00.920 --> 4:05:03.160
 And keeping these two feelings in my heart

4:05:03.160 --> 4:05:07.280
 is a fun way to explore, to wonder, to think, and to live,

4:05:07.280 --> 4:05:10.280
 always a little bit on the edge of madness.

4:05:10.280 --> 4:05:11.400
 Thank you for listening.

4:05:11.400 --> 4:05:22.080
 I hope to see you next time.
