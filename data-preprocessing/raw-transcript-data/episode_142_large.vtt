00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
 The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis,

00:02.960 --> 00:05.000
 his fourth time on the podcast.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.880
 He's a professor at MIT

00:06.880 --> 00:10.440
 and head of the MIT Computational Biology Group.

00:10.440 --> 00:14.440
 Since this is episode number 142,

00:14.440 --> 00:16.680
 and 42, as we all know,

00:16.680 --> 00:18.840
 is the answer to the ultimate question of life,

00:18.840 --> 00:20.440
 the universe, and everything,

00:20.440 --> 00:23.640
 according to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

00:23.640 --> 00:26.760
 we decided to talk about this unanswerable question

00:26.760 --> 00:28.120
 of the meaning of life

00:28.120 --> 00:32.000
 in whatever way we two descendants of apes could muster,

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
 from biology, psychology, to metaphysics, and to music.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.400
 Quick mention of each sponsor,

00:39.400 --> 00:42.080
 followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.160
 Thanks to Grammarly,

00:44.160 --> 00:47.440
 which is a service for checking spelling, grammar,

01:05.680 --> 01:06.520
 As a side note,

01:06.520 --> 01:09.280
 let me say that the opening 40 minutes of the conversation

01:09.280 --> 01:11.480
 are all about the many songs

01:11.480 --> 01:14.160
 that formed the soundtrack to the journey

01:14.160 --> 01:15.840
 of Manolis's life.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.000
 It was a happy accident for me to discover

01:18.000 --> 01:20.440
 yet another dimension of depth

01:20.440 --> 01:22.720
 to the fascinating mind of Manolis.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.840
 I include links to YouTube versions

01:24.840 --> 01:28.200
 of many of the songs we mentioned in the description,

01:28.200 --> 01:30.600
 and overlay lyrics on occasion.

01:30.600 --> 01:31.960
 But if you're just listening to this

01:31.960 --> 01:34.720
 without listening to the songs or watching the video,

01:34.720 --> 01:37.040
 I hope you still might enjoy, as I did,

01:37.040 --> 01:39.600
 the passion that Manolis has for music,

01:39.600 --> 01:43.080
 his singing of the little excerpts from the songs,

01:43.080 --> 01:46.240
 and in general, the meaning we discuss

01:46.240 --> 01:49.200
 that we pull from the different songs.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.760
 If music is not your thing,

01:50.760 --> 01:53.960
 I do give timestamps to the less musical

01:53.960 --> 01:56.720
 and more philosophical parts of the conversation.

01:56.720 --> 01:59.160
 I hope you enjoy this little experiment

01:59.160 --> 02:02.960
 and conversation about music and life.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.280

02:13.320 --> 02:17.360
 And now, here's my conversation with Manolis Callas.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.120
 You mentioned Leonard Cohen and the song Hallelujah

02:21.120 --> 02:22.800
 as a beautiful song.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.120
 So what are the three songs

02:26.120 --> 02:29.160
 you draw the most meaning from about life?

02:29.160 --> 02:31.320
 Don't get me started.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.680
 So there's really countless songs that have marked me,

02:34.680 --> 02:38.520
 that have sort of shaped me in periods of joy

02:38.520 --> 02:40.280
 and in periods of sadness.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.040
 My son likes to joke that I have a song

02:43.040 --> 02:44.880
 for every sentence he will say,

02:44.880 --> 02:46.320
 because very often I will break into a song

02:46.320 --> 02:47.720
 with a sentence he'll say.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.520
 My wife calls me the radio

02:50.520 --> 02:53.440
 because I can sort of recite hundreds of songs

02:53.440 --> 02:54.560
 that have really shaped me.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.800
 So it's gonna be very hard to just pick a few.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.800
 So I'm just gonna tell you a little bit

02:57.800 --> 03:01.640
 about my song transition as I've grown up.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.720
 In Greece, it was very much about,

03:03.720 --> 03:06.880
 as I told you before, the misery, the poverty,

03:06.880 --> 03:09.000
 but also overcoming adversity.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.920
 So some of the songs that have really shaped me

03:11.920 --> 03:13.880
 are Charis Alexiou, for example,

03:13.880 --> 03:16.400
 is one of my favorite singers in Greece.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.600
 And then there's also really just old traditional songs

03:19.600 --> 03:21.120
 that my parents used to listen to.

03:21.120 --> 03:25.480
 Like one of them is Ani Moun Plousios,

03:25.480 --> 03:28.840
 which is basically, oh, if I was rich.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.200
 And the song is painting this beautiful picture

03:32.200 --> 03:34.960
 about all the noises that you hear in the neighborhood,

03:34.960 --> 03:37.560
 his poor neighborhood, the train going by,

03:37.560 --> 03:39.920
 the priest walking to the church

03:39.920 --> 03:43.040
 and the kids crying next door and all of that.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.640
 And he says, with all of that,

03:44.640 --> 03:47.520
 I'm having trouble falling asleep and dreaming.

03:47.520 --> 03:52.400
 If I was rich, and then he was breaking to that.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.680
 So it's this juxtaposition between the spirit

03:55.680 --> 03:59.920
 and the sublime and then the physical and the harsh reality.

03:59.920 --> 04:03.320
 It's just not having troubles, not being miserable.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.160
 So basically rich to him just means

04:05.160 --> 04:06.560
 out of my misery, basically.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.200
 And then also being able to travel,

04:10.200 --> 04:12.240
 being able to sort of be the captain of a ship

04:12.240 --> 04:14.200
 and see the world and stuff like that.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.160
 So it's just such beautiful imagery.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.280
 So many of the Greek songs, just like the poetry

04:18.280 --> 04:21.400
 we talked about, they acknowledge the cruelty,

04:21.400 --> 04:24.440
 the difficulty of life, but are longing for a better life.

04:24.440 --> 04:25.280
 That's exactly right.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.960
 And another one is Ftokhologia.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.760
 And this is one of those songs that has like a fast

04:29.760 --> 04:33.600
 and joyful half and a slow and sad half.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.760
 And it goes back and forth between them.

04:35.760 --> 04:36.600
 And it's like,

04:36.600 --> 04:41.200
 Ftokhologia, jefse na kathemou dragoouzi.

04:41.200 --> 04:45.800
 So poor, you know, basically it's the state of being poor.

04:45.800 --> 04:50.160
 I don't even know if there's a word for that in English.

04:50.160 --> 04:54.000
 And then fast part is ta kerya sou megalosan

04:54.000 --> 04:56.200
 ke ponesan ke matosan.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.120
 So, and then it's like, oh, you know,

04:59.120 --> 05:02.680
 basically like the state of being poor and misery,

05:02.680 --> 05:05.600
 you know, for you, I write all my songs, et cetera.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.000
 And then the fast part is in your arms,

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
 grew up and suffered and, you know, stood up and,

05:14.000 --> 05:18.360
 you know, rose, men with clear vision.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.760
 This whole concept of taking on the world

05:21.760 --> 05:25.040
 with nothing to lose because you've seen the worst of it.

05:25.040 --> 05:29.920
 This imagery of psilaki parizopoula harastakorizopoula.

05:29.920 --> 05:34.080
 So it's describing the young men as cypress trees.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.840
 And that's probably one of my earliest exposure

05:35.840 --> 05:38.080
 to a metaphor, to sort of, you know,

05:38.080 --> 05:40.040
 this very rich imagery.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.600
 And I love about the fact that I was reading a story

05:42.600 --> 05:44.760
 to my kids the other day and it was dark.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.000
 And my daughter who's six is like,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.480
 oh, can I please see the pictures?

05:48.480 --> 05:53.480
 And Jonathan, who's eight, so my daughter Cleo is like,

05:53.560 --> 05:54.640
 oh, let's look at the pictures.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.480
 And my son Jonathan, he's like, but Cleo,

05:57.480 --> 06:00.200
 if you look at the pictures, it's just an image.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.280
 If you just close your eyes and listen, it's a video.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.400
 That's brilliant.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.800
 It's beautiful.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.960
 And he's basically showing just how much more

06:08.960 --> 06:12.240
 the human imagination has besides just a few images

06:12.240 --> 06:14.120
 that, you know, the book will give you.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.680
 And then another one, oh gosh,

06:15.680 --> 06:17.960
 this one is really like miserable.

06:17.960 --> 06:22.960
 It's called Sto Perigiali, To Krifo.

06:23.200 --> 06:28.200
 And it's basically describing how vigorously

06:28.480 --> 06:31.680
 we took on our life and we pushed hard

06:31.680 --> 06:33.760
 towards a direction that we then realized

06:33.760 --> 06:34.680
 was the wrong one.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.680
 And again, these songs give you so much perspective.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.000
 There's no songs like that in English

06:41.000 --> 06:44.200
 that will basically sort of just smack you in the face

06:44.200 --> 06:47.440
 about sort of the passion and the force and the drive.

06:47.440 --> 06:51.160
 And then it turns out, we just followed the wrong life.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.360
 And it's like, wow.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.320
 Okay, so that was you.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.120
 All right, so that's like before 12.

06:57.120 --> 07:02.120
 So growing up in sort of this horrendously miserable

07:03.160 --> 07:07.040
 sort of view of romanticism, of suffering.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.640
 So then my preteen years is like, you know,

07:10.640 --> 07:12.840
 learning English through songs.

07:12.840 --> 07:13.720
 So basically, you know,

07:13.720 --> 07:15.560
 listening to all the American pop songs

07:15.560 --> 07:17.880
 and then memorizing them vocally

07:17.880 --> 07:19.680
 before I even knew what they meant.

07:19.680 --> 07:23.000
 So, you know, Madonna and Michael Jackson

07:23.000 --> 07:25.280
 and all of these sort of really popular songs

07:25.280 --> 07:27.760
 and, you know, George Michael and just songs

07:27.760 --> 07:30.800
 that I would just listen to the radio and repeat vocally.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.480
 And eventually as I started learning English,

07:32.480 --> 07:34.520
 I was like, oh wow, this thing I've been repeating,

07:34.520 --> 07:36.040
 I now understand what it means.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.880
 Without relistening it to it,

07:37.880 --> 07:40.200
 but just with re repeating it, it was like, oh.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.120
 Again, Michael Jackson's Man in the Mirror

07:44.120 --> 07:47.480
 is teaching you that it's your responsibility

07:47.480 --> 07:49.400
 to just improve yourself.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.160
 You know, if you wanna make the world a better place,

07:51.160 --> 07:52.960
 take a look at yourself and make the change.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.160
 This whole concept of, again, I mean,

07:55.160 --> 07:57.000
 all of these songs, you can listen to them shallowly

07:57.000 --> 07:59.040
 or you can just listen to them and say,

07:59.040 --> 08:00.760
 oh, there's deeper meaning here.

08:00.760 --> 08:04.240
 And I think there's a certain philosophy of song

08:04.240 --> 08:06.320
 as a way of touching the psyche.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.400
 So if you look at regions of the brain,

08:08.400 --> 08:10.160
 people have lost their language ability

08:10.160 --> 08:12.320
 because they have an accident in that region of the brain

08:12.320 --> 08:16.040
 can actually sing because it's exactly

08:16.040 --> 08:18.400
 the symmetric region of the brain.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.680
 And that again, teaches you so much

08:19.680 --> 08:23.960
 about language evolution and sort of the duality

08:23.960 --> 08:28.360
 of musicality and, you know, rhythmic patterns

08:28.360 --> 08:31.160
 and eventually language.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.280
 Do you have a sense of why songs developed?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.200
 You're kind of suggesting that it's possible

08:36.200 --> 08:39.240
 that there is something important

08:39.240 --> 08:43.160
 about our connection with song and with music

08:43.160 --> 08:46.080
 on the level of the importance of language.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.280
 Is it possible?

08:47.280 --> 08:48.560
 It's not just possible.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.200
 In my view, language comes after music.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.520
 Language comes after song.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.360
 No, seriously.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.720
 Like basically, my view of human cognitive evolution

08:56.720 --> 08:58.800
 is rituals.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.360
 If you look at many early cultures,

09:01.360 --> 09:04.560
 there's rituals around every stage of life.

09:04.560 --> 09:09.560
 There's organized dance performances around mating.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.440
 And if you look at mate selection,

09:11.440 --> 09:14.080
 I mean, that's an evolutionary drive right there.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.160
 So basically, if you're not able to string together

09:16.160 --> 09:19.920
 a complex dance as a bird, you don't get a mate.

09:19.920 --> 09:23.240
 And that actually forms this development

09:23.240 --> 09:25.320
 for many song learning birds.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.800
 Not every bird knows how to sing.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.040
 And not every bird knows how to learn a complicated song.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.880
 So basically, there's birds that simply have

09:33.880 --> 09:36.120
 the same few tunes that they know how to play.

09:36.120 --> 09:39.080
 And a lot of that is inherent and genetically encoded.

09:39.080 --> 09:42.600
 And others are birds that learn how to sing.

09:42.600 --> 09:47.320
 And if you look at a lot of these exotic birds of paradise

09:47.320 --> 09:48.280
 and stuff like that,

09:48.280 --> 09:51.320
 the mating rituals that they have are enormously amazing.

09:51.320 --> 09:55.120
 And I think human mating rituals of ancient tribes

09:55.120 --> 09:56.840
 are not very far off from that.

09:56.840 --> 10:01.840
 And in my view, the sequential formation of these movements

10:01.960 --> 10:06.080
 is a prelude to the cognitive capabilities

10:06.080 --> 10:08.360
 that ultimately enable language.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.600
 It is fascinating to think that that's

10:10.600 --> 10:13.440
 not just an accidental precursor to intelligence.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.040
 Yeah, sexually selected.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.560
 Well, it's sexually selected and it's a prerequisite.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.400
 Yeah.

10:20.400 --> 10:21.760
 It's like, it's required for intelligence.

10:21.760 --> 10:24.960
 And even as language has now developed,

10:24.960 --> 10:28.760
 I think the artistic expression is needed,

10:28.760 --> 10:31.280
 like badly needed by our brain.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.920
 So it's not just that, oh, our brain can kind of,

10:34.920 --> 10:36.840
 you know, take a break and go do that stuff.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.200
 No, I mean, you know, I don't know if you remember

10:39.200 --> 10:40.800
 that scene from, oh gosh,

10:40.800 --> 10:43.560
 where's that Jack Nicholson movie in New Hampshire.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.880
 All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.080
 A dull boy.

10:49.080 --> 10:49.920
 The Shining.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.560
 The Shining.

10:51.560 --> 10:54.880
 So there's this amazing scene where he's constantly

10:54.880 --> 10:57.200
 trying to concentrate and what's coming out

10:57.200 --> 10:58.920
 of the typewriter is just gibberish.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.640
 And I have that image as well when I'm working.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.240
 And I'm like, no, basically all of these crazy,

11:04.240 --> 11:06.560
 you know, huge number of hobbies that I have,

11:06.560 --> 11:09.560
 they're not just tolerated by my work.

11:09.560 --> 11:12.000
 They're required by my work.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.960
 This ability of sort of stretching your brain

11:13.960 --> 11:15.640
 in all these different directions

11:15.640 --> 11:20.160
 is connecting your emotional self and your cognitive self.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.480
 And that's a prerequisite to being able

11:22.480 --> 11:24.720
 to be cognitively capable.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.560
 At least in my view.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.840
 Yeah, I wonder if the world without art and music,

11:28.840 --> 11:30.640
 you're just making me realize that perhaps

11:30.640 --> 11:34.720
 that world would be not just devoid of fun things

11:34.720 --> 11:38.120
 to look at or listen to, but devoid of all the other stuff.

11:38.120 --> 11:41.160
 All the bridges and rockets and science.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.400
 Exactly, exactly.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.320
 Creativity is not disconnected from art.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.520
 And you know, my kids, I mean, you know,

11:47.520 --> 11:50.520
 I could be doing the full math treatment to them.

11:50.520 --> 11:53.320
 No, they play the piano and they play the violin

11:53.320 --> 11:54.320
 and they play sports.

11:54.320 --> 11:58.160
 I mean, this whole, you know, sort of movement

11:58.160 --> 12:01.840
 and going through mazes and playing tennis

12:01.840 --> 12:05.240
 and, you know, playing soccer and avoiding obstacles

12:05.240 --> 12:06.400
 and all of that,

12:06.400 --> 12:09.120
 that forms your three dimensional view of the world.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.000
 Being able to actually move and run and play

12:11.000 --> 12:14.600
 in three dimensions is extremely important for math,

12:14.600 --> 12:17.880
 for, you know, stringing together complicated concepts.

12:17.880 --> 12:21.440
 It's the same underlying cognitive machinery

12:21.440 --> 12:26.440
 that is used for navigating mazes and for navigating theorems

12:27.360 --> 12:28.760
 and sort of solving equations.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.760
 So I can't, you know, I can't have a conversation

12:31.760 --> 12:33.720
 with my students without, you know,

12:33.720 --> 12:35.360
 sort of either using my hands

12:35.360 --> 12:39.400
 or opening the whiteboard in Zoom

12:39.400 --> 12:41.280
 and just constantly drawing.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.800
 Or, you know, back when we had in person meetings,

12:43.800 --> 12:44.640
 just the whiteboard on my own.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.240
 The whiteboard, yeah, that's fascinating to think about.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.440
 So that's Michael Jackson, man,

12:49.440 --> 12:52.200
 Mirror, Careless Whisper with George Michael,

12:52.200 --> 12:53.040
 which is a song I like.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.440
 You can say Careless Whisper.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.480
 I mean, I didn't say that.

12:55.480 --> 12:56.320
 I like that one.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.960
 That's too popular for you.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.720
 I had recorded, no, no, no,

12:59.720 --> 13:01.560
 that it's an amazing song for me.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.480
 I had recorded a small part of it

13:03.480 --> 13:05.720
 as it's played at the tail end of the radio.

13:05.720 --> 13:09.080
 And I had a tape where I only had part of that song

13:09.080 --> 13:11.880
 and I just played it over and over and over again,

13:11.880 --> 13:13.680
 just so beautiful.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.040
 It's so heartbreaking.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.200
 That song is almost Greek.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.040
 It's so heartbreaking.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.040
 I know, and George Michael is Greek.

13:19.040 --> 13:19.880
 Is he Greek?

13:19.880 --> 13:20.760
 He's Greek, of course.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.680
 George Michaelides, I mean, he's Greek.

13:22.680 --> 13:23.520
 Yeah.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.760
 I did not know this.

13:24.760 --> 13:25.600
 Now you know.

13:25.600 --> 13:30.280
 I'm so sorry to offend you so deeply not knowing this.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.120
 So, okay, so what's...

13:31.120 --> 13:32.080
 So anyway, so we're moving to France

13:32.080 --> 13:33.000
 when I'm 12 years old.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.120
 And now I'm getting into the songs of Gainsbourg.

13:36.120 --> 13:39.520
 So Gainsbourg is this incredible French composer.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.000
 He is always seen on stage,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.320
 like not even pretending to try to please,

13:44.320 --> 13:45.280
 just like with his cigarette,

13:45.280 --> 13:47.480
 just like rrrr mumbling his songs.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.840
 But the lyrics are unbelievable.

13:49.840 --> 13:53.040
 Like basically entire sentences will rhyme.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.680
 He will say the same thing twice and you're like, whoa.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.720
 And in fact, another, speaking of Greek,

14:00.720 --> 14:03.080
 a French Greek, George Mustaky,

14:03.080 --> 14:05.240
 this song is just magnificent.

14:05.240 --> 14:10.040
 Avec ma gueule de métèque, de juif errant, de patre grecque.

14:10.040 --> 14:15.040
 So with my face of métèque is actually a Greek word.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.840
 A Greek word, it's a French word for a Greek word.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.080
 But met comes from meta,

14:20.080 --> 14:23.360
 and then ec from Ikea, from ecology, which means home.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.640
 So métèque is someone who has changed homes for a migrant.

14:26.640 --> 14:30.040
 So with my face of a migrant, and you'll love this one.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.320
 De juif errant, de patre grecque,

14:32.320 --> 14:37.320
 of a meandering Jew, of Greek pastor.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.040
 So again, the Russian Greek,

14:42.040 --> 14:45.480
 the Jewish Orthodox connection, so.

14:45.480 --> 14:46.920
 Aime mes cheveux au quatre vents,

14:46.920 --> 14:48.720
 with my hair in the four wings.

14:48.720 --> 14:53.160
 Avec mes yeux tous délavés qui me donnent léreux de rêver.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.960
 Avec, with my eyes that are all washed out,

14:55.960 --> 14:58.800
 who give me the pretense of dreaming,

14:58.800 --> 15:01.240
 but who don't dream that much anymore.

15:01.240 --> 15:05.200
 With my hands of thief, of musician,

15:05.200 --> 15:08.960
 and who have stolen so many gardens.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.280
 With my mouth that has drunk,

15:11.280 --> 15:14.520
 that has kissed, and that has bitten,

15:14.520 --> 15:16.920
 without ever pleasing its hunger.

15:17.960 --> 15:22.360
 With my skin that has been rubbed

15:23.280 --> 15:25.640
 in the sun of all the summers,

15:25.640 --> 15:28.000
 and anything that was wearing a skirt.

15:29.040 --> 15:32.160
 With my heart, and then you have to listen to this verse,

15:32.160 --> 15:33.240
 it's so beautiful.

15:33.240 --> 15:38.240
 Avec mon coeur qui a su faire souffrir autant qu il a souffert.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.920
 Qui a su faire.

15:39.920 --> 15:44.580
 With my heart that knew how to make suffer

15:44.580 --> 15:46.560
 as much as it suffered,

15:46.560 --> 15:50.360
 but was able to, that knew how to make,

15:50.360 --> 15:53.160
 in French it's actually su faire,

15:53.160 --> 15:54.760
 that knew how to make.

15:54.760 --> 15:57.840
 Qui a su faire souffrir autant qu il a souffert.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.480
 Verses that span the whole thing.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.800
 It's just beautiful.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.920
 Do you know, on a small tangent,

16:02.920 --> 16:05.760
 do you know Jacques Brel?

16:05.760 --> 16:07.080
 Of course, of course.

16:07.080 --> 16:10.240
 And then Ne Me Kite Pas, those songs.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.560
 That song gets me every time.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.800
 So there's a cover of that song

16:14.800 --> 16:17.120
 by one of my favorite female artists.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.400
 Not Nina Simone.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.760
 No, no, no, no, no.

16:19.760 --> 16:20.600
 Modern?

16:20.600 --> 16:21.760
 Carol Emerald.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.760
 She's from Amsterdam.

16:24.760 --> 16:28.200
 And she has a version of Ne Me Kite Pas

16:28.200 --> 16:30.600
 where she's actually added some English lyrics.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.100
 And it's really beautiful.

16:33.100 --> 16:35.280
 But again, Ne Me Kite Pas is just so,

16:35.280 --> 16:38.360
 I mean it's, you know, the promises,

16:38.360 --> 16:42.000
 the volcanoes that will restart.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.440
 It's just so beautiful.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.280
 And.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.080
 I love, there's not many songs

16:47.080 --> 16:51.560
 that show such depth of desperation

16:51.560 --> 16:52.880
 for another human being.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.040
 That's so powerful.

16:54.040 --> 16:54.880
 I apologize.

16:54.880 --> 16:58.000
 Je t offrirai des perles de pluie

16:58.000 --> 17:01.040
 venant de pays où il ne pleut pas.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.460
 And then high school.

17:02.460 --> 17:03.840
 Now I'm starting to learn English.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.040
 So I moved to New York.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.720
 So Sting's Englishman in New York.

17:07.720 --> 17:08.560
 Yeah.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.920
 Magnificent song.

17:09.920 --> 17:14.280
 And again, there's if manners maggoth manners someone said

17:14.280 --> 17:16.840
 then he's the hero of the day.

17:16.840 --> 17:20.060
 It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile.

17:20.060 --> 17:23.600
 Be yourself no matter what they say.

17:23.600 --> 17:27.740
 And then takes more than combat gear to make a man.

17:27.740 --> 17:30.640
 Takes more than a license for a gun.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.120
 Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.440
 A gentleman will walk but never run.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.880
 It's again, you're talking about songs

17:39.880 --> 17:41.200
 that teach you how to live.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.600
 I mean, this is one of them.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.360
 Basically says, it's not the combat gear that makes a man.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.500
 Where's the part where he says, there you go.

17:49.500 --> 17:53.800
 Gentleness so brighty are rare in this society.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.800
 At night a candle's brighter than the sun.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.640
 So beautiful.

17:57.640 --> 18:00.520
 He basically says, well, you just might be the only one.

18:00.520 --> 18:03.720
 Modesty propriety can lead to notoriety.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.880
 You could end up as the only one.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.100
 It's, it basically tells you,

18:08.100 --> 18:09.840
 you don't have to be like the others.

18:09.840 --> 18:14.000
 Be yourself, show kindness, show generosity.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.260
 Don't, you know, don't let that anger get to you.

18:18.260 --> 18:19.800
 You know, the song Fragile.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.920
 How fragile we are, how fragile we are.

18:22.920 --> 18:26.080
 So again, as in Greece, I didn't even know what that meant.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.840
 How fragile we are, but the song was so beautiful.

18:28.840 --> 18:29.960
 And then eventually I learned English

18:29.960 --> 18:31.800
 and I actually understand the lyrics.

18:31.800 --> 18:36.800
 And the song is actually written after the Contras

18:36.920 --> 18:39.680
 murdered Ben Linder in 1987.

18:39.680 --> 18:43.120
 And the US eventually turned against supporting

18:43.120 --> 18:44.480
 these guerrillas.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.160
 And it was just a political song,

18:46.160 --> 18:49.300
 but so such a realization that you can't win

18:49.300 --> 18:51.400
 with violence basically.

18:51.400 --> 18:55.360
 And that song starts with the most beautiful poetry.

18:55.360 --> 19:00.360
 So if blood will flow when flesh and steel are one,

19:00.360 --> 19:04.640
 drying in the color of the evening sun,

19:04.640 --> 19:08.320
 tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away,

19:08.320 --> 19:11.800
 but something in our minds will always stain.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.320
 Perhaps this final act was meant

19:14.320 --> 19:16.760
 to clinch a lifetime's argument

19:16.760 --> 19:19.080
 that nothing comes through violence

19:19.080 --> 19:21.400
 and nothing ever could.

19:21.400 --> 19:25.040
 For all those born beneath an angry star,

19:25.040 --> 19:28.360
 lest we forget how fragile we are.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.080
 Damn, right?

19:31.080 --> 19:33.680
 I mean, that's poetry.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.680
 It was beautiful.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.440
 And he's using the English language

19:37.440 --> 19:42.020
 is just such a refined way with deep meanings,

19:42.020 --> 19:45.640
 but also words that rhyme just so beautifully

19:45.640 --> 19:49.800
 and evocations of when flesh and steel are one.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.360
 I mean, it's just mind boggling.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.880
 And then of course the refrain that everybody remembers

19:55.880 --> 20:00.000
 is on and on the rain will fall, et cetera.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.840
 But like this beginning.

20:00.840 --> 20:01.920
 Tears from a star, wow.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.440
 Yeah.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.840
 And again, tears from a star, how fragile we are.

20:06.840 --> 20:10.160
 I mean, just these rhymes are just flowing so naturally.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.800
 Something, it seems that more meaning comes

20:12.800 --> 20:16.000
 when there's a rhythm that, I don't know what that is.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.160
 That probably connects to exactly what you were saying.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.240
 And if you pay close attention,

20:19.240 --> 20:22.480
 you will notice that the more obvious words

20:22.480 --> 20:25.120
 sometimes are the second verse

20:25.120 --> 20:28.120
 and the less obvious are often the first verse

20:28.120 --> 20:31.680
 because it makes the second verse flow much more naturally

20:31.680 --> 20:33.760
 because otherwise it feels contrived.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.480
 Oh, you went and found this like unusual word.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.800
 In Dark Moments, the whole album of Pink Floyd

20:39.800 --> 20:42.600
 and the movie just marked me enormously

20:42.600 --> 20:45.200
 as a teenager, just the wall.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.700
 And there's one song that never actually made it

20:47.700 --> 20:49.840
 into the album that's only there in the movie

20:49.840 --> 20:51.920
 about when the tigers broke free

20:51.920 --> 20:55.040
 and the tigers are the tanks of the Germans.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.120
 And it just describes, again, this vivid imagery.

20:58.120 --> 21:02.960
 It was just before dawn, one miserable morning in Black 44

21:02.960 --> 21:05.760
 when the forward commander was told to sit tight

21:05.760 --> 21:08.360
 when he asked that his men be withdrawn.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.400
 And the generals gave thanks

21:10.400 --> 21:15.400
 as the other ranks held back the enemy tanks for a while.

21:16.040 --> 21:19.520
 And the Anzio bridgehead was held

21:19.520 --> 21:24.520
 for the price of a few hundred ordinary lives.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.960
 So that's a theme that keeps coming back in Pink Floyd

21:26.960 --> 21:28.760
 with Us Versus Them.

21:28.760 --> 21:32.080
 Us and them, God only knows

21:32.080 --> 21:36.200
 that's not what we would choose to do.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.440
 For work he cried from the rear

21:39.440 --> 21:43.960
 and the front rows died from another song.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.240
 It's like this whole concept of Us Versus Them.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.560
 And there's that theme of Us Versus Them again

21:48.560 --> 21:52.800
 where the child is discovering how his father died

21:52.800 --> 21:55.800
 when he finds an old and a found it one day

21:55.800 --> 21:58.360
 in a drawer of old photographs hidden away.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.400
 And my eyes still grow damp to remember

22:01.400 --> 22:05.080
 his majesty's sign with his own rubber stamp.

22:05.080 --> 22:08.480
 So it's so ironic because it seems the way

22:08.480 --> 22:09.960
 that he's writing it that he's not crying

22:09.960 --> 22:11.440
 because his father was lost.

22:11.440 --> 22:15.080
 He's crying because kind old King George

22:15.080 --> 22:17.920
 took the time to actually write mother a note

22:17.920 --> 22:19.920
 about the fact that his father died.

22:19.920 --> 22:23.200
 It's so ironic because it basically says

22:23.200 --> 22:26.720
 we are just ordinary men and of course we're disposable.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.560
 So I don't know if you know the root of the word pioneers

22:30.760 --> 22:34.720
 but you had a chess board here earlier, a pawn.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.760
 In French, it's a pigeon.

22:36.760 --> 22:38.160
 They are the ones that you send to the front

22:38.160 --> 22:40.120
 to get murdered, slaughtered.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.080
 This whole concept of pioneers

22:42.080 --> 22:45.200
 having taken this whole disposable ordinary men

22:45.200 --> 22:48.680
 to actually be the ones that we're now treating as heroes.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.760
 So anyway, there's this juxtaposition of that.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.480
 And then the part that always just strikes me

22:53.480 --> 22:56.680
 is the music and the tonality totally changes.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.000
 And now he describes the attack.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.920
 It was dark all around.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.960
 There was frost in the ground.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.360
 When the tigers broke free

23:05.360 --> 23:10.360
 and no one survived from the Royal Fusiliers company.

23:10.840 --> 23:13.000
 They were all left behind.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.360
 Most of them dead.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.640
 The rest of them dying.

23:18.640 --> 23:23.640
 And that's how the high command took my daddy from me.

23:24.560 --> 23:27.520
 And that song, even though it's not in the album,

23:27.520 --> 23:29.760
 explains the whole movie.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.840
 Cause it's this movie of misery.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.840
 It's this movie of someone being stuck in their head

23:34.840 --> 23:36.800
 and not being able to get out of it.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.840
 There's no other movie that I think has captured so well

23:39.840 --> 23:44.520
 this prison that is someone's own mind.

23:44.520 --> 23:47.000
 And this wall that you're stuck inside

23:47.000 --> 23:50.440
 and this feeling of loneliness.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.880
 And sort of, is there anybody out there?

23:54.040 --> 23:56.440
 And you know, sort of, hello, hello.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.880
 Is there anybody in there?

23:58.880 --> 24:00.920
 Just nod if you can hear me.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.760
 Is there anyone home?

24:04.280 --> 24:06.560
 Come on, yo.

24:06.560 --> 24:08.800
 I hear you're feeling down.

24:08.800 --> 24:13.800
 Just one minute, I hear you nodding in again.

24:15.440 --> 24:16.840
 Anyway, so.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.080
 Yeah, the prison of your mind.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.560
 So those are the darker moments.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.000
 Exactly, these are the darker moments.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.840
 Yeah, in the darker moments, the mind does feel

24:25.840 --> 24:30.120
 like you're trapped alone in a room with it.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.440
 Yeah, and there's this scene in the movie

24:32.440 --> 24:35.600
 which like, where he just breaks out with his guitar

24:35.600 --> 24:36.840
 and there's this prostitute in the room.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.680
 She starts throwing stuff and then he like, you know

24:39.680 --> 24:41.760
 breaks the window, he throws the chair outside.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.640
 And then you see him laying in the pool

24:43.640 --> 24:45.800
 with his own blood, like, you know, everywhere.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.800
 And then there's these endless hours spent

24:48.800 --> 24:51.640
 fixing every little thing and lining it up.

24:51.640 --> 24:55.240
 And it's this whole sort of mania versus, you know

24:55.240 --> 24:57.320
 you can spend hours building up something

24:57.320 --> 24:59.720
 and just destroy it in a few seconds.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.600
 One of my turns is that song.

25:01.600 --> 25:06.600
 And it's like, I feel cold as a tourniquet

25:07.560 --> 25:10.080
 right as a manor.

25:10.080 --> 25:13.920
 Dry as a funeral drum.

25:13.920 --> 25:17.600
 And then the music also is like, run to the bedroom.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.920
 There's a suitcase on the left.

25:19.920 --> 25:23.280
 There you find my favorite acts.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.960
 Don't look so frightened.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.440
 This is just a passing phase.

25:27.440 --> 25:30.040
 One of my bad days.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.120
 It's just so beautiful.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.360
 I need to rewatch it.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.200
 That's so, you're making me realize.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.800
 But imagine watching this as a teenager.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.760
 It like ruins your mind.

25:37.760 --> 25:42.200
 It's like so many, it's such harsh imagery.

25:42.200 --> 25:46.760
 And then, you know, anyway, so there's the dark moment.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.840
 And then again, going back to Sting

25:48.840 --> 25:50.920
 now it's the political songs, Russians.

25:51.760 --> 25:55.800
 And I think that song should be a new national anthem

25:55.800 --> 25:58.560
 for the US, not for Russians, but for red versus blue.

25:58.560 --> 26:02.360
 Mr. Khrushchev says we will bury you.

26:02.360 --> 26:06.040
 I don't subscribe to this point of view.

26:06.040 --> 26:10.240
 It'd be such an ignorant thing to do

26:10.240 --> 26:14.800
 if the Russians love their children too.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.880
 What is it doing?

26:15.880 --> 26:19.080
 It's basically saying the Russians

26:19.080 --> 26:21.440
 are just as humans as we are.

26:21.440 --> 26:24.920
 There's no way that they're gonna let their children die.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.720
 And then it's just so beautiful.

26:26.720 --> 26:30.240
 How can I save my innocent boy

26:30.240 --> 26:33.520
 from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?

26:33.520 --> 26:36.760
 And now that's the new national anthem, are you reading?

26:36.760 --> 26:40.120
 There is no monopoly of common sense

26:40.120 --> 26:43.880
 on either side of the political fence.

26:43.880 --> 26:47.240
 We share the same biology

26:47.240 --> 26:50.680
 regardless of ideology.

26:50.680 --> 26:54.840
 Believe me when I say to you,

26:54.840 --> 26:59.200
 I hope the Russians love their children too.

27:00.280 --> 27:03.680
 There's no such thing as a winnable war.

27:03.680 --> 27:07.120
 It's a lie we don't believe anymore.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.600
 I mean, it's beautiful, right?

27:10.600 --> 27:13.640
 And for God's sake, America, wake up.

27:13.640 --> 27:15.680
 These are your fellow Americans.

27:15.680 --> 27:19.160
 They're your fellow biology.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.440
 There is no monopoly of common sense

27:21.440 --> 27:23.200
 on either side of the political fence.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.320
 It's just so beautiful.

27:24.320 --> 27:27.360
 There's no crisper, simpler way to say

27:27.360 --> 27:31.600
 Russians love their children too, the common humanity.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.240
 And remember what I was telling you,

27:33.240 --> 27:35.240
 I think in one of our first podcasts

27:35.240 --> 27:39.680
 about the daughter who's crying for her brother

27:39.680 --> 27:40.960
 to come back for more.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.200
 And then the Virgin Mary appears and says,

27:43.200 --> 27:44.520
 who should I take instead?

27:44.520 --> 27:47.600
 This Turk, here's his family, here's his children.

27:47.600 --> 27:51.080
 This other one, he just got married, et cetera.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.280
 And that basically says, no.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.320
 I mean, if you look at the Lord of the Rings,

27:56.320 --> 27:59.520
 the enemies are these monsters, they're not human.

27:59.520 --> 28:00.920
 And that's what we always do.

28:00.920 --> 28:04.880
 We always say, they're not like us, they're different.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.280
 They're not humans, et cetera.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.960
 So there's this dehumanization that has to happen

28:08.960 --> 28:10.240
 for people to go to war.

28:11.480 --> 28:14.320
 If you realize just how close we are genetically,

28:14.320 --> 28:18.720
 one with the other, this whole 99.9% identical,

28:18.720 --> 28:22.160
 you can't bear weapons against someone who's like that.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.240
 And the things that are the most meaningful to us

28:24.240 --> 28:28.680
 in our lives at every level is the same on all sides,

28:28.680 --> 28:29.520
 on both sides.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.360
 Exactly.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.400
 So it's not just that we're genetically the same.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.440
 Yeah, we're ideologically the same.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.400
 We love our children, we love our country.

28:36.400 --> 28:40.600
 We will fight for our family.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.920
 So, and the last one I mentioned last time we spoke,

28:43.920 --> 28:46.440
 which is Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now.

28:47.320 --> 28:51.720
 So she has three rounds, one on clouds, one on love,

28:51.720 --> 28:53.360
 and one on life.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.480
 And on clouds she says,

28:55.480 --> 28:58.840
 Rows and flows of angel hair

28:58.840 --> 29:02.120
 And ice cream castles in the air

29:02.120 --> 29:04.600
 And feather canyons everywhere

29:04.600 --> 29:07.160
 I've looked at clouds that way

29:07.160 --> 29:10.640
 But now they only block the sun

29:10.640 --> 29:14.080
 They rain and snow on everyone

29:14.080 --> 29:17.160
 So many things I would have done

29:17.160 --> 29:19.880
 But clouds got in my way

29:19.880 --> 29:23.280
 And then I've looked at clouds from both sides now

29:23.280 --> 29:25.560
 From up and down

29:25.560 --> 29:28.080
 And still somehow it's

29:28.080 --> 29:31.120
 Clouds illusions I recall

29:31.120 --> 29:36.120
 I really don't know clouds at all

29:36.240 --> 29:37.640
 And then she goes on about love,

29:37.640 --> 29:39.200
 how it's super, super happy,

29:39.200 --> 29:42.280
 or it's about misery and loss and about life,

29:42.280 --> 29:45.400
 how it's about winning and losing and so on and so forth.

29:45.400 --> 29:49.200
 But now old friends are acting strange

29:49.200 --> 29:53.160
 They shake their heads, they say I've changed

29:53.160 --> 29:56.880
 Well, something's lost and something's gained

29:56.880 --> 29:59.480
 In living every day

29:59.480 --> 30:02.360
 So again, that's growing up and realizing that,

30:02.360 --> 30:04.880
 well, the view that you had as a kid

30:04.880 --> 30:07.160
 is not necessarily that you have as an adult.

30:07.160 --> 30:09.880
 Remember my poem from when I was 16 years old

30:09.880 --> 30:11.920
 of this whole, you know,

30:11.920 --> 30:14.720
 children dance now all in row and then in the end,

30:14.720 --> 30:16.200
 even though the snow seems bright,

30:16.200 --> 30:17.720
 without you have lost their light,

30:17.720 --> 30:19.600
 sun that sang and moon that smiled.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.960
 So this whole concept of, if you have love

30:22.960 --> 30:24.520
 and if you have passion,

30:24.520 --> 30:26.680
 you see the exact same thing from a different way.

30:26.680 --> 30:28.480
 You can go out running in the rain

30:28.480 --> 30:29.760
 or you could just stay in and say,

30:29.760 --> 30:32.480
 ah, sucks, I won't be able to go outside now.

30:33.480 --> 30:34.320
 Those sides.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.160
 Anyway, and the last one is,

30:36.160 --> 30:38.360
 last, last one I promise, Leonard Cohen.

30:38.360 --> 30:39.600
 This is amazing by the way.

30:39.600 --> 30:44.600
 I'm so glad we stumbled on how much joy you have

30:44.600 --> 30:49.520
 in so many avenues of life and music is just one of them.

30:49.520 --> 30:50.360
 That's amazing.

30:50.360 --> 30:52.160
 But yes, Leonard Cohen.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.120
 Going back to Leonard Cohen,

30:53.120 --> 30:54.040
 since that's where you started.

30:54.040 --> 30:56.360
 So Leonard Cohen's Dance Me to the End of Love.

30:56.360 --> 30:59.440
 That was our opening song in our wedding with my wife.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.280
 Oh no, that's good.

31:00.280 --> 31:01.720
 As we came out to greet the guests,

31:01.720 --> 31:03.360
 it was Dance Me to the End of Love.

31:03.360 --> 31:06.160
 And then another one, which is just so passionate always

31:06.160 --> 31:09.840
 and we always keep referring back to it is I'm Your Man.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.080
 And it goes on and on about sort of,

31:12.080 --> 31:14.480
 I can be every type of lover for you.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.480
 And what's really beautiful in marriage

31:16.480 --> 31:20.000
 is that we live that with my wife every day.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.040
 You can have the passion, you can have the anger,

31:23.040 --> 31:25.760
 you can have the love, you can have the tenderness.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.160
 There's just so many gems in that song.

31:28.160 --> 31:31.520
 If you want a partner, take my hand.

31:31.520 --> 31:35.600
 Or if you want to strike me down in anger,

31:35.600 --> 31:39.760
 here I stand, I'm your man.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.680
 Then if you want a boxer, I will step into the ring for you.

31:43.680 --> 31:46.400
 If you want a driver, climb inside.

31:46.400 --> 31:50.480
 Or if you want to take me for a ride, you know you can.

31:50.480 --> 31:53.840
 So this whole concept of you want to drive, I'll follow.

31:53.840 --> 31:55.520
 You want me to drive, I'll drive.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.640
 And the difference I would say between like that

31:58.640 --> 32:01.760
 and Nemaki Tapa is this song, he's got an attitude.

32:01.760 --> 32:06.080
 He's like, he's proud of his ability

32:06.080 --> 32:09.120
 to basically be any kind of man for as long as opposed

32:09.120 --> 32:14.120
 to the Jacques Brel like desperation of what do I have to be

32:14.800 --> 32:17.520
 for you to love me, that kind of desperation.

32:17.520 --> 32:20.160
 But notice there's a parallel here.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.720
 There's a verse that is perhaps not paid attention

32:22.720 --> 32:27.720
 to as much which says, ah, but a man never got a woman back,

32:29.120 --> 32:32.440
 not by begging on his knees.

32:32.440 --> 32:34.560
 So it seems that the I'm your man

32:34.560 --> 32:37.760
 is actually an apology song in the same way

32:37.760 --> 32:40.480
 that Nemaki Tapa is an apology song.

32:40.480 --> 32:44.800
 Nemaki Tapa basically says I've screwed up.

32:44.800 --> 32:45.680
 I'm sorry, baby.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.000
 And in the same way that the Careless Whisper

32:48.000 --> 32:48.880
 is I'm screwed up.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.240
 Yes, that's right.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.560
 I'm never gonna dance again.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.280
 Guilty feet have got no rhythm.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.840
 So this is an apology song, not by begging on his knees

32:59.840 --> 33:03.360
 or I'd crawl to you, baby, and I'd fall at your feet

33:03.360 --> 33:07.280
 and I'd howl at your beauty like a dog in heat

33:07.280 --> 33:11.040
 and I'd claw at your heart and I'd tear at your sheet.

33:11.040 --> 33:12.080
 I'd say please.

33:13.840 --> 33:16.720
 And then the last one is so beautiful.

33:18.480 --> 33:21.360
 If you want a father for your child

33:22.080 --> 33:27.120
 or only want to walk with me a while across the sand,

33:28.400 --> 33:29.440
 I'm your man.

33:30.480 --> 33:33.200
 That's the last verses which basically says

33:33.200 --> 33:34.240
 you want me for a day?

33:35.680 --> 33:36.720
 I'll be there.

33:36.720 --> 33:37.760
 Do you want me to just walk?

33:37.760 --> 33:38.240
 I'll be there.

33:38.240 --> 33:39.840
 You want me for life?

33:39.840 --> 33:41.200
 Do you want a father for your child?

33:41.200 --> 33:42.240
 I'll be there too.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.600
 It's just so beautiful.

33:43.600 --> 33:44.560
 Oh, sorry.

33:44.560 --> 33:45.680
 Remember how I told you I was gonna finish

33:45.680 --> 33:46.800
 with a lighthearted song?

33:46.800 --> 33:47.300
 Yes.

33:48.000 --> 33:48.880
 Last one.

33:48.880 --> 33:49.380
 You ready?

33:49.840 --> 33:53.200
 So Alison Krauss and Union Station,

33:53.200 --> 33:55.600
 country song, believe it or not, the lucky one.

33:57.280 --> 34:01.120
 So I've never identified as much

34:01.120 --> 34:05.840
 with the lyrics of a song as this one.

34:05.840 --> 34:06.720
 And it's hilarious.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.000
 My friend, Serafim Batoglou,

34:09.040 --> 34:11.600
 is the guy who got me to genomics in the first place.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.520
 I owe enormously to him.

34:13.520 --> 34:14.640
 And he's another Greek.

34:14.640 --> 34:16.080
 We actually met dancing, believe it or not.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.920
 So we used to perform Greek dances.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.400
 I was the president of the International Students Association.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.160
 So we put on these big performances

34:22.160 --> 34:24.080
 for 500 people at MIT.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.320
 And there's a picture on the MIT Tech

34:26.320 --> 34:29.280
 where Serafim, who's like a bodybuilder,

34:29.280 --> 34:30.560
 was holding me on his shoulder.

34:30.560 --> 34:33.120
 And I was like doing maneuvers in the air, basically.

34:34.160 --> 34:35.760
 So anyway, this guy, Serafim,

34:35.760 --> 34:40.160
 we were driving back from a conference.

34:40.160 --> 34:41.680
 And there's this Russian girl

34:41.680 --> 34:44.000
 who was describing how every member of her family

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
 had been either killed by the communists

34:46.000 --> 34:48.400
 or killed by the Germans or killed by the,

34:48.400 --> 34:51.280
 like, she had just like, you know, misery,

34:51.280 --> 34:54.880
 like death and, you know, sickness and everything.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.240
 Everyone was decimated in her family.

34:56.240 --> 34:57.280
 She was the last standing member.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.400
 And we stopped at a, Serafim was driving

35:00.400 --> 35:02.560
 and we stopped at a rest area.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.320
 And he takes me aside and he's like,

35:04.320 --> 35:05.760
 Manolis, we're gonna crash.

35:07.920 --> 35:08.880
 Get her out of my car.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.120
 And then he basically says,

35:11.120 --> 35:14.880
 but I'm only reassured because you're here with me.

35:14.880 --> 35:15.680
 And I'm like, what do you mean?

35:15.680 --> 35:18.080
 He's like, you know, he's like, from your smile,

35:18.720 --> 35:20.400
 I know you're the luckiest man on the planet.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.080
 So there's this really funny thing

35:24.080 --> 35:27.760
 where I just feel freaking lucky all the time.

35:28.480 --> 35:30.400
 And it's a question of attitude.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.240
 Of course, I'm not any luckier than any other person,

35:32.240 --> 35:34.880
 but every time something horrible happens to me,

35:34.880 --> 35:36.960
 I'm like, and in fact, even in that song,

35:36.960 --> 35:38.880
 the song about sort of, you know,

35:38.880 --> 35:40.720
 walking on the beach and this, you know,

35:40.720 --> 35:43.040
 sort of taking our life the wrong way

35:43.040 --> 35:45.200
 and then, you know, having to turn around.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.200
 At some point he's like, you know,

35:47.200 --> 35:49.840
 in the fresh sand, we wrote her name.

35:53.200 --> 35:57.360
 So how nicely that the wind blew and the writing was erased.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.320
 So again, it's this whole sort of,

36:00.320 --> 36:05.200
 not just saying, oh, bummer, but, oh, great.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.400
 I just lost this.

36:06.400 --> 36:09.760
 This must mean something, right?

36:09.760 --> 36:11.120
 This horrible thing happened,

36:11.120 --> 36:14.640
 it must open the door to a beautiful chapter.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.680
 So, so Allison Krauss is talking about the lucky one.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.520
 So I was like, oh my God, she wrote a song for me.

36:21.200 --> 36:24.640
 And she goes, you're the lucky one, I know that now,

36:24.640 --> 36:27.280
 as free as the wind blowing down the road,

36:27.280 --> 36:30.640
 loved by many, hated by none, I'd say,

36:30.640 --> 36:32.480
 you were lucky because you know what you've done,

36:32.480 --> 36:34.960
 not the care in the world, not the worry inside.

36:35.920 --> 36:37.520
 Everything's going to be all right

36:37.520 --> 36:38.720
 because you're the lucky one.

36:39.520 --> 36:42.240
 And then she goes, you're the lucky one,

36:42.240 --> 36:44.560
 always having fun, a jack of all trades,

36:44.560 --> 36:45.760
 a master of none.

36:45.760 --> 36:48.000
 You look at the world with the smiling eyes

36:48.000 --> 36:50.720
 and laugh at the devil as his train rolls by.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.880
 I'll give you a song and a one night stand.

36:53.520 --> 36:55.440
 You'll be looking at a happy man

36:55.440 --> 36:57.120
 because you're the lucky one.

36:57.120 --> 37:00.720
 It basically says, if you just don't worry too much,

37:01.360 --> 37:06.640
 if you don't try to be a one trick pony,

37:06.640 --> 37:08.960
 if you just embrace the fact

37:08.960 --> 37:10.640
 that you might suck at a bunch of things,

37:10.640 --> 37:12.560
 but you're just gonna try a lot of things.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.400
 And then there's another verse that says,

37:15.040 --> 37:17.120
 well, you're blessed I guess,

37:17.120 --> 37:20.000
 but never knowing which road you're choosing,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.160
 to you the next best thing

37:22.160 --> 37:24.480
 to playing and winning is playing and losing.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.480
 It's just so beautiful

37:26.480 --> 37:27.760
 because he basically says,

37:28.240 --> 37:32.640
 if you try your best,

37:33.280 --> 37:34.720
 but it's still playing,

37:35.520 --> 37:36.800
 if you lose, it's okay.

37:36.800 --> 37:37.760
 You had an awesome game.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.280
 And again, superficially,

37:41.280 --> 37:43.040
 it sounds like a super happy song.

37:43.040 --> 37:46.160
 But then there's the last verse basically says,

37:46.160 --> 37:47.920
 no matter where you are, that's where you'll be.

37:47.920 --> 37:50.240
 You can bet your luck won't follow me.

37:50.720 --> 37:53.040
 Just give you a song and then one night stand,

37:53.040 --> 37:54.720
 you'll be looking at a happy man.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.160
 And then in the video of the song,

37:56.160 --> 37:57.760
 she just walks away or he just walks away

37:57.760 --> 37:58.560
 or something like that.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.560
 And it basically tells you

38:00.560 --> 38:02.800
 that freedom comes at a price.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.680
 Freedom comes at the price of non commitment.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.040
 This whole sort of birds who love

38:07.040 --> 38:07.920
 or birds who cry,

38:08.400 --> 38:11.600
 you can't really love unless you cry.

38:11.600 --> 38:12.800
 You can't just be the lucky one,

38:12.800 --> 38:14.000
 the happy boy, la la la,

38:14.960 --> 38:17.280
 and yet have a long term relationship.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.240
 So it's, on one hand,

38:20.240 --> 38:22.240
 I identify with the shallowness of this song,

38:22.240 --> 38:24.080
 of you know, you're the lucky one,

38:24.080 --> 38:25.360
 jack of all trades, a master or none.

38:26.560 --> 38:27.840
 But at the same time,

38:27.840 --> 38:29.920
 I identify with a lesson of,

38:29.920 --> 38:31.920
 well, you can't just be the happy,

38:31.920 --> 38:33.520
 merry, go lucky all the time.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.440
 Sometimes you have to embrace loss

38:35.440 --> 38:37.440
 and sometimes you have to embrace suffering.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.440
 And sometimes you have to embrace that.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.160
 If you have a safety net,

38:42.160 --> 38:43.600
 you're not really committing enough.

38:44.640 --> 38:45.600
 You're not, you know,

38:45.600 --> 38:48.000
 basically you're allowing yourself to slip.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.480
 But if you just go all in

38:50.480 --> 38:52.000
 and you just, you know,

38:52.000 --> 38:53.520
 let go of your reservations,

38:53.520 --> 38:55.200
 that's when you truly will get somewhere.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.160
 So anyway, that's like the,

38:58.160 --> 39:00.720
 I managed to narrow it down to what, 15 songs?

39:01.760 --> 39:03.760
 Thank you for that wonderful journey

39:03.760 --> 39:04.880
 that you just took us on,

39:04.880 --> 39:10.480
 the darkest possible places of Greek song

39:10.480 --> 39:13.520
 to ending on this country song.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.120
 I haven't heard it before,

39:15.120 --> 39:16.800
 but that's exactly right.

39:16.800 --> 39:17.760
 I feel the same way,

39:17.760 --> 39:19.840
 depending on the day,

39:19.840 --> 39:22.240
 is this the luckiest human on earth.

39:22.240 --> 39:23.840
 And there's something to that,

39:23.840 --> 39:27.520
 but you're right, it needs to be,

39:27.520 --> 39:30.800
 we need to now return to the muck of life

39:30.800 --> 39:35.280
 in order to be able to truly enjoy it.

39:35.280 --> 39:35.760
 So it's...

39:35.760 --> 39:36.640
 What do you mean muck?

39:36.640 --> 39:37.200
 What's muck?

39:38.000 --> 39:39.280
 The messiness of life.

39:39.280 --> 39:39.760
 Yeah.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.440
 The things that were,

39:41.440 --> 39:44.480
 things don't turn out the way you expect it to.

39:44.480 --> 39:44.960
 Yeah.

39:44.960 --> 39:47.520
 So like, to feel like you're in the right place,

39:47.520 --> 39:48.800
 to feel lucky,

39:48.800 --> 39:51.680
 is like focusing on the beautiful consequences.

39:51.680 --> 39:52.080
 Yeah.

39:52.080 --> 39:55.440
 But then that feeling of things being different

39:55.440 --> 39:56.640
 than you expected,

39:56.640 --> 39:59.680
 that you stumble in all the kinds of ways,

39:59.680 --> 40:01.280
 that seems to be,

40:01.280 --> 40:03.200
 needs to be paired with the feeling of luck.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.640
 There's basically one way,

40:04.640 --> 40:06.400
 the only way not to make mistakes,

40:06.400 --> 40:07.760
 is to never do anything.

40:07.760 --> 40:08.000
 Right.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.680
 Basically, you have to embrace the fact

40:11.680 --> 40:13.360
 that you'll be wrong so many times.

40:13.360 --> 40:14.720
 In so many research meetings,

40:14.720 --> 40:17.120
 I just go off on a tangent and say,

40:17.120 --> 40:18.880
 let's think about this for a second.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.120
 And it's just crazy for me,

40:21.120 --> 40:22.400
 who's a computer scientist,

40:22.400 --> 40:24.080
 to just tell my biologist friends,

40:24.080 --> 40:25.680
 what if biology kind of worked this way?

40:25.680 --> 40:26.800
 Yeah.

40:26.800 --> 40:27.840
 And they humor me.

40:27.840 --> 40:28.800
 They just let me talk.

40:29.600 --> 40:33.360
 And rarely has it not gone somewhere good.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.600
 It's not that I'm always right,

40:35.600 --> 40:38.560
 but it's always something worth exploring further,

40:39.120 --> 40:42.800
 that if you're an outsider with humility

40:42.800 --> 40:46.000
 and knowing that I'll be wrong a bunch of times,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.320
 but I'll challenge your assumptions,

40:49.680 --> 40:51.520
 and often take us to a better place,

40:52.320 --> 40:54.880
 is part of this whole sort of messiness of life.

40:54.880 --> 40:58.000
 Like if you don't try and lose and get hurt

40:58.000 --> 41:01.040
 and suffer and cry and just break your heart

41:01.040 --> 41:03.680
 and all these feelings of guilt and,

41:03.680 --> 41:04.960
 wow, I did the wrong thing.

41:06.400 --> 41:07.680
 Of course, that's part of life.

41:07.680 --> 41:08.800
 And that's just something that,

41:08.800 --> 41:11.600
 if you are a doer, you'll make mistakes.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.720
 If you're a criticizer, yeah, sure,

41:14.720 --> 41:16.880
 you can sit back and criticize everybody else

41:16.880 --> 41:17.840
 for the mistakes they make.

41:18.560 --> 41:21.360
 Or instead, you can just be out there making those mistakes.

41:21.360 --> 41:23.360
 And frankly, I'd rather be the criticized one

41:23.360 --> 41:24.240
 than the criticizer.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.920
 Yeah, brilliantly put.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.600
 Every time somebody steals my bicycle,

41:27.600 --> 41:29.600
 I say, well, no, my son's like,

41:29.600 --> 41:31.360
 why do they steal our bicycle, dad?

41:31.360 --> 41:34.400
 And I'm like, aren't you happy that you have bicycles

41:34.400 --> 41:35.200
 that people can steal?

41:35.200 --> 41:36.020
 Yeah.

41:36.020 --> 41:39.000
 Aren't you happy that you have bicycles that people can steal?

41:39.000 --> 41:41.640
 I'd rather be the person stolen from than the stealer.

41:41.640 --> 41:44.360
 Yeah, it's not the critic that counts.

41:45.080 --> 41:49.080
 So that's, we've just talked amazingly

41:49.080 --> 41:51.000
 about life from the music perspective.

41:51.640 --> 41:55.080
 Let's talk about life from, human life,

41:55.080 --> 41:57.320
 from perhaps other perspective and its meaning.

41:57.320 --> 42:00.520
 So this is episode 142.

42:00.520 --> 42:05.520
 There is perhaps an absurdly deep meaning

42:08.840 --> 42:13.680
 to the number 42 that our culture has elevated.

42:13.680 --> 42:16.760
 So this is a perfect time to talk about the meaning of life.

42:16.760 --> 42:18.400
 We've talked about it already,

42:18.400 --> 42:22.840
 but do you think this question that's so simple

42:23.880 --> 42:27.540
 and so seemingly absurd has value

42:27.540 --> 42:29.160
 of what is the meaning of life?

42:29.160 --> 42:33.280
 Is it something that raising the question

42:33.280 --> 42:36.520
 and trying to answer it, is that a ridiculous pursuit

42:36.520 --> 42:37.560
 or is there some value?

42:37.560 --> 42:39.360
 Is it answerable at all?

42:39.360 --> 42:42.560
 So first of all, I feel that we owe it to your listeners

42:42.560 --> 42:44.000
 to say why 42?

42:44.000 --> 42:44.840
 Sure.

42:46.040 --> 42:48.340
 So of course the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

42:48.340 --> 42:52.220
 came up with 42 as basically a random number.

42:52.220 --> 42:55.480
 Just, you know, the author just pulled it out of a hat

42:55.480 --> 42:56.680
 and he's admitted so.

42:56.680 --> 43:00.320
 He said, well, 42 just seemed like just random numbers any.

43:01.480 --> 43:05.480
 But in fact, there's many numbers that are linked to 42.

43:05.480 --> 43:09.320
 So 42, again, just to summarize,

43:09.320 --> 43:13.860
 is the answer that these super mega computer

43:13.860 --> 43:15.960
 that had computed for a million years

43:15.960 --> 43:17.800
 with the most powerful computer in the world

43:17.800 --> 43:18.840
 had come up with.

43:18.840 --> 43:20.640
 At some point, the computer says,

43:21.980 --> 43:23.340
 I have an answer.

43:23.340 --> 43:25.360
 And they're like, what?

43:25.360 --> 43:27.200
 It's like, you're not gonna like it.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.280
 Like, what is it?

43:28.280 --> 43:29.120
 It's 42.

43:30.480 --> 43:33.080
 And then the irony is that they had forgotten, of course,

43:33.080 --> 43:33.920
 what the question was.

43:33.920 --> 43:34.880
 Yes.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.360
 So now they have to build a bigger computer

43:36.360 --> 43:37.960
 to figure out what the question is,

43:37.960 --> 43:39.420
 to which the answer is 42.

43:39.420 --> 43:41.520
 So as I was turning 42,

43:41.520 --> 43:43.820
 I basically sort of researched

43:43.820 --> 43:45.760
 why 42 is such a cool number.

43:45.760 --> 43:47.240
 And it turns out that,

43:47.240 --> 43:48.960
 and I put together this little passage

43:48.960 --> 43:51.200
 that was explaining to all those guests

43:51.200 --> 43:53.120
 to my 42nd birthday party

43:53.120 --> 43:54.920
 why we were talking about the meaning of life.

43:54.920 --> 43:58.520
 And basically talked about how 42

43:58.520 --> 44:03.240
 is the angle at which light reflects off of water

44:03.240 --> 44:04.300
 to create a rainbow.

44:05.760 --> 44:07.800
 And it's so beautiful because the rainbow

44:07.800 --> 44:09.920
 is basically the combination of sort of,

44:09.920 --> 44:11.800
 it's been raining, but there's hope

44:11.800 --> 44:13.320
 because the sun just came out.

44:13.320 --> 44:14.920
 So it's a very beautiful number there.

44:14.920 --> 44:17.780
 So 42 is also the sum of all rows and columns

44:17.780 --> 44:21.400
 of a magic cube that contains all consecutive integers

44:21.400 --> 44:22.760
 starting at one.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.680
 So basically, if you take all integers

44:24.680 --> 44:27.360
 between one and however many vertices there are,

44:27.360 --> 44:28.880
 the sums is always 42.

44:29.840 --> 44:34.240
 42 is the only number left under 100

44:34.240 --> 44:36.560
 for which the equation of X to the cube

44:36.560 --> 44:39.720
 plus Y to the cube plus Z to the cube is N

44:39.720 --> 44:42.000
 and was not known to not have a solution.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.160
 And now it's the only one that actually has a solution.

44:46.160 --> 44:50.240
 42 is also one, zero, one, zero, one, zero in binary.

44:50.240 --> 44:51.520
 Again, the yin and the yang,

44:51.520 --> 44:52.680
 the good and the evil,

44:52.680 --> 44:54.960
 one and zero, the balance of the force.

44:54.960 --> 44:58.320
 42 is the number of chromosomes for the giant panda.

44:58.320 --> 45:01.920
 And the giant panda, I know it's totally random.

45:01.920 --> 45:04.280
 It's a suspicious symbol of great strength

45:04.280 --> 45:07.480
 coupled with peace, friendship, gentle temperament,

45:07.480 --> 45:09.520
 harmony, balance, and friendship

45:09.520 --> 45:12.560
 whose black and white colors again symbolize yin and yang.

45:12.560 --> 45:15.040
 The reason why it's the symbol for China

45:15.040 --> 45:19.840
 is exactly the strength, but yet peace and so on and so forth.

45:19.840 --> 45:21.680
 So 42 chromosomes.

45:21.680 --> 45:24.960
 It takes light 10 to the minus 42 seconds

45:24.960 --> 45:27.880
 to cross the diameter of a proton

45:27.880 --> 45:29.560
 connecting the two fundamental dimensions

45:29.560 --> 45:31.160
 of space and time.

45:31.160 --> 45:33.520
 42 is the number of times a piece of paper

45:33.520 --> 45:36.000
 should be folded to reach beyond the moon,

45:40.120 --> 45:41.960
 which is what I assume my students mean

45:41.960 --> 45:44.560
 when they ask that their paper reaches for the stars.

45:44.560 --> 45:46.400
 I just tell them just fold it a bunch of times.

45:46.400 --> 45:51.400
 42 is the number of messier object, 42, which is Orion.

45:54.240 --> 45:58.520
 And that's one of the most famous galaxies.

45:58.520 --> 46:00.800
 It's I think also the place where we can actually see

46:00.800 --> 46:03.000
 the center of our galaxy.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.680
 42 is the numeric representation of the star symbol

46:05.680 --> 46:09.200
 in ASCII, which is very useful

46:09.200 --> 46:10.880
 when searching for the stars.

46:10.880 --> 46:14.240
 And also a reg exp for life, the universe and everything.

46:14.240 --> 46:19.240
 So star, in Egyptian mythology, the goddess Maat

46:20.120 --> 46:22.320
 which was personifying truth and justice

46:22.320 --> 46:25.600
 would ask 42 questions to every dying person.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.960
 And those answering successfully would become stars

46:27.960 --> 46:30.440
 continued to give life and fuel universal growth.

46:31.320 --> 46:35.680
 In Judaic tradition, God ascribe the 42 lettered name

46:35.680 --> 46:38.080
 and trusted only to the middle age pious meek

46:38.080 --> 46:42.120
 free from bad temper, sober and not insistent on his rights.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.440
 And in Christian tradition, there's 42 generations

46:44.440 --> 46:47.240
 from Abraham, Isaac, that we talked about,

46:47.240 --> 46:51.520
 the story of Isaac, Jacob, eventually Joseph, Mary and Jesus.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.920
 In Kabbalistic tradition, Elocha, which is 42

46:54.920 --> 46:57.920
 is the number with which God creates the universe

46:57.920 --> 47:02.920
 starting with 25, let there be and ending with 70, good.

47:02.920 --> 47:07.920
 So 25 plus, you know, 17, there's a 42 chapter sutra,

47:08.480 --> 47:10.600
 which is the first Indian religious tradition

47:10.600 --> 47:12.840
 which is the first Indian religious scripture

47:12.840 --> 47:14.640
 which was translated to Chinese,

47:14.640 --> 47:18.800
 thus introducing Buddhism to China from India.

47:18.800 --> 47:21.920
 The 42 line Bible was the first printed book

47:21.920 --> 47:25.760
 marking the age of printing in the 1450s

47:25.760 --> 47:27.240
 and the dissemination of knowledge

47:27.240 --> 47:29.560
 eventually leading to the enlightenment.

47:29.560 --> 47:33.240
 A yeast cell, which is called a single cell eukaryote

47:33.240 --> 47:34.800
 and the subject of my PhD research

47:34.800 --> 47:38.080
 has exactly 42 million proteins.

47:38.080 --> 47:40.840
 Anyway, so there's a series of 42.

47:40.840 --> 47:42.920
 You're on fire with this, these are really good.

47:42.920 --> 47:45.680
 So I guess what you're saying is just a random number.

47:45.680 --> 47:47.280
 Yeah, basically.

47:47.280 --> 47:49.200
 So all of these are backronyms.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.440
 So, you know, after you have the number,

47:50.440 --> 47:52.120
 you figure out why that number.

47:52.120 --> 47:56.360
 So anyway, so now that we've spoken about Y42,

47:56.360 --> 47:58.240
 why do we search for meaning?

47:58.240 --> 48:01.080
 And you're asking, you know, will that search

48:01.080 --> 48:02.560
 ultimately lead to our destruction?

48:02.560 --> 48:04.840
 And my thinking is exactly the opposite.

48:04.840 --> 48:08.520
 So basically that asking about meaning

48:08.520 --> 48:11.480
 is something that's so inherent to human nature.

48:11.480 --> 48:13.440
 It's something that makes life beautiful

48:13.440 --> 48:14.960
 that makes it worth living.

48:14.960 --> 48:18.480
 And that searching for meaning is actually the point.

48:18.480 --> 48:19.680
 It's not the finding it.

48:19.680 --> 48:21.640
 I think when you found it, you're dead.

48:22.720 --> 48:26.520
 Don't ever be satisfied that, you know, I've got it.

48:26.520 --> 48:30.080
 So I like to say that life is lived forward

48:30.080 --> 48:32.280
 but it only makes sense backward.

48:32.280 --> 48:34.440
 And I don't remember whose quote that is,

48:34.440 --> 48:39.440
 but the whole search itself is the meaning.

48:39.680 --> 48:41.880
 And what I love about it is that

48:43.360 --> 48:44.960
 there's a double search going on.

48:44.960 --> 48:47.640
 There's a search in every one of us

48:47.640 --> 48:50.760
 through our own lives to find meaning.

48:50.760 --> 48:52.960
 And then there's a search which is happening

48:52.960 --> 48:55.920
 for humanity itself to find our meaning.

48:56.800 --> 49:01.560
 And we as humans like to look at animals and say,

49:01.560 --> 49:03.120
 of course they have a meaning.

49:03.120 --> 49:04.960
 Like a dog has its meaning.

49:04.960 --> 49:07.000
 It's just a bunch of instincts, you know,

49:07.000 --> 49:09.400
 running around, loving everything.

49:09.400 --> 49:11.520
 You know, remember our joke with a cat and the dog.

49:11.520 --> 49:14.360
 Yeah, cat has no meaning.

49:14.360 --> 49:15.400
 No, no.

49:15.400 --> 49:20.400
 So, and I'm noticing the yin yang symbol right here

49:20.600 --> 49:23.360
 with this whole panda, black and white and the 0102.

49:23.360 --> 49:24.960
 You're on fire with that 42.

49:24.960 --> 49:29.520
 Some of those are gold ASCII value for a star symbol.

49:29.520 --> 49:30.360
 Damn.

49:30.360 --> 49:34.280
 So basically in my view, the search for meaning

49:34.280 --> 49:39.200
 and the act of searching for something more meaningful

49:39.200 --> 49:43.160
 is life's meaning by itself.

49:43.160 --> 49:45.600
 The fact that we kind of always hope that,

49:45.600 --> 49:47.960
 yes, maybe for animals that's not the case,

49:47.960 --> 49:51.200
 but maybe humans have something that we should be doing

49:51.200 --> 49:52.040
 and something else.

49:52.040 --> 49:53.480
 And it's not just about procreation.

49:53.480 --> 49:55.400
 It's not just about dominance.

49:55.400 --> 49:58.320
 It's not just about strength and feeding, et cetera.

49:58.320 --> 50:00.840
 Like we're the one species that spends such a tiny,

50:00.840 --> 50:03.400
 little minority of its time feeding

50:03.400 --> 50:08.400
 that we have this enormous, huge cognitive capability

50:08.720 --> 50:11.080
 that we can just use for all kinds of other stuff.

50:11.080 --> 50:12.880
 And that's where art comes in.

50:12.880 --> 50:15.920
 That's where the healthy mind comes in

50:15.920 --> 50:18.280
 with exploring all of these different aspects

50:18.280 --> 50:23.280
 that are just not directly tied to a purpose.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.760
 That's not directly tied to a function.

50:25.760 --> 50:28.520
 It's really just the playing of life.

50:28.520 --> 50:32.400
 The, you know, not for particular reason.

50:32.400 --> 50:34.240
 Do you think this thing we got,

50:34.240 --> 50:38.120
 this mind is unique in the universe

50:39.640 --> 50:41.680
 in terms of how difficult it is to build?

50:43.320 --> 50:47.480
 Is it possible that we're the most beautiful thing

50:47.480 --> 50:49.840
 that the universe has constructed?

50:49.840 --> 50:51.120
 Both the most beautiful and the most ugly,

50:51.120 --> 50:52.520
 but certainly the most complex.

50:52.520 --> 50:55.040
 So look at evolutionary time.

50:55.040 --> 50:58.880
 The dinosaurs ruled the earth for 135 million years.

50:58.880 --> 51:00.920
 We've been around for a million years.

51:02.960 --> 51:05.800
 So one versus 135.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.720
 So dinosaurs were extinct, you know,

51:07.720 --> 51:09.080
 about 60 million years ago

51:09.080 --> 51:11.000
 and mammals that had been happily evolving

51:11.000 --> 51:13.280
 as tiny little creatures for 30 million years

51:13.280 --> 51:15.440
 then took over the planet and then, you know,

51:15.440 --> 51:17.960
 dramatically radiated about 60 million years ago.

51:19.080 --> 51:24.000
 Out of these mammals came the neocortex formation.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.560
 So basically the neocortex,

51:25.560 --> 51:28.040
 which is sort of the outer layer of our brain

51:28.040 --> 51:29.800
 compared to our quote unquote reptilian brain,

51:29.800 --> 51:33.160
 which we share the structure of with all of the dinosaurs.

51:33.160 --> 51:36.000
 They didn't have that and yet they ruled the planet.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.720
 So how many other planets have still, you know,

51:38.720 --> 51:41.560
 mindless dinosaurs where strength

51:41.560 --> 51:45.440
 was the only dimension ruling the planet?

51:45.440 --> 51:49.360
 So there was something weird that annihilated the dinosaurs.

51:49.360 --> 51:51.040
 And again, you could look at biblical things

51:51.040 --> 51:53.720
 of sort of God coming and wiping out his creatures

51:53.720 --> 51:55.080
 to make room for the next ones.

51:55.080 --> 51:59.120
 So the mammals basically sort of took over the planet

51:59.120 --> 52:03.160
 and then grew this cognitive capability

52:03.160 --> 52:06.240
 of this general purpose machine.

52:06.240 --> 52:10.520
 And primates push that to extreme

52:10.520 --> 52:15.480
 and humans among primates have just exploded that hardware.

52:15.480 --> 52:20.480
 But that hardware is selected for survival.

52:20.480 --> 52:23.080
 It's selected for procreation.

52:23.080 --> 52:26.160
 It's initially selected with his very simple

52:26.160 --> 52:30.440
 Darwinian view of the world of random mutation,

52:30.440 --> 52:32.640
 ruthless selection, and then selection

52:32.640 --> 52:34.240
 for making more of yourself.

52:35.720 --> 52:38.880
 If you look at human cognition,

52:38.880 --> 52:41.680
 it's gone down a weird evolutionary path

52:41.680 --> 52:44.800
 in the sense that we are expanding

52:44.800 --> 52:47.840
 an enormous amount of energy on this apparatus

52:47.840 --> 52:50.720
 between our ears that is wasting, what,

52:50.720 --> 52:53.800
 15% of our bodily energy, 20%,

52:53.800 --> 52:57.800
 like some enormous percentage of our calories

52:57.800 --> 52:59.600
 go to function our brain.

53:00.800 --> 53:03.960
 No other species makes that big of a commitment.

53:03.960 --> 53:06.840
 That has basically taken energetic changes

53:06.840 --> 53:11.280
 for efficiency on the metabolic side for humanity

53:11.280 --> 53:13.400
 to basically power that thing.

53:13.400 --> 53:17.000
 And our brain is both enormously more efficient

53:17.000 --> 53:20.480
 than other brains, but also, despite this efficiency,

53:20.480 --> 53:22.320
 enormously more energy consuming.

53:23.480 --> 53:27.000
 So, and if you look at just the sheer folds

53:27.000 --> 53:30.400
 that the human brain has, again, our skull could only

53:30.400 --> 53:32.720
 grow so much before it could no longer go

53:32.720 --> 53:36.600
 through the pelvic opening and kill the mother

53:36.600 --> 53:40.560
 at every birth, so, but yet the folds continued

53:40.560 --> 53:43.720
 effectively creating just so much more capacity.

53:43.720 --> 53:48.720
 The evolutionary context in which this was made

53:48.720 --> 53:52.040
 is enormously fascinating, and it has to do with

53:53.480 --> 53:55.680
 other humans that we have now killed off

53:55.680 --> 53:57.480
 or that have gone extinct.

53:57.480 --> 54:01.360
 And that has now created this weird place of humans

54:01.360 --> 54:03.520
 on the planet as the only species

54:03.520 --> 54:05.880
 that has this enormous hardware.

54:05.880 --> 54:07.520
 So that can basically make us think

54:07.520 --> 54:09.200
 that there's something very weird and unique

54:09.200 --> 54:11.080
 that happened in human evolution that perhaps

54:11.080 --> 54:13.640
 has not been recreated elsewhere. Maybe the asteroid

54:13.640 --> 54:15.920
 didn't hit, you know, sister earth,

54:15.920 --> 54:19.400
 and dinosaurs are still ruling, and, you know,

54:19.400 --> 54:21.120
 any kind of proto human is squished

54:21.120 --> 54:22.960
 and eaten for breakfast basically.

54:25.440 --> 54:28.640
 However, we're not as unique as we like to think

54:28.640 --> 54:30.720
 because there was this enormous diversity

54:30.720 --> 54:33.040
 of other human like forms.

54:33.040 --> 54:35.720
 And once you make it to that stage where you have

54:35.720 --> 54:38.760
 a neocortex like explosion of, wow, we're not

54:38.760 --> 54:41.200
 competing on intelligence, and we're not competing

54:41.200 --> 54:43.080
 on social structures, and we're not competing

54:43.080 --> 54:47.840
 on larger and larger groups, and being able to

54:47.840 --> 54:51.880
 coordinate and being able to have empathy,

54:51.880 --> 54:55.280
 the concept of empathy, the concept of an ego,

54:55.280 --> 54:58.640
 the concept of a self, of self awareness,

54:58.640 --> 55:03.640
 comes probably from being able to project

55:04.000 --> 55:06.520
 another person's intentions,

55:06.520 --> 55:10.000
 another person's intentions to understand

55:10.000 --> 55:13.480
 what they mean when you have these large cognitive groups,

55:13.480 --> 55:15.160
 large social groups.

55:15.160 --> 55:19.080
 So me being able to sort of create a mental model

55:19.080 --> 55:22.520
 of how you think may have come before I was able

55:22.520 --> 55:26.360
 to create a personal mental model of how do I think.

55:26.360 --> 55:30.680
 So this introspection probably came after this sort

55:30.680 --> 55:34.640
 of projection and this empathy, which basically means,

55:34.640 --> 55:37.720
 you know, passion, pathos, suffering,

55:37.720 --> 55:39.120
 but basically sensing.

55:39.120 --> 55:42.600
 So basically empathy means feeling what you're feeling,

55:42.600 --> 55:45.320
 trying to project your emotional state

55:45.320 --> 55:47.520
 onto my cognitive apparatus.

55:47.520 --> 55:51.360
 And I think that is what eventually led

55:51.360 --> 55:55.240
 to this enormous cognitive explosion

55:55.240 --> 55:56.680
 that happened in humanity.

55:56.680 --> 56:01.680
 So, you know, life itself in my view is inevitable

56:02.840 --> 56:03.680
 on every planet.

56:03.680 --> 56:05.480
 Inevitable. Inevitable.

56:05.480 --> 56:09.920
 But the evolution of life to self awareness and cognition

56:09.920 --> 56:12.680
 and all the incredible things that humans have done,

56:12.680 --> 56:14.600
 you know, that might not be as inevitable.

56:14.600 --> 56:15.440
 That's your intuition.

56:15.440 --> 56:20.440
 So if you were to sort of estimate and bet some money on it,

56:20.640 --> 56:24.920
 if we reran Earth a million times,

56:26.000 --> 56:29.520
 would what we got now be the most special thing

56:29.520 --> 56:30.960
 and how often would it be?

56:30.960 --> 56:34.760
 So scientifically speaking, how repeatable is this experiment?

56:36.240 --> 56:38.640
 So this whole cognitive revolution?

56:38.640 --> 56:39.480
 Yes.

56:40.520 --> 56:41.920
 Maybe not.

56:41.920 --> 56:42.760
 Maybe not.

56:42.760 --> 56:47.640
 Basically, I feel that the longevity of, you know,

56:47.640 --> 56:51.880
 dinosaurs suggests that it was not quite inevitable

56:51.880 --> 56:56.680
 that we humans eventually made it.

56:56.680 --> 56:59.200
 What you're also implying one thing here.

56:59.200 --> 57:01.120
 You're saying, you're implying that humans

57:01.120 --> 57:03.320
 also don't have this longevity.

57:03.320 --> 57:05.000
 This is the interesting question.

57:05.000 --> 57:09.480
 So with the Fermi Paradox, the idea that the basic question

57:09.480 --> 57:14.360
 is like, if the universe has a lot of alien life forms in it,

57:14.360 --> 57:16.440
 why haven't we seen them?

57:16.440 --> 57:19.320
 And one thought is that there's a great filter

57:19.320 --> 57:23.600
 or multiple great filters that basically would destroy

57:23.600 --> 57:24.880
 intelligent civilizations.

57:24.880 --> 57:28.560
 Like this thing that we, you know, this multifolding brain

57:28.560 --> 57:32.080
 that keeps growing may not be such a big feature.

57:32.080 --> 57:34.200
 It might be useful for survival,

57:34.200 --> 57:38.400
 but it like takes us down a side road

57:38.400 --> 57:41.120
 that is a very short one with a quick dead end.

57:41.120 --> 57:42.160
 What do you think about that?

57:42.160 --> 57:45.560
 So I think the universe is enormous,

57:45.560 --> 57:48.240
 not just in space, but also in time.

57:50.040 --> 57:55.040
 And the pretense that, you know, the last blink

57:55.040 --> 57:58.760
 of an instant that we've been able to send radio waves

57:58.760 --> 58:00.320
 is when somebody should have been paying attention

58:00.320 --> 58:02.920
 to our planet is a little ridiculous.

58:03.840 --> 58:07.200
 So my, you know, what I love about Star Wars

58:07.200 --> 58:10.720
 is a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

58:10.720 --> 58:11.880
 It's not like some distant future.

58:11.880 --> 58:13.480
 It's a long, long time ago.

58:13.480 --> 58:15.960
 What I love about it is that basically says,

58:15.960 --> 58:19.360
 you know, evolution and civilization

58:19.360 --> 58:23.760
 are just so recent in, you know, on earth.

58:23.760 --> 58:25.080
 Like there's countless other planets

58:25.080 --> 58:27.720
 that have probably all kinds of life forms,

58:27.720 --> 58:30.400
 multicellular perhaps, and so on and so forth.

58:31.560 --> 58:35.840
 But the fact that humanity has only been listening

58:35.840 --> 58:39.360
 and emitting for just this tiny little blink

58:39.360 --> 58:42.800
 means that any of these, you know, alien civilizations

58:42.800 --> 58:44.080
 would need to be paying attention

58:44.080 --> 58:47.160
 to every single insignificant planet out there.

58:47.160 --> 58:50.320
 And, you know, again, I mean, the movie Contact

58:50.320 --> 58:52.360
 and the book is just so beautiful.

58:52.360 --> 58:56.160
 This whole concept of we don't need to travel physically.

58:56.160 --> 58:57.680
 We can travel as light.

58:57.680 --> 59:01.000
 We can send instructions for people to create machines

59:01.000 --> 59:03.080
 that will allow us to beam down light

59:03.080 --> 59:04.840
 and recreate ourselves.

59:04.840 --> 59:07.480
 And in the book, you know, the aliens actually take over.

59:07.480 --> 59:09.800
 They're not as friendly.

59:09.800 --> 59:13.520
 But, you know, this concept that we have to eventually

59:13.520 --> 59:14.720
 go and conquer every planet.

59:14.720 --> 59:16.640
 I mean, I think that, yes,

59:16.640 --> 59:18.560
 we will become a galactic species.

59:18.560 --> 59:22.440
 So you have a hope, well, you said think, so.

59:22.440 --> 59:23.280
 Oh, of course, of course.

59:23.280 --> 59:25.840
 I mean, now that we've made it so far.

59:25.840 --> 59:27.200
 So you feel like we've made it.

59:27.200 --> 59:30.080
 Oh gosh, I feel that, you know, cognition,

59:30.080 --> 59:31.760
 the cognition as an evolutionary trait

59:31.760 --> 59:33.800
 has won over in our planet.

59:33.800 --> 59:35.320
 There's no doubt that we've made it.

59:35.320 --> 59:40.240
 So basically humans have won the battle for, you know,

59:40.240 --> 59:41.360
 dominance.

59:41.360 --> 59:43.760
 It wasn't necessarily the case with dinosaurs.

59:43.760 --> 59:46.120
 Like, I mean, yes, you know,

59:46.120 --> 59:50.360
 there's some claims of intelligence.

59:50.360 --> 59:53.800
 And if you look at Jurassic Park, yeah, sure, whatever.

59:53.800 --> 59:56.920
 But, you know, they just don't have the hardware for it.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.280
 And humans have the hardware.

59:59.280 --> 1:00:01.360
 There's no doubt that mammals have

1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:03.640
 a dramatically improved hardware

1:00:03.640 --> 1:00:06.080
 for cognition over dinosaurs.

1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:09.440
 Like basically there's universes where strength won out.

1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:11.640
 And in our planet, in our, you know,

1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:15.560
 particular version of whatever happened in this planet,

1:00:15.560 --> 1:00:16.920
 cognition won out.

1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:18.000
 And it's kind of cool.

1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.480
 I mean, it's a privilege, right?

1:00:20.480 --> 1:00:22.000
 It's kind of like living in Boston instead of,

1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.560
 I don't know, some middle age place

1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:28.040
 where everybody's like hitting each other

1:00:28.040 --> 1:00:31.120
 with, you know, weapons and sticks.

1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:33.640
 You're back to the Lucky Ones song.

1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:36.040
 I mean, we are the lucky ones.

1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:39.600
 But the flip side of that is that this hardware

1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:41.600
 also allows us to develop weapons

1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:43.840
 and methods of destroying ourselves.

1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:46.840
 Again, I want to go back to Pinker

1:00:46.840 --> 1:00:49.520
 and the better angels of our nature.

1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:53.960
 The whole concept that civilization

1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:57.040
 and the act of civilizing

1:00:57.040 --> 1:01:02.040
 has dramatically reduced violence, dramatically.

1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:05.320
 If you look, you know, at every scale,

1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:07.880
 as soon as organization comes,

1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:12.880
 the state basically owns the right to violence.

1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:17.520
 And eventually the state gives that right

1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:20.400
 of governance to the people,

1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:23.400
 but violence has been eliminated by that state.

1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:27.080
 So this whole concept of central governance

1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:28.880
 and people agreeing to live together

1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:33.960
 and share responsibilities and duties

1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:36.760
 and, you know, all of that

1:01:36.760 --> 1:01:41.520
 is something that has led so much to less violence,

1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:45.720
 less death, less suffering, less, you know, poverty,

1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:48.720
 less, you know, war.

1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:53.520
 I mean, yes, we have the capability to destroy ourselves,

1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:56.520
 but the arc of civilization

1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.680
 has led to much, much less destruction,

1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:00.840
 much, much less war and much more peace.

1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:04.000
 And of course there's blips back and forth

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.400
 and, you know, there are setbacks,

1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:10.200
 but again, the moral arc of the universe.

1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:13.280
 But it seems to just, I probably imagine

1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:14.960
 there were two dinosaurs back in the day

1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:17.080
 having this exact conversation

1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:18.600
 and they look up to the sky

1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:21.200
 and there seems to be something like an asteroid

1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:22.040
 going towards Earth.

1:02:22.040 --> 1:02:24.760
 So it's, while it's very true

1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:28.520
 that the arc of our society of human civilization

1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:31.480
 seems to be progressing towards a better, better life

1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:34.860
 for everybody in the many ways that you described,

1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:39.160
 things can change in a moment.

1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:41.620
 And it feels like it's not just us humans

1:02:41.620 --> 1:02:44.160
 we're living through a pandemic.

1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:47.960
 You could imagine that a pandemic would be more destructive

1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:52.540
 or there could be asteroids that just appear

1:02:52.540 --> 1:02:54.480
 out of the darkness of space,

1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:57.760
 which I recently learned it's not that easy

1:02:57.760 --> 1:02:59.920
 to actually detect them.

1:02:59.920 --> 1:03:00.760
 Yes.

1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:02.960
 So 48, what happens in 48 years?

1:03:04.620 --> 1:03:05.460
 I'm not sure.

1:03:05.460 --> 1:03:07.000
 2068, Apophis.

1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.600
 There's an asteroid that's coming.

1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:11.560
 In 48 years, it has very high chance

1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:13.560
 of actually wiping us out completely.

1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:14.400
 Yes.

1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:15.240
 Yes.

1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:18.580
 So we have 48 years to get our act together.

1:03:18.580 --> 1:03:21.040
 It's not like some distant, distant hypothesis.

1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:21.880
 Yes.

1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:23.120
 Like, yeah, sure, they're hard to detect

1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:25.280
 but this one we know about, it's coming.

1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:26.240
 So how do you feel about that?

1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:27.200
 Why are you still so optimistic?

1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:29.840
 Oh gosh, I'm so happy with where we are now.

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:30.880
 This is gonna be great.

1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:32.760
 Seriously, if you look at progress,

1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:36.880
 if you look at, again, the speed with which knowledge

1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:40.760
 has been transferred, what has led to humanity

1:03:40.760 --> 1:03:43.280
 making so many advances so fast?

1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:44.360
 Okay.

1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:47.560
 So what has led to humanity making so many advances

1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:50.360
 is not just the hardware upgrades,

1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:52.600
 it's also the software upgrades.

1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:55.520
 So by hardware upgrades, I basically mean our neocortex

1:03:55.520 --> 1:03:57.320
 and the expansion and these layers

1:03:57.320 --> 1:04:00.300
 and folds of our brain and all of that.

1:04:00.300 --> 1:04:01.380
 That's the hardware.

1:04:01.380 --> 1:04:03.360
 The software hasn't,

1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:06.600
 you know, the hardware hasn't changed much

1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:08.420
 in the last, what, 70,000 years.

1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:12.000
 As I mentioned last time,

1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:13.580
 if you take a person from ancient Egypt

1:04:13.580 --> 1:04:18.020
 and you bring them up now, they're just as equally fit.

1:04:18.020 --> 1:04:20.520
 So hardware hasn't changed.

1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:22.480
 What has changed is software.

1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:27.480
 What has changed is that we are growing up in societies

1:04:28.920 --> 1:04:30.920
 that are much more complex.

1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:33.840
 This whole concept of neoteny basically allows

1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:35.800
 our exponential growth.

1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:39.160
 The concept that our brain has not fully formed,

1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:43.620
 has not fully stabilized itself until after our teenage years.

1:04:43.620 --> 1:04:46.680
 So we basically have a good 16 years, 18 years

1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:48.920
 to sort of infuse it with the latest

1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:51.240
 and greatest in software.

1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:53.920
 If you look at what happened in ancient Greece,

1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:57.420
 why did everything explode at once?

1:04:57.420 --> 1:04:59.720
 My take on this is that it was the shift

1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:03.560
 from the Egyptian and hieroglyphic software

1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:05.720
 to the Greek language software.

1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:10.000
 This whole concept of creating abstract notions,

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:15.000
 of creating these layers of cognition

1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:19.560
 and layers of meaning and layers of abstraction

1:05:19.560 --> 1:05:24.560
 for words and ideals and beauty and harmony.

1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:26.880
 How do you write harmony in hieroglyphics?

1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:28.300
 There's no such thing as, you know,

1:05:28.300 --> 1:05:31.600
 sort of expressing these ideals of peace and justice

1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:34.440
 and, you know, these concepts of,

1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:39.440
 or even, you know, macabre concepts of doom, et cetera.

1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:42.200
 You don't have the language for it.

1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:47.200
 Your brain has trouble getting at that concept.

1:05:48.360 --> 1:05:53.200
 So what I'm trying to say is that these software upgrades

1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:57.000
 for human language, human culture,

1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:00.160
 human environment, human education

1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:04.760
 have basically led to this enormous explosion of knowledge.

1:06:04.760 --> 1:06:07.240
 And eventually after the enlightenment,

1:06:07.240 --> 1:06:11.360
 and as I was mentioning the 42 line Bible

1:06:11.360 --> 1:06:13.800
 and the printed press, the dissemination of knowledge,

1:06:13.800 --> 1:06:17.120
 you basically now have this whole horizontal dispersion

1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:21.360
 of ideas in addition to the vertical inheritance of genes.

1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:24.040
 So the hardware improvements happen

1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:25.520
 through vertical inheritance.

1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:27.060
 The software improvements happen

1:06:27.060 --> 1:06:28.760
 through horizontal inheritance.

1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:31.400
 And the reason why human civilization exploded

1:06:31.400 --> 1:06:32.720
 is not a hardware change anymore,

1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:34.600
 it's really a software change.

1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:37.260
 So if you're looking at now where we are today,

1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:40.520
 look at coronavirus.

1:06:40.520 --> 1:06:43.360
 Yes, sure, it could have killed us a hundred years ago,

1:06:43.360 --> 1:06:45.600
 it would have, but it didn't.

1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:46.440
 Why?

1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:51.000
 Because in January, we published the genome.

1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.020
 A month later, less than a month later,

1:06:53.020 --> 1:06:54.960
 the first vaccine designs were done.

1:06:54.960 --> 1:06:58.240
 And now less than a year later, 10 months later,

1:06:58.240 --> 1:07:01.240
 we already have a working vaccine that's 90% efficient.

1:07:01.240 --> 1:07:03.760
 I mean, that is ridiculous by any standards.

1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:06.000
 And the reason is sharing.

1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:09.460
 So the asteroid, yes, could wipe us out in 48 years,

1:07:09.460 --> 1:07:11.040
 but 48 years?

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:16.040
 I mean, look at where we were 48 years ago, technologically.

1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:18.420
 I mean, how much more we understand

1:07:18.420 --> 1:07:23.020
 the basic foundations of space is enormous.

1:07:23.020 --> 1:07:27.360
 The technological revolutions of digitization,

1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:29.900
 the amount of compute power we can put

1:07:29.900 --> 1:07:34.900
 on any nail size hardware is enormous.

1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:40.580
 And this is nowhere near ending.

1:07:40.580 --> 1:07:43.820
 We all have our little problems going back and forth

1:07:43.820 --> 1:07:46.240
 on the social side and on the political side,

1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:50.600
 on the sort of human side and the societal side,

1:07:50.600 --> 1:07:54.120
 but science has not slowed down.

1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:57.400
 Science is moving at a breakneck pace ahead.

1:07:57.400 --> 1:08:00.640
 So, you know, Elon is now putting rockets out

1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:01.700
 from the private space.

1:08:01.700 --> 1:08:06.080
 I mean, that now democratization of space exploration

1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:07.920
 is, you know, gonna revolutionize everything.

1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:09.800
 It's gonna explode, continue.

1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:12.600
 In the same way that every technology has exploded,

1:08:12.600 --> 1:08:15.940
 this is the shift to space technology exploding.

1:08:15.940 --> 1:08:19.360
 So 48 years is infinity from now

1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:21.300
 in terms of space capabilities.

1:08:21.300 --> 1:08:22.640
 So I'm not worried at all.

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:25.840
 Are you excited by the possibility of a human,

1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:28.440
 well, one, a human stepping foot on Mars

1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:33.060
 and two, possible colonization of not necessarily Mars,

1:08:33.060 --> 1:08:34.840
 but other planets and all that kind of stuff

1:08:34.840 --> 1:08:36.120
 for people living in space?

1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:37.120
 Inevitable.

1:08:37.120 --> 1:08:38.320
 Inevitable. Inevitable.

1:08:38.320 --> 1:08:39.160
 Would you do it?

1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:41.520
 Or do you kind of like Earth? Of course, of course.

1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:42.360
 You know, how many?

1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:44.000
 How many people will you wait?

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.080
 Will you wait for, I think it was about

1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:50.000
 when the Declaration of Independence was signed,

1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.560
 about two to three million people lived here.

1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:54.440
 So would you move like before?

1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:57.000
 Would you be like on the first boat?

1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:58.300
 Would you be on the 10th boat?

1:08:58.300 --> 1:09:00.480
 Would you wait until the Declaration of Independence?

1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:02.120
 I don't think I'll be on the short list

1:09:02.120 --> 1:09:04.000
 because I'll be old by then.

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.120
 They'll probably get a bunch of younger people.

1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:09.760
 But you're, it's the wisdom and the,

1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:12.000
 then again, you are the lucky one.

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.640
 But wisdom can be transferred horizontally.

1:09:13.640 --> 1:09:15.240
 I gotta tell you, you are the lucky one.

1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:16.200
 So you might be on the list.

1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:17.040
 I don't know.

1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:20.320
 I mean, I kind of feel like I would love

1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:23.840
 to see Earth from above, just to watch our planet.

1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:25.560
 I mean, just, I mean, you know,

1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:29.360
 you can watch a live feed of the space station.

1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:32.640
 Watching Earth is magnificent,

1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:35.840
 like this blue tiny little shield.

1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:38.040
 It's so thin, our atmosphere.

1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:39.180
 Like if you drive to New York,

1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:40.560
 you're basically in outer space.

1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:41.480
 I mean, it's ridiculous.

1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:42.520
 It's just so thin.

1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:45.060
 And it's just, again, such a privilege

1:09:45.060 --> 1:09:47.300
 to be on this planet, such a privilege.

1:09:47.300 --> 1:09:52.300
 But I think our species is in for big, good things.

1:09:54.860 --> 1:09:56.340
 I think that, you know,

1:09:56.340 --> 1:09:58.820
 we will overcome our little problems

1:09:58.820 --> 1:10:01.420
 and eventually come together as a species.

1:10:01.420 --> 1:10:04.380
 I feel that we're definitely on the path to that.

1:10:04.380 --> 1:10:07.900
 And, you know, it's just not permeated

1:10:07.900 --> 1:10:09.660
 through the whole universe yet.

1:10:09.660 --> 1:10:11.260
 I mean, through the whole world yet,

1:10:11.260 --> 1:10:12.580
 through the whole Earth yet,

1:10:12.580 --> 1:10:14.260
 but it's definitely permeating.

1:10:15.380 --> 1:10:17.680
 So you've talked about humans as special.

1:10:18.860 --> 1:10:23.860
 How exactly are we special relative to the dinosaurs?

1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:27.520
 So I mentioned that there's, you know,

1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:31.720
 this dramatic cognitive improvement that we've made,

1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:34.000
 but I think it goes much deeper than that.

1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:38.740
 So if you look at a lion attacking a gazelle

1:10:38.740 --> 1:10:40.980
 in the middle of the Serengeti,

1:10:40.980 --> 1:10:45.660
 the lion is smelling the molecules in the environment.

1:10:45.660 --> 1:10:50.660
 Its hormones and neuro receptors

1:10:51.500 --> 1:10:53.500
 are sort of getting it ready for impulse.

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:58.420
 The target is constantly looking around and sensing.

1:10:58.420 --> 1:11:02.980
 I've actually been in Kenya and I've kind of seen the hunt.

1:11:02.980 --> 1:11:07.220
 So I've kind of seen the sort of game of waiting

1:11:07.220 --> 1:11:12.220
 and the mitochondria in the muscles of the lion

1:11:13.340 --> 1:11:18.340
 are basically ready for, you know, jumping.

1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:21.500
 They're expensing an enormous amount of energy.

1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:23.500
 The grass as it's flowing

1:11:23.500 --> 1:11:28.500
 is constantly transforming solar energy into chloroplasts,

1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:32.160
 you know, through the chloroplast into energy,

1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:34.620
 which eventually feeds the gazelle

1:11:34.620 --> 1:11:36.940
 and eventually feeds the lions.

1:11:36.940 --> 1:11:37.860
 And so on and so forth.

1:11:37.860 --> 1:11:42.860
 So as humans, we experience all of that,

1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:48.340
 but the lion only experiences one layer.

1:11:49.580 --> 1:11:51.100
 The mitochondria in its body

1:11:51.100 --> 1:11:52.500
 are only experiencing one layer.

1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:55.540
 The chloroplasts are only experiencing one layer.

1:11:55.540 --> 1:11:59.780
 The, you know, photoreceptors and the smell receptors

1:11:59.780 --> 1:12:00.620
 and the chemical receptors,

1:12:00.620 --> 1:12:02.820
 like the lion always attacks against the wind

1:12:02.820 --> 1:12:04.060
 so that it's not smelled.

1:12:04.060 --> 1:12:09.060
 Like all of these things are one layer at a time.

1:12:11.140 --> 1:12:14.740
 And we humans somehow perceive the whole stack.

1:12:14.740 --> 1:12:17.060
 So going back to software infrastructure

1:12:17.060 --> 1:12:18.660
 and hardware infrastructure,

1:12:18.660 --> 1:12:20.620
 if you design a computer,

1:12:20.620 --> 1:12:23.260
 you basically have a physical layer that you start with.

1:12:23.260 --> 1:12:24.820
 And then on top of that physical layer,

1:12:24.820 --> 1:12:27.300
 you have, you know, the electrical layer.

1:12:27.300 --> 1:12:28.660
 And on top of the electrical layer,

1:12:28.660 --> 1:12:32.660
 you have basically gates and logic and an assembly layer.

1:12:32.660 --> 1:12:33.700
 And on top of the assembly layer,

1:12:33.700 --> 1:12:36.500
 you have your, you know, higher order,

1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:37.660
 higher level programming.

1:12:37.660 --> 1:12:38.500
 And on top of that,

1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:40.180
 you have your deep learning routine, et cetera.

1:12:40.180 --> 1:12:41.020
 And on top of that,

1:12:41.020 --> 1:12:44.780
 you eventually build a cognitive system that's smart.

1:12:46.060 --> 1:12:49.540
 I want you to now picture this cognitive system

1:12:49.540 --> 1:12:51.900
 becoming not just self aware,

1:12:53.380 --> 1:12:56.860
 but also becoming aware of the hardware that it's made of

1:12:57.820 --> 1:13:01.180
 and the atoms that it's made of and so on and so forth.

1:13:01.180 --> 1:13:03.700
 So it's as if your AI system,

1:13:03.700 --> 1:13:08.580
 and there's this beautiful scene in 2001 Odyssey of Space,

1:13:08.580 --> 1:13:13.060
 where Hull, after Dave starts disconnecting him,

1:13:13.060 --> 1:13:17.700
 is starting to sing a song about daisies, et cetera.

1:13:17.700 --> 1:13:22.700
 And Hull is basically saying, Dave, I'm losing my mind.

1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:26.500
 I can feel I'm losing my mind.

1:13:26.500 --> 1:13:28.140
 It's just so beautiful.

1:13:28.140 --> 1:13:31.620
 This concept of self awareness of knowing

1:13:31.620 --> 1:13:35.300
 that the hardware is no longer there is amazing.

1:13:35.300 --> 1:13:39.100
 And in the same way humans who have had accidents

1:13:39.100 --> 1:13:42.100
 are aware that they've had accidents.

1:13:42.100 --> 1:13:44.260
 So there's this self awareness of AI

1:13:45.300 --> 1:13:49.300
 that is, you know, this beautiful concept about,

1:13:49.300 --> 1:13:52.780
 you know, sort of the eventual cognitive leap

1:13:52.780 --> 1:13:54.620
 to self awareness.

1:13:54.620 --> 1:13:57.260
 But imagine now the AI system

1:13:57.260 --> 1:13:58.540
 actually breaking through these layers

1:13:58.540 --> 1:13:59.380
 and saying, wait a minute,

1:13:59.380 --> 1:14:01.860
 I think I can design a slightly better hardware

1:14:01.860 --> 1:14:03.460
 to get me functioning better.

1:14:03.460 --> 1:14:05.740
 And that's what basically humans are doing.

1:14:05.740 --> 1:14:08.460
 So if you look at our reasoning layer,

1:14:08.460 --> 1:14:11.220
 it's built on top of a cognitive layer.

1:14:11.220 --> 1:14:13.420
 And the reasoning layer we share with AI,

1:14:13.420 --> 1:14:14.500
 it's kind of cool.

1:14:14.500 --> 1:14:16.540
 Like there is another thing on the planet

1:14:16.540 --> 1:14:19.420
 that can integrate equations and it's manmade,

1:14:19.420 --> 1:14:22.140
 but we share computation with them.

1:14:22.140 --> 1:14:24.860
 We share this cognitive layer of playing chess.

1:14:24.860 --> 1:14:26.580
 We're not alone anymore.

1:14:26.580 --> 1:14:28.460
 We're not the only thing on the planet that plays chess.

1:14:28.460 --> 1:14:31.300
 Now we have AI that also plays chess.

1:14:31.300 --> 1:14:33.780
 But in some sense that that particular organism,

1:14:33.780 --> 1:14:36.300
 AI as it is now only operates in that layer.

1:14:36.300 --> 1:14:37.340
 Exactly.

1:14:37.340 --> 1:14:38.180
 Exactly.

1:14:38.180 --> 1:14:40.180
 And then most animals operate

1:14:40.180 --> 1:14:43.820
 in the sort of cognitive layer that we're all experiencing.

1:14:43.820 --> 1:14:48.060
 A bat is doing this incredible integration of signals,

1:14:48.060 --> 1:14:50.020
 but it's not aware of it.

1:14:50.020 --> 1:14:55.020
 It's basically constantly sending echo location waves

1:14:55.020 --> 1:14:56.580
 and it's receiving them back.

1:14:56.580 --> 1:14:58.780
 And multiple bats in the same cave

1:14:58.780 --> 1:15:01.340
 are operating at slightly different frequencies

1:15:01.340 --> 1:15:03.380
 and with slightly different pulses.

1:15:03.380 --> 1:15:04.860
 And they're all sensing objects

1:15:04.860 --> 1:15:07.020
 and they're doing motion planning

1:15:07.020 --> 1:15:08.460
 in their cognitive hardware,

1:15:08.460 --> 1:15:10.380
 but they're not even aware of all of that.

1:15:10.380 --> 1:15:13.500
 All they know is that they have a 3D view of space

1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:17.020
 around them, just like any gazelle walking through,

1:15:17.020 --> 1:15:18.620
 you know, the desert.

1:15:18.620 --> 1:15:23.220
 And any baby looking around is aware of things

1:15:23.220 --> 1:15:26.540
 without doing the math of how am I processing

1:15:26.540 --> 1:15:28.580
 all of these visual information, et cetera.

1:15:28.580 --> 1:15:31.500
 You're just aware of the layer that you live in.

1:15:31.500 --> 1:15:35.740
 I think if you look at this, at humanity,

1:15:35.740 --> 1:15:38.740
 we've basically managed through our cognitive layer,

1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:41.660
 through our perception layer, through our senses layer,

1:15:41.660 --> 1:15:46.660
 through our multi organ layer, through our genetic layer,

1:15:46.900 --> 1:15:51.820
 through our molecular layer, through our atomic layer,

1:15:51.820 --> 1:15:54.340
 through our quantum layer,

1:15:54.340 --> 1:15:58.140
 through even the very fabric of the space time continuum

1:15:58.140 --> 1:16:00.620
 unite all of that cognitively.

1:16:00.620 --> 1:16:03.620
 So as we're watching that scene in the Serengeti,

1:16:04.460 --> 1:16:07.300
 we as scientists, we as educated humans,

1:16:07.300 --> 1:16:09.980
 we as, you know, anyone who's finished high school

1:16:09.980 --> 1:16:12.060
 are aware of all of this beauty

1:16:12.060 --> 1:16:14.700
 of all of these different layers interplaying together.

1:16:14.700 --> 1:16:16.660
 And I think that's something very unique

1:16:16.660 --> 1:16:20.100
 in perhaps not just the galaxy, but maybe even the cosmos.

1:16:20.100 --> 1:16:25.100
 This species that has managed to in space

1:16:25.980 --> 1:16:29.420
 cross through these layers from the enormous

1:16:29.420 --> 1:16:30.780
 to the infinitely small.

1:16:30.780 --> 1:16:33.140
 And that's what I love about particle physics.

1:16:33.140 --> 1:16:35.780
 The fact that it actually unites everything.

1:16:35.780 --> 1:16:36.620
 The very small and the very big.

1:16:36.620 --> 1:16:38.020
 The very small and the very big.

1:16:38.020 --> 1:16:39.300
 It's only through the very big

1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:41.340
 that the very small gets formed.

1:16:41.340 --> 1:16:43.100
 Like basically every atom of gold

1:16:44.260 --> 1:16:47.860
 results from the fusion that happened

1:16:47.860 --> 1:16:51.420
 of increasingly large particles before that explosion

1:16:51.420 --> 1:16:53.620
 that then disperses it through the cosmos.

1:16:53.620 --> 1:16:57.220
 And it's only through understanding the very large

1:16:57.220 --> 1:16:59.540
 that we understand the very small and vice versa.

1:16:59.540 --> 1:17:01.980
 And that's in space.

1:17:01.980 --> 1:17:04.820
 Then there's the time direction.

1:17:04.820 --> 1:17:08.660
 As you are watching the Kilimanjaro mountain,

1:17:08.660 --> 1:17:11.660
 you can kind of look back through time

1:17:11.660 --> 1:17:14.300
 to when that volcano was exploding

1:17:14.300 --> 1:17:17.740
 and growing out of the tectonic forces.

1:17:17.740 --> 1:17:20.420
 As you drive through Death Valley,

1:17:20.420 --> 1:17:23.380
 you see these mountains on their side

1:17:23.380 --> 1:17:27.020
 and these layers of history exposed.

1:17:28.260 --> 1:17:33.260
 We are aware of the eons that have happened on earth

1:17:34.380 --> 1:17:36.180
 and the tectonic movements on earth.

1:17:37.220 --> 1:17:41.220
 The same way that we're aware of the Big Bang

1:17:41.220 --> 1:17:44.620
 and the early evolution of the cosmos.

1:17:44.620 --> 1:17:46.620
 And we can also see forward in time

1:17:46.620 --> 1:17:48.380
 as to where the universe is heading.

1:17:48.380 --> 1:17:53.340
 We can see Apophis in 2068 coming over,

1:17:53.340 --> 1:17:54.340
 looking ahead in time.

1:17:54.340 --> 1:17:58.780
 I mean, that would be magician stuff in ancient times.

1:17:58.780 --> 1:18:02.420
 So what I love about humanity and its role in the universe

1:18:02.420 --> 1:18:05.820
 is that if there's a God watching,

1:18:05.820 --> 1:18:08.300
 he's like, finally, somebody figured it out.

1:18:08.300 --> 1:18:10.460
 I've been building all these beautiful things

1:18:10.460 --> 1:18:11.620
 and somebody can appreciate it.

1:18:11.620 --> 1:18:13.780
 And figured me out from God's perspective,

1:18:13.780 --> 1:18:16.980
 meaning become aware of, you know.

1:18:16.980 --> 1:18:18.900
 Yeah, so it's kind of interesting

1:18:18.900 --> 1:18:21.980
 to think of the world in this way as layers

1:18:21.980 --> 1:18:25.380
 and us humans are able to convert those layers

1:18:25.380 --> 1:18:29.940
 into ideas that you can then combine, right?

1:18:29.940 --> 1:18:32.060
 So we're doing some kind of conversion.

1:18:32.060 --> 1:18:33.500
 Exactly, exactly.

1:18:33.500 --> 1:18:35.220
 And last time you asked me about

1:18:35.220 --> 1:18:37.660
 whether we live in a simulation, for example.

1:18:37.660 --> 1:18:42.660
 I mean, realize that we are living in a simulation.

1:18:42.660 --> 1:18:45.020
 We are, the reality that we're in

1:18:45.020 --> 1:18:48.820
 without any sort of person programming this is a simulation.

1:18:48.820 --> 1:18:51.660
 Like basically what happens inside your skull?

1:18:51.660 --> 1:18:55.060
 There's this integration of sensory inputs

1:18:55.060 --> 1:18:57.820
 which are translated into perceptory signals,

1:18:57.820 --> 1:19:00.500
 which are then translated into a conceptual model

1:19:00.500 --> 1:19:02.540
 of the world around you.

1:19:02.540 --> 1:19:06.820
 And that exercise is happening seamlessly.

1:19:06.820 --> 1:19:11.020
 And yet, you know, if you think about sort of, again,

1:19:11.020 --> 1:19:15.180
 this whole simulation and Neo analogy,

1:19:15.180 --> 1:19:18.380
 you can think of the reality that we live in as a matrix,

1:19:18.380 --> 1:19:22.300
 as the matrix, but we've actually broken through the matrix.

1:19:22.300 --> 1:19:23.940
 We've actually traversed the layers.

1:19:23.940 --> 1:19:27.620
 We didn't have to take a pill, like we didn't, you know,

1:19:27.620 --> 1:19:29.420
 Morpheus didn't have to show up

1:19:29.420 --> 1:19:31.820
 to basically give us the blue pill or the red pill.

1:19:31.820 --> 1:19:35.900
 We were able to sufficiently evolve cognitively

1:19:35.900 --> 1:19:37.780
 through the hardware explosion

1:19:37.780 --> 1:19:41.180
 and sufficiently evolve scientifically

1:19:41.180 --> 1:19:43.020
 through the software explosion

1:19:43.020 --> 1:19:45.780
 to basically get at breaking through the matrix,

1:19:45.780 --> 1:19:47.820
 realizing that we live in a matrix

1:19:47.820 --> 1:19:51.220
 and realizing that we are this thing in there.

1:19:51.220 --> 1:19:53.780
 And yet that thing in there has a consciousness

1:19:53.780 --> 1:19:56.020
 that lives through all these layers.

1:19:57.140 --> 1:19:58.500
 And I think we're the only species.

1:19:58.500 --> 1:20:00.460
 We're the only thing that we even can think of

1:20:00.460 --> 1:20:01.620
 that has actually done that,

1:20:01.620 --> 1:20:09.780
 that has sort of permeated space and time scales

1:20:09.780 --> 1:20:13.820
 and layers of abstraction plowing through them

1:20:13.820 --> 1:20:16.940
 and realizing what we're really, really made of.

1:20:16.940 --> 1:20:20.020
 And the next frontier is of course, cognition.

1:20:20.020 --> 1:20:22.540
 So we understand so much of the cosmos,

1:20:22.540 --> 1:20:24.340
 so much of the stuff around us,

1:20:24.340 --> 1:20:28.060
 but the stuff inside here, finding the basis for the soul,

1:20:28.060 --> 1:20:31.300
 finding the basis for the ego, for the self,

1:20:31.300 --> 1:20:35.180
 the self awareness, when does the spark happen

1:20:35.180 --> 1:20:38.820
 that basically sort of makes you you?

1:20:38.820 --> 1:20:41.060
 I mean, that's really the next frontier.

1:20:41.060 --> 1:20:44.980
 So in terms of these peeling off layers of complexity,

1:20:44.980 --> 1:20:47.420
 somewhere between the cognitive layer

1:20:47.420 --> 1:20:52.460
 and the reasoning layer or the computational layer,

1:20:52.460 --> 1:20:54.460
 there's still some stuff to be figured out there.

1:20:54.460 --> 1:20:56.020
 And I think that's the final frontier

1:20:56.020 --> 1:20:59.020
 of sort of completing our journey through that matrix.

1:20:59.020 --> 1:21:03.980
 And maybe duplicating it in other versions of ourselves

1:21:03.980 --> 1:21:08.660
 through AI, which is another very exciting possibility.

1:21:08.660 --> 1:21:12.700
 What I love about AI and the way that it operates right now

1:21:12.700 --> 1:21:14.940
 is the fact that it is unpredictable.

1:21:16.020 --> 1:21:18.380
 There's emergent behavior

1:21:18.380 --> 1:21:22.260
 in our cognitively capable artificial systems

1:21:23.660 --> 1:21:26.580
 that we can certainly model,

1:21:26.580 --> 1:21:30.020
 but we don't encode directly.

1:21:30.020 --> 1:21:32.500
 And that's a key difference.

1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:35.460
 So we like to say, oh, of course,

1:21:35.460 --> 1:21:38.900
 this is not really intelligent because we coded it up.

1:21:38.900 --> 1:21:41.500
 And we've just put in these little parameters there

1:21:41.500 --> 1:21:43.700
 and there's like six billion parameters

1:21:43.700 --> 1:21:45.660
 and once you've learned them,

1:21:45.660 --> 1:21:48.140
 we kind of understand the layers.

1:21:48.140 --> 1:21:50.380
 But that's an oversimplification.

1:21:50.380 --> 1:21:53.260
 It's like saying, oh, of course, humans,

1:21:53.260 --> 1:21:55.580
 we understand humans, they're just made out of neurons

1:21:55.580 --> 1:22:00.580
 and layers of cortex and there's a visual area.

1:22:01.220 --> 1:22:04.140
 But every human is encoded

1:22:04.140 --> 1:22:06.380
 by a ridiculously small number of genes

1:22:06.380 --> 1:22:09.500
 compared to the complexity of our cognitive apparatus.

1:22:09.500 --> 1:22:11.540
 20,000 genes is really not that much

1:22:11.540 --> 1:22:13.420
 out of which a tiny little fraction

1:22:13.420 --> 1:22:16.340
 are in fact encoding all of our cognitive functions.

1:22:16.340 --> 1:22:19.740
 The rest is emergent behavior.

1:22:19.740 --> 1:22:24.740
 The rest is the cortical layers

1:22:24.740 --> 1:22:27.460
 doing their thing in the same way

1:22:27.460 --> 1:22:30.980
 that when we build these conversational systems

1:22:30.980 --> 1:22:34.540
 or these cognitive systems or these deep learning systems,

1:22:34.540 --> 1:22:36.100
 we put the architecture in place,

1:22:36.100 --> 1:22:37.620
 but then they do their thing.

1:22:37.620 --> 1:22:38.740
 And in some ways,

1:22:38.740 --> 1:22:41.620
 that's creating something that has its own identity.

1:22:41.620 --> 1:22:43.620
 That's creating something that's not just,

1:22:43.620 --> 1:22:45.820
 oh yeah, it's not the early AI

1:22:45.820 --> 1:22:47.100
 where if you hadn't programmed

1:22:47.100 --> 1:22:49.140
 what happens in the grocery bags

1:22:49.140 --> 1:22:52.980
 when you have both cold and hot and hard and soft,

1:22:52.980 --> 1:22:54.540
 the system wouldn't know what to do.

1:22:54.540 --> 1:22:57.660
 No, no, you basically now just program the primitives

1:22:57.660 --> 1:22:59.460
 and then it learns from that.

1:22:59.460 --> 1:23:01.220
 So even though the origins are humble,

1:23:01.220 --> 1:23:03.340
 just like it is for our genetic code,

1:23:03.340 --> 1:23:05.500
 for AI, even though the origins are humble,

1:23:05.500 --> 1:23:10.500
 the result of it being deployed into the world

1:23:11.420 --> 1:23:13.660
 is infinitely complex.

1:23:16.860 --> 1:23:21.620
 And yet, it's not yet able to be cognizant

1:23:21.620 --> 1:23:25.540
 of all the other layers of its,

1:23:25.540 --> 1:23:30.540
 you know, it's not able to think about space and time.

1:23:33.020 --> 1:23:35.780
 It's not able to think about the hardware in which it runs,

1:23:35.780 --> 1:23:38.420
 the electricity in which it runs yet.

1:23:38.420 --> 1:23:41.060
 So if you look at humans,

1:23:41.060 --> 1:23:43.300
 we basically have the same cognitive architecture

1:23:43.300 --> 1:23:45.660
 as monkeys, as the great apes.

1:23:45.660 --> 1:23:48.220
 It's just a ton more of it.

1:23:48.220 --> 1:23:52.180
 If you look at GPT3 versus GPT2,

1:23:52.180 --> 1:23:55.460
 again, it's the same architecture, just more of it.

1:23:55.460 --> 1:23:58.460
 And yet it's able to do so much more.

1:23:58.460 --> 1:23:59.940
 So if you start thinking about sort of

1:23:59.940 --> 1:24:03.100
 what's the future of that, GPT4 and GPT5,

1:24:03.100 --> 1:24:05.340
 do you really need fundamentally different architectures

1:24:05.340 --> 1:24:07.820
 or do you just need a ton more hardware?

1:24:07.820 --> 1:24:10.340
 And we do have a ton more hardware.

1:24:10.340 --> 1:24:12.580
 Like these systems are nowhere near

1:24:12.580 --> 1:24:15.540
 what humans have between our ears.

1:24:15.540 --> 1:24:19.300
 So, you know, there's something to be said

1:24:19.300 --> 1:24:22.900
 about stay tuned for emergent behavior.

1:24:22.900 --> 1:24:24.740
 We keep thinking that general intelligence

1:24:24.740 --> 1:24:27.700
 might just be forever away,

1:24:27.700 --> 1:24:29.820
 but it could just simply be that

1:24:29.820 --> 1:24:31.860
 we just need a ton more hardware

1:24:31.860 --> 1:24:33.620
 and that humans are just not that different

1:24:33.620 --> 1:24:37.260
 from the great apes, except for just a ton more of it.

1:24:37.260 --> 1:24:41.060
 Yeah, it's interesting that in the AI community,

1:24:41.060 --> 1:24:43.540
 maybe there's a human centric fear,

1:24:43.540 --> 1:24:48.540
 but the notion that GPT10 will achieve general intelligence

1:24:49.980 --> 1:24:51.940
 is something that people shy away from,

1:24:51.940 --> 1:24:54.300
 that there has to be something totally different

1:24:54.300 --> 1:24:56.220
 and new added to this.

1:24:56.220 --> 1:24:59.260
 And yet it's not seriously considered that

1:25:01.100 --> 1:25:05.140
 this very simple thing, this very simple architecture,

1:25:05.140 --> 1:25:07.460
 when scaled, might be the thing

1:25:07.460 --> 1:25:09.100
 that achieves super intelligence.

1:25:09.100 --> 1:25:11.580
 And people think the same way about humanity

1:25:11.580 --> 1:25:13.180
 and human consciousness.

1:25:13.180 --> 1:25:15.220
 They're like, oh, consciousness might be quantum,

1:25:15.220 --> 1:25:18.220
 or it might be, you know, some nonphysical thing.

1:25:18.220 --> 1:25:21.620
 And it's like, or it could just be a lot more

1:25:21.620 --> 1:25:25.820
 of the same hardware that now is sufficiently capable

1:25:25.820 --> 1:25:29.380
 of self awareness just because it has the neurons to do it.

1:25:29.380 --> 1:25:32.780
 So maybe the consciousness that is so elusive

1:25:33.660 --> 1:25:38.260
 is an emergent behavior of you basically string together

1:25:38.260 --> 1:25:41.340
 all these cognitive capabilities that come from running,

1:25:41.340 --> 1:25:43.260
 from seeing, for reacting,

1:25:43.260 --> 1:25:45.620
 from predicting the movement of a fly

1:25:45.620 --> 1:25:47.300
 as you're catching it through the air.

1:25:47.300 --> 1:25:49.540
 All of these things are just like great lookup tables

1:25:49.540 --> 1:25:51.420
 encoded in a giant neural network.

1:25:51.420 --> 1:25:53.060
 I mean, I'm oversimplifying, of course,

1:25:53.060 --> 1:25:55.540
 the complexity and the diversity of the different types

1:25:55.540 --> 1:25:57.260
 of excitatory and inhibitory neurons,

1:25:57.260 --> 1:25:59.860
 the wave forms that sort of shine through

1:26:01.860 --> 1:26:04.740
 the connections across all these different layers,

1:26:04.740 --> 1:26:06.900
 the amalgamation of signals, et cetera.

1:26:06.900 --> 1:26:08.500
 The brain is enormously complex.

1:26:08.500 --> 1:26:09.580
 I mean, of course.

1:26:09.580 --> 1:26:11.580
 But again, it's a small number of primitives

1:26:11.580 --> 1:26:14.260
 encoded by a tiny number of genes,

1:26:14.260 --> 1:26:19.260
 which are self organized and shaped by their environment.

1:26:21.140 --> 1:26:23.420
 Babies that are growing up today

1:26:23.420 --> 1:26:28.420
 are listening to language from conception.

1:26:28.460 --> 1:26:32.300
 Basically, as soon as the auditory apparatus forms,

1:26:32.300 --> 1:26:35.100
 it's already getting shaped to the types of signals

1:26:35.100 --> 1:26:37.180
 that are out in the real world today.

1:26:37.180 --> 1:26:39.300
 So it's not just like, oh, have an Egyptian be born

1:26:39.300 --> 1:26:40.540
 and then ship them over.

1:26:40.540 --> 1:26:44.300
 It's like, no, that Egyptian would be listening in

1:26:44.300 --> 1:26:46.420
 to the complexity of the world and then getting born

1:26:46.420 --> 1:26:49.620
 and sort of seeing just how much more complex the world is.

1:26:49.620 --> 1:26:53.940
 So it's a combination of the underlying hardware,

1:26:53.940 --> 1:26:57.540
 which if you think about as a geneticist,

1:26:57.540 --> 1:27:00.100
 in my view, the hardware gives you an upper bound

1:27:00.100 --> 1:27:02.260
 of cognitive capabilities,

1:27:02.260 --> 1:27:05.260
 but it's the environment that makes those capabilities shine

1:27:05.260 --> 1:27:06.980
 and reach their maximum.

1:27:06.980 --> 1:27:11.060
 So we're a combination of nature and nurture.

1:27:11.060 --> 1:27:15.300
 The nature is our genes and our cognitive apparatus.

1:27:15.300 --> 1:27:18.620
 And the nurture is the richness of the environment

1:27:18.620 --> 1:27:22.140
 that makes that cognitive apparatus reach its potential.

1:27:22.140 --> 1:27:27.140
 And we are so far from reaching our full potential, so far.

1:27:27.380 --> 1:27:31.060
 I think that kids being born a hundred years from now,

1:27:31.060 --> 1:27:33.500
 they'll be looking at us now and saying

1:27:33.500 --> 1:27:36.500
 what primitive educational systems they had.

1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:38.180
 I can't believe people were not wired

1:27:38.180 --> 1:27:42.740
 into this virtual reality from birth as we are now,

1:27:42.740 --> 1:27:46.180
 cause like they're clearly inferior and so on and so forth.

1:27:46.180 --> 1:27:48.100
 I basically think that our environment

1:27:48.100 --> 1:27:53.100
 will continue exploding and our cognitive capabilities,

1:27:53.220 --> 1:27:55.220
 it's not like, oh, we're only using 10% of our brain.

1:27:55.220 --> 1:27:56.060
 That's ridiculous.

1:27:56.060 --> 1:27:57.660
 Of course, we're using 100% of our brain,

1:27:57.660 --> 1:28:00.740
 but it's still constrained by how complex

1:28:00.740 --> 1:28:02.140
 our environment is.

1:28:02.140 --> 1:28:06.500
 So the hardware will remain the same, but the software,

1:28:06.500 --> 1:28:08.740
 in a quickly advancing environment,

1:28:08.740 --> 1:28:10.820
 the software will make a huge difference

1:28:10.820 --> 1:28:14.340
 in the nature of like the human experience,

1:28:14.340 --> 1:28:15.500
 the human condition.

1:28:15.500 --> 1:28:17.500
 It's fascinating to think that humans will look

1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:19.460
 very different a hundred years from now,

1:28:19.460 --> 1:28:20.740
 just because the environment changed,

1:28:20.740 --> 1:28:22.980
 even though we're still the same great apes,

1:28:22.980 --> 1:28:25.420
 the descendant of apes.

1:28:25.420 --> 1:28:28.660
 At the core of this is kind of a notion of ideas

1:28:28.660 --> 1:28:31.020
 that I don't know if you're,

1:28:31.020 --> 1:28:33.140
 there's a lot of people, including you,

1:28:33.140 --> 1:28:34.940
 eloquently about this topic,

1:28:34.940 --> 1:28:39.460
 but Richard Dawkins talks about the notion of memes

1:28:39.460 --> 1:28:43.700
 and let's say this notion of ideas,

1:28:45.500 --> 1:28:49.140
 multiplying, selecting in the minds of humans.

1:28:49.140 --> 1:28:52.460
 Do you ever think about ideas from that perspective,

1:28:52.460 --> 1:28:54.740
 ideas as organisms themselves

1:28:54.740 --> 1:28:57.580
 that are breeding in the minds of humans?

1:28:57.580 --> 1:28:59.540
 I love the concept of memes.

1:28:59.540 --> 1:29:03.660
 I love the concept of these horizontal transfer of ideas

1:29:03.660 --> 1:29:08.340
 and sort of permeating through our layer

1:29:08.340 --> 1:29:11.140
 of interconnected neural networks.

1:29:11.140 --> 1:29:15.140
 So you can think of sort of the cognitive space

1:29:15.140 --> 1:29:17.100
 that has now connected all of humanity,

1:29:18.020 --> 1:29:22.460
 where we are now one giant information

1:29:22.460 --> 1:29:24.820
 and idea sharing network,

1:29:24.820 --> 1:29:28.900
 well beyond what was thought to be ever capable

1:29:28.900 --> 1:29:32.620
 when the concept of a meme was created by Richard Dawkins.

1:29:32.620 --> 1:29:35.260
 So, but I wanna take that concept

1:29:35.260 --> 1:29:39.260
 just into another twist,

1:29:39.260 --> 1:29:44.260
 which is the horizontal transfer of humans with fellowships.

1:29:47.140 --> 1:29:51.140
 And the fact that as people apply to MIT

1:29:51.140 --> 1:29:53.100
 from around the world,

1:29:53.100 --> 1:29:55.660
 there's a selection that happens,

1:29:55.660 --> 1:29:58.220
 not just for their ideas,

1:29:58.220 --> 1:30:00.620
 but also for the cognitive hardware

1:30:00.620 --> 1:30:02.940
 that came up with those ideas.

1:30:02.940 --> 1:30:05.260
 So we don't just ship ideas around anymore.

1:30:05.260 --> 1:30:07.220
 They don't evolve in a vacuum.

1:30:07.220 --> 1:30:11.020
 The ideas themselves influence the distribution

1:30:11.020 --> 1:30:14.460
 of cognitive systems, i.e. humans and brains

1:30:14.460 --> 1:30:15.500
 around the planet.

1:30:15.500 --> 1:30:17.140
 Yeah, we ship them to different locations

1:30:17.140 --> 1:30:18.340
 based on their properties.

1:30:18.340 --> 1:30:19.620
 That's exactly right.

1:30:19.620 --> 1:30:24.100
 So those cognitive systems that think of physics,

1:30:24.100 --> 1:30:25.940
 for example, might go to CERN

1:30:25.940 --> 1:30:28.300
 and those that think of genomics

1:30:28.300 --> 1:30:30.460
 might go to the Broad Institute.

1:30:30.460 --> 1:30:32.100
 And those that think of computer science

1:30:32.100 --> 1:30:35.820
 might go to, I don't know, Stanford or CMU or MIT.

1:30:35.820 --> 1:30:38.700
 And you basically have this co evolution now

1:30:38.700 --> 1:30:40.980
 of memes and ideas

1:30:40.980 --> 1:30:44.700
 and the cognitive conversational systems

1:30:44.700 --> 1:30:47.220
 that love these ideas and feed on these ideas

1:30:47.220 --> 1:30:50.140
 and understand these ideas and appreciate these ideas

1:30:50.140 --> 1:30:52.060
 now coming together.

1:30:52.060 --> 1:30:56.020
 So you basically have students coming to Boston to study

1:30:56.020 --> 1:30:56.940
 because that's the place

1:30:56.940 --> 1:30:59.300
 where these types of cognitive systems thrive.

1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:05.620
 And they're selected based on their cognitive output

1:31:05.620 --> 1:31:08.020
 and their idea output.

1:31:08.020 --> 1:31:10.620
 But once they get into that place,

1:31:10.620 --> 1:31:15.020
 the boiling and interbreeding of these memes

1:31:15.020 --> 1:31:17.660
 becomes so much more frequent.

1:31:17.660 --> 1:31:21.580
 That what comes out of it is so far beyond

1:31:21.580 --> 1:31:23.980
 if ideas were evolving in a vacuum

1:31:23.980 --> 1:31:25.860
 of an already established hardware,

1:31:25.860 --> 1:31:28.540
 cognitive interconnection system of the planet,

1:31:28.540 --> 1:31:32.820
 where now you basically have the ideas

1:31:32.820 --> 1:31:35.100
 shaping the distribution of these systems.

1:31:35.100 --> 1:31:37.700
 And then the genetics kick in as well.

1:31:37.700 --> 1:31:40.060
 You basically have now these people

1:31:40.060 --> 1:31:42.020
 who came to be a student kind of like myself

1:31:42.020 --> 1:31:45.260
 who now stuck around and are now professors

1:31:45.260 --> 1:31:49.900
 bringing up our own genetically encoded

1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:53.300
 and genetically related cognitive systems,

1:31:53.300 --> 1:31:56.100
 mine are eight, six and three years old,

1:31:56.100 --> 1:31:58.020
 who are now growing up in an environment

1:31:58.020 --> 1:32:02.460
 surrounded by other cognitive systems of a similar age

1:32:02.460 --> 1:32:06.180
 with parents who love these types of thinking and ideas.

1:32:06.180 --> 1:32:09.260
 And you basically have a whole interbreeding now

1:32:09.260 --> 1:32:14.260
 of genetically selected transfer of cognitive systems

1:32:14.260 --> 1:32:19.260
 where the genes and the memes are co evolving

1:32:19.380 --> 1:32:23.300
 the same soup of ever improving knowledge

1:32:23.300 --> 1:32:28.300
 and societal inter fertilization,

1:32:28.300 --> 1:32:29.940
 cross fertilization of these ideas.

1:32:29.940 --> 1:32:32.780
 So this beautiful image.

1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:36.420
 So this is shipping these actual meat cognitive systems

1:32:36.420 --> 1:32:37.580
 to physical locations.

1:32:37.580 --> 1:32:41.660
 They tend to cluster in the biology ones,

1:32:41.660 --> 1:32:45.340
 and the biology ones cluster in a certain building too.

1:32:45.340 --> 1:32:49.540
 So like within that there's clusters on top of clusters,

1:32:49.540 --> 1:32:50.380
 top of clusters.

1:32:50.380 --> 1:32:52.740
 What about in the online world?

1:32:52.740 --> 1:32:55.340
 Is that, do you also see that kind of,

1:32:55.340 --> 1:32:58.940
 because people now form groups on the internet

1:32:58.940 --> 1:33:03.820
 that they stick together so they can sort of,

1:33:03.820 --> 1:33:08.660
 these cognitive systems can collect themselves

1:33:08.660 --> 1:33:13.660
 and breed together in different layers of spaces.

1:33:14.420 --> 1:33:15.940
 It doesn't just have to be physical space.

1:33:15.940 --> 1:33:17.180
 Absolutely, absolutely.

1:33:17.180 --> 1:33:19.740
 So basically there's the physical rearrangement,

1:33:19.740 --> 1:33:21.860
 but there's also the conglomeration

1:33:21.860 --> 1:33:24.340
 of the same cognitive system.

1:33:24.340 --> 1:33:25.860
 Doesn't need to be, i.e. human.

1:33:26.820 --> 1:33:29.140
 Doesn't need to belong to only one community.

1:33:29.140 --> 1:33:30.340
 So yes, you might be a member

1:33:30.340 --> 1:33:31.580
 of the computer science department,

1:33:31.580 --> 1:33:33.820
 but you can also hang out in the biology department.

1:33:33.820 --> 1:33:35.820
 But you might also go online into,

1:33:35.820 --> 1:33:37.940
 I don't know, poetry department readings

1:33:37.940 --> 1:33:38.780
 and so on and so forth.

1:33:38.780 --> 1:33:40.620
 Or you might be part of a group

1:33:40.620 --> 1:33:42.820
 that only has 12 people in the world,

1:33:42.820 --> 1:33:45.300
 but that are connected through their ideas

1:33:45.300 --> 1:33:49.340
 and are now interbreeding these ideas in a whole other way.

1:33:49.340 --> 1:33:53.140
 So this coevolution of genes and memes

1:33:53.140 --> 1:33:55.220
 is not just physically instantiated.

1:33:55.220 --> 1:34:00.220
 It's also sort of rearranged in this cognitive space as well.

1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:05.100
 And sometimes these cognitive systems hold conferences

1:34:05.100 --> 1:34:06.820
 and they all gather around

1:34:06.820 --> 1:34:09.060
 and there's like one of them is like talking

1:34:09.060 --> 1:34:10.100
 and they're all like listening

1:34:10.100 --> 1:34:12.540
 and then they discuss and then they have free lunch

1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:13.380
 and so on.

1:34:13.380 --> 1:34:15.980
 No, but then that's where you find students

1:34:15.980 --> 1:34:18.260
 where when I go to a conference,

1:34:18.260 --> 1:34:20.940
 I go through the posters where I'm on a mission.

1:34:20.940 --> 1:34:23.580
 Basically my mission is to read and understand

1:34:23.580 --> 1:34:25.060
 what every poster is about.

1:34:25.060 --> 1:34:25.900
 And for a few of them,

1:34:25.900 --> 1:34:27.660
 I'll dive deeply and understand everything,

1:34:27.660 --> 1:34:29.940
 but I make it a point to just go poster after poster

1:34:29.940 --> 1:34:31.820
 in order to read all of them.

1:34:31.820 --> 1:34:35.460
 And I find some gems and students that I speak to

1:34:35.460 --> 1:34:37.780
 that sometimes eventually join my lab.

1:34:37.780 --> 1:34:41.820
 And then sort of you're sort of creating this permeation

1:34:41.820 --> 1:34:46.820
 of the transfer of ideas, of ways of thinking

1:34:48.260 --> 1:34:52.940
 and very often of moral values, of social structures,

1:34:52.940 --> 1:34:57.940
 of just more imperceptible properties

1:34:59.820 --> 1:35:00.860
 of these cognitive systems

1:35:00.860 --> 1:35:02.660
 that simply just cling together.

1:35:02.660 --> 1:35:07.140
 Basically, I have the luxury at MIT

1:35:07.140 --> 1:35:09.140
 of not just choosing smart people,

1:35:09.140 --> 1:35:12.660
 but choosing smart people who I get along with,

1:35:12.660 --> 1:35:17.660
 who are generous and friendly and creative and smart

1:35:17.820 --> 1:35:22.820
 and excited and childish in their uninhibited behaviors

1:35:25.220 --> 1:35:26.060
 and so on and so forth.

1:35:26.060 --> 1:35:29.860
 So you basically can choose yourself to surround,

1:35:29.860 --> 1:35:31.260
 you can choose to surround yourself

1:35:31.260 --> 1:35:36.140
 with people who are not only cognitively compatible,

1:35:36.140 --> 1:35:39.780
 but also imperceptibly

1:35:39.780 --> 1:35:43.580
 through the meta cognitive systems compatible.

1:35:43.580 --> 1:35:46.740
 And again, when I say compatible, not all the same.

1:35:46.740 --> 1:35:50.580
 Sometimes, not sometimes, all the time.

1:35:50.580 --> 1:35:53.540
 The teams are made out of complimentary components,

1:35:53.540 --> 1:35:56.220
 not just compatible, but very often complimentary.

1:35:56.220 --> 1:35:59.580
 So in my own team, I have a diversity of students

1:35:59.580 --> 1:36:01.900
 who come from very different backgrounds.

1:36:01.900 --> 1:36:04.180
 There's a whole spectrum of biology to computation,

1:36:04.180 --> 1:36:06.660
 of course, but within biology, there's a lot of realms.

1:36:06.660 --> 1:36:08.820
 Within computation, there's a lot of realms.

1:36:08.820 --> 1:36:13.340
 And what makes us click so well together

1:36:13.340 --> 1:36:16.620
 is the fact that not only do we have a common mission,

1:36:16.620 --> 1:36:21.620
 a common passion and a common view of the world,

1:36:22.500 --> 1:36:25.540
 but that we're complimentary in our skills,

1:36:25.540 --> 1:36:28.060
 in our angles with which we come at it and so on and so forth.

1:36:28.060 --> 1:36:29.700
 And that's sort of what makes it click.

1:36:29.700 --> 1:36:32.860
 Yeah, it's fascinating that the stickiness

1:36:32.860 --> 1:36:35.980
 of multiple cognitive systems together

1:36:35.980 --> 1:36:37.980
 includes both the commonality,

1:36:37.980 --> 1:36:40.740
 so you meet because there's some common thing,

1:36:40.740 --> 1:36:45.180
 but you stick together because you're different

1:36:45.180 --> 1:36:46.740
 in all the useful ways.

1:36:46.740 --> 1:36:47.580
 Yeah, yeah.

1:36:47.580 --> 1:36:51.780
 And my wife and I, I mean, we adore each other to pieces,

1:36:51.780 --> 1:36:54.300
 but we're also extremely different in many ways.

1:36:54.300 --> 1:36:55.900
 And that's beautiful. Careful.

1:36:55.900 --> 1:36:57.100
 She's gonna be listening to this.

1:36:57.100 --> 1:36:59.020
 But I love that about us.

1:36:59.020 --> 1:37:01.900
 I love the fact that I'm living out there

1:37:01.900 --> 1:37:05.580
 in the world of ideas and I forget what day it is.

1:37:05.580 --> 1:37:07.060
 And she's like, well, at 8 a.m.,

1:37:07.060 --> 1:37:08.260
 the kids better be to school.

1:37:08.260 --> 1:37:09.260
 Right.

1:37:09.260 --> 1:37:14.260
 And I do get yelled at, but I need it.

1:37:15.460 --> 1:37:18.100
 Basically, I need her as much as she needs me.

1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:20.180
 And she loves interacting with me and talking.

1:37:20.180 --> 1:37:23.540
 I mean, last night, we were talking about this

1:37:23.540 --> 1:37:24.580
 and I showed her the questions

1:37:24.580 --> 1:37:26.540
 and we were bouncing ideas off each other.

1:37:26.540 --> 1:37:28.140
 And it was just beautiful.

1:37:28.140 --> 1:37:32.180
 We basically have these, basically,

1:37:32.180 --> 1:37:36.060
 cognitive, let it all loose kind of dates

1:37:36.060 --> 1:37:38.260
 where we just bring papers

1:37:38.260 --> 1:37:41.020
 and we're bouncing ideas, et cetera.

1:37:41.020 --> 1:37:44.540
 So we have extremely different perspectives,

1:37:44.540 --> 1:37:49.540
 but very common goals and interests and anyway.

1:37:49.900 --> 1:37:52.260
 What do you make of the communication mechanism

1:37:52.260 --> 1:37:54.180
 that we humans use to share those ideas?

1:37:54.180 --> 1:37:57.300
 Because one essential element of all of this

1:37:57.300 --> 1:38:01.500
 is not just that we're able to have these ideas,

1:38:01.500 --> 1:38:03.740
 but we're also able to share them.

1:38:03.740 --> 1:38:06.060
 We tend to, maybe you can correct me,

1:38:06.060 --> 1:38:10.060
 but we seem to use language to share the ideas.

1:38:10.060 --> 1:38:12.100
 Maybe we share them in some much deeper way

1:38:12.100 --> 1:38:13.220
 than language, I don't know.

1:38:13.220 --> 1:38:15.780
 But what do you make of this whole mechanism

1:38:15.780 --> 1:38:18.740
 that ghaf on the matlid is to the human condition?

1:38:18.740 --> 1:38:20.100
 So some people will tell you

1:38:20.100 --> 1:38:23.140
 that your language dictates your thoughts

1:38:23.140 --> 1:38:26.260
 and your thoughts cannot form outside language.

1:38:26.260 --> 1:38:27.860
 I tend to disagree.

1:38:27.860 --> 1:38:32.860
 I see thoughts as much more abstract

1:38:33.180 --> 1:38:36.460
 as basically when I dream, I don't dream in words.

1:38:36.460 --> 1:38:40.500
 I dream in shapes and forms and three dimensional space

1:38:40.500 --> 1:38:42.380
 with extreme detail.

1:38:42.380 --> 1:38:44.300
 I was describing, so when I wake up

1:38:44.300 --> 1:38:47.140
 in the middle of the night, I actually record my dreams.

1:38:47.140 --> 1:38:50.380
 Sometimes I write them down in a Dropbox file.

1:38:50.380 --> 1:38:53.940
 Other times I'll just dictate them in audio.

1:38:53.940 --> 1:38:57.420
 And my wife was giving me a massage the other day

1:38:57.420 --> 1:39:00.020
 cause like my left side was frozen

1:39:00.020 --> 1:39:02.780
 and I started playing the recording.

1:39:02.780 --> 1:39:05.460
 And as I was listening to it, I was like,

1:39:05.460 --> 1:39:06.300
 I don't remember any of that.

1:39:06.300 --> 1:39:08.020
 And it was like, of course.

1:39:08.020 --> 1:39:10.220
 And then the entire thing came back.

1:39:10.220 --> 1:39:12.420
 But then there's no way any other person

1:39:12.420 --> 1:39:15.780
 could have recreated that entire sort of

1:39:15.780 --> 1:39:20.180
 three dimensional shape and dream and concept.

1:39:20.180 --> 1:39:22.500
 And in the same way, when I'm thinking of ideas,

1:39:22.500 --> 1:39:25.300
 there's so many ideas I can't put to words.

1:39:25.300 --> 1:39:27.060
 I mean, I will describe them with a thousand words,

1:39:27.060 --> 1:39:29.860
 but the idea itself is much more precise

1:39:29.860 --> 1:39:31.500
 or much more sort of abstract

1:39:31.500 --> 1:39:34.100
 or much more something difference,

1:39:34.100 --> 1:39:36.380
 either less abstract or more abstract.

1:39:36.380 --> 1:39:41.380
 And it's either, basically there's just the projection

1:39:42.060 --> 1:39:44.620
 that happens from the three dimensional ideas

1:39:44.620 --> 1:39:46.860
 into let's say a one dimensional language.

1:39:46.860 --> 1:39:49.860
 And the language certainly gives you the apparatus

1:39:49.860 --> 1:39:51.180
 to think about concepts

1:39:51.180 --> 1:39:53.620
 that you didn't realize existed before.

1:39:53.620 --> 1:39:56.380
 And with my team, we often create new words.

1:39:56.380 --> 1:39:58.100
 I'm like, well, now we're gonna call these

1:39:58.100 --> 1:39:59.980
 the regulatory plexus of a gene.

1:39:59.980 --> 1:40:01.660
 And that gives us now the language

1:40:01.660 --> 1:40:04.540
 to sort of build on that as one concept

1:40:04.540 --> 1:40:07.820
 that you then build upon with all kinds of other things.

1:40:07.820 --> 1:40:11.860
 So there's this coevolution again of ideas and language,

1:40:11.860 --> 1:40:15.300
 but they're not one to one with each other.

1:40:15.300 --> 1:40:20.300
 Now let's talk about language itself, words, sentences.

1:40:20.300 --> 1:40:24.100
 This is a very distant construct

1:40:24.100 --> 1:40:26.420
 from where language actually begun.

1:40:26.420 --> 1:40:28.460
 So if you look at how we communicate,

1:40:29.780 --> 1:40:32.980
 as I'm speaking, my eyes are shining

1:40:32.980 --> 1:40:36.060
 and my face is changing through all kinds of emotions.

1:40:36.060 --> 1:40:41.060
 And my entire body composition posture is reshaped.

1:40:41.300 --> 1:40:44.300
 And my intonation, the pauses that I make,

1:40:44.300 --> 1:40:47.220
 the softer and the louder and the this and that

1:40:47.220 --> 1:40:50.700
 are conveying so much more information.

1:40:50.700 --> 1:40:54.140
 And if you look at early human language,

1:40:54.140 --> 1:40:57.100
 and if you look at how the great apes

1:40:57.100 --> 1:40:59.180
 communicate with each other, there's a lot of grunting,

1:40:59.180 --> 1:41:01.260
 there's a lot of posturing, there's a lot of emotions,

1:41:01.260 --> 1:41:03.620
 there's a lot of sort of shrieking, et cetera.

1:41:03.620 --> 1:41:08.620
 They have a lot of components of our human language,

1:41:09.180 --> 1:41:10.420
 just not the words.

1:41:10.420 --> 1:41:13.500
 So I think of human communication

1:41:14.740 --> 1:41:19.020
 as combining the ape component,

1:41:19.020 --> 1:41:22.940
 but also of course the GPT3 component.

1:41:22.940 --> 1:41:24.940
 So basically there's the cognitive layer

1:41:24.940 --> 1:41:27.820
 and the reasoning layer that we share

1:41:27.820 --> 1:41:30.380
 with different parts of our relatives.

1:41:30.380 --> 1:41:31.980
 There's the AI relatives,

1:41:31.980 --> 1:41:34.500
 but there's also the grunting relatives.

1:41:34.500 --> 1:41:37.660
 And what I love about humanity is that we have both.

1:41:37.660 --> 1:41:40.340
 We're not just a conversational system.

1:41:40.340 --> 1:41:44.060
 We're a grunting, emotionally charged,

1:41:44.060 --> 1:41:49.060
 weirdly interconnected system

1:41:49.060 --> 1:41:51.500
 that also has the ability to reason.

1:41:51.500 --> 1:41:54.620
 And when we communicate with each other,

1:41:54.620 --> 1:41:56.900
 there's so much more than just language.

1:41:56.900 --> 1:41:59.060
 There's so much more than just words.

1:41:59.060 --> 1:42:01.660
 It does seem like we're able to somehow transfer

1:42:01.660 --> 1:42:04.620
 even more than the body language.

1:42:04.620 --> 1:42:07.900
 It seems that in the room with us

1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:12.900
 is always a giant knowledge base of shared experiences,

1:42:13.380 --> 1:42:15.420
 different perspectives on those experiences,

1:42:15.420 --> 1:42:19.100
 but I don't know, the knowledge of who the last three,

1:42:19.100 --> 1:42:21.140
 four presidents in the United States was,

1:42:21.140 --> 1:42:24.700
 and just all the 9 11, the tragedies in 9 11,

1:42:24.700 --> 1:42:28.020
 all the beautiful and terrible things

1:42:28.020 --> 1:42:28.860
 that happen in the world.

1:42:28.860 --> 1:42:31.420
 They're somehow both in our minds

1:42:31.420 --> 1:42:36.420
 and somehow enrich the ability to transfer information.

1:42:37.060 --> 1:42:39.100
 What I love about it is I can talk to you

1:42:39.100 --> 1:42:40.420
 about 2001 Odyssey of Space

1:42:40.420 --> 1:42:41.940
 and mention a very specific scene

1:42:41.940 --> 1:42:44.540
 and that evokes all these feelings that you had

1:42:44.540 --> 1:42:45.540
 when you first watched it.

1:42:45.540 --> 1:42:48.140
 We're both visualizing that and maybe in different ways.

1:42:48.140 --> 1:42:48.980
 Exactly.

1:42:48.980 --> 1:42:52.140
 But in that, yeah, and not only that,

1:42:52.140 --> 1:42:56.100
 but the feeling is brought back up,

1:42:56.100 --> 1:42:58.140
 just like you said, with the dreams.

1:42:58.140 --> 1:43:01.140
 We both have that feeling arise in some form

1:43:01.140 --> 1:43:06.140
 as you bring up the child facing his own mortality.

1:43:07.180 --> 1:43:09.260
 It's fascinating that we're able to do that,

1:43:09.260 --> 1:43:10.580
 but I don't know.

1:43:10.580 --> 1:43:12.540
 Now let's talk about Neuralink for a second.

1:43:12.540 --> 1:43:14.580
 So what's the concept of Neuralink?

1:43:14.580 --> 1:43:17.060
 The concept of Neuralink is that I'm gonna take

1:43:17.060 --> 1:43:19.700
 whatever knowledge is encoded in my brain

1:43:19.700 --> 1:43:22.140
 directly transfer it into your brain.

1:43:22.140 --> 1:43:25.260
 So this is a beautiful, fascinating,

1:43:25.260 --> 1:43:29.180
 and extremely sort of appealing concept,

1:43:29.180 --> 1:43:32.140
 but I see a lot of challenges surrounding that.

1:43:32.140 --> 1:43:34.860
 The first one is we have no idea

1:43:34.860 --> 1:43:36.740
 how to even begin to understand

1:43:36.740 --> 1:43:40.100
 how knowledge is encoded in a person's brain.

1:43:40.100 --> 1:43:41.860
 I mean, I told you about this paper that we had recently

1:43:41.860 --> 1:43:45.380
 with Li Hui Cai and Asaf Marko

1:43:45.380 --> 1:43:47.940
 that basically was looking at these engrams

1:43:47.940 --> 1:43:50.580
 that are formed with combinations of neurons

1:43:50.580 --> 1:43:53.140
 that cofire when a stimulus happens,

1:43:53.140 --> 1:43:54.260
 where we can go into a mouse

1:43:54.260 --> 1:43:56.780
 and select those neurons that fire by marking them

1:43:56.780 --> 1:43:58.540
 and then see what happens when they first fire.

1:43:58.540 --> 1:44:00.740
 And then select the neurons that fire again

1:44:00.740 --> 1:44:02.700
 when the experience is repeated.

1:44:02.700 --> 1:44:04.820
 These are the recall neurons,

1:44:04.820 --> 1:44:07.580
 and then there's the memory consolidation neurons.

1:44:07.580 --> 1:44:09.820
 So we're starting to understand a little bit

1:44:09.820 --> 1:44:14.060
 of sort of the distributed nature of knowledge encoding

1:44:14.060 --> 1:44:16.500
 and experience encoding in the human brain

1:44:16.500 --> 1:44:17.900
 and in the mouse brain.

1:44:17.900 --> 1:44:21.420
 And the concept that we'll understand

1:44:21.420 --> 1:44:23.700
 that sufficiently one day

1:44:23.700 --> 1:44:26.580
 to be able to take a snapshot

1:44:26.580 --> 1:44:31.580
 of what does that scene from Dave losing his mind,

1:44:31.580 --> 1:44:34.260
 of Khal losing his mind and talking to Dave,

1:44:36.460 --> 1:44:39.340
 how is that seen and coded in your mind?

1:44:39.340 --> 1:44:41.340
 Imagine the complexity of that.

1:44:41.340 --> 1:44:44.780
 But now imagine, suppose that we solve this problem.

1:44:45.740 --> 1:44:48.740
 And the next enormous challenge is how do I go

1:44:48.740 --> 1:44:50.980
 and modify the next person's brain

1:44:50.980 --> 1:44:54.260
 to now create the same exact neural connections?

1:44:54.260 --> 1:44:56.260
 So that's an enormous challenge right there.

1:44:56.260 --> 1:44:58.860
 So basically it's not just reading, it's now writing.

1:45:00.140 --> 1:45:02.100
 And again, what if something goes wrong?

1:45:02.100 --> 1:45:05.100
 I don't wanna even think about that, that's number two.

1:45:05.100 --> 1:45:08.100
 And number three, who says that the way

1:45:08.100 --> 1:45:11.460
 that you encode Dave, I'm losing my mind

1:45:11.460 --> 1:45:14.660
 and I encode Dave, I'm losing my mind

1:45:14.660 --> 1:45:17.220
 is anywhere near each other.

1:45:17.220 --> 1:45:19.940
 Basically, maybe the way that I'm encoding it

1:45:19.940 --> 1:45:24.780
 is twisted with my childhood memories of running through

1:45:24.780 --> 1:45:28.020
 the pebbles in Greece, and yours is twisted

1:45:28.020 --> 1:45:31.100
 with your childhood memories growing up in Russia.

1:45:31.100 --> 1:45:34.660
 And there's no way that I can take my encoding

1:45:34.660 --> 1:45:35.780
 and put it into your brain,

1:45:35.780 --> 1:45:38.060
 because it'll A, mess things up,

1:45:38.060 --> 1:45:42.940
 and B, be incompatible with your own unique experiences.

1:45:42.940 --> 1:45:45.340
 So that's telepathic communication from human to human.

1:45:45.340 --> 1:45:48.500
 It's fascinating, you're reminding us

1:45:48.500 --> 1:45:51.900
 that there's two biological systems

1:45:51.900 --> 1:45:54.460
 on both ends of that communication.

1:45:54.460 --> 1:45:59.460
 The easier, I guess, maybe half as difficult thing to do

1:45:59.620 --> 1:46:03.020
 in the hope with Neuralink is that we can communicate

1:46:03.020 --> 1:46:06.100
 with an AI system, so where one side of that

1:46:06.100 --> 1:46:08.740
 is a little bit more controllable,

1:46:08.740 --> 1:46:13.340
 but even just that is exceptionally difficult.

1:46:13.340 --> 1:46:16.780
 Let's talk about two neuronal systems talking to each other.

1:46:16.780 --> 1:46:19.500
 Suppose that GPT4 tells GPT3, hey,

1:46:19.500 --> 1:46:21.820
 give me all your knowledge, right?

1:46:21.820 --> 1:46:24.340
 It's ready, I have 10 times more hardware,

1:46:24.340 --> 1:46:25.980
 I'm ready, just feed me.

1:46:25.980 --> 1:46:27.260
 What's GPT3 gonna do?

1:46:27.260 --> 1:46:30.900
 Is it gonna say, oh, here's my 10 billion parameters?

1:46:30.900 --> 1:46:32.660
 No. No way.

1:46:32.660 --> 1:46:35.020
 The simplest way, and perhaps the fastest way

1:46:35.020 --> 1:46:36.500
 for GPT3 to transfer all its knowledge

1:46:36.500 --> 1:46:39.820
 to its older body that has a lot more hardware

1:46:39.820 --> 1:46:44.820
 is to regenerate every single possible human sentence

1:46:44.900 --> 1:46:46.620
 that it can possibly create.

1:46:46.620 --> 1:46:48.100
 Just keep talking.

1:46:48.100 --> 1:46:50.780
 Keep talking and just reencode it all together.

1:46:50.780 --> 1:46:53.380
 So maybe what language does is exactly that.

1:46:53.380 --> 1:46:56.740
 It's taking one generative cognitive model,

1:46:56.740 --> 1:46:59.620
 it's running it forward to emit utterances

1:46:59.620 --> 1:47:01.780
 that kind of make sense in my cognitive frame,

1:47:01.780 --> 1:47:04.060
 and it's reencoding them into yours

1:47:04.060 --> 1:47:07.260
 through the parsing of that same language.

1:47:07.260 --> 1:47:09.700
 And I think the conversation might actually be

1:47:09.700 --> 1:47:11.140
 the most efficient way to do it,

1:47:11.140 --> 1:47:14.540
 so not just talking, but interactive,

1:47:14.540 --> 1:47:18.340
 so talking back and forth, asking questions, interrupting.

1:47:18.340 --> 1:47:20.860
 So GPT4 will constantly be interrupting.

1:47:20.860 --> 1:47:25.100
 Annoying. Annoying, yeah.

1:47:25.100 --> 1:47:27.740
 But the beauty of that is also that

1:47:27.740 --> 1:47:29.820
 as we're interrupting each other,

1:47:29.820 --> 1:47:33.460
 there's all kinds of misinterpretations that happen,

1:47:33.460 --> 1:47:36.620
 that basically when my students speak,

1:47:36.620 --> 1:47:38.980
 I will often know that I'm misunderstanding

1:47:38.980 --> 1:47:41.420
 what they're saying, and I'll be like,

1:47:41.420 --> 1:47:43.100
 hold that thought for a second.

1:47:43.100 --> 1:47:44.860
 Let me tell you what I think I understood,

1:47:44.860 --> 1:47:46.780
 which I know is different from what you said.

1:47:46.780 --> 1:47:49.020
 Then I'll say that, and then someone else

1:47:49.020 --> 1:47:50.540
 in the same Zoom meeting

1:47:50.540 --> 1:47:53.780
 will basically say, well, here's another way

1:47:53.780 --> 1:47:55.420
 to think about what you just said.

1:47:55.420 --> 1:47:57.300
 And then by the third iteration,

1:47:57.300 --> 1:47:59.260
 we're somewhere completely different,

1:47:59.260 --> 1:48:01.980
 that if we could actually communicate

1:48:01.980 --> 1:48:06.100
 with full neural network parameters back and forth

1:48:06.100 --> 1:48:09.100
 of that knowledge and idea and coding,

1:48:09.100 --> 1:48:11.860
 would be far inferior,

1:48:11.860 --> 1:48:15.380
 because the reencoding with our own,

1:48:15.380 --> 1:48:17.540
 as we said last time, emotional baggage

1:48:17.540 --> 1:48:21.780
 and cognitive baggage from our unique experiences

1:48:21.780 --> 1:48:26.780
 through our shared experiences, distinct encodings,

1:48:27.260 --> 1:48:29.660
 in the context of all our unique experiences,

1:48:29.660 --> 1:48:34.660
 is leading to so much more diversity of perspectives.

1:48:37.140 --> 1:48:40.460
 And again, going back to this whole concept of these,

1:48:40.460 --> 1:48:43.940
 entire network of all of human cognitive systems

1:48:43.940 --> 1:48:45.820
 connected to each other,

1:48:45.820 --> 1:48:48.980
 and sort of how ideas and memes permeate through that,

1:48:48.980 --> 1:48:52.140
 that's sort of what really creates a whole new level

1:48:52.140 --> 1:48:57.140
 of human experience through this reasoning layer

1:48:59.140 --> 1:49:00.620
 and this computational layer

1:49:00.620 --> 1:49:03.980
 that obviously lives on top of our cognitive layer.

1:49:04.820 --> 1:49:09.820
 So you're one of these aforementioned cognitive systems,

1:49:09.820 --> 1:49:14.820
 mortal, but thoughtful, and you're connected to a bunch,

1:49:15.620 --> 1:49:19.500
 like you said, students, your wife, your kids.

1:49:19.500 --> 1:49:23.500
 What do you, in your brief time here on Earth,

1:49:23.500 --> 1:49:25.740
 this is a Meaning of Life episode,

1:49:25.740 --> 1:49:30.740
 so what do you hope this world will remember you as?

1:49:31.300 --> 1:49:33.140
 What do you hope your legacy will be?

1:49:33.140 --> 1:49:38.140
 I don't think of legacy as much as maybe most people.

1:49:40.620 --> 1:49:41.460
 Oh, it's kind of funny.

1:49:41.460 --> 1:49:44.340
 I'm consciously living the present.

1:49:44.340 --> 1:49:47.460
 Many students tell me, oh, give us some career advice.

1:49:47.460 --> 1:49:48.940
 I'm like, I'm the wrong person.

1:49:48.940 --> 1:49:50.700
 I've never made a career plan.

1:49:50.700 --> 1:49:51.900
 I still have to make one.

1:49:51.900 --> 1:49:56.900
 I, it's funny to be both experiencing the past,

1:49:56.900 --> 1:50:01.900
 and the present, and the future,

1:50:01.900 --> 1:50:04.580
 but also consciously living in the present,

1:50:04.580 --> 1:50:08.460
 and just, there's a conscious decision we can make

1:50:08.460 --> 1:50:10.260
 to not worry about all that,

1:50:10.260 --> 1:50:13.740
 which again, goes back to the I'm the lucky one kind of thing

1:50:13.740 --> 1:50:18.740
 of living in the present and being happy winning,

1:50:18.740 --> 1:50:20.300
 and being happy losing,

1:50:20.300 --> 1:50:23.580
 and there's a sort of,

1:50:23.580 --> 1:50:27.740
 I'm happy losing, and there's a certain freedom

1:50:27.740 --> 1:50:29.420
 that comes with that, but again,

1:50:29.420 --> 1:50:32.700
 a certain sort of, I don't know,

1:50:32.700 --> 1:50:36.060
 ephemerity of living for the present,

1:50:37.260 --> 1:50:39.940
 but if you, if you stay back from all of that,

1:50:39.940 --> 1:50:44.860
 where basically my current modus operandi

1:50:44.860 --> 1:50:49.100
 is live for the present, make every day

1:50:49.100 --> 1:50:50.700
 the best you can make,

1:50:50.700 --> 1:50:55.300
 and just make the local blip of local maxima

1:50:55.300 --> 1:50:58.740
 of the universe, of the awesomeness of the planet,

1:50:58.740 --> 1:51:02.060
 and the town, and the family that we live in,

1:51:02.060 --> 1:51:05.860
 both academic family and biological family,

1:51:07.620 --> 1:51:08.700
 make it a little more awesome

1:51:08.700 --> 1:51:09.900
 by being generous to your friends,

1:51:09.900 --> 1:51:11.300
 being generous to the people around you,

1:51:11.300 --> 1:51:13.620
 being kind to your enemies,

1:51:13.620 --> 1:51:17.740
 and just showing love all around.

1:51:17.740 --> 1:51:21.540
 You can't be upset at people if you truly love them.

1:51:21.540 --> 1:51:23.380
 If somebody yells at you and insults you

1:51:23.380 --> 1:51:25.780
 every time you say the slightest thing,

1:51:25.780 --> 1:51:28.940
 and yet when you see them, you just see them with love,

1:51:30.220 --> 1:51:31.660
 it's a beautiful feeling.

1:51:31.660 --> 1:51:34.660
 It's like, you know, I'm feeling exactly like

1:51:34.660 --> 1:51:37.620
 when I look at my three year old who's like screaming,

1:51:37.620 --> 1:51:39.740
 even though I love her and I want her good,

1:51:39.740 --> 1:51:42.780
 she's still screaming and saying, no, no, no, no, no.

1:51:42.780 --> 1:51:47.100
 And I'm like, I love you, genuinely love you,

1:51:47.100 --> 1:51:49.580
 but I can sort of kind of see that your brain

1:51:49.580 --> 1:51:53.860
 is kind of stuck in that little mode of anger.

1:51:53.860 --> 1:51:58.260
 And there's plenty of people out there who don't like me,

1:51:58.260 --> 1:52:01.460
 and I see them with love as a child

1:52:01.460 --> 1:52:04.540
 that is stuck in a cognitive state

1:52:04.540 --> 1:52:06.980
 that they're eventually gonna snap out of,

1:52:06.980 --> 1:52:08.980
 or maybe not, and that's okay.

1:52:08.980 --> 1:52:12.980
 So there's that aspect of sort of experiencing life

1:52:12.980 --> 1:52:16.980
 with the best intentions.

1:52:16.980 --> 1:52:20.380
 And I love when I'm wrong.

1:52:20.380 --> 1:52:22.700
 I had a friend who was like one of the smartest people

1:52:22.700 --> 1:52:24.700
 I've ever met who would basically say,

1:52:24.700 --> 1:52:26.300
 oh, I love it when I'm wrong

1:52:26.300 --> 1:52:27.860
 because it makes me feel human.

1:52:27.860 --> 1:52:31.100
 And it's so beautiful.

1:52:31.100 --> 1:52:32.660
 I mean, she's really one of the smartest people

1:52:32.660 --> 1:52:33.500
 I've ever met.

1:52:33.500 --> 1:52:36.100
 And she was like, oh, it's such a good feeling.

1:52:36.100 --> 1:52:41.100
 And I love being wrong, but there's something

1:52:41.500 --> 1:52:42.540
 about self improvement.

1:52:42.540 --> 1:52:45.260
 There's something about sort of how do I

1:52:45.260 --> 1:52:49.100
 not make the most mistakes, but attempt the most rights

1:52:49.100 --> 1:52:50.820
 and do the fewest wrongs,

1:52:50.820 --> 1:52:53.100
 but with the full knowledge that this will happen.

1:52:53.100 --> 1:52:54.400
 That's one aspect.

1:52:55.340 --> 1:53:00.260
 So through this life in the present,

1:53:00.260 --> 1:53:02.140
 what's really funny is,

1:53:02.140 --> 1:53:04.540
 and that's something that I've experienced more and more

1:53:04.540 --> 1:53:07.820
 really thanks to you and through this podcast,

1:53:07.820 --> 1:53:11.100
 is this enormous number of people who will basically comment,

1:53:11.100 --> 1:53:14.820
 wow, I've been following this guy for so many years now,

1:53:14.820 --> 1:53:17.380
 or wow, this guy has inspired so many of us

1:53:17.380 --> 1:53:19.540
 in computation biology and so on and so forth.

1:53:19.540 --> 1:53:22.040
 I'm like, I don't know any of that,

1:53:22.040 --> 1:53:23.580
 but I'm only discovering this now

1:53:23.580 --> 1:53:27.940
 through these sort of sharing our emotional states

1:53:27.940 --> 1:53:31.580
 and our cognitive states with a wider audience,

1:53:31.580 --> 1:53:33.980
 where suddenly I'm sort of realizing that,

1:53:33.980 --> 1:53:35.540
 wow, maybe I've had a legacy.

1:53:36.820 --> 1:53:39.900
 Like basically I've trained generations of students

1:53:39.900 --> 1:53:44.900
 from MIT and I've put all of my courses freely online

1:53:45.220 --> 1:53:47.760
 since 2001.

1:53:47.760 --> 1:53:50.140
 So basically all of my video recordings of my lectures

1:53:50.140 --> 1:53:52.240
 have been online since 2001.

1:53:52.240 --> 1:53:56.100
 So countless generations of people from across the world

1:53:56.100 --> 1:53:58.540
 will meet me at a conference and say,

1:53:58.540 --> 1:54:01.060
 like I was at this conference where somebody heard my voice

1:54:01.060 --> 1:54:02.620
 and it's like, I know this voice,

1:54:02.620 --> 1:54:04.540
 I've been listening to your lectures.

1:54:04.540 --> 1:54:07.180
 And it's just such a beautiful thing where

1:54:07.180 --> 1:54:11.400
 like we're sharing widely and who knows

1:54:11.400 --> 1:54:13.900
 which students will get where

1:54:13.900 --> 1:54:16.300
 from whatever they catch out of these lectures,

1:54:16.300 --> 1:54:18.500
 even if what they catch is just inspiration

1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:20.700
 and passion and drive.

1:54:20.700 --> 1:54:25.700
 So there's this intangible legacy quote unquote

1:54:26.260 --> 1:54:29.720
 that every one of us has through the people we touch.

1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:31.940
 One of my friends from undergrad basically told me,

1:54:31.940 --> 1:54:33.640
 oh, my mom remembers you vividly

1:54:33.640 --> 1:54:34.480
 from when she came to campus.

1:54:34.480 --> 1:54:36.080
 I'm like, I didn't even meet her.

1:54:36.080 --> 1:54:39.380
 She's like, no, but she sort of saw you interacting

1:54:39.380 --> 1:54:40.860
 with people and said, wow,

1:54:40.860 --> 1:54:43.420
 he's exuding this positive energy.

1:54:43.420 --> 1:54:47.020
 And there's that aspect of sort of just motivating people

1:54:47.020 --> 1:54:50.620
 with your kindness, with your passion, with your generosity

1:54:50.620 --> 1:54:55.620
 and with your just selflessness of just give,

1:54:56.860 --> 1:54:58.980
 it doesn't matter where it goes.

1:54:58.980 --> 1:55:01.820
 I've been to conferences where basically people will,

1:55:01.820 --> 1:55:04.100
 I'll ask them a question and then they'll come back to,

1:55:04.100 --> 1:55:06.380
 or there was a conference where I asked somebody a question

1:55:06.380 --> 1:55:08.620
 and they said, oh, in fact, this entire project

1:55:08.620 --> 1:55:10.500
 was inspired by your question three years ago

1:55:10.500 --> 1:55:11.860
 at the same conference.

1:55:11.860 --> 1:55:13.460
 I'm like, wow.

1:55:13.460 --> 1:55:15.560
 And then on top of that, there's also the ripple effect.

1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:18.500
 So you're speaking to the direct influence of inspiration

1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:22.100
 or education, but there's also the follow on things

1:55:22.100 --> 1:55:23.980
 that happen to that and there's this ripple

1:55:23.980 --> 1:55:27.140
 that from you just this one individual first drop.

1:55:27.140 --> 1:55:29.260
 And from every one of us, from everyone,

1:55:29.260 --> 1:55:30.920
 that's what I love about humanity.

1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:35.740
 The fact that every one of us shares genes

1:55:36.660 --> 1:55:39.780
 and genetic variants with very recent ancestors

1:55:39.780 --> 1:55:41.060
 with everyone else.

1:55:41.060 --> 1:55:45.640
 So even if I die tomorrow, my genes are still shared

1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:47.460
 through my cousins and through my uncles

1:55:47.460 --> 1:55:49.980
 and through my immediate family.

1:55:49.980 --> 1:55:52.740
 And of course I'm lucky enough to have my own children,

1:55:52.740 --> 1:55:55.700
 but even if you don't, your genes are still permeating

1:55:55.700 --> 1:55:57.540
 through all of the layers of your family.

1:55:57.540 --> 1:56:00.220
 So your genes will have the legacy there, yeah.

1:56:00.220 --> 1:56:01.360
 Every one of us.

1:56:02.460 --> 1:56:05.020
 Number two, our ideas are constantly intermingling

1:56:05.020 --> 1:56:05.840
 with each other.

1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:08.780
 So there's no person living in the planet

1:56:08.780 --> 1:56:12.040
 a hundred years from now who will not be directly impacted

1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:14.560
 by every one of the planet living here today

1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:18.540
 through genetic inheritance and through meme inheritance.

1:56:18.540 --> 1:56:22.060
 That's cool to think that your ideas, Manolis Callas,

1:56:22.060 --> 1:56:27.060
 would touch every single person on this planet.

1:56:27.100 --> 1:56:27.940
 It's interesting.

1:56:27.940 --> 1:56:30.300
 It's not just mine, Joe Smith, who's looking at this

1:56:30.300 --> 1:56:33.900
 right now, his ideas will also touch everybody.

1:56:33.900 --> 1:56:37.100
 So there's this interconnectedness of humanity.

1:56:37.100 --> 1:56:39.220
 And then I'm also a professor.

1:56:39.220 --> 1:56:42.140
 So my day job is legacy.

1:56:42.140 --> 1:56:46.180
 My day job is training, not just the thousands of people

1:56:46.180 --> 1:56:47.900
 who watch my videos on the web,

1:56:47.900 --> 1:56:50.300
 but the people who are actually in my class,

1:56:50.300 --> 1:56:55.020
 who basically come to MIT to learn from a bunch of us.

1:56:55.020 --> 1:56:58.420
 The cognitive systems that were shipped to this particular

1:56:58.420 --> 1:56:59.260
 location in space.

1:56:59.260 --> 1:57:00.540
 And who will then disperse back

1:57:00.540 --> 1:57:02.660
 into all of their home countries.

1:57:02.660 --> 1:57:05.200
 That's what makes America the beacon of the world.

1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:09.100
 We don't just export goods.

1:57:09.100 --> 1:57:10.900
 We export people.

1:57:10.900 --> 1:57:12.140
 Cognitive systems.

1:57:12.140 --> 1:57:15.300
 We export people who are born here.

1:57:15.300 --> 1:57:18.980
 And we also export training that people born elsewhere

1:57:18.980 --> 1:57:21.940
 will come here to get and will then disseminate,

1:57:21.940 --> 1:57:23.940
 not just whatever knowledge they got,

1:57:23.940 --> 1:57:26.140
 but whatever ideals they learned.

1:57:26.140 --> 1:57:28.700
 And I think that's something that's a legacy of the US

1:57:28.700 --> 1:57:31.260
 that you cannot stop with political isolation.

1:57:31.260 --> 1:57:33.460
 You cannot stop with economic isolation.

1:57:33.460 --> 1:57:35.700
 That's something that will continue to happen

1:57:35.700 --> 1:57:38.260
 through all the people we've touched through our universities.

1:57:38.260 --> 1:57:40.940
 So there's the students who took my classes,

1:57:40.940 --> 1:57:44.220
 who are basically now going off and teaching their classes.

1:57:44.220 --> 1:57:46.460
 And I've trained generations of computational biologists.

1:57:46.460 --> 1:57:48.620
 No one in genomics who's gone through MIT

1:57:48.620 --> 1:57:50.060
 hasn't taken my class.

1:57:50.060 --> 1:57:53.020
 So basically there's this impact through,

1:57:53.020 --> 1:57:55.220
 I mean, there's so many people in biotechs who are like,

1:57:55.220 --> 1:57:56.260
 hey, I took your class.

1:57:56.260 --> 1:57:58.380
 That's what got me into the field like 15 years ago.

1:57:58.380 --> 1:58:00.140
 And it's just so beautiful.

1:58:00.140 --> 1:58:04.760
 And then there's the academic family that I have.

1:58:04.760 --> 1:58:07.740
 So the students who are actually studying with me,

1:58:07.740 --> 1:58:09.280
 who are my trainees.

1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:12.880
 So this sort of mentorship of ancient Greece.

1:58:15.020 --> 1:58:20.020
 So I basically have an academic family and we are a family.

1:58:20.020 --> 1:58:24.200
 There's this such strong connection,

1:58:24.200 --> 1:58:27.640
 this bond of you're part of the Kelly's family.

1:58:27.640 --> 1:58:29.840
 So I have a biological family at home

1:58:29.840 --> 1:58:32.120
 and I have an academic family on campus.

1:58:32.120 --> 1:58:33.720
 And that academic family

1:58:33.720 --> 1:58:36.240
 has given me great grandchildren already.

1:58:36.240 --> 1:58:37.120
 Yes.

1:58:37.120 --> 1:58:40.720
 So I've trained people who are now professors at Stanford,

1:58:40.720 --> 1:58:45.720
 CMU, Harvard, WashU, I mean, everywhere in the world.

1:58:46.400 --> 1:58:49.240
 And these people have now trained people

1:58:49.240 --> 1:58:53.060
 who are now having their own faculty jobs.

1:58:53.060 --> 1:58:55.160
 So there's basically people who see me

1:58:55.160 --> 1:58:57.360
 as their academic grandfather.

1:58:57.360 --> 1:58:58.440
 And it's just so beautiful

1:58:58.440 --> 1:59:00.460
 because you don't have to wait for the 18 years

1:59:00.460 --> 1:59:03.920
 of cognitive hardware development

1:59:03.920 --> 1:59:07.440
 to sort of have amazing conversation with people.

1:59:07.440 --> 1:59:09.640
 These are fully grown humans, fully grown adult

1:59:09.640 --> 1:59:14.640
 who are cognitively super ready and who are shaped by,

1:59:15.680 --> 1:59:18.720
 and I see some of these beautiful papers and I'm like,

1:59:18.720 --> 1:59:21.880
 I can see the touch of our lab in those papers.

1:59:21.880 --> 1:59:22.720
 It's just so beautiful.

1:59:22.720 --> 1:59:25.560
 Cause you're like, I spent hours with these people

1:59:25.560 --> 1:59:28.760
 teaching them not just how to do a paper, but how to think.

1:59:29.740 --> 1:59:31.960
 And this whole concept of, you know,

1:59:31.960 --> 1:59:34.200
 the first paper that we write together

1:59:34.200 --> 1:59:37.480
 is an experience with every one of these students.

1:59:37.480 --> 1:59:38.760
 So, you know, I always tell them

1:59:38.760 --> 1:59:40.560
 to write the whole first draft

1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:43.320
 and they know that I will rewrite every word.

1:59:43.320 --> 1:59:45.840
 But the act of them writing it

1:59:45.840 --> 1:59:48.320
 and what I do is these like joint editing sessions

1:59:48.320 --> 1:59:50.080
 where I'm like, let's coedit.

1:59:50.080 --> 1:59:53.040
 And with this coediting, we basically have...

1:59:53.040 --> 1:59:55.080
 Creative destruction.

1:59:55.080 --> 1:59:56.680
 So I share my Zoom screen

1:59:56.680 --> 1:59:59.600
 and I'm just thinking out loud as I'm doing this.

1:59:59.600 --> 2:00:01.200
 And they're learning from that process

2:00:01.200 --> 2:00:03.180
 as opposed to like come back two days later

2:00:03.180 --> 2:00:05.080
 and they see a bunch of red on a page.

2:00:05.080 --> 2:00:08.120
 I'm sort of, well, that's not how you write this.

2:00:08.120 --> 2:00:09.480
 That's not how you think about this.

2:00:09.480 --> 2:00:10.840
 That's not, you know, what's the point?

2:00:10.840 --> 2:00:12.600
 Like this morning was having,

2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:14.600
 yes, this morning between six and 8 a.m.

2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:15.800
 I had a two hour meeting

2:00:15.800 --> 2:00:18.280
 going through one of these papers

2:00:18.280 --> 2:00:20.800
 and then saying, what's the point here?

2:00:20.800 --> 2:00:22.200
 Why do you even show that?

2:00:22.200 --> 2:00:24.040
 It's just a bunch of points on a graph.

2:00:24.040 --> 2:00:26.640
 No, what you have to do is extract the meaning,

2:00:26.640 --> 2:00:28.240
 do the homework for them.

2:00:28.240 --> 2:00:32.440
 And there's this nurturing, this mentorship

2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:34.640
 that sort of creates now a legacy,

2:00:34.640 --> 2:00:39.400
 which is infinite because they've now gone off on the,

2:00:39.400 --> 2:00:42.120
 you know, and all of that is just humanity.

2:00:42.120 --> 2:00:44.200
 Then of course there's the papers I write

2:00:44.200 --> 2:00:48.240
 because yes, my day job is training students,

2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:50.280
 but it's a research university.

2:00:50.280 --> 2:00:54.400
 The way that they learn is through the mens and manus,

2:00:54.400 --> 2:00:56.000
 mind and hand.

2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:59.360
 It's the practical training of actually doing research.

2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:03.860
 And that research is a beneficial side effect

2:01:03.860 --> 2:01:06.640
 of having these awesome papers

2:01:06.640 --> 2:01:10.900
 that will now tell other people how to think.

2:01:10.900 --> 2:01:13.240
 There's this paper we just posted recently on MedArchive

2:01:13.240 --> 2:01:16.200
 and one of the most generous and eloquent comments about it

2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:21.200
 was like, wow, this is a masterclass in scientific writing,

2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:24.920
 in analysis, in biological interpretation, and so forth.

2:01:24.920 --> 2:01:27.500
 It's just so fulfilling from a person I've never met

2:01:27.500 --> 2:01:28.340
 or heard about.

2:01:28.340 --> 2:01:30.720
 Can you say the title of the paper, Brian Chen?

2:01:30.720 --> 2:01:31.860
 I don't remember the title,

2:01:31.860 --> 2:01:36.700
 but it's single cell dissection of schizophrenia reveals.

2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:39.920
 So the two points that we found

2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:42.780
 was this whole transcriptional resilience.

2:01:42.780 --> 2:01:46.600
 Like there's some individuals who are schizophrenic,

2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:50.040
 but they have an additional cell type

2:01:50.040 --> 2:01:53.560
 or an additional cell state, which we believe is protective.

2:01:53.560 --> 2:01:55.680
 And that cell state when they have it

2:01:55.680 --> 2:01:58.920
 will cause other cells to have normal gene expression patterns.

2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:00.440
 It's beautiful.

2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:03.980
 And then that cell is connected

2:02:03.980 --> 2:02:06.120
 with some of the PV interneurons

2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:09.520
 that are basically sending these inhibitory brainwaves

2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:10.860
 through the brain.

2:02:10.860 --> 2:02:14.940
 And basically there's another component of,

2:02:14.940 --> 2:02:18.460
 there's a set of master regulators that we discovered

2:02:18.460 --> 2:02:20.760
 who are controlling many of the genes

2:02:20.760 --> 2:02:22.600
 that are differentially expressed.

2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:24.500
 And these master regulators are themselves

2:02:24.500 --> 2:02:27.120
 genetic targets of schizophrenia.

2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:28.700
 And they are themselves involved

2:02:28.700 --> 2:02:31.840
 in both synaptic connectivity

2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:34.740
 and also in early brain development.

2:02:34.740 --> 2:02:36.880
 So there's this sort of interconnectedness

2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:40.160
 between synaptic development axis

2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:41.640
 and also this transcriptional resilience.

2:02:41.640 --> 2:02:43.120
 So, I mean, we basically made up a title

2:02:43.120 --> 2:02:44.860
 that combines all these concepts.

2:02:44.860 --> 2:02:45.760
 You have all these concepts,

2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:46.920
 all these people working together,

2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:49.640
 and ultimately these minds condense it down

2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:51.800
 into a beautifully written little document

2:02:51.800 --> 2:02:52.640
 that lives on forever. Exactly.

2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:55.040
 And that document now has its own life.

2:02:55.040 --> 2:02:59.940
 Our work has 120,000 citations.

2:02:59.940 --> 2:03:02.100
 I mean, that's not just people who read it.

2:03:02.100 --> 2:03:03.740
 These are people who used it

2:03:03.740 --> 2:03:05.760
 to write something based on it.

2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:10.640
 I mean, that to me is just so fulfilling

2:03:10.640 --> 2:03:12.960
 to basically say, wow, I've touched people.

2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:17.780
 So I don't think of my legacy as I live every day.

2:03:17.780 --> 2:03:20.300
 I just think of the beauty of the present

2:03:20.300 --> 2:03:22.440
 and the power of interconnectedness.

2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:25.020
 And just, I feel like a kid in a candy shop

2:03:25.020 --> 2:03:28.040
 where I'm just like constantly,

2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:31.620
 where do I, what package do I open first?

2:03:31.620 --> 2:03:33.980
 And, you know. You're the lucky one.

2:03:33.980 --> 2:03:37.880
 A jack of all trades, a master of none.

2:03:37.880 --> 2:03:41.320
 I think for a Meaning of Life episode,

2:03:41.320 --> 2:03:45.400
 we would be amiss if we did not have at least a poem or two.

2:03:45.400 --> 2:03:49.360
 Do you mind if we end in a couple of poems?

2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:51.720
 Maybe a happy, maybe a sad one.

2:03:51.720 --> 2:03:52.680
 I would love that.

2:03:52.680 --> 2:03:54.160
 So thank you for the luxury.

2:03:55.360 --> 2:03:57.080
 The first one is kind of,

2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:03.720
 I remember when you were talking with Eric Weinstein

2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:08.720
 about this comment of Leonard Cohen that says,

2:04:09.460 --> 2:04:11.880
 but you don't really care for music, do you?

2:04:11.880 --> 2:04:12.760
 In Hallelujah.

2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:16.260
 That's basically kind of like mocking its reader.

2:04:16.260 --> 2:04:18.520
 So one of my poems is a little like that.

2:04:18.520 --> 2:04:23.520
 So I had just broken up with my girlfriend

2:04:23.720 --> 2:04:26.920
 and there's this other friend who was coming to visit me.

2:04:26.920 --> 2:04:30.420
 And she said, I will not come unless you write me a poem.

2:04:30.420 --> 2:04:35.420
 And I was like, writing a poem on demand.

2:04:37.480 --> 2:04:40.880
 So this poem is called Write Me a Poem.

2:04:40.880 --> 2:04:44.280
 It goes, write me a poem, she said with a smile.

2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:47.120
 Make sure it's pretty, romantic and rhymes.

2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:49.480
 Make sure it's worthy of that bold flame,

2:04:49.480 --> 2:04:52.560
 that love uniting us beyond a mere game.

2:04:52.560 --> 2:04:54.840
 And she took off without more words,

2:04:54.840 --> 2:04:57.840
 rushed for the bus and traveled the world.

2:04:57.840 --> 2:05:00.640
 A poem, I thought, this is sublime.

2:05:00.640 --> 2:05:03.120
 What better way for passing the time?

2:05:03.120 --> 2:05:05.380
 What better way to count up the hours

2:05:05.380 --> 2:05:08.440
 before she comes back to my lonely tower?

2:05:08.440 --> 2:05:10.400
 Waiting for joy to fill up my heart,

2:05:10.400 --> 2:05:13.280
 let's write a poem for when we're apart.

2:05:13.280 --> 2:05:16.040
 How does a poem start, I inquired.

2:05:16.040 --> 2:05:18.400
 Give me a topic, cook up a style.

2:05:18.400 --> 2:05:20.840
 Throw in some cute words, oh, here and there.

2:05:20.840 --> 2:05:22.840
 Throw in some passion, love and despair.

2:05:23.760 --> 2:05:26.760
 Love, three eggs, one pound of flour,

2:05:26.760 --> 2:05:28.860
 three cups of water and bake for an hour.

2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:32.300
 Love is no recipe as I understand.

2:05:32.300 --> 2:05:34.560
 You can't just cook up a poem on demand.

2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:37.080
 And as I was twisting all this in my mind,

2:05:37.080 --> 2:05:40.920
 I looked at the page, by golly, it rhymed.

2:05:40.920 --> 2:05:43.960
 Three roses, white chocolate, vanilla powder,

2:05:43.960 --> 2:05:46.640
 some beautiful rhymes and maybe a flower.

2:05:46.640 --> 2:05:49.360
 No, be romantic, the young girl insisted.

2:05:49.360 --> 2:05:51.600
 Do this, do that, don't be so silly.

2:05:51.600 --> 2:05:53.400
 You must believe it straight from your heart.

2:05:53.400 --> 2:05:56.800
 If you don't feel it, we're better apart.

2:05:56.800 --> 2:05:59.520
 Oh, my sweet thing, what can I say?

2:05:59.520 --> 2:06:02.960
 You bring me the sun all night and all day.

2:06:02.960 --> 2:06:06.060
 You're the stars and the moon and the birds way up high.

2:06:06.060 --> 2:06:09.440
 You're my evening sweet song, my morning blue sky.

2:06:09.440 --> 2:06:12.480
 You are my muse, your spell has me caught.

2:06:12.480 --> 2:06:15.640
 You bring me my voice and scatter my thoughts.

2:06:15.640 --> 2:06:19.160
 To put that loving writing in vain, I can try.

2:06:19.160 --> 2:06:22.400
 But when I'm with you, my wings want to fly.

2:06:22.400 --> 2:06:25.640
 So I put down the pen and drop my defenses.

2:06:25.640 --> 2:06:28.560
 Give myself to you and fill up my senses.

2:06:31.280 --> 2:06:35.040
 The baffled king composing, that was beautiful.

2:06:35.040 --> 2:06:38.160
 What I love about it is that I did not

2:06:38.160 --> 2:06:39.760
 bring up a dictionary of rhymes.

2:06:39.760 --> 2:06:42.200
 I did not sort of work hard.

2:06:42.200 --> 2:06:45.560
 So basically when I write poems, I just type.

2:06:45.560 --> 2:06:46.880
 I never go back, I just.

2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:50.880
 So when my brain gets into that mode,

2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:52.800
 it actually happens like I wrote it.

2:06:52.800 --> 2:06:54.320
 Oh, wow, so the rhymes just kind of.

2:06:54.320 --> 2:06:55.160
 The rhymes just kind of come.

2:06:55.160 --> 2:06:56.000
 It's an emergent phenomenon.

2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:57.080
 It's an emergent phenomenon.

2:06:57.080 --> 2:07:00.960
 I just get into that mode and then it comes up.

2:07:00.960 --> 2:07:02.040
 That's a beautiful one.

2:07:02.040 --> 2:07:06.760
 And it's basically, you know, as you got it,

2:07:06.760 --> 2:07:08.120
 it's basically saying it's no recipe

2:07:08.120 --> 2:07:09.880
 and then I'm throwing in the recipes

2:07:09.880 --> 2:07:11.600
 and as I'm writing it, I'm like, you know.

2:07:11.600 --> 2:07:16.480
 So it's very introspective in this whole concept.

2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:19.560
 So anyway, there's another one many years earlier

2:07:19.560 --> 2:07:23.600
 that is, you know, darker.

2:07:23.600 --> 2:07:26.760
 It's basically this whole concept of let's be friends.

2:07:26.760 --> 2:07:29.760
 I was like, ugh, you know.

2:07:29.760 --> 2:07:32.480
 No, let's be friends, just like, you know.

2:07:32.480 --> 2:07:34.080
 So the last words are shout out,

2:07:34.080 --> 2:07:36.240
 I love you or send me to hell.

2:07:36.240 --> 2:07:40.000
 So the title is Burn Me Tonight.

2:07:41.520 --> 2:07:43.200
 Lie to me, baby.

2:07:43.200 --> 2:07:44.680
 Lie to me now.

2:07:44.680 --> 2:07:45.920
 Tell me you love me.

2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:47.080
 Break me a vow.

2:07:47.080 --> 2:07:49.920
 Give me a sweet word, a promise, a kiss.

2:07:49.920 --> 2:07:52.760
 Give me the world, a sweet taste to miss.

2:07:52.760 --> 2:07:56.120
 Don't let me lay here, inert, ugly, cold,

2:07:56.120 --> 2:07:59.120
 with nothing sweet felt and nothing harsh told.

2:07:59.120 --> 2:08:02.360
 Give me some hope, false, foolish, yet kind.

2:08:02.360 --> 2:08:05.120
 Make me regret, I'll leave you behind.

2:08:05.120 --> 2:08:08.240
 Don't pity my soul or torture it right.

2:08:08.240 --> 2:08:09.560
 Treat it with hatred.

2:08:09.560 --> 2:08:11.040
 Start up a fight.

2:08:11.040 --> 2:08:14.040
 For it's from mildness that my soul dies

2:08:14.040 --> 2:08:18.600
 when you cover your passion in a bland friend's disguise.

2:08:18.600 --> 2:08:19.560
 Kiss me now, baby.

2:08:19.560 --> 2:08:21.080
 Show me your passion.

2:08:21.080 --> 2:08:23.640
 Turn off the lights and rip off your fashion.

2:08:23.640 --> 2:08:26.720
 Give me my life's joy this one night.

2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:30.120
 Burn all my matches for one blazing light.

2:08:30.120 --> 2:08:32.480
 Don't think of tomorrow and let today fade.

2:08:32.480 --> 2:08:35.560
 Don't try and protect me from love's cutting blade.

2:08:35.560 --> 2:08:38.480
 Your razor will always rip off my veins.

2:08:38.480 --> 2:08:42.080
 Don't spare me the passion to spare me the pains.

2:08:42.080 --> 2:08:44.600
 Kiss me now, honey, or spit in my face.

2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:47.680
 Throw me an insult I'll gladly embrace.

2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:49.960
 Tell me now clearly that you never cared.

2:08:49.960 --> 2:08:52.800
 Say it now loudly like you never dared.

2:08:52.800 --> 2:08:54.080
 I'm ready to hear it.

2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:55.480
 I'm ready to die.

2:08:55.480 --> 2:08:58.520
 I'm ready to burn and start a new life.

2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:01.400
 I'm ready to face the rough burning truth

2:09:01.400 --> 2:09:04.360
 rather than waste the rest of my youth.

2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:07.240
 So tell me, my lover, should I stay or go?

2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:09.800
 The answer to love is one, yes or no.

2:09:09.800 --> 2:09:12.480
 There's no I like you, no let's be friends,

2:09:12.480 --> 2:09:15.120
 shout out I love you, or send me to hell.

2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:21.600
 I don't think there's a better way to end

2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:23.320
 a discussion of the meaning of life.

2:09:23.320 --> 2:09:25.720
 Whatever the heck the meaning is,

2:09:25.720 --> 2:09:28.720
 go all in as that poem says.

2:09:28.720 --> 2:09:30.480

 And now, let me leave you with some words

2:10:11.480 --> 2:10:13.440
 from Douglas Adams in his book,

2:10:13.440 --> 2:10:16.160
 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

2:10:16.160 --> 2:10:19.440
 On the planet Earth, man had always assumed

2:10:19.440 --> 2:10:22.160
 that he was more intelligent than dolphins

2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:24.480
 because he had achieved so much.

2:10:24.480 --> 2:10:28.720
 The wheel, New York, wars, and so on,

2:10:28.720 --> 2:10:31.240
 whilst all the dolphins had ever done

2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:34.920
 was muck about in the water having a good time.

2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:38.600
 But conversely, the dolphins had always believed

2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:41.480
 that they were far more intelligent than man

2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:43.940
 for precisely the same reasons.

2:10:43.940 --> 2:11:04.940
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
