00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
 The following is a conversation with Frank Wilczek,

00:02.800 --> 00:07.000
 a theoretical physicist at MIT who won the Nobel Prize

00:07.000 --> 00:09.620
 for the co discovery of asymptotic freedom

00:09.620 --> 00:12.160
 in the theory of strong interaction.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.040
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:14.040 --> 00:18.700
 the Information, NetSuite, ExpressVPN, Blinkist,

00:18.700 --> 00:20.420
 and Aidsleep.

00:20.420 --> 00:23.600
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.900
 As a side note, let me say a word about asymptotic freedom.

00:26.900 --> 00:30.000
 Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of an atom.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.800
 Strong interaction is responsible

00:31.800 --> 00:34.160
 for the strong nuclear force that binds them.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.700
 But strong interaction also holds together the quarks

00:37.700 --> 00:40.040
 that make up the protons and neutrons.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.240
 Frank Wilczek, David Gross, and David Politzer

00:43.240 --> 00:45.280
 came up with a theory postulating

00:45.280 --> 00:48.040
 that when quarks come really close to one another,

00:48.040 --> 00:51.440
 the attraction abates and they behave like free particles.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.420
 This is called asymptotic freedom.

00:54.420 --> 00:57.860
 This happens at very, very high energies,

00:57.860 --> 01:00.640
 which is also where all the fun is.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.880
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,

01:02.880 --> 01:06.540
 and here is my conversation with Frank Wilczek.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.960
 What is the most beautiful idea in physics?

01:10.960 --> 01:13.520
 The most beautiful idea in physics

01:13.520 --> 01:18.520
 is that we can get a compact description of the world

01:19.080 --> 01:22.760
 that's very precise and very full

01:22.760 --> 01:26.900
 at the level of the operating system of the world.

01:28.520 --> 01:32.100
 That's an extraordinary gift.

01:32.100 --> 01:37.100
 And we get worried when we find discrepancies

01:38.160 --> 01:41.080
 between our description of the world

01:41.080 --> 01:42.800
 and what's actually observed

01:43.760 --> 01:46.780
 at the level even of a part in a billion.

01:46.780 --> 01:49.440
 You actually have this quote from Einstein

01:49.440 --> 01:51.880
 that the most incomprehensible thing

01:51.880 --> 01:54.920
 about the universe is that it is comprehensible,

01:54.920 --> 01:55.760
 something like that.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.320
 Yes, so that's the most beautiful surprise

01:58.320 --> 02:03.320
 that I think that really was to me the most profound result

02:05.160 --> 02:08.640
 of the scientific revolution of the 17th century

02:08.640 --> 02:13.120
 with the shining example of Newtonian physics

02:13.120 --> 02:17.320
 that you could aspire to completeness, precision,

02:17.320 --> 02:20.120
 and a concise description of the world,

02:20.120 --> 02:21.360
 of the operating system.

02:21.360 --> 02:25.280
 And it's gotten better and better over the years

02:25.280 --> 02:27.920
 and that's the continuing miracle.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.880
 Now, there are a lot of beautiful sub miracles too.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.600
 The form of the equations is governed

02:33.600 --> 02:35.760
 by high degrees of symmetry

02:35.760 --> 02:39.000
 and they have a very surprising kind

02:39.000 --> 02:40.800
 of mind expanding structure,

02:40.800 --> 02:42.920
 especially in quantum mechanics.

02:42.920 --> 02:47.920
 But if I had to say the single most beautiful revelation

02:47.920 --> 02:52.920
 is that, in fact, the world is comprehensible.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.480
 Would you say that's a fact or a hope?

02:56.480 --> 02:58.160
 It's a fact.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.280
 We can do, you can point to things like

03:02.360 --> 03:07.360
 the rise of gross national products per capita

03:11.400 --> 03:14.220
 around the world as a result of the scientific revolution.

03:14.220 --> 03:15.720
 You can see it all around you.

03:15.720 --> 03:20.720
 And recent developments with exponential production

03:21.420 --> 03:26.420
 of wealth, control of nature at a very profound level

03:27.480 --> 03:31.800
 where we do things like sense tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny

03:31.800 --> 03:35.560
 vibrations to tell that there are black holes

03:35.560 --> 03:40.560
 colliding far away or we test laws as I alluded to

03:40.560 --> 03:45.400
 whether it's part in a billion and do things

03:45.400 --> 03:47.660
 in what appear on the surface

03:47.660 --> 03:49.820
 to be entirely different conceptual universes.

03:49.820 --> 03:52.040
 I mean, on the one hand, pencil and paper

03:52.040 --> 03:55.520
 are nowadays computers that calculate abstractions

03:55.520 --> 03:58.660
 and on the other hand, magnets and accelerators

03:58.660 --> 04:00.840
 and detectors that look at the behavior

04:00.840 --> 04:05.160
 of fundamental particles and these different universes

04:05.160 --> 04:08.200
 have to agree or else we get very upset

04:08.200 --> 04:12.760
 and that's an amazing thing if you think about it.

04:12.760 --> 04:17.760
 And it's telling us that we do understand a lot

04:18.040 --> 04:20.480
 about nature at a very profound level

04:21.400 --> 04:25.520
 and there are still things we don't understand of course

04:25.520 --> 04:28.940
 but as we get better and better answers

04:28.940 --> 04:32.720
 and better and better ability to address difficult questions

04:32.720 --> 04:35.560
 we can ask more and more ambitious questions.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.320
 Well, I guess the hope part of that is because

04:38.320 --> 04:40.280
 we are surrounded by mystery.

04:40.280 --> 04:45.040
 So one way to say it, if you look at the growth GDP

04:45.040 --> 04:47.200
 over time that we figured out quite a lot

04:47.200 --> 04:50.340
 and we're able to improve the quality of life

04:50.340 --> 04:53.160
 because of that and we've figured out some fundamental things

04:53.160 --> 04:55.400
 about this universe but we still don't know

04:55.400 --> 04:58.720
 how much mystery there is and it's also possible

04:58.720 --> 05:03.360
 that there's some things that are in fact incomprehensible

05:03.360 --> 05:07.400
 to both our minds and the tools of science.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.600
 Like the sad thing is we may not know it

05:11.600 --> 05:14.320
 because in fact they are incomprehensible

05:14.320 --> 05:16.480
 and that's the open question is how much

05:16.480 --> 05:18.180
 of the universe is comprehensible?

05:18.180 --> 05:23.180
 If we figured out everything what's inside the black hole

05:23.480 --> 05:26.760
 and everything that happened at the moment of the Big Bang

05:26.760 --> 05:28.880
 does that still give us the key

05:28.880 --> 05:30.740
 to understanding the human mind

05:30.740 --> 05:33.880
 and the emergence of all the beautiful complexity

05:33.880 --> 05:35.020
 we see around us?

05:35.020 --> 05:38.120
 That's not like when I see these objects

05:38.120 --> 05:41.480
 like I don't know if you've seen them like cellular automata

05:41.480 --> 05:44.920
 all these kinds of objects where the from simple rules

05:44.920 --> 05:48.920
 emerges complexity, it makes you wonder maybe

05:48.920 --> 05:52.400
 it's not reducible to simple beautiful equations

05:52.400 --> 05:54.900
 the whole thing only parts of it.

05:54.900 --> 05:57.680
 That's the tension I was getting at with the hope.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.240
 Well, when we say the universe is comprehensible

06:00.240 --> 06:04.980
 we have to kind of draw careful distinctions

06:04.980 --> 06:09.980
 about or definitions about what we mean by that.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.280
 Both the universe and the kind of and the comprehensive.

06:15.280 --> 06:20.280
 Exactly, right so the so in certain areas

06:22.160 --> 06:27.160
 of understanding reality we've made extraordinary progress

06:27.160 --> 06:32.160
 I would say in understanding fundamental physical processes

06:32.560 --> 06:35.780
 and getting very precise equations that really work

06:35.780 --> 06:40.560
 and allow us to do the profound sculpting of matter

06:40.560 --> 06:43.280
 to make computers and iPhones and everything else

06:43.280 --> 06:46.080
 and they really work and they're extraordinary productions

06:48.160 --> 06:51.720
 on the other but and that's all based

06:51.720 --> 06:53.120
 on the laws of quantum mechanics

06:53.120 --> 06:58.120
 and they really work and they give us tremendous control

06:59.760 --> 07:04.760
 of nature on the other hand as we get better answers

07:04.840 --> 07:07.260
 we can also ask more ambitious questions

07:07.260 --> 07:11.200
 and there are certainly things that have been observed

07:11.200 --> 07:15.360
 even in what would be usually called the realm of physics

07:15.360 --> 07:19.640
 that aren't understood for instance there seems to be

07:19.640 --> 07:21.840
 another source of mass in the universe

07:21.840 --> 07:25.120
 the so called dark matter that we don't know what it is

07:25.120 --> 07:29.600
 and it's a very interesting question what it is then

07:30.420 --> 07:34.040
 but also as you were alluding to there's it's one thing

07:34.040 --> 07:38.040
 to know the basic equations it's another thing

07:38.040 --> 07:42.280
 to be able to solve them in important cases

07:42.280 --> 07:45.520
 so we run up against the limits of that

07:45.520 --> 07:48.600
 in things like chemistry where we'd like to be able

07:48.600 --> 07:51.280
 to design molecules and predict their behavior

07:51.280 --> 07:54.480
 from the equations we think the equations could do that

07:54.480 --> 07:59.480
 in principle but in practice it's very challenging

07:59.880 --> 08:02.580
 to solve them in all but very simple cases

08:04.280 --> 08:07.200
 and then there's the other thing which is that a lot

08:07.200 --> 08:11.520
 of what we're interested in is historically conditioned

08:11.520 --> 08:15.460
 it's not a matter of the fundamental equations

08:15.460 --> 08:19.960
 but about what has evolved or come out

08:19.960 --> 08:23.640
 of the early universe and formed into people and frogs

08:23.640 --> 08:27.160
 and societies and things and the laws of physics

08:27.160 --> 08:30.160
 the basic laws of physics only take you so far

08:30.160 --> 08:32.680
 in that it kind of provides a foundation

08:32.680 --> 08:35.760
 but doesn't really that you need entirely different concepts

08:35.760 --> 08:39.780
 to deal with those kind of systems

08:39.780 --> 08:44.780
 and one thing I can say about that is that the laws

08:46.360 --> 08:48.920
 themselves point out their limitations

08:48.920 --> 08:53.360
 that they kind of their laws for dynamical evolution

08:53.360 --> 08:55.600
 so they tell you what happens if you have

08:55.600 --> 08:57.540
 a certain starting point but they don't tell you

08:57.540 --> 09:01.720
 what the starting point should be at least yeah

09:01.720 --> 09:05.000
 and the other thing that emerges

09:05.000 --> 09:09.600
 from the equations themselves is the phenomena

09:09.600 --> 09:14.600
 of chaos and sensitivity to initial conditions

09:14.600 --> 09:19.600
 which tells us that you have that there are intrinsic

09:20.760 --> 09:24.600
 limitations on how well we can spell out the consequences

09:24.600 --> 09:26.360
 of the laws if we try to apply them.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.900
 It's the old apple pie if you want to what is it

09:28.900 --> 09:32.520
 make an apple pie from scratch you have to build

09:32.520 --> 09:34.280
 the universe or something like that.

09:34.280 --> 09:37.280
 Well you're much better off starting with apples

09:37.280 --> 09:39.800
 than starting with quarks let's put it that way.

09:39.800 --> 09:42.320
 In your book A Beautiful Question you ask

09:42.320 --> 09:44.960
 does the world embody beautiful ideas?

09:44.960 --> 09:48.080
 So the book is centered around this very interesting

09:48.080 --> 09:50.520
 question it's like Shakespeare you can like dig in

09:50.520 --> 09:52.400
 and read into all the different interpretations

09:52.400 --> 09:56.280
 of this question but at the high level what to use

09:56.280 --> 09:59.520
 the connection between beauty of the world

09:59.520 --> 10:02.240
 and physics of the world.

10:02.240 --> 10:05.320
 In a sense we now have a lot of insight into what

10:05.320 --> 10:09.260
 the laws are the form they take that allow us

10:09.260 --> 10:13.080
 to understand matter in great depth and control it

10:13.080 --> 10:18.080
 as we've discussed and it's an extraordinary thing

10:19.460 --> 10:24.460
 how mathematically ideal those equations turn out to be.

10:26.620 --> 10:31.620
 In the early days of Greek philosophy Plato had this model

10:33.260 --> 10:37.020
 of atoms built out of the five perfectly symmetrical

10:37.020 --> 10:39.480
 platonic solids so there was somehow the idea

10:39.480 --> 10:44.000
 that mathematical symmetry should govern the world

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
 and we've out Platoed Plato by far in modern physics

10:49.040 --> 10:52.320
 because we have symmetries that are much more extensive

10:52.320 --> 10:56.720
 much more powerful that turn out to be the ingredients

10:56.720 --> 10:59.160
 out of which we construct our theory of the world

10:59.160 --> 11:04.160
 and it works and so that's certainly beautiful.

11:04.160 --> 11:09.160
 So the idea of symmetry which is a driving inspiration

11:13.840 --> 11:18.800
 in much of human art especially decorative art

11:18.800 --> 11:22.420
 like the Alhambra or wallpaper designs or things

11:22.420 --> 11:26.680
 you see around you everywhere also turns out to be

11:26.680 --> 11:30.480
 the dominant theme in modern fundamental physics

11:30.480 --> 11:33.500
 symmetry and its manifestations the laws turn out

11:33.500 --> 11:36.600
 to be very to have these tremendous amounts of symmetry

11:36.600 --> 11:38.920
 you can change the symbols and move them around

11:38.920 --> 11:42.420
 in different ways and they still have the same consequences.

11:45.180 --> 11:50.180
 So that's beautiful that these concepts that humans

11:59.040 --> 12:03.220
 find appealing also turn out to be the concepts

12:03.220 --> 12:05.660
 that govern how the world actually works.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.080
 I don't think that's an accident.

12:09.080 --> 12:13.720
 I think humans were evolved to be able to interact

12:13.720 --> 12:17.740
 with the world in ways that are advantageous

12:17.740 --> 12:21.600
 and to learn from it and so we are naturally evolved

12:21.600 --> 12:24.880
 or designed to enjoy beauty and it's a symmetry

12:24.880 --> 12:29.880
 and the world has it and that's why we resonate with it.

12:29.880 --> 12:33.180
 Well it's interesting that the ideas of symmetry

12:33.180 --> 12:38.180
 emerge at many levels of the hierarchy of the universe.

12:40.860 --> 12:44.420
 So you're talking about particles but it also is

12:44.420 --> 12:47.280
 at the level of chemistry and biology

12:47.280 --> 12:52.280
 and the fact that our cognitive sort of our perception

12:55.060 --> 12:59.060
 system and whatever our cognition is also finds

12:59.060 --> 13:02.980
 it appealing or somehow our sense of what is beautiful

13:02.980 --> 13:05.180
 is grounded in this idea of symmetry

13:05.180 --> 13:06.760
 or the breaking of symmetry.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.540
 Symmetry is at the core of our conception of beauty

13:09.540 --> 13:11.620
 whether it's the breaking or the non breaking

13:11.620 --> 13:12.980
 of the symmetry.

13:12.980 --> 13:16.400
 It makes you wonder why.

13:17.740 --> 13:18.580
 Why?

13:20.340 --> 13:23.780
 So I come from Russia and the question of Dostoevsky

13:23.780 --> 13:27.020
 he has said that beauty will save the world.

13:27.020 --> 13:29.540
 Maybe as a physicist you can tell me

13:29.540 --> 13:31.380
 what do you think he meant by that?

13:31.380 --> 13:32.980
 I don't know if it saves the world

13:32.980 --> 13:35.700
 but it does turn out to be a tremendous source

13:35.700 --> 13:37.500
 of insight into the world.

13:37.500 --> 13:42.500
 When we investigate kind of the most fundamental

13:42.840 --> 13:46.100
 interactions, things that are hard to access

13:46.100 --> 13:48.460
 because they occur at very short distances

13:48.460 --> 13:53.460
 between very special kinds of particles

13:53.460 --> 13:58.460
 whose properties are only revealed at high energies.

14:01.280 --> 14:04.000
 We don't have much to go on from everyday life

14:04.000 --> 14:06.600
 but so we have when we guess what the,

14:06.600 --> 14:08.640
 and the experiments are difficult to do

14:08.640 --> 14:13.640
 so you can't really follow a very wholly empirical procedure

14:14.760 --> 14:19.760
 to sort of in the Baconian style figure out the laws

14:20.140 --> 14:23.200
 kind of step by step just by accumulating a lot of data

14:23.200 --> 14:25.960
 what we actually do is guess.

14:25.960 --> 14:29.440
 And the guesses are kind of aesthetic really.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.540
 What would be a nice description

14:31.540 --> 14:34.180
 that's consistent with what we know

14:34.180 --> 14:36.320
 and then you try it out and see if it works

14:36.320 --> 14:41.320
 and by gosh it does in many profound cases.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.080
 So there's that but there's another source of symmetry

14:46.080 --> 14:51.080
 which I didn't talk so much about in a beautiful question

14:51.080 --> 14:56.080
 but does relate to your comments

14:56.880 --> 15:01.880
 and I think very much relates to the source of symmetry

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
 that we find in biology and in our heads, you know,

15:08.440 --> 15:13.440
 in our brain which is that, well it is discussed a bit

15:15.860 --> 15:20.480
 in a beautiful question and also in fundamentals

15:20.480 --> 15:25.480
 is that when you have, symmetry is also a very important

15:28.240 --> 15:30.340
 means of construction.

15:30.340 --> 15:34.540
 So when you have for instance simple viruses

15:34.540 --> 15:39.380
 that need to construct their coat, their protein coat,

15:39.380 --> 15:42.180
 the coats often take the form of platonic solids

15:43.500 --> 15:47.100
 and the reason is that the viruses are really dumb

15:47.100 --> 15:49.020
 and they only know how to do one thing

15:49.020 --> 15:51.620
 so they make a pentagon then they make another pentagon

15:51.620 --> 15:52.640
 and they make another pentagon

15:52.640 --> 15:55.420
 and they all glue together in the same way

15:55.420 --> 15:58.980
 and that makes a very symmetrical object sort of.

15:58.980 --> 16:02.060
 So the rules of development when you have simple rules

16:02.060 --> 16:07.060
 and they work again and again, you get symmetrical patterns.

16:07.060 --> 16:09.740
 That's kind of, in fact it's a recipe also

16:09.740 --> 16:14.740
 for generating fractals, like the kind of broccoli

16:14.740 --> 16:19.300
 that has all this internal structure

16:19.300 --> 16:20.740
 and I wish I had a picture to show

16:20.740 --> 16:23.740
 but maybe people remember it from the supermarket

16:26.660 --> 16:30.020
 and you say how did a vegetable get so intelligent

16:30.020 --> 16:31.620
 to make such a beautiful object

16:31.620 --> 16:33.480
 with all this fractal structure

16:33.480 --> 16:35.940
 and the secret is stupidity.

16:35.940 --> 16:38.560
 You just do the same thing over and over again

16:38.560 --> 16:43.100
 and in our brains also, you know, we came out,

16:43.100 --> 16:47.500
 we start from single cells and they reproduce

16:47.500 --> 16:51.840
 and each one does basically roughly the same thing.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.780
 The program evolves in time, of course,

16:56.780 --> 17:01.660
 different modules get turned on and off,

17:01.660 --> 17:03.460
 different regions of the genetic code

17:03.460 --> 17:06.700
 get turned on and off but basically,

17:06.700 --> 17:08.800
 a lot of the same things are going on

17:08.800 --> 17:09.740
 and they're simple things

17:09.740 --> 17:12.460
 and so you produce the same patterns over and over again

17:12.460 --> 17:14.540
 and that's a recipe for producing symmetry

17:14.540 --> 17:17.180
 because you're getting the same thing in many, many places

17:17.180 --> 17:20.860
 and if you look at, for instance,

17:20.860 --> 17:24.860
 the beautiful drawings of Roman Icahal,

17:24.860 --> 17:29.220
 the great neuroanatomist who drew the structure

17:29.220 --> 17:33.380
 of different organs like the hippocampus,

17:33.380 --> 17:37.860
 you see it's very regular and very intricate

17:37.860 --> 17:42.860
 and it's symmetry in that sense

17:43.940 --> 17:46.860
 because it's many repeated units

17:46.860 --> 17:49.620
 that you can take from one place to the other

17:49.620 --> 17:51.860
 and see that they look more or less the same.

17:51.860 --> 17:54.300
 But what you're describing, this kind of beauty

17:54.300 --> 17:58.940
 that we're talking about now is a very small sample

17:58.940 --> 18:01.860
 in terms of space time in a very big world

18:01.860 --> 18:06.860
 in a very short, brief moment in this long history.

18:08.260 --> 18:11.420
 In your book, Fundamentals, 10 Keys to Reality,

18:11.420 --> 18:13.460
 I'd really recommend people read it.

18:14.580 --> 18:19.580
 You say that space and time are pretty big or very big.

18:20.340 --> 18:21.660
 How big are we talking about?

18:21.660 --> 18:26.660
 Can you tell a brief history of space and time?

18:26.660 --> 18:30.660
 It's easy to tell a brief history, but the details get very

18:30.660 --> 18:33.780
 involved, of course, but one thing I'd like to say

18:33.780 --> 18:37.140
 is that if you take a broad enough view,

18:37.140 --> 18:38.820
 the history of the universe is simpler

18:38.820 --> 18:40.660
 than the history of Sweden, say,

18:40.660 --> 18:43.900
 because your standards are lower.

18:45.900 --> 18:49.620
 But just to make it quantitative,

18:49.620 --> 18:51.500
 I'll just give a few highlights.

18:51.500 --> 18:55.500
 And it's a little bit easier to talk about time,

18:55.500 --> 18:57.420
 so let's start with that.

18:57.420 --> 19:00.100
 The Big Bang occurred, we think.

19:00.100 --> 19:03.820
 The universe was much hotter and denser and more uniform

19:03.820 --> 19:07.060
 about 13.8 billion years ago,

19:07.060 --> 19:08.860
 and that's what we call the Big Bang.

19:10.740 --> 19:12.540
 And it's been expanding and cooling,

19:12.540 --> 19:16.100
 the matter in it has been expanding and cooling ever since.

19:16.100 --> 19:20.660
 So in a real sense, the universe is 13.8 billion years old.

19:20.660 --> 19:24.060
 That's a big number, kind of hard to think about.

19:24.060 --> 19:26.260
 A nice way to think about it, though,

19:26.260 --> 19:29.260
 is to map it onto one year.

19:29.260 --> 19:32.980
 So let's say the universe just linearly mapped

19:32.980 --> 19:37.620
 the time intervals from 13.8 billion years onto one year.

19:37.620 --> 19:42.620
 So the Big Bang then is on January 1st at 12 a.m.

19:43.980 --> 19:48.980
 And you wait for quite a long time

19:49.980 --> 19:51.660
 before the dinosaurs emerge.

19:51.660 --> 19:55.100
 The dinosaurs emerge on Christmas, it turns out.

19:55.100 --> 19:55.940
 And...

19:55.940 --> 19:57.900
 12 months, almost 12 months later.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.220
 Getting close to the end, yes.

19:59.220 --> 20:01.060
 Getting close to the end.

20:01.060 --> 20:05.580
 And the extinction event that let the mammals

20:05.580 --> 20:08.900
 and ultimately humans inherit the Earth

20:08.900 --> 20:13.540
 from the dinosaurs occurred on December 30th.

20:13.540 --> 20:18.380
 And all of human history is a small part of the last day.

20:18.380 --> 20:23.380
 And so, yes, so we're occupying only,

20:23.380 --> 20:26.860
 and a human lifetime is a very, very infinitesimal part

20:26.860 --> 20:31.860
 of this interval of these gigantic cosmic reaches of time.

20:35.300 --> 20:39.300
 And in space, we can tell a very similar story.

20:39.300 --> 20:44.300
 In fact, it's convenient to think that the size

20:44.300 --> 20:48.820
 of the universe is the distance that light can travel

20:48.820 --> 20:50.700
 in 13.8 billion years.

20:50.700 --> 20:54.420
 So it's 13.8 billion light years.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.940
 That's how far you can see out.

20:56.940 --> 21:01.380
 That's how far signals can reach us.

21:01.380 --> 21:06.380
 And that is a big distance.

21:06.380 --> 21:13.380
 That is a big distance because compared to that, the Earth

21:14.780 --> 21:18.180
 is a fraction of a light second.

21:18.180 --> 21:21.580
 So again, it's really, really big.

21:21.580 --> 21:26.580
 And so if we wanna think about the universe

21:27.020 --> 21:29.380
 as a whole in space and time,

21:30.420 --> 21:35.060
 we really need a different kind of imagination.

21:35.060 --> 21:38.860
 It's not something you can grasp

21:41.900 --> 21:44.380
 in terms of psychological time in a useful way.

21:44.380 --> 21:47.460
 You have to think, you have to use exponential notation

21:47.460 --> 21:51.820
 and abstract concepts to really get any hold

21:51.820 --> 21:54.980
 on these vast times and spaces.

21:56.340 --> 21:58.140
 On the other hand, let me hasten to add

21:58.140 --> 22:00.460
 that that doesn't make us small

22:00.460 --> 22:05.460
 or make the time that we have to us small.

22:06.900 --> 22:10.660
 Because again, looking at those pictures

22:10.660 --> 22:15.500
 of what our minds are and some of the components

22:15.500 --> 22:18.620
 of our minds, these beautiful drawings

22:18.620 --> 22:21.180
 of the cellular patterns inside the brain,

22:21.180 --> 22:24.820
 you see that there are many, many, many processing units.

22:24.820 --> 22:29.740
 And if you analyze how fast they operate,

22:29.740 --> 22:31.660
 I tried to estimate how many thoughts

22:31.660 --> 22:33.340
 a person can have in a lifetime.

22:33.340 --> 22:34.740
 That's kind of a fuzzy question,

22:34.740 --> 22:36.740
 but I'm very proud that I was able

22:36.740 --> 22:39.460
 to define it pretty precisely.

22:39.460 --> 22:43.620
 And it turns out we have time for billions

22:43.620 --> 22:46.940
 of meaningful thoughts in a lifetime.

22:46.940 --> 22:48.540
 So it's a lot.

22:48.540 --> 22:51.820
 We shouldn't think of ourselves as terribly small

22:51.820 --> 22:53.300
 either in space or in time,

22:53.300 --> 22:57.460
 because although we're small in those dimensions

22:57.460 --> 23:01.380
 compared to the universe, we're large compared

23:01.380 --> 23:05.980
 to meaningful units of processing information

23:05.980 --> 23:10.200
 and being able to conceptualize and understand things.

23:11.620 --> 23:15.100
 Yeah, but 99% of those thoughts are probably food,

23:15.100 --> 23:16.820
 sex, or internet related.

23:16.820 --> 23:20.540
 Well, yeah, well, they're not necessarily, that's right.

23:20.540 --> 23:24.100
 Only like point one is Nobel Prize winning ideas.

23:24.100 --> 23:26.340
 That's true, but there's more to life

23:26.340 --> 23:27.740
 than winning Nobel Prizes.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.860
 How did you do that calculate?

23:29.860 --> 23:31.380
 Can you maybe break that apart a little bit,

23:31.380 --> 23:34.020
 just kind of for fun, sort of an intuition

23:34.020 --> 23:35.940
 of how we calculate the number of thoughts?

23:35.940 --> 23:37.900
 The number of thoughts, right.

23:37.900 --> 23:40.940
 It's necessarily imprecise because a lot of things

23:40.940 --> 23:43.260
 are going on in different ways and what is a thought.

23:43.260 --> 23:45.900
 But there are several things that point

23:45.900 --> 23:50.900
 to more or less the same rate of being able

23:50.900 --> 23:52.700
 to have meaningful thoughts.

23:52.700 --> 23:57.700
 For instance, the one that I think is maybe

23:57.700 --> 24:01.420
 the most penetrating is how fast

24:01.420 --> 24:04.420
 we can process visual images.

24:04.420 --> 24:05.720
 How do we do that?

24:07.820 --> 24:11.380
 If you've ever watched old movies,

24:11.380 --> 24:15.700
 you can see that, well, any movie, in fact,

24:15.700 --> 24:18.080
 a motion picture is really not a motion picture.

24:18.080 --> 24:20.540
 It's a series of snapshots that are playing

24:20.540 --> 24:25.120
 one after the other and it's because our brains

24:25.120 --> 24:26.540
 also work that way.

24:26.540 --> 24:29.940
 We take snapshots of the world, integrate over a certain time

24:29.940 --> 24:33.500
 and then go on to the next one and then by post processing,

24:33.500 --> 24:37.020
 create the illusion of continuity and flow,

24:37.020 --> 24:38.380
 we can deal with that.

24:38.380 --> 24:43.380
 And if the flicker rate is too slow,

24:44.540 --> 24:48.640
 then you start to see that it's a series of snapshots

24:48.640 --> 24:51.060
 and you can ask, what is the crossover?

24:51.060 --> 24:53.100
 When does it change from being something

24:53.100 --> 24:57.440
 that is matched to our processing speed versus too fast?

24:57.440 --> 25:00.460
 And it turns out about 40 per second.

25:00.460 --> 25:04.820
 And then if you take 40 per second as how well,

25:04.820 --> 25:06.900
 how fast we can process visual images,

25:06.900 --> 25:09.460
 you get to several billions of thoughts.

25:10.820 --> 25:14.700
 If you, similarly, if you ask what are some

25:14.700 --> 25:16.980
 of the fastest things that people can do?

25:16.980 --> 25:18.700
 Well, they can play video games,

25:18.700 --> 25:22.500
 they can play the piano very fast if they're skilled at it.

25:22.500 --> 25:25.320
 And again, you get to similar units

25:25.320 --> 25:27.260
 or how fast can people talk?

25:27.260 --> 25:28.420
 You get to similar, you know,

25:28.420 --> 25:30.140
 within a couple of orders of magnitude,

25:30.140 --> 25:33.020
 you get more or less to the same idea.

25:33.020 --> 25:38.020
 So that's how you can say that there's billions

25:38.660 --> 25:40.780
 of meaningful, there's room for billions

25:40.780 --> 25:42.140
 of meaningful thoughts.

25:42.140 --> 25:47.140
 I won't argue for exactly two billion versus 1.8 billion.

25:47.620 --> 25:49.100
 It's not that kind of question,

25:49.100 --> 25:52.820
 but I think any estimate that's reasonable

25:52.820 --> 25:57.820
 will come out within, say, 100 billion and 100 million.

25:58.180 --> 25:59.880
 So it's a lot.

26:01.700 --> 26:04.140
 It would be interesting to map out

26:04.140 --> 26:07.300
 for an individual human being the landscape of thoughts

26:07.300 --> 26:09.320
 that they've sort of traveled.

26:09.320 --> 26:12.960
 If you think of thoughts as a set of trajectories,

26:14.340 --> 26:16.400
 what that landscape looks like.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.620
 I mean, I've been recently really thinking

26:19.620 --> 26:24.620
 about this Richard Dawkins idea of memes

26:24.780 --> 26:27.840
 and just all this ideas and the evolution of ideas

26:27.840 --> 26:29.900
 inside of one particular human mind

26:30.780 --> 26:33.740
 and how they're then changed and evolved

26:33.740 --> 26:36.520
 by interaction with other human beings.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.100
 It's interesting to think about.

26:38.100 --> 26:41.500
 So if you think the number is billions,

26:41.500 --> 26:44.340
 you think there's also social interaction.

26:44.340 --> 26:48.660
 So these aren't like there's interaction

26:48.660 --> 26:50.740
 in the same way you have interaction with particles.

26:50.740 --> 26:53.500
 There's interaction between human thoughts

26:53.500 --> 26:56.380
 that perhaps that interaction in itself

26:56.380 --> 26:59.140
 is fundamental to the process of thinking.

26:59.140 --> 27:01.380
 Like without social interaction,

27:01.380 --> 27:04.100
 we would be like stuck, like walking in a circle.

27:04.100 --> 27:07.380
 We need the perturbation of other humans

27:07.380 --> 27:09.620
 to create change and evolution.

27:09.620 --> 27:13.300
 Once you bring in concepts of interactions

27:13.300 --> 27:15.880
 and correlations and relations,

27:15.880 --> 27:19.220
 then you have what's called a combinatorial explosion

27:20.260 --> 27:24.300
 that the number of possibilities expands exponentially

27:24.300 --> 27:28.900
 technically with the number of things you're considering.

27:28.900 --> 27:33.900
 And it can easily rapidly outstrip these billions

27:34.700 --> 27:36.740
 of thoughts that we're talking about.

27:36.740 --> 27:41.700
 So we definitely cannot by brute force

27:41.700 --> 27:44.460
 master complex situations

27:45.500 --> 27:48.920
 or think of all the possibilities in a complex situations.

27:48.920 --> 27:52.500
 I mean, even something as relatively simple as chess

27:53.500 --> 27:56.300
 is still something that human beings

27:56.300 --> 27:57.860
 can't comprehend completely.

27:57.860 --> 28:00.940
 Even the best players lose, still sometimes lose

28:00.940 --> 28:05.140
 and they consistently lose to computers these days.

28:05.140 --> 28:08.860
 And in computer science, there's a concept of NP complete.

28:08.860 --> 28:12.260
 So large classes of problems when you scale them up

28:12.260 --> 28:16.100
 beyond a few individuals become intractable.

28:16.100 --> 28:21.020
 And so that in that sense, the world is inexhaustible.

28:21.020 --> 28:25.920
 And that makes it beautiful that we can make any laws

28:25.920 --> 28:29.660
 that generalize efficiently and well

28:29.660 --> 28:32.780
 can compress all of that combinatorial complexity

28:32.780 --> 28:33.980
 just like a simple rule.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.380
 That in itself is beautiful.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.660
 It's a happy situation.

28:36.660 --> 28:41.660
 And I think that we can find general principles

28:43.300 --> 28:45.780
 of sort of of the operating system

28:45.780 --> 28:49.940
 that are comprehensible, simple, extremely powerful

28:49.940 --> 28:52.740
 and let us control things very well

28:52.740 --> 28:55.460
 and ask profound questions.

28:55.460 --> 28:56.380
 And on the other hand,

28:56.380 --> 28:59.100
 that the world is going to be inexhaustible.

28:59.100 --> 29:03.300
 That once we start asking about relationships

29:03.300 --> 29:06.940
 and how they evolve and social interactions

29:06.940 --> 29:10.620
 and we'll never have a theory of everything

29:10.620 --> 29:13.580
 in any meaningful sense because that.

29:13.580 --> 29:16.620
 Of everything, everything, truly everything is.

29:17.860 --> 29:19.940
 Can I ask you about the Big Bang?

29:19.940 --> 29:23.460
 So we talked about the space and time are really big.

29:24.380 --> 29:27.780
 But then, and we humans give a lot of meaning

29:27.780 --> 29:32.780
 to the word space and time in our like daily lives.

29:33.660 --> 29:37.300
 But then can we talk about this moment of beginning

29:37.300 --> 29:39.340
 and how we're supposed to think about it?

29:40.480 --> 29:42.460
 That at the moment of the Big Bang,

29:42.460 --> 29:46.660
 everything was what, like infinitely small

29:46.660 --> 29:48.740
 and then it just blew up?

29:48.740 --> 29:49.820
 We have to be careful here

29:49.820 --> 29:53.480
 because there's a common misconception

29:53.480 --> 29:58.480
 that the Big Bang is like the explosion of a bomb

29:58.580 --> 30:02.980
 in empty space that fills up the surrounding place.

30:02.980 --> 30:03.940
 It is space.

30:03.940 --> 30:05.300
 It is, yeah.

30:05.300 --> 30:08.960
 As we understand it, it's the fact,

30:08.960 --> 30:12.260
 it's the fact or the hypothesis,

30:12.260 --> 30:14.820
 but well supported up to a point

30:14.820 --> 30:19.820
 that everywhere in the whole universe,

30:19.820 --> 30:23.180
 early in the history,

30:24.180 --> 30:28.140
 matter came together into a very hot, very dense,

30:28.140 --> 30:29.940
 if you run it backwards in time,

30:29.940 --> 30:32.740
 matter comes together into a very hot, very dense

30:32.740 --> 30:36.260
 and yet very homogeneous plasma

30:36.260 --> 30:39.500
 of all the different kinds of elementary particles

30:39.500 --> 30:41.260
 and quarks and anti quarks and gluons

30:41.260 --> 30:43.340
 and photons and electrons and anti electrons,

30:43.340 --> 30:45.160
 everything, all of that stuff.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.940
 Like really hot.

30:46.940 --> 30:49.140
 Really, really, really hot.

30:49.140 --> 30:52.100
 We're talking about way, way hotter

30:52.100 --> 30:53.660
 than the surface of the sun.

30:56.140 --> 31:00.660
 Well, in fact, if you take the equations as they come,

31:00.660 --> 31:02.940
 the prediction is that the temperature

31:02.940 --> 31:04.020
 just goes to infinity,

31:04.020 --> 31:06.920
 but then the equations break down.

31:06.920 --> 31:10.620
 We don't really, there are various,

31:10.620 --> 31:12.980
 the equations become infinity equals infinity,

31:12.980 --> 31:15.120
 so they don't feel that it's called a singularity.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.240
 We don't really know.

31:16.240 --> 31:19.660
 This is running the equations backwards,

31:19.660 --> 31:21.780
 so you can't really get a sensible idea

31:21.780 --> 31:23.940
 of what happened before the Big Bang.

31:23.940 --> 31:25.660
 So we need different equations

31:25.660 --> 31:28.380
 to address the very earliest moments.

31:31.580 --> 31:35.660
 But so things were hotter and denser.

31:35.660 --> 31:40.140
 We don't really know why things started out that way.

31:40.140 --> 31:43.980
 We have a lot of evidence that they did start out that way.

31:43.980 --> 31:47.840
 But since most of the,

31:51.180 --> 31:55.420
 we don't get to visit there and do controlled experiments.

31:55.420 --> 31:59.580
 Most of the record is very, very processed

31:59.580 --> 32:04.580
 and we have to use very subtle techniques

32:05.560 --> 32:09.500
 and powerful instruments to get information

32:09.500 --> 32:11.140
 that has survived.

32:11.140 --> 32:14.220
 Get closer and closer to the Big Bang.

32:14.220 --> 32:16.460
 Get closer and closer to the beginning of things.

32:16.460 --> 32:21.460
 And what's revealed there is that, as I said,

32:22.900 --> 32:25.180
 there undoubtedly was a period

32:25.180 --> 32:26.940
 when everything in the universe

32:26.940 --> 32:30.900
 that we have been able to look at and understand,

32:30.900 --> 32:33.420
 and that's consistent with everything,

32:33.420 --> 32:41.420
 is in a condition where it was much, much hotter

32:41.420 --> 32:43.020
 and much, much denser,

32:44.220 --> 32:46.340
 but still obeying the laws of physics

32:46.340 --> 32:48.180
 as we know them today.

32:48.180 --> 32:51.100
 And then you start with that.

32:51.100 --> 32:53.180
 So all the matter is in equilibrium.

32:54.300 --> 32:57.960
 And then with small quantum fluctuations

32:57.960 --> 32:59.460
 and run it forward,

32:59.460 --> 33:04.020
 and then it produces, at least in broad strokes,

33:04.020 --> 33:06.620
 the universe we see around us today.

33:06.620 --> 33:09.180
 Do you think we'll ever be able to,

33:09.180 --> 33:12.640
 with the tools of physics, with the way science is,

33:12.640 --> 33:14.020
 with the way the human mind is,

33:14.020 --> 33:17.700
 we'll ever be able to get to the moment of the Big Bang

33:17.700 --> 33:21.700
 in our understanding or even the moment before the Big Bang?

33:21.700 --> 33:24.700
 Can we understand what happened before the Big Bang?

33:24.700 --> 33:29.700
 I'm optimistic both that we'll be able to measure more,

33:31.620 --> 33:33.460
 so observe more,

33:33.460 --> 33:36.640
 and that we'll be able to figure out more.

33:36.640 --> 33:40.660
 So they're very, very tangible prospects

33:40.660 --> 33:45.660
 for observing the extremely early universe,

33:45.660 --> 33:48.540
 so even much earlier than we can observe now

33:49.420 --> 33:52.220
 through looking at gravitational waves.

33:52.220 --> 33:55.700
 Gravitational waves, since they interact so weakly

33:55.700 --> 33:57.340
 with ordinary matter,

33:58.820 --> 34:03.660
 sort of send a minimally processed signal from the Big Bang.

34:03.660 --> 34:05.860
 It's a very weak signal

34:05.860 --> 34:07.380
 because it's traveled a long way

34:07.380 --> 34:09.460
 and diffused over long spaces,

34:09.460 --> 34:13.360
 but people are gearing up to try to detect

34:13.360 --> 34:15.220
 gravitational waves that could have come

34:15.220 --> 34:16.340
 from the early universe.

34:16.340 --> 34:19.140
 Yeah, LIGO's an incredible engineering project.

34:19.140 --> 34:24.140
 It's the most sensitive, precise devices on Earth.

34:24.660 --> 34:27.500
 The fact that humans can build something like that

34:27.500 --> 34:31.340
 is truly awe inspiring from an engineering perspective.

34:31.340 --> 34:34.820
 Right, but these gravitational waves from the early universe

34:34.820 --> 34:38.420
 will probably be of a much longer wavelength

34:38.420 --> 34:41.500
 than LIGO is capable of sensing,

34:41.500 --> 34:44.620
 so there's a beautiful project

34:44.620 --> 34:49.620
 that's contemplated to put lasers

34:51.120 --> 34:54.980
 in different locations in the solar system.

34:54.980 --> 34:56.420
 We really, really separate it

34:56.420 --> 34:59.900
 by solar system scale differences,

34:59.900 --> 35:03.400
 like artificial planets or moons in different places

35:03.400 --> 35:06.060
 and see the tiny motions of those

35:06.060 --> 35:07.220
 relative to one another

35:07.220 --> 35:10.100
 as a signal of radiation from the Big Bang.

35:10.100 --> 35:15.100
 We can also maybe indirectly see the imprint

35:15.300 --> 35:18.340
 of gravitational waves from the early universe

35:18.340 --> 35:23.040
 on the photons, the microwave background radiation.

35:23.040 --> 35:27.240
 That is our present way of seeing into the earliest universe,

35:27.240 --> 35:31.180
 but those photons interact much more strongly with matter.

35:31.180 --> 35:32.980
 They're much more strongly processed,

35:32.980 --> 35:37.980
 so they don't give us directly such an unprocessed view

35:37.980 --> 35:41.100
 of the early universe, of the very early universe,

35:41.100 --> 35:45.700
 but if gravitational waves leave some imprint on that

35:45.700 --> 35:49.380
 as they move through, we could detect that too,

35:49.380 --> 35:53.180
 and people are trying, as we speak,

35:53.180 --> 35:56.860
 working very hard towards that goal.

35:56.860 --> 35:58.980
 It's so exciting to think about a sensor

35:58.980 --> 36:01.180
 the size of the solar system.

36:01.180 --> 36:03.180
 That would be a fantastic,

36:03.180 --> 36:06.100
 I mean, that would be a pinnacle artifact

36:06.100 --> 36:08.100
 of human endeavor to me.

36:08.100 --> 36:11.900
 It would be such an inspiring thing

36:11.900 --> 36:14.220
 that just we want to know,

36:15.140 --> 36:17.460
 and we go to these extraordinary lengths

36:17.460 --> 36:20.860
 of making gigantic things that are also very sophisticated

36:20.860 --> 36:22.260
 because what you're trying to do,

36:22.260 --> 36:24.960
 you have to understand how they move.

36:24.960 --> 36:28.020
 You have to understand the properties of light

36:28.020 --> 36:30.900
 that are being used, the interference between light,

36:30.900 --> 36:34.180
 and you have to be able to make the light with lasers

36:34.180 --> 36:35.740
 and understand the quantum theory

36:35.740 --> 36:38.300
 and get the timing exactly right.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.100
 It's an extraordinary endeavor

36:40.100 --> 36:42.100
 involving all kinds of knowledge

36:42.100 --> 36:45.100
 from the very small to the very large,

36:45.100 --> 36:49.060
 and all in the service of curiosity

36:49.060 --> 36:51.380
 and built on a grand scale, so.

36:52.540 --> 36:57.540
 Yeah, it would make me proud to be a human if we did that.

36:58.340 --> 37:01.340
 I love that you're inspired both by the power of theory

37:01.340 --> 37:02.580
 and the power of experiment.

37:02.580 --> 37:07.580
 So both, I think, are exceptionally impressive

37:07.860 --> 37:10.500
 that the human mind can come up with theories

37:10.500 --> 37:13.200
 that give us a peek into how the universe works,

37:13.200 --> 37:16.900
 but also construct tools that are way bigger

37:16.900 --> 37:20.720
 than the evolutionary origins we came from.

37:20.720 --> 37:22.060
 Right, and by the way,

37:22.060 --> 37:25.740
 the fact that we can design such things and they work

37:25.740 --> 37:28.200
 is an extraordinary demonstration

37:28.200 --> 37:30.620
 that we really do understand a lot.

37:30.620 --> 37:33.260
 And then in some ways.

37:33.260 --> 37:36.220
 And it's our ability to answer questions

37:36.220 --> 37:37.820
 that also leads us to be able

37:37.820 --> 37:39.820
 to address more ambitious questions.

37:39.820 --> 37:44.180
 So you mentioned at the Big Bang in the early days,

37:45.140 --> 37:46.860
 things are pretty homogeneous.

37:46.860 --> 37:47.820
 Yes.

37:47.820 --> 37:51.660
 But here we are, sitting on Earth,

37:51.660 --> 37:56.660
 two hairless apes, you could say, with microphones.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.820
 In talking about the brief history of things,

37:58.820 --> 38:00.780
 you said it's much harder to describe Sweden

38:00.780 --> 38:03.780
 than it is the universe.

38:03.780 --> 38:05.340
 So there's a lot of complexity.

38:05.340 --> 38:07.420
 There was a lot of interesting details here.

38:07.420 --> 38:11.260
 So how does this complexity come to be, do you think?

38:11.260 --> 38:13.500
 It seems like there's these pockets.

38:13.500 --> 38:14.340
 Yeah.

38:14.340 --> 38:18.840
 We don't know how rare of like where hairless apes emerge.

38:18.840 --> 38:19.680
 Yeah.

38:19.680 --> 38:22.100
 And then that came from the initial soup

38:22.100 --> 38:23.500
 that was homogeneous.

38:23.500 --> 38:26.460
 Was that an accident?

38:26.460 --> 38:31.460
 Well, we understand in broad outlines

38:31.620 --> 38:33.660
 how it could happen.

38:33.660 --> 38:36.380
 We certainly don't understand why it happened exactly

38:36.380 --> 38:37.300
 in the way it did.

38:40.180 --> 38:42.620
 Or there are certainly open questions

38:42.620 --> 38:44.120
 about the origins of life

38:44.120 --> 38:47.940
 and how inevitable the emergence of intelligence was

38:47.940 --> 38:48.940
 and how that happened.

38:48.940 --> 38:52.180
 But in the very broadest terms,

38:52.180 --> 38:57.180
 the universe early on was quite homogeneous,

38:58.020 --> 39:00.160
 but not completely homogeneous.

39:01.020 --> 39:06.020
 There were part in 10,000 fluctuations in density

39:07.060 --> 39:09.540
 within this primordial plasma.

39:10.580 --> 39:15.580
 And as time goes on, there's an instability

39:16.860 --> 39:20.140
 which causes those density contrasts to increase.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.700
 There's a gravitational instability

39:21.700 --> 39:24.620
 where it's denser, the gravitational attractions

39:24.620 --> 39:25.580
 are stronger.

39:25.580 --> 39:27.300
 And so that brings in more matter

39:27.300 --> 39:29.780
 and it gets even denser and so on and so on.

39:29.780 --> 39:34.380
 So there's a natural tendency of matter to clump

39:34.380 --> 39:37.180
 because of gravitational interactions.

39:37.180 --> 39:39.860
 And then the equation is complicated.

39:39.860 --> 39:42.900
 We have lots of things clumping together.

39:43.980 --> 39:47.060
 Then we know what the laws are,

39:47.060 --> 39:50.020
 but we have to a certain extent wave our hands

39:50.020 --> 39:51.900
 about what happens.

39:51.900 --> 39:56.220
 But basic understanding of chemistry

39:56.220 --> 40:00.140
 says that if things and the physics of radiation

40:00.140 --> 40:02.840
 tells us that as things start to clump together,

40:02.840 --> 40:05.540
 they can radiate, give off some energy.

40:05.540 --> 40:07.900
 So they don't just, they slow down.

40:07.900 --> 40:09.300
 As a result, they lose energy.

40:09.300 --> 40:12.340
 They can collaborate together, cool down,

40:12.340 --> 40:16.220
 form things like stars, form things like planets.

40:16.220 --> 40:19.260
 And so in broad terms, there's no mystery.

40:19.260 --> 40:22.300
 There's, that's what the scenario,

40:22.300 --> 40:25.580
 that's what the equations tell you should happen.

40:25.580 --> 40:30.580
 But because it's a process involving

40:30.580 --> 40:33.720
 many, many fundamental individual units,

40:37.100 --> 40:40.620
 the application of the laws that govern individual units

40:40.620 --> 40:44.740
 to these things is very delicate,

40:46.100 --> 40:48.220
 computationally very difficult.

40:48.220 --> 40:52.020
 And more profoundly, the equations have

40:52.020 --> 40:54.260
 this probability of chaos or sensitivity

40:54.260 --> 40:57.380
 to initial conditions, which tells you tiny differences

40:57.380 --> 41:00.700
 in the initial state can lead to enormous differences

41:00.700 --> 41:02.440
 in the subsequent behavior.

41:02.440 --> 41:07.440
 So physics, fundamental physics at some point says,

41:08.340 --> 41:11.760
 okay, chemists, biologists, this is your problem.

41:11.760 --> 41:16.680
 And then again, in broad terms,

41:16.680 --> 41:21.680
 we know how it's conceivable that the humans

41:23.100 --> 41:28.140
 and things like that, how complex structure can emerge.

41:28.140 --> 41:33.140
 It's a matter of having the right kind of temperature

41:34.040 --> 41:36.300
 and the right kind of stuff.

41:36.300 --> 41:41.300
 So you need to be able to make chemical bonds

41:41.300 --> 41:42.860
 that are reasonably stable

41:42.860 --> 41:45.380
 and be able to make complex structures.

41:45.380 --> 41:48.700
 And we're very fortunate that carbon has this ability

41:48.700 --> 41:53.700
 to make backbones and elaborate branchings and things.

41:54.220 --> 41:57.580
 So you can get complex things that we call biochemistry.

41:57.580 --> 42:01.140
 And yet the bonds can be broken a little bit

42:01.140 --> 42:04.760
 with the help of energetic injections from the sun.

42:04.760 --> 42:07.440
 So you have to have both the possibility of changing,

42:07.440 --> 42:10.580
 but also the useful degree of stability.

42:10.580 --> 42:15.580
 And we know at that very, very broad level, physics

42:15.820 --> 42:17.780
 can tell you that it's conceivable.

42:17.780 --> 42:22.780
 If you want to know what really happened,

42:23.140 --> 42:26.260
 what really can happen, then you have to work a bit,

42:26.260 --> 42:27.100
 go to chemistry.

42:27.100 --> 42:29.820
 If you want to know what actually happened,

42:29.820 --> 42:32.260
 then you really have to consult the fossil record

42:32.260 --> 42:33.220
 and biologists.

42:33.220 --> 42:38.220
 And so these ways of addressing the issue

42:41.220 --> 42:43.400
 are complimentary in a sense.

42:43.400 --> 42:48.400
 They use different kinds of concepts,

42:49.660 --> 42:52.480
 they use different languages

42:52.480 --> 42:54.340
 and they address different kinds of questions,

42:54.340 --> 42:59.340
 but they're not inconsistent, they're just complimentary.

42:59.340 --> 43:03.740
 It's kind of interesting to think about those early fluctuations

43:03.740 --> 43:07.140
 as our earliest ancestors.

43:07.140 --> 43:08.180
 Yes, that's right.

43:08.180 --> 43:13.180
 So it's amazing to think that this is the modern answer

43:15.900 --> 43:20.900
 to the, or the modern version of what the Hindu philosophers

43:24.100 --> 43:25.740
 had, that art thou.

43:25.740 --> 43:30.480
 If you ask what, okay, those little quantum fluctuations

43:30.480 --> 43:34.480
 in the early universe are the seeds out of which complexity,

43:36.380 --> 43:40.900
 including plausibly humans, really evolve.

43:40.900 --> 43:42.260
 You don't need anything else.

43:42.260 --> 43:47.260
 That brings up the question of asking for a friend here

43:47.260 --> 43:52.140
 if there's other pockets of complexity,

43:52.140 --> 43:57.140
 commonly called as alien intelligent civilizations out there.

43:59.420 --> 44:00.900
 Well, we don't know for sure,

44:00.900 --> 44:05.740
 but I have a strong suspicion that the answer is yes

44:05.740 --> 44:10.740
 because the one case we do have at hand to study

44:13.500 --> 44:17.720
 here on Earth, we sort of know what the conditions were

44:17.720 --> 44:18.880
 that were helpful to life,

44:18.880 --> 44:21.700
 the right kind of temperature, the right kind of star

44:21.700 --> 44:24.260
 that keeps, maintains that temperature for a long time,

44:24.260 --> 44:26.420
 the liquid environment of water.

44:28.420 --> 44:33.420
 And once those conditions emerged on Earth,

44:33.800 --> 44:36.060
 which was roughly four and a half billion years ago,

44:36.060 --> 44:39.700
 it wasn't very long before what we call life

44:39.700 --> 44:41.580
 started to leave relics.

44:41.580 --> 44:46.580
 So we can find forms of life, primitive forms of life

44:47.060 --> 44:49.980
 that are almost as old as the Earth itself

44:49.980 --> 44:54.980
 in the sense that once the Earth was turned

44:55.180 --> 44:58.660
 from a very hot boiling thing

44:58.660 --> 45:02.340
 and cooled off into a solid mass with water,

45:02.340 --> 45:03.940
 life emerged very, very quickly.

45:03.940 --> 45:07.820
 So it seems that these general conditions for life

45:09.180 --> 45:13.860
 are enough to make it happen relatively quickly.

45:13.860 --> 45:18.860
 Now, the other lesson I think that one can draw

45:21.500 --> 45:24.580
 from this one example, it's dangerous to draw lessons

45:24.580 --> 45:27.620
 from one example, but that's all we've got,

45:27.620 --> 45:32.020
 and that the emergence of intelligent life

45:32.020 --> 45:34.220
 is a different issue altogether.

45:35.340 --> 45:40.340
 That took a long time and seems to have been

45:40.340 --> 45:45.340
 pretty contingent for a long time.

45:47.300 --> 45:50.580
 Well, for most of the history of life,

45:50.580 --> 45:54.060
 it was single celled things.

45:55.060 --> 45:58.020
 Even multicellular life only rose

45:58.020 --> 46:01.620
 about 600 million years ago, so much after.

46:01.620 --> 46:06.620
 And then intelligence is kind of a luxury.

46:12.540 --> 46:17.540
 Many more kinds of creatures have big stomachs

46:18.100 --> 46:20.220
 than big brains.

46:20.220 --> 46:25.180
 In fact, most have no brains at all in any reasonable sense.

46:25.180 --> 46:30.140
 And the dinosaurs ruled for a long, long time

46:30.140 --> 46:31.500
 and some of them were pretty smart,

46:31.500 --> 46:35.300
 but they were at best bird brains

46:35.300 --> 46:37.700
 because birds came from the dinosaurs.

46:37.700 --> 46:41.540
 And it could have stayed that way.

46:41.540 --> 46:46.260
 And then the emergence of humans was very contingent

46:46.260 --> 46:49.620
 and kind of a very, very recent development

46:49.620 --> 46:51.900
 on evolutionary timescales.

46:51.900 --> 46:55.100
 And you can argue about the level of human intelligence,

46:55.100 --> 46:58.460
 but I think that's what we're talking about.

46:58.460 --> 47:02.260
 It's very impressive and can ask these kinds of questions

47:02.260 --> 47:04.020
 and discuss them intelligently.

47:07.020 --> 47:12.020
 So I guess my, so this is a long winded answer

47:13.380 --> 47:16.940
 or justification of my feeling

47:16.940 --> 47:21.940
 is that the conditions for life in some form

47:21.940 --> 47:26.940
 are probably satisfied many, many places

47:28.700 --> 47:32.140
 around the universe and even within our galaxy.

47:33.260 --> 47:36.020
 I'm not so sure about the emergence of intelligent life

47:36.980 --> 47:41.500
 or the emergence of technological civilizations.

47:41.500 --> 47:46.500
 That seems much more contingent and special.

47:47.420 --> 47:50.380
 And we might, it's conceivable to me

47:50.380 --> 47:52.820
 that we're the only example in the galaxy.

47:54.460 --> 47:56.660
 Although, yeah, I don't know one way or the other.

47:56.660 --> 47:59.660
 I have different opinions on different days of the week.

47:59.660 --> 48:01.420
 But one of the things that worries me

48:01.420 --> 48:04.700
 in the spirit of being humble,

48:04.700 --> 48:08.060
 that our particular kind of intelligence

48:09.060 --> 48:10.700
 is not very special.

48:10.700 --> 48:13.700
 So there's all kinds of different intelligences.

48:13.700 --> 48:15.020
 And even more broadly,

48:15.020 --> 48:19.060
 there could be many different kinds of life.

48:19.060 --> 48:22.420
 So the basic definition, and I just had,

48:22.420 --> 48:24.860
 I think somebody that you know, Sarah Walker,

48:24.860 --> 48:27.260
 I just had a very long conversation with her

48:27.260 --> 48:29.380
 about even just the very basic question

48:29.380 --> 48:34.380
 of trying to define what is life from a physics perspective.

48:34.580 --> 48:36.060
 Even that question within itself,

48:36.060 --> 48:38.180
 I think one of the most fundamental questions

48:38.180 --> 48:41.100
 in science and physics and everything

48:41.100 --> 48:43.860
 is just trying to get a hold,

48:43.860 --> 48:45.500
 trying to get some universal laws

48:45.500 --> 48:47.420
 around the ideas of what is life

48:47.420 --> 48:49.660
 because that kind of unlocks a bunch of things

48:49.660 --> 48:52.460
 around life, intelligence, consciousness,

48:52.460 --> 48:53.420
 all those kinds of things.

48:53.420 --> 48:55.060
 I agree with you in a sense,

48:55.060 --> 48:56.580
 but I think that's a dangerous question

48:56.580 --> 49:01.580
 because the answer can't be any more precise

49:01.740 --> 49:02.940
 than the question.

49:02.940 --> 49:06.220
 And the question, what is life,

49:07.980 --> 49:11.340
 kind of assumes that we have a definition of life

49:11.340 --> 49:12.900
 and that it's a natural phenomena

49:12.900 --> 49:14.660
 that can be distinguished.

49:14.660 --> 49:17.580
 But really there are edge cases like viruses

49:17.580 --> 49:20.740
 and some people would like to say

49:20.740 --> 49:25.020
 that electrons have consciousness.

49:25.020 --> 49:28.700
 So you can't, if you really have fuzzy concepts,

49:28.700 --> 49:33.700
 it's very hard to reach precise kinds of scientific answers.

49:34.060 --> 49:37.020
 But I think there's a very fruitful question

49:37.020 --> 49:39.020
 that's adjacent to it,

49:39.020 --> 49:42.060
 which has been pursued in different forms

49:42.060 --> 49:44.980
 for quite a while

49:44.980 --> 49:47.820
 and is now becoming very sophisticated

49:47.820 --> 49:50.020
 in reaching in new directions.

49:50.020 --> 49:53.900
 And that is, what are the states of matter

49:53.900 --> 49:55.100
 that are possible?

49:55.100 --> 49:58.460
 So in high school or grade school,

49:58.460 --> 50:01.740
 you learn about solids, liquids and gases,

50:01.740 --> 50:04.700
 but that really just scratches the surface

50:04.700 --> 50:07.820
 of different ways that are distinguishable,

50:07.820 --> 50:12.820
 that matter can form into macroscopically different,

50:15.060 --> 50:17.420
 meaningful patterns that we call phases.

50:17.420 --> 50:19.460
 And then there are precise definitions

50:19.460 --> 50:21.660
 of what we mean by phases of matter

50:21.660 --> 50:26.100
 and that have been worked out fruitful over the decades.

50:26.100 --> 50:29.820
 And we're discovering new states of matter all the time

50:29.820 --> 50:33.260
 and kind of having to work at what we mean by matter.

50:33.260 --> 50:35.980
 We're discovering the capabilities of matter

50:35.980 --> 50:39.580
 to organize in interesting ways.

50:39.580 --> 50:44.580
 And some of them, like liquid crystals,

50:46.020 --> 50:49.060
 are important ingredients of life.

50:49.060 --> 50:51.740
 Our cell membranes are liquid crystals,

50:51.740 --> 50:54.100
 and that's very important to the way they work.

50:55.500 --> 50:57.340
 Recently, there's been a development

50:57.340 --> 51:01.500
 in where we're talking about states of matter

51:01.500 --> 51:06.500
 that are not static, but that have dynamics,

51:06.580 --> 51:09.620
 that have characteristic patterns,

51:09.620 --> 51:11.540
 not only in space, but in time.

51:11.540 --> 51:12.860
 These are called time crystals,

51:12.860 --> 51:14.460
 and that's been a development

51:14.460 --> 51:17.580
 that's just in the last decade or so.

51:17.580 --> 51:20.820
 It's just really, really flourishing.

51:20.820 --> 51:25.820
 And so is there a state of matter

51:25.820 --> 51:30.820
 or a group of states of matter that corresponds to life?

51:31.580 --> 51:34.460
 Maybe, but the answer can't be any more definite

51:34.460 --> 51:35.900
 than the question.

51:35.900 --> 51:38.620
 I mean, I gotta push back on the,

51:38.620 --> 51:39.940
 those are just words.

51:39.940 --> 51:41.980
 I mean, I disagree with you.

51:41.980 --> 51:45.940
 The question points to a direction.

51:45.940 --> 51:49.180
 The answer might be able to be more precise

51:49.180 --> 51:53.300
 than the question, because just as you're saying,

51:53.300 --> 51:56.660
 there is a, we could be discovering

51:56.660 --> 51:59.740
 certain characteristics and patterns

51:59.740 --> 52:02.860
 that are associated with a certain type of matter,

52:02.860 --> 52:04.420
 macroscopically speaking,

52:04.420 --> 52:09.420
 and that we can then be able to post facto say,

52:10.620 --> 52:14.420
 this is, let's assign the word life to this kind of matter.

52:14.420 --> 52:17.580
 I agree with that completely, that's what that's,

52:17.580 --> 52:19.780
 but that's, so it's not a disagreement.

52:19.780 --> 52:23.380
 It's very frequent in physics that, or in science,

52:23.380 --> 52:26.820
 that words that are in common use

52:26.820 --> 52:31.380
 get refined and reprocessed into scientific terms

52:31.380 --> 52:34.280
 that's happened for things like force and energy.

52:35.800 --> 52:38.780
 And so we, in a way, we find out

52:38.780 --> 52:43.780
 what the useful definition is, or symmetry, for instance.

52:43.900 --> 52:47.260
 And the common usage may be quite different

52:47.260 --> 52:48.460
 from the scientific usage,

52:48.460 --> 52:52.020
 but the scientific usage is special

52:52.020 --> 52:53.340
 and takes on a life of its own,

52:53.340 --> 52:57.700
 and we find out what the useful version of it is,

52:59.820 --> 53:02.060
 the fruitful version of it is.

53:02.060 --> 53:05.340
 So I do think, so in that spirit,

53:05.340 --> 53:10.340
 I think if we can identify states of matter

53:10.340 --> 53:15.340
 or linked states of matter that can carry on processes

53:18.540 --> 53:22.420
 of self reproduction and development

53:23.940 --> 53:27.380
 and information processing,

53:28.260 --> 53:33.260
 we might be tempted to classify those things as life.

53:34.260 --> 53:36.860
 Well, can I ask you about the craziest one,

53:36.860 --> 53:41.540
 which is the one we know maybe least about,

53:41.540 --> 53:42.700
 which is consciousness.

53:42.700 --> 53:44.940
 Is it possible that there are certain kinds of matter

53:44.940 --> 53:49.940
 would be able to classify as conscious,

53:50.340 --> 53:54.380
 meaning like, so there's the panpsychists, right,

53:54.380 --> 53:57.900
 who are the philosophers who kind of try to imply

53:57.900 --> 54:01.220
 that all matter has some degree of consciousness,

54:01.220 --> 54:04.220
 and you can almost construct like a physics of consciousness.

54:04.220 --> 54:09.220
 Do you, again, we're in such early days of this,

54:09.260 --> 54:13.100
 but nevertheless, it seems useful to talk about it.

54:13.100 --> 54:15.860
 Is there some sense from a physics perspective

54:15.860 --> 54:17.380
 to make sense of consciousness?

54:18.860 --> 54:19.700
 Is there some hope?

54:19.700 --> 54:24.700
 Well, again, consciousness is a very imprecise word

54:24.820 --> 54:28.620
 and loaded with connotations that I think we should,

54:28.620 --> 54:31.900
 we don't wanna start a scientific analysis with that,

54:31.900 --> 54:34.260
 I don't think.

54:34.260 --> 54:38.340
 It's often been important in science

54:38.340 --> 54:41.700
 to start with simple cases and work up.

54:43.020 --> 54:45.860
 Consciousness, I think what most people think of

54:45.860 --> 54:47.740
 when you talk about consciousness is,

54:47.740 --> 54:52.740
 okay, what am I doing in the world?

54:52.980 --> 54:53.900
 This is my experience.

54:53.900 --> 54:57.180
 I have a rich inner life and experience,

54:57.180 --> 54:59.900
 and where is that in the equations?

54:59.900 --> 55:02.220
 And I think that's a great question,

55:02.220 --> 55:03.420
 a great, great question,

55:03.420 --> 55:07.740
 and actually, I think I'm gearing up to spend part of,

55:07.740 --> 55:10.980
 I mean, to try to address that in coming years.

55:10.980 --> 55:12.660
 One version of asking that question,

55:12.660 --> 55:14.420
 just as you said now,

55:14.420 --> 55:19.060
 is what is the simplest formulation of that to study?

55:19.060 --> 55:20.740
 I think I'm much more comfortable

55:20.740 --> 55:23.780
 with the idea of studying self awareness

55:23.780 --> 55:25.420
 as opposed to consciousness,

55:25.420 --> 55:30.260
 because that sort of gets rid of the mystical aura of the thing.

55:30.260 --> 55:33.780
 And self awareness is in simple,

55:33.780 --> 55:38.780
 you know, I think contiguous at least

55:38.980 --> 55:41.580
 with ideas about feedback.

55:41.580 --> 55:45.380
 So if you have a system that looks at its own state

55:45.380 --> 55:48.820
 and responds to it, that's a kind of self awareness.

55:50.820 --> 55:54.460
 And more sophisticated versions

55:54.460 --> 55:57.380
 could be like in information processing things,

55:57.380 --> 56:00.540
 computers that look into their own internal state

56:00.540 --> 56:02.060
 and do something about it.

56:03.220 --> 56:08.220
 And I think that could also be done in neural nets.

56:08.300 --> 56:10.260
 This is called recurrent neural nets,

56:10.260 --> 56:12.860
 which are hard to understand and kind of a frontier.

56:15.340 --> 56:18.340
 So I think understanding those

56:18.340 --> 56:23.340
 and gradually building up a kind of profound ability

56:26.500 --> 56:31.500
 to conceptualize different levels of self awareness.

56:32.220 --> 56:33.540
 What do you have to not know?

56:33.540 --> 56:34.620
 And what do you have to know?

56:34.620 --> 56:36.740
 And when do you know that you don't know it?

56:36.740 --> 56:38.180
 Or when do you, what do you think you know

56:38.180 --> 56:39.220
 that you don't really know?

56:39.220 --> 56:44.220
 And these, I think clarifying those issues,

56:44.220 --> 56:47.300
 when we clarify those issues

56:47.300 --> 56:51.420
 and get a rich theory around self awareness,

56:51.420 --> 56:55.780
 I think that will illuminate the questions

56:55.780 --> 56:58.180
 about consciousness in a way that, you know,

56:58.180 --> 57:00.860
 scratching your chin and talking about qualia

57:00.860 --> 57:04.260
 and blah, blah, blah, blah is never gonna do.

57:04.260 --> 57:06.860
 Well, I also have a different approach to the whole thing.

57:06.860 --> 57:09.060
 So there's, from a robotics perspective,

57:09.060 --> 57:13.260
 you can engineer things that exhibit qualities

57:13.260 --> 57:18.260
 of consciousness without understanding how things work.

57:19.780 --> 57:24.780
 And from that perspective, you, it's like a back door,

57:25.620 --> 57:28.020
 like enter through the psychology door.

57:28.020 --> 57:32.180
 Precisely, I think we're on the same wavelength here.

57:32.180 --> 57:35.300
 I think that, and let me just add one comment,

57:35.300 --> 57:40.300
 which is I think we should try to understand consciousness

57:40.300 --> 57:45.300
 as we experience it as, in evolutionary terms,

57:48.940 --> 57:53.020
 and ask ourselves, why, why does it happen?

57:53.020 --> 57:54.380
 This thing seems useful.

57:54.380 --> 57:55.220
 Why is it useful?

57:55.220 --> 57:56.340
 Why is it useful?

57:56.340 --> 57:57.180
 Interesting question.

57:57.180 --> 58:01.540
 I think we've got a conscious eyewatch here.

58:01.540 --> 58:02.380
 Interesting question.

58:02.380 --> 58:03.500
 Thank you, Siri.

58:03.500 --> 58:04.340
 Okay.

58:08.100 --> 58:09.660
 I'll get back to you later.

58:09.660 --> 58:14.660
 The, and I think what we're gonna,

58:14.820 --> 58:18.500
 I'm morally certain that what's gonna emerge

58:18.500 --> 58:21.500
 from analyzing recurrent neural nets

58:21.500 --> 58:26.380
 and robotic design and advanced computer design

58:26.380 --> 58:31.380
 is that having this kind of looking at the internal state

58:33.940 --> 58:38.420
 in a structured way that doesn't look at everything,

58:38.420 --> 58:40.580
 this guy's has, it's encapsulated,

58:40.580 --> 58:42.260
 looks at highly processed information,

58:42.260 --> 58:44.380
 is very selective and makes choices

58:44.380 --> 58:45.620
 without knowing how they're made.

58:45.620 --> 58:47.360
 There's, there'll also be an unconscious.

58:47.360 --> 58:49.460
 I think that that is gonna be,

58:49.460 --> 58:51.940
 turn out to be really essential

58:51.940 --> 58:55.460
 to doing efficient information processing.

58:55.460 --> 58:59.340
 And that's why it evolved,

58:59.340 --> 59:03.420
 because it's, it's, it's, it's helpful in,

59:03.420 --> 59:06.240
 because brains come at a high cost.

59:06.240 --> 59:09.480
 So there has to be, there has to be a good why.

59:09.480 --> 59:10.960
 And there's a reason, yeah.

59:10.960 --> 59:15.960
 They're rare in evolution and big brains

59:16.640 --> 59:19.920
 are rare in evolution and they, they come at a big cost.

59:19.920 --> 59:22.480
 You mean, if you, you, they, they,

59:22.480 --> 59:25.960
 they have high metabolic demands.

59:27.160 --> 59:30.640
 They require, you know, very active lifestyle,

59:30.640 --> 59:35.640
 warm bloodedness and take, take away from the ability

59:36.880 --> 59:39.160
 to support metabolism of digestion.

59:39.160 --> 59:42.280
 And so, so it's, it's, it comes at a high cost.

59:42.280 --> 59:44.320
 It has to, it has to pay back.

59:44.320 --> 59:47.160
 Yeah, I think it has a lot of value in social interaction.

59:47.160 --> 59:49.600
 So I actually am spending the rest of the day today

59:49.600 --> 59:54.600
 and with our friends that are,

59:54.960 --> 59:58.280
 our legged friends in robotic form at Boston Dynamics.

59:58.280 --> 1:00:03.280
 And I think, so my probably biggest passion

1:00:03.760 --> 1:00:05.760
 is human robot interaction.

1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:09.480
 And it seems that consciousness from the perspective

1:00:09.480 --> 1:00:12.920
 of the robot is very useful to improve

1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:15.260
 the human robot interaction experience.

1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:18.520
 The first, the display of consciousness,

1:00:18.520 --> 1:00:20.200
 but then to me, there's a gray area

1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:23.620
 between the display of consciousness and consciousness itself.

1:00:23.620 --> 1:00:24.920
 If you think of consciousness

1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:26.900
 from an evolutionary perspective,

1:00:26.900 --> 1:00:29.880
 it seems like a useful tool in human communication, so.

1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:32.040
 Yes, it's certainly, well,

1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:35.240
 whatever consciousness is will turn out to be.

1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:39.680
 I think addressing it through its use

1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:42.060
 and working up from simple cases

1:00:42.060 --> 1:00:45.680
 and also working up from engineering experience

1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:48.760
 in trying to do efficient computation,

1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:53.380
 including efficient management of social interactions

1:00:53.380 --> 1:00:56.260
 is going to really shed light on these questions.

1:00:56.260 --> 1:00:59.680
 As I said, in a way that sort of musing abstractly

1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:01.640
 about consciousness never would.

1:01:01.640 --> 1:01:04.060
 So as I mentioned, I talked to Sarah Walker

1:01:04.060 --> 1:01:07.560
 and first of all, she says, hi, spoke very highly of you.

1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:12.400
 One of her concerns about physics and physicists and humans

1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:16.960
 is that we may not fully understand the system

1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:18.980
 that we're inside of.

1:01:18.980 --> 1:01:22.880
 Meaning like, there may be limits

1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:24.440
 to the kind of physics we do

1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:28.760
 in trying to understand the system of which we're part of.

1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:33.760
 So like, the observer is also the observed.

1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:36.720
 In that sense, it seems like

1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:42.760
 our tools of understanding the world,

1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:44.840
 I mean, this is mostly centered around the questions

1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:47.520
 of what is life, trying to understand the patterns

1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:51.320
 that are characteristic of life and intelligence,

1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:53.280
 all those kinds of things.

1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:57.320
 We're not using the right tools because we're in the system.

1:01:57.320 --> 1:02:01.320
 Is there something that resonates with you there?

1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:02.160
 Almost like...

1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:07.160
 Well, yes, we have limitations, of course,

1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:11.720
 in the amount of information we can process.

1:02:12.680 --> 1:02:16.800
 On the other hand, we can get help from our Silicon friends

1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:21.420
 and we can get help from all kinds of instruments

1:02:21.420 --> 1:02:24.220
 that make up for our perceptual deficits.

1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:30.040
 And we can use, at a conceptual level,

1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:32.760
 we can use different kinds of concepts

1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:35.360
 to address different kinds of questions.

1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:40.280
 So I'm not sure exactly what problem she's talking about.

1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:45.280
 It's a problem akin to an organism living in a 2D plane

1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:47.800
 trying to understand a three dimensional world.

1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:48.920
 Well, we can do that.

1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:53.360
 I mean, in fact, for practical purposes,

1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:55.840
 most of our experience is two dimensional.

1:02:55.840 --> 1:02:57.680
 It's hard to move vertically.

1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:00.400
 And yet we've produced conceptually

1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:01.800
 a three dimensional symmetry

1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:04.440
 and in fact, four dimensional space time.

1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:10.440
 So by thinking in appropriate ways and using instruments

1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:14.860
 and getting consistent accounts and rich accounts,

1:03:14.860 --> 1:03:19.200
 we find out what concepts are necessary.

1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:25.960
 And I don't see any end in sight of the process

1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:30.960
 or any showstoppers because, let me give you an example.

1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:35.400
 I mean, for instance, QCD,

1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:37.360
 our theory of the strong interaction,

1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:40.360
 has nice equations, which I helped to discover.

1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:41.280
 What's QCD?

1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:42.880
 Quantum chromodynamics.

1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:47.480
 So it's our theory of the strong interaction,

1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:51.400
 the interaction that is responsible for nuclear physics.

1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:53.120
 So it's the interaction that governs

1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:55.340
 how quarks and gluons interact with each other

1:03:55.340 --> 1:03:59.360
 and make protons and neutrons

1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:03.120
 and all the strong, the related particles

1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:05.360
 and many things in physics.

1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:07.960
 It's one of the four basic forces of nature

1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:09.800
 as we presently understand it.

1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:14.800
 And so we have beautiful equations,

1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:20.800
 which we can test in very special circumstances

1:04:22.620 --> 1:04:25.680
 using at high energies, at accelerators.

1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:28.700
 So we're certain that these equations are correct.

1:04:28.700 --> 1:04:30.520
 Prizes are given for it and so on.

1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:32.760
 And people try to knock it down and they can't.

1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:37.760
 Yeah, but the situations in which we can calculate

1:04:43.020 --> 1:04:46.280
 the consequences of these equations are very limited.

1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:51.280
 So for instance, no one has been able to demonstrate

1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:57.080
 that this theory, which is built on quarks and gluons,

1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:01.080
 which no one, which you don't observe,

1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:03.360
 actually produces protons and neutrons

1:05:03.360 --> 1:05:04.560
 and the things you do observe.

1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:06.760
 This is called the problem of confinement.

1:05:07.640 --> 1:05:11.000
 So no one's been able to prove that analytically

1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.520
 in a way that a human can understand.

1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:16.640
 On the other hand, we can take these equations

1:05:16.640 --> 1:05:20.400
 to a computer, to gigantic computers and compute.

1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:25.440
 And by God, you get the world from it.

1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:30.440
 So these equations in a way that we don't understand

1:05:32.120 --> 1:05:36.760
 in terms of human concepts, we can't do the calculations,

1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:39.020
 but our machines can do them.

1:05:39.020 --> 1:05:43.480
 So with the help of what I like to call our silicon friends

1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:46.600
 and their descendants in the future,

1:05:46.600 --> 1:05:50.720
 we can understand in a different way

1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:53.000
 that allows us to understand more.

1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:56.480
 But I don't think we'll ever, no human is ever going

1:05:56.480 --> 1:06:00.560
 to be able to solve those equations in the same way.

1:06:00.560 --> 1:06:04.760
 So, but I think that's, you know,

1:06:04.760 --> 1:06:09.560
 when we find limitations to our natural abilities,

1:06:09.560 --> 1:06:12.880
 we can try to find workarounds.

1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:15.160
 And sometimes that's appropriate concepts.

1:06:15.160 --> 1:06:17.320
 Sometimes it's appropriate instruments.

1:06:17.320 --> 1:06:19.800
 Sometimes it's a combination of the two.

1:06:19.800 --> 1:06:24.800
 But I think it's premature to get defeatist about it.

1:06:26.220 --> 1:06:31.220
 I don't see any logical contradiction

1:06:32.480 --> 1:06:35.040
 or paradox or limitation

1:06:35.040 --> 1:06:38.320
 that will bring this process to a halt.

1:06:38.320 --> 1:06:40.960
 Well, I think the idea is to continue thinking

1:06:40.960 --> 1:06:42.880
 outside the box in different directions,

1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:45.880
 meaning just like how the math allows us

1:06:45.880 --> 1:06:47.280
 to think in multiple dimensions

1:06:47.280 --> 1:06:52.280
 outside of our perception system, sort of thinking,

1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:55.720
 you know, coming up with new tools

1:06:55.720 --> 1:06:58.320
 of mathematics or computation or all those kinds of things

1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:03.320
 to take different perspectives on our universe.

1:07:04.220 --> 1:07:05.440
 Well, I'm all for that.

1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:08.840
 You know, and I kind of have even elevated into a principle

1:07:08.840 --> 1:07:11.520
 which is of complementarity following Bohr

1:07:11.520 --> 1:07:16.520
 that you need different ways of thinking

1:07:16.520 --> 1:07:18.600
 even about the same things

1:07:18.600 --> 1:07:21.080
 in order to do justice to their reality

1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:23.880
 and answer different kinds of questions about them.

1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:27.480
 I mean, we've several times alluded to the fact

1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:30.280
 that human beings are hard to understand

1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:34.560
 and the concepts that you use to understand human beings

1:07:34.560 --> 1:07:37.640
 if you wanna prescribe drugs for them

1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:42.560
 or see what's gonna happen if they move very fast

1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:45.160
 or are exposed to radiation.

1:07:45.160 --> 1:07:47.200
 And so that requires one kind of thinking

1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:52.080
 that's very physical based on the fact

1:07:52.080 --> 1:07:55.480
 that the materials that were made out of.

1:07:55.480 --> 1:07:57.680
 On the other hand, if you want to understand

1:07:57.680 --> 1:07:59.440
 how a person's going to behave

1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:01.280
 in a different kind of situation,

1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:06.120
 you need entirely different concepts from psychology

1:08:06.120 --> 1:08:08.480
 and there's nothing wrong with that.

1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:09.760
 You can have very different ways

1:08:09.760 --> 1:08:11.840
 of addressing the same material

1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:14.920
 that are useful for different purposes, right?

1:08:14.920 --> 1:08:16.120
 Can you describe this idea

1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:18.920
 which is fascinating of complementarity a little bit?

1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:23.920
 Sort of first of all, what state is the principle?

1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:26.800
 What is it?

1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:29.160
 And second of all, what are good examples

1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:30.960
 starting from quantum mechanics?

1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:32.720
 You used to mention psychology.

1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:33.560
 Let's talk about this more.

1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:34.920
 It's like in your new book

1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:37.120
 one of the most fascinating ideas actually.

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.280
 I think it's a wonderful, yeah.

1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:43.160
 To me it's, well, it's the culminating chapter of the book

1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:48.160
 and I think since the whole book is about the big lessons

1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:52.520
 or big takeaways from profound understanding

1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:55.520
 of the physical world that we've achieved,

1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:59.000
 including that it's mysterious in some ways,

1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:06.040
 this was the final overarching lesson, complementarity.

1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:11.040
 Lesson, complementarity and it's a approach.

1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:18.520
 So unlike some of these other things

1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:20.640
 which are just facts about the world,

1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:22.480
 like the world is both big and small

1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:26.320
 and different sizes and is big but we're not small,

1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:28.440
 things we talked about earlier

1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:30.800
 and the fact that the universe is comprehensible

1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:33.600
 and how complexity could emerge from simplicity

1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:37.880
 and so those things are in the broad sense

1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:39.760
 facts about the world.

1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:42.560
 Complementarity is more an attitude towards the world

1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:46.320
 than encouraged by the facts about the world.

1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:51.320
 And it's the concept or the approach

1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:59.320
 or the realization that it can be appropriate

1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:02.880
 and useful and inevitable and unavoidable

1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:07.880
 to use very different descriptions of the same object

1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:11.680
 or the same system or the same situation

1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:15.520
 to answer different kinds of questions

1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:17.960
 that may be very different

1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:22.560
 and even mutually uninterpretable,

1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:27.720
 immutually incomprehensible.

1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:28.960
 But both correct somehow.

1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:32.720
 But both correct and sources of different kinds of insight

1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:33.880
 which is so weird.

1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:36.640
 But it seems to work in so many cases.

1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:41.080
 It works in many cases and I think it's a deep fact

1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:44.600
 about the world and how we should approach it.

1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:49.600
 It's most rigorous form where it's actually a theorem

1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:53.520
 if quantum mechanics is correct,

1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:55.360
 occurs in quantum mechanics

1:10:55.360 --> 1:11:00.360
 where the primary description of the world

1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:03.400
 is in terms of wave functions.

1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:04.720
 But let's not talk about the world.

1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:07.480
 Let's just talk about a particle, an electron.

1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:12.600
 The primary description of that electron

1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:14.440
 is its wave function.

1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:18.720
 And the wave function can be used to predict

1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:21.840
 where it's gonna be.

1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:24.200
 If you observe, it'll be in different places

1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:27.520
 with different probabilities or how fast it's moving.

1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:31.280
 And it'll also be moving in different ways

1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:32.760
 with different probabilities.

1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:35.240
 That's what quantum mechanics says.

1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:38.920
 And you can predict either set of probabilities

1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:40.160
 if you know what's gonna happen

1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:45.160
 if I make an observation of the position or the velocity.

1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:51.600
 So the wave function gives you ways of doing both of those.

1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:54.480
 But to do it, to get those predictions,

1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:57.320
 you have to process the wave function in different ways.

1:11:57.320 --> 1:11:59.120
 You process it one way for position

1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:01.520
 and in a different way for momentum.

1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:05.400
 And those ways are mathematically incompatible.

1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:08.480
 It's like you have a stone

1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:11.120
 and you can sculpt it into a Venus de Milo

1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:14.360
 or you can sculpt it into David, but you can't do both.

1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:20.680
 And that's an example of complementarity.

1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:22.560
 To answer different kinds of questions,

1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:25.920
 you have to analyze the system in different ways

1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:29.200
 that are mutually incompatible,

1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:32.800
 but both valid to answer different kinds of questions.

1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:34.880
 So in that case, it's a theorem,

1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:38.920
 but I think it's a much more widespread phenomena

1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:40.440
 that applies to many cases

1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:42.400
 where we can't prove it as a theorem,

1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:46.520
 but it's a piece of wisdom, if you like,

1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:51.520
 and appears to be a very important insight.

1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:53.840
 And if you ignore it,

1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:58.840
 you can get very confused and misguided.

1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:06.960
 Do you think this is a useful hack

1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:10.560
 for ideas that we don't fully understand?

1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:13.720
 Or is this somehow a fundamental property

1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:16.760
 of all or many ideas,

1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:19.360
 that you can take multiple perspectives

1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:20.820
 and they're both true?

1:13:20.820 --> 1:13:24.420
 Well, I think it's both.

1:13:24.420 --> 1:13:26.040
 So it's both the answer to all questions.

1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:27.400
 Yes, that's right.

1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:28.920
 It's not either or, it's both.

1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:32.760
 It's paralyzing to think that we live in a world

1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:37.440
 that's fundamentally surrounded by complementary ideas.

1:13:39.540 --> 1:13:44.040
 Because we somehow want to attach ourselves

1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:45.720
 to absolute truths,

1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:48.440
 and absolute truths certainly don't like the idea

1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:50.080
 of complementarity.

1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:53.160
 Yes, Einstein was very uncomfortable with complementarity.

1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:55.280
 And in a broad sense,

1:13:55.280 --> 1:13:57.420
 the famous Bohr Einstein debates

1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:00.760
 revolved around this question

1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:03.040
 of whether the complementarity

1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:08.040
 that is a foundational feature of quantum mechanics,

1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:09.240
 as we have it,

1:14:10.620 --> 1:14:15.620
 is a permanent feature of the universe

1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:19.040
 and our description of nature.

1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:22.960
 And so far, quantum mechanics wins.

1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:26.480
 And it's gone from triumph to triumph.

1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:28.720
 Whether complementarity is rock bottom,

1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:31.560
 I guess, you can never be sure.

1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:34.220
 I mean, but it looks awfully good

1:14:34.220 --> 1:14:35.560
 and it's been very successful.

1:14:35.560 --> 1:14:40.400
 And certainly, complementarity has been extremely useful

1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:43.460
 and fruitful in that domain,

1:14:43.460 --> 1:14:48.460
 including some of Einstein's attempts to challenge it

1:14:50.780 --> 1:14:55.460
 with the famous Einstein Podolsky Rosen experiment

1:14:55.460 --> 1:14:57.380
 turned out to be confirmations

1:14:57.380 --> 1:15:02.380
 that have been useful in themselves.

1:15:03.300 --> 1:15:05.180
 But so thinking about these things was fruitful,

1:15:05.180 --> 1:15:07.920
 but not in the way that Einstein hoped.

1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:12.920
 Yeah, so as I said, in the case of quantum mechanics

1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:24.640
 and this dilemma or dichotomy

1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:29.280
 between processing the wave function in different ways,

1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:30.120
 it's a theorem.

1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:31.200
 They're mutually incompatible

1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:32.880
 and the physical correlate of that

1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:35.080
 is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle

1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:38.880
 you can't have position and momentum determined at once.

1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:46.600
 But in other cases, like one that I like to think about

1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:50.120
 or like to point out as an example

1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:52.980
 is free will and determinism.

1:15:52.980 --> 1:15:57.240
 It's much less of a theorem

1:15:57.240 --> 1:16:02.240
 and more a kind of way of thinking about things

1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:10.680
 that I think is reassuring

1:16:10.680 --> 1:16:15.680
 and avoids a lot of unnecessary quarreling and confusion.

1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:17.480
 The quarreling I'm okay with

1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:18.960
 and the confusion I'm okay with,

1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:21.640
 I mean, people debate about difficult ideas,

1:16:21.640 --> 1:16:24.560
 but the question is whether it could be

1:16:24.560 --> 1:16:26.880
 almost a fundamental truth.

1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:28.280
 I think it is a fundamental truth.

1:16:28.280 --> 1:16:32.640
 That free will is both an illusion and not.

1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:34.240
 Yes, I think that's correct.

1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:39.280
 There's a reason why people say quantum mechanics is weird

1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:42.840
 and complementarity is a big part of that.

1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:48.760
 To say that our actual whole world is weird,

1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:52.140
 the whole hierarchy of the universe is weird

1:16:52.140 --> 1:16:54.440
 in this kind of particular way,

1:16:54.440 --> 1:16:59.440
 and it's quite profound, but it's also humbling

1:17:03.240 --> 1:17:06.720
 because it's like we're never going to be on sturdy ground

1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:09.280
 in the way that humans like to be.

1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:13.760
 It's like you have to embrace that this whole thing

1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:18.080
 is like unsteady mess.

1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:21.560
 It's one of many lessons in humility

1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:26.560
 that we run into in profound understanding of the world.

1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:30.720
 The Copernican revolution was one,

1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:35.200
 that the earth is not the center of the universe.

1:17:35.200 --> 1:17:36.960
 Darwinian evolution is another,

1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:53.960
 that humans are not the pinnacle of God's creation and the apparent result

1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:57.640
 of deep understanding of physical reality,

1:17:57.640 --> 1:18:05.520
 that mind emerges from matter and there's no call

1:18:05.520 --> 1:18:07.960
 on special life forces or souls.

1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:11.440
 These are all lessons in humility,

1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:19.120
 and I actually find complementarity a liberating concept.

1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:21.560
 It's, okay, you know, we...

1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:22.640
 Yeah, it is in a way.

1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:28.080
 That is what I remember.

1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:30.880
 There's a story about Dr. Johnson,

1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:32.640
 and he's talking with Boswell,

1:18:32.640 --> 1:18:36.400
 and Boswell was, they were discussing a sermon

1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:37.800
 that they'd both heard,

1:18:37.800 --> 1:18:43.600
 and the sort of culmination of the sermon was the speaker saying,

1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:45.440
 I accept the universe.

1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:50.720
 And Dr. Johnson said, well, damn well better.

1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:55.720
 And there's a certain joy in accepting the universe

1:18:55.720 --> 1:18:57.760
 because it's mind expanding.

1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:10.160
 And to me, complementarity also suggests tolerance,

1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:15.880
 suggests opportunities for understanding things

1:19:15.880 --> 1:19:22.760
 in different ways that add to rather than detract

1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:25.120
 from understanding.

1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:29.960
 So I think it's an opportunity for mind expansion

1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:33.160
 and demanding that there's only one way

1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:36.720
 to think about things can be very limiting.

1:19:36.720 --> 1:19:38.840
 On the free will one, that's a trippy one, though.

1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:43.520
 To think like I am the decider of my own actions

1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:49.760
 and at the same time I'm not is tricky to think about,

1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:53.840
 but there does seem to be some kind of profound truth in that.

1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:56.880
 I get, well, I think it is tied up.

1:19:56.880 --> 1:20:00.320
 It will turn out to be tied up when we understand things better

1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:04.640
 with these issues of self awareness and where we get,

1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:06.960
 what we perceive as making choices,

1:20:06.960 --> 1:20:12.120
 what does that really mean and what's going on under the hood.

1:20:12.120 --> 1:20:15.000
 But I'm speculating about a future understanding

1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:17.000
 that's not in place at present.

1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:19.960
 Your sense there will always be,

1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:22.880
 like as you dig into the self awareness thing,

1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:24.600
 there'll always be some places

1:20:24.600 --> 1:20:26.640
 where complementarity is gonna show up.

1:20:26.640 --> 1:20:28.040
 Oh, definitely, yeah.

1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:31.560
 I mean, there will be, how should I say?

1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:33.720
 There'll be kind of a God's eye view

1:20:33.720 --> 1:20:37.400
 which sees everything that's going on

1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:40.120
 in the computer or the brain.

1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:42.280
 And then there's the brain's own view

1:20:42.280 --> 1:20:46.240
 or the central processor or whatever it is,

1:20:46.240 --> 1:20:50.760
 what we call the self, the consciousness,

1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:53.480
 that's only aware of a very small part of it.

1:20:53.480 --> 1:20:54.800
 And those are very different.

1:20:54.800 --> 1:20:59.720
 Those are, so the God's eye view can be deterministic

1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:04.720
 while the self view sees free will.

1:21:07.880 --> 1:21:11.440
 I'm pretty sure that's how it's gonna work out actually.

1:21:11.440 --> 1:21:15.160
 But as it stands, free will is a concept

1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:19.280
 that we definitely, at least I feel I definitely experience,

1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:21.600
 I can choose to do one thing then another.

1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:24.920
 And other people I think are sufficiently similar to me

1:21:24.920 --> 1:21:28.420
 that I trust that they feel the same way.

1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:33.600
 And it's an essential concept in psychology

1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:35.680
 and law and so forth.

1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:40.680
 But at the same time, I think that mind emerges from matter

1:21:42.520 --> 1:21:47.360
 and that there's an alternative description of matter

1:21:47.360 --> 1:21:51.160
 that's up to subtleties about quantum mechanics,

1:21:51.160 --> 1:21:53.960
 which I don't think are relevant here,

1:21:53.960 --> 1:21:56.180
 really is deterministic.

1:21:56.180 --> 1:21:57.960
 Let me ask you about some particles.

1:21:57.960 --> 1:21:59.200
 Okay.

1:21:59.200 --> 1:22:00.880
 First the absurd question,

1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:04.980
 almost like a question that like Plato would ask.

1:22:04.980 --> 1:22:07.740
 What is the smallest thing in the universe?

1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:13.520
 As far as we know, the fundamental particles

1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:17.480
 out of which we build our most successful description

1:22:17.480 --> 1:22:20.040
 of nature are points.

1:22:20.040 --> 1:22:24.880
 They don't have any internal structure.

1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:29.980
 So that's as small as can be.

1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:34.000
 So what does that mean operationally?

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:39.000
 That means that they obey equations that describe entities

1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:44.000
 that are singular concentrations of energy,

1:22:46.240 --> 1:22:47.720
 momentum, angular momentum,

1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:50.080
 the things that particles have,

1:22:50.080 --> 1:22:53.460
 but localized at individual points.

1:22:53.460 --> 1:22:57.960
 Now that mathematical structure

1:22:57.960 --> 1:23:01.420
 is only revealed partially in the world

1:23:01.420 --> 1:23:04.600
 because to process the wave function

1:23:04.600 --> 1:23:09.360
 in a way that accesses information about the precise

1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:12.080
 position of things, you have to apply a lot of energy

1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:14.960
 and that's an idealization

1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:16.720
 and you can apply infinite amount of energy

1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:19.880
 to determine a precise position.

1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:22.440
 But at the mathematical level,

1:23:23.560 --> 1:23:26.560
 we build the world out of particles that are points.

1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:29.280
 So do they actually exist and what are we talking about?

1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:30.120
 Oh, they exist.

1:23:30.120 --> 1:23:33.000
 So let me ask sort of do quarks exist?

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.200
 Yes, do electrons exist?

1:23:36.200 --> 1:23:37.720
 Yes, do photons exist?

1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:38.540
 Yes.

1:23:38.540 --> 1:23:39.720
 But what does it mean for them to exist?

1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:43.520
 Okay, so well, the hard answer to that,

1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:48.520
 the precise answer is that we construct the world

1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:51.880
 out of equations that contain entities

1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:56.720
 that are reproducible,

1:23:56.720 --> 1:24:00.860
 that exist in vast numbers throughout the universe,

1:24:00.860 --> 1:24:05.860
 that have definite properties of mass,

1:24:05.900 --> 1:24:10.900
 spin and a few others that we call electrons

1:24:13.420 --> 1:24:17.220
 and what an electron is is defined by the equations

1:24:17.220 --> 1:24:19.920
 that it satisfies theoretically

1:24:19.920 --> 1:24:24.160
 and we find that there are many, many exemplars

1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:28.860
 of that entity in the physical world.

1:24:28.860 --> 1:24:31.300
 So in the case of electrons,

1:24:31.300 --> 1:24:34.260
 we can isolate them and study them

1:24:34.260 --> 1:24:36.740
 and individual ones in great detail

1:24:36.740 --> 1:24:41.100
 and we can check that they all actually are identical

1:24:42.100 --> 1:24:45.420
 and that's why chemistry works and yes.

1:24:45.420 --> 1:24:49.820
 So in that case, it's very tangible.

1:24:49.820 --> 1:24:51.020
 Similarly with photons,

1:24:51.020 --> 1:24:55.180
 you can study them individually, the units of light

1:24:55.180 --> 1:24:59.900
 and nowadays, it's very practical

1:24:59.900 --> 1:25:01.560
 to study individual photons

1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:05.660
 and determine their spin and their other basic properties

1:25:05.660 --> 1:25:10.660
 and check out the equations in great detail.

1:25:11.100 --> 1:25:13.480
 For quarks and gluons,

1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:16.780
 which are the other two main ingredients

1:25:16.780 --> 1:25:21.780
 of our model of matter that's so successful,

1:25:22.300 --> 1:25:23.580
 it's a little more complicated

1:25:23.580 --> 1:25:28.320
 because the quarks and gluons that appear in our equations

1:25:29.300 --> 1:25:33.340
 don't appear directly as particles you can isolate

1:25:33.340 --> 1:25:35.720
 and study individually.

1:25:35.720 --> 1:25:40.720
 They always occur within what are called bound states

1:25:41.820 --> 1:25:43.980
 or structures like protons.

1:25:43.980 --> 1:25:48.060
 A proton, roughly speaking, is composed of three quarks

1:25:48.060 --> 1:25:50.620
 and a lot of gluons but we can detect them

1:25:50.620 --> 1:25:54.420
 in a remarkably direct way actually nowadays,

1:25:54.420 --> 1:25:57.280
 whereas at relatively low energies,

1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:00.820
 the behavior of quarks is complicated.

1:26:00.820 --> 1:26:05.500
 At high energies, they can propagate through space

1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:10.500
 relatively freely for a while and we can see their tracks.

1:26:11.740 --> 1:26:14.820
 So ultimately, they get recaptured into protons

1:26:14.820 --> 1:26:17.940
 and other mesons and funny things

1:26:17.940 --> 1:26:21.020
 but for a short time, they propagate freely

1:26:21.020 --> 1:26:25.260
 and while that happens, we can take snapshots

1:26:25.260 --> 1:26:27.440
 and see their manifestations.

1:26:29.620 --> 1:26:31.700
 Actually, this kind of thing is exactly

1:26:31.700 --> 1:26:33.140
 what I got the Nobel Prize for,

1:26:33.140 --> 1:26:35.060
 predicting that this would work.

1:26:35.060 --> 1:26:36.540
 And similarly for gluons,

1:26:36.540 --> 1:26:41.540
 although you can't isolate them as individual particles

1:26:41.660 --> 1:26:43.900
 and study them in the same way that we study electrons,

1:26:43.900 --> 1:26:48.900
 say, you can use them theoretically as entities

1:26:51.820 --> 1:26:54.820
 out of which you build tangible things

1:26:57.060 --> 1:26:58.500
 that we actually do observe

1:26:59.560 --> 1:27:03.820
 but also you can, at accelerators at high energy,

1:27:03.820 --> 1:27:06.340
 you can liberate them for brief periods of time

1:27:06.340 --> 1:27:10.860
 and study and get convincing evidence

1:27:10.860 --> 1:27:15.460
 that they leave tracks and you can get convincing evidence

1:27:15.460 --> 1:27:17.900
 that they were there and have the properties

1:27:17.900 --> 1:27:19.580
 that we wanted them to have.

1:27:19.580 --> 1:27:21.260
 Can we talk about asymptotic freedom,

1:27:21.260 --> 1:27:24.020
 this very idea that you won the Nobel Prize for?

1:27:24.020 --> 1:27:25.300
 Yeah.

1:27:25.300 --> 1:27:29.660
 So it describes a very weird effect to me,

1:27:30.820 --> 1:27:33.220
 the weird in the following way.

1:27:33.220 --> 1:27:38.220
 So the way I think of most forces or interactions,

1:27:38.220 --> 1:27:43.220
 the closer you are, the stronger the effect,

1:27:43.820 --> 1:27:46.300
 the stronger the force, right?

1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:50.540
 With quarks, the close they are,

1:27:50.540 --> 1:27:53.900
 the less so the strong interaction.

1:27:53.900 --> 1:27:58.600
 And in fact, they're basically act like free particles

1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:00.700
 when they're very close.

1:28:00.700 --> 1:28:01.900
 That's right, yes.

1:28:01.900 --> 1:28:04.540
 But this requires a huge amount of energy.

1:28:04.540 --> 1:28:09.540
 Like can you describe me why, how does this even work?

1:28:11.740 --> 1:28:12.580
 How weird it is?

1:28:12.580 --> 1:28:17.580
 A proper description must bring in quantum mechanics

1:28:18.220 --> 1:28:20.620
 and relativity and it's,

1:28:21.660 --> 1:28:25.460
 so a proper description and equations,

1:28:25.460 --> 1:28:29.860
 so a proper description really is probably more

1:28:29.860 --> 1:28:34.140
 than we have time for and require quite a bit of patience

1:28:34.140 --> 1:28:35.980
 on your part, but.

1:28:35.980 --> 1:28:37.700
 How does relativity come into play?

1:28:37.700 --> 1:28:39.220
 Wait, wait a minute.

1:28:39.220 --> 1:28:44.220
 Relativity is important because when we talk about

1:28:48.980 --> 1:28:51.580
 trying to think about short distances,

1:28:51.580 --> 1:28:55.060
 we have to think about very large momenta

1:28:55.060 --> 1:28:56.580
 and very large momenta are connected

1:28:56.580 --> 1:28:59.180
 to very large energy in relativity.

1:28:59.180 --> 1:29:02.460
 And so the connection between how things behave

1:29:02.460 --> 1:29:06.180
 at short distances and how things behave at high energy

1:29:06.180 --> 1:29:09.340
 really is connected through relativity

1:29:09.340 --> 1:29:13.000
 in sort of a slightly backhanded way.

1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:16.180
 Quantum mechanics indicates that short,

1:29:16.180 --> 1:29:18.980
 to get to analyze short distances,

1:29:20.120 --> 1:29:25.120
 you need to bring in probes that carry a lot of momentum.

1:29:26.460 --> 1:29:29.140
 This again is related to uncertainty

1:29:29.140 --> 1:29:31.980
 because it's the fact that you have to bring in

1:29:31.980 --> 1:29:36.060
 a lot of momentum that interferes with the possibility

1:29:36.060 --> 1:29:40.220
 of determining position and momentum at the same time.

1:29:40.220 --> 1:29:41.980
 If you want to determine position,

1:29:41.980 --> 1:29:45.140
 you have to use instruments that bring in a lot of momentum.

1:29:45.140 --> 1:29:48.580
 And because of that, those same instruments

1:29:48.580 --> 1:29:50.060
 can't also measure momentum

1:29:50.060 --> 1:29:52.460
 because they're disturbing the momentum that,

1:29:53.620 --> 1:29:56.220
 and then the momentum brings in energy and yeah.

1:29:56.220 --> 1:29:59.540
 So that there's also the effect that asymptotic freedom

1:29:59.540 --> 1:30:04.540
 comes from the possibility of spontaneously making

1:30:08.460 --> 1:30:12.140
 quarks and gluons for short amounts of time

1:30:12.140 --> 1:30:15.480
 that fluctuate into existence and out of existence.

1:30:16.600 --> 1:30:21.600
 And the fact that that can be done

1:30:21.860 --> 1:30:23.800
 with a very little amount of energy

1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:26.660
 and uncertainty and energy translates

1:30:26.660 --> 1:30:27.620
 into uncertainty and time.

1:30:27.620 --> 1:30:31.460
 So if you do that for a short time, you can do that.

1:30:31.460 --> 1:30:34.040
 Well, it's all comes in a package.

1:30:35.340 --> 1:30:39.500
 So I told you it would take a while to really explain,

1:30:39.500 --> 1:30:44.100
 but the results can be understood.

1:30:44.100 --> 1:30:48.100
 I mean, we can state the results pretty simply, I think.

1:30:48.100 --> 1:30:53.100
 So in everyday life, we do encounter some forces

1:30:53.100 --> 1:30:56.380
 that increase with distance

1:30:56.380 --> 1:30:59.320
 and kind of turn off at short distances.

1:30:59.320 --> 1:31:02.140
 That's the way rubber bands work, if you think about it,

1:31:02.140 --> 1:31:06.980
 or if you pull them hard, they resist,

1:31:06.980 --> 1:31:11.620
 but they get flabby if the rubber band is not pulled.

1:31:12.940 --> 1:31:17.660
 And so there are, that can happen in the physical world,

1:31:17.660 --> 1:31:19.860
 but what's really difficult is to see

1:31:19.860 --> 1:31:21.820
 how that could be a fundamental force

1:31:21.820 --> 1:31:24.400
 that's consistent with everything else we know.

1:31:24.400 --> 1:31:28.500
 And that's what asymptotic freedom is.

1:31:28.500 --> 1:31:33.500
 It says that there's a very particular kind

1:31:33.620 --> 1:31:37.480
 of fundamental force that involves special particles

1:31:37.480 --> 1:31:40.340
 called gluons with very special properties

1:31:40.340 --> 1:31:43.080
 that enables that kind of behavior.

1:31:43.080 --> 1:31:47.380
 So there were experiment, at the time we did our work,

1:31:47.380 --> 1:31:49.300
 there were experimental indications

1:31:49.300 --> 1:31:54.180
 that quarks and gluons did have this kind of property,

1:31:54.180 --> 1:31:56.780
 but there were no equations

1:31:56.780 --> 1:31:59.600
 that were capable of capturing it.

1:31:59.600 --> 1:32:02.580
 And we found the equations and showed how they work

1:32:02.580 --> 1:32:06.240
 and showed how they, that they were basically unique.

1:32:06.240 --> 1:32:08.300
 And this led to a complete theory

1:32:08.300 --> 1:32:09.980
 of how the strong interaction works,

1:32:09.980 --> 1:32:14.220
 which is the quantum chromodynamics we mentioned earlier.

1:32:14.220 --> 1:32:19.220
 And so that's the phenomenon that quarks and gluons

1:32:23.140 --> 1:32:26.500
 interact very, very weakly when they're close together.

1:32:26.500 --> 1:32:29.100
 That's connected through relativity

1:32:29.100 --> 1:32:32.520
 with the fact that they also interact very, very weakly

1:32:32.520 --> 1:32:34.000
 at high energies.

1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:36.680
 So if you have, so at high energies,

1:32:37.740 --> 1:32:42.220
 the simplicity of the fundamental interaction gets revealed.

1:32:42.220 --> 1:32:43.820
 At the time we did our work,

1:32:43.820 --> 1:32:46.580
 the clues were very subtle,

1:32:46.580 --> 1:32:50.140
 but nowadays at what are now high energy accelerators,

1:32:50.140 --> 1:32:51.100
 it's all obvious.

1:32:51.100 --> 1:32:52.900
 So we would have had a much,

1:32:52.900 --> 1:32:55.540
 well, somebody would have had a much easier time

1:32:55.540 --> 1:32:57.700
 20 years later, looking at the data,

1:32:57.700 --> 1:32:59.940
 you can sort of see the quarks and gluons.

1:32:59.940 --> 1:33:02.140
 As I mentioned, they leave these short tracks

1:33:02.140 --> 1:33:04.380
 that would have been much, much easier,

1:33:04.380 --> 1:33:08.700
 but from fundamental, from indirect clues,

1:33:08.700 --> 1:33:10.260
 we were able to piece together enough

1:33:10.260 --> 1:33:13.240
 to make that behavior a prediction

1:33:13.240 --> 1:33:15.900
 rather than a post diction, right?

1:33:15.900 --> 1:33:17.960
 So it becomes obvious at high energies.

1:33:17.960 --> 1:33:19.240
 It becomes very obvious.

1:33:19.240 --> 1:33:21.560
 When we first did this work,

1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:24.820
 it was frontiers of high energy physics

1:33:24.820 --> 1:33:27.780
 and at big international conferences,

1:33:27.780 --> 1:33:30.900
 there would always be sessions on testing QCD

1:33:30.900 --> 1:33:34.380
 and whether this proposed description

1:33:34.380 --> 1:33:37.660
 of the strong interaction was in fact correct and so forth.

1:33:37.660 --> 1:33:39.740
 And it was very exciting.

1:33:39.740 --> 1:33:44.740
 But nowadays the same kind of work,

1:33:44.740 --> 1:33:48.920
 but much more precise with calculations

1:33:48.920 --> 1:33:50.700
 to more accuracy and experiments

1:33:50.700 --> 1:33:53.500
 that are much more precise

1:33:54.380 --> 1:33:57.160
 and comparisons that are very precise.

1:33:57.160 --> 1:33:59.100
 Now it's called calculating backgrounds

1:33:59.100 --> 1:34:03.040
 because people take this for granted

1:34:03.040 --> 1:34:06.660
 and wanna see deviations from the theory,

1:34:06.660 --> 1:34:09.740
 which would be the new discoveries.

1:34:09.740 --> 1:34:11.700
 Yeah, the cutting edge becomes a foundation

1:34:11.700 --> 1:34:13.100
 and the foundation becomes boring.

1:34:13.100 --> 1:34:13.940
 Yes.

1:34:15.340 --> 1:34:19.100
 Is there some, for basic explanation purposes,

1:34:19.100 --> 1:34:23.300
 is there something to be said about strong interactions

1:34:23.300 --> 1:34:26.260
 in the context of the strong nuclear force

1:34:26.260 --> 1:34:30.800
 for the attraction between protons and neutrons

1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:35.340
 versus the interaction between quarks within protons?

1:34:35.340 --> 1:34:40.340
 Well, quarks and gluons have the same relation

1:34:40.620 --> 1:34:43.700
 basically to nuclear physics

1:34:43.700 --> 1:34:46.700
 as electrons and photons have

1:34:46.700 --> 1:34:49.780
 to atomic and molecular physics.

1:34:49.780 --> 1:34:54.780
 So atoms and photons are the dynamic entities

1:34:56.780 --> 1:35:01.580
 that really come into play in chemistry and atomic physics.

1:35:01.580 --> 1:35:03.220
 Of course, you have to have the atomic nuclei,

1:35:03.220 --> 1:35:07.060
 but those are small and relatively inert,

1:35:07.060 --> 1:35:09.440
 really the dynamical part.

1:35:09.440 --> 1:35:12.100
 And for most purposes of chemistry,

1:35:12.100 --> 1:35:14.200
 you just say that you have this tiny little nucleus,

1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:17.120
 which QCD gives you.

1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:17.960
 Don't worry about it.

1:35:17.960 --> 1:35:19.700
 It just, it's there.

1:35:19.700 --> 1:35:22.660
 The real action is the electrons moving around

1:35:22.660 --> 1:35:24.460
 and exchanging and things like that.

1:35:26.900 --> 1:35:29.340
 Okay, but we want it to understand the nucleus too.

1:35:29.340 --> 1:35:34.340
 And so atoms are sort of quantum mechanical clouds

1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.880
 of electrons held together by electrical forces,

1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:39.780
 which is photons.

1:35:39.780 --> 1:35:40.820
 And then this radiation,

1:35:40.820 --> 1:35:43.300
 which is another aspect of photons.

1:35:43.300 --> 1:35:44.560
 That's where all the fun happens

1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:45.900
 is the electrons and the photons.

1:35:45.900 --> 1:35:47.000
 Yeah, that's right.

1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:49.160
 And the nucleus are kind of the,

1:35:51.180 --> 1:35:53.920
 well, they give the positive charge

1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:55.760
 and most of the mass of matter,

1:35:55.760 --> 1:36:00.760
 but they don't, since they're so heavy,

1:36:01.180 --> 1:36:03.800
 they don't move very much in chemistry.

1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:07.920
 And I'm oversimplifying drastically.

1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:12.240
 They're not contributing much to the interaction in chemistry.

1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:13.680
 For most purposes in chemistry,

1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:16.120
 you can just idealize them as concentrations

1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:18.720
 of positive mass and charge that are,

1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:22.120
 you don't have to look inside,

1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:24.260
 but people are curious what's inside.

1:36:24.260 --> 1:36:29.260
 And that was a big thing on the agenda

1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:32.520
 of 20th century physics starting in the 19,

1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:34.520
 well, starting with the 20th century

1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:38.240
 and unfolding throughout of trying to understand

1:36:38.240 --> 1:36:41.600
 what forces held the atomic nucleus together,

1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:42.700
 what it was and so.

1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:49.640
 Anyway, the story that emerges from QCD

1:36:49.640 --> 1:36:54.640
 is that very similar to the way that,

1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:57.120
 well, broadly similar to the way

1:36:57.120 --> 1:37:01.080
 that clouds of electrons held together

1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:04.480
 by electrical forces give you atoms

1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:07.320
 and ultimately molecules.

1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:13.740
 Protons and neutrons are like atoms

1:37:13.740 --> 1:37:17.820
 made now out of quarks, quark clouds held together

1:37:17.820 --> 1:37:20.960
 by gluons, which are like the photons

1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:23.580
 that give the electric forces,

1:37:23.580 --> 1:37:26.480
 but this is giving a different force, the strong force.

1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:31.480
 And the residual forces between protons and neutrons

1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:36.800
 that are leftover from the basic binding

1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:40.120
 are like the residual forces between atoms

1:37:40.120 --> 1:37:43.560
 that give molecules, but in the case of protons and neutrons,

1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:45.400
 it gives you atomic nuclei.

1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:48.400
 So again, for definitional purposes,

1:37:48.400 --> 1:37:51.000
 QCD, quantum chromodynamics,

1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:54.040
 is basically the physics of strong interaction.

1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:56.580
 Yeah, we understand, we now would understand,

1:37:56.580 --> 1:37:58.680
 I think most physicists would say

1:37:58.680 --> 1:38:02.000
 it's the theory of quarks and gluons

1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:03.160
 and how they interact.

1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:07.840
 But it's a very precise, and I think it's fair to say,

1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:11.920
 very beautiful theory based on mathematical symmetry

1:38:11.920 --> 1:38:16.600
 of a high order, and another thing that's beautiful

1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:19.200
 about it is that it's kind of

1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:26.280
 in the same family as electrodynamics.

1:38:26.280 --> 1:38:31.200
 The conceptual structure of the equations are very similar.

1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:34.880
 They're based on having particles that respond to charge

1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:37.160
 in a very symmetric way.

1:38:37.160 --> 1:38:39.660
 In the case of electrodynamics,

1:38:39.660 --> 1:38:42.040
 it's photons that respond to electric charge.

1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:44.520
 In the case of quantum chromodynamics,

1:38:44.520 --> 1:38:47.520
 there are three kinds of charge that we call colors,

1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:49.320
 but they're nothing like colors.

1:38:49.320 --> 1:38:51.900
 They really are like different kinds of charge.

1:38:51.900 --> 1:38:54.560
 But they rhyme with the same kind of,

1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:56.600
 like it's similar kind of dynamics.

1:38:56.600 --> 1:38:57.920
 Similar kind of dynamics.

1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:02.920
 I'd like to say that QCD is like QED on steroids.

1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:05.920
 And instead of one photon, you have eight gluons.

1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:09.200
 Instead of one charge, you have three color charges.

1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:13.120
 But there's a strong family resemblance between them.

1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:16.880
 But the context in which QCD does this thing

1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:19.360
 is it's much higher energies.

1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:20.480
 Like that's where it comes to life.

1:39:20.480 --> 1:39:22.320
 Well, it's a stronger force,

1:39:22.320 --> 1:39:27.320
 so that to access how it works and kind of pry things apart,

1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:30.360
 you have to inject more energy.

1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:35.320
 And so that gives us, in some sense,

1:39:35.320 --> 1:39:39.440
 a hint of how things were in the earlier universe.

1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:41.120
 Yeah, well, in that regard,

1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:43.760
 asymptotic freedom is a tremendous blessing

1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:48.280
 because it means things get simpler at high energy.

1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:50.040
 The universe was born free.

1:39:50.040 --> 1:39:50.880
 Born free.

1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:52.640
 That's very good, yes.

1:39:52.640 --> 1:39:53.560
 Universe was born.

1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:56.560
 So in atomic physics,

1:39:56.560 --> 1:39:59.360
 a similar thing happens in the theory of stars.

1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:03.380
 Stars are hot enough that the interactions

1:40:03.380 --> 1:40:07.520
 between electrons and photons, they're liberated.

1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:08.680
 They don't form atoms anymore.

1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:09.640
 They make a plasma,

1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:12.320
 which in some ways is simpler to understand.

1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:14.640
 You don't have complicated chemistry.

1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:18.120
 And in the early universe, according to QCD,

1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:20.480
 similarly atomic nuclei dissolved

1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:22.880
 and take the constituent quarks and gluons,

1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:24.480
 which are moving around very fast

1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:27.020
 and interacting in relatively simple ways.

1:40:27.020 --> 1:40:30.560
 And so this opened up the early universe

1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:33.560
 to scientific calculation.

1:40:33.560 --> 1:40:35.840
 Can I ask you about some other weird particles

1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:37.920
 that make up our universe?

1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:39.740
 What are axions?

1:40:39.740 --> 1:40:42.640
 And what is the strong CP problem?

1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:47.640
 Okay, so let me start with what the strong CP problem is.

1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:53.720
 First of all, well, C is charge conjugation,

1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:57.600
 which is the transformation,

1:40:57.600 --> 1:40:59.940
 the notional transformation, if you like,

1:40:59.940 --> 1:41:03.360
 that changes all particles into their antiparticles.

1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:08.360
 And the concept of C symmetry,

1:41:09.140 --> 1:41:12.240
 charge conjugation symmetry, is that if you do that,

1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:15.440
 you find the same laws that would work.

1:41:16.760 --> 1:41:20.720
 So the laws are symmetric if the behavior

1:41:20.720 --> 1:41:22.800
 that particles exhibit is the same

1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:27.160
 as the behavior you get with all their antiparticles.

1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:31.360
 And then P is parity,

1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:35.260
 which is also called spatial inversion.

1:41:35.260 --> 1:41:39.040
 It's basically looking at a mirror universe

1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:41.960
 and saying that the laws that are obeyed

1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:44.160
 in a mirror universe, when you look,

1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:46.780
 that the mirror images obey the same laws

1:41:46.780 --> 1:41:50.480
 as the sources of their images.

1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:52.840
 There's no way of telling left from right, for instance,

1:41:52.840 --> 1:41:55.640
 that the laws don't distinguish between left and right.

1:41:55.640 --> 1:42:00.380
 Now, in the mid 20th century,

1:42:00.380 --> 1:42:03.620
 people discovered that both of those are not quite true.

1:42:05.160 --> 1:42:08.960
 Really, the equation that the mirror universe,

1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:13.960
 the universe that you see in a mirror

1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:18.480
 is not gonna obey the same laws

1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:23.480
 as the universe that we actually interpret.

1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:26.880
 You would be able to tell

1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:28.980
 if you did the right kind of experiments,

1:42:28.980 --> 1:42:31.520
 which was the mirror and which was the real thing.

1:42:33.700 --> 1:42:34.840
 Anyway, that.

1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:36.080
 That's the parity and they show

1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:37.920
 that the parity doesn't necessarily hold.

1:42:37.920 --> 1:42:39.080
 It doesn't quite hold.

1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:45.680
 Examining what the exceptions are turned out to be,

1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:47.400
 to lead to all kinds of insight

1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:49.840
 about the nature of fundamental interactions,

1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:51.640
 especially properties of neutrinos

1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:53.840
 and the weak interaction, it's a long story.

1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:55.480
 But it's a very, it's a.

1:42:55.480 --> 1:42:57.680
 So you just define the C and the P,

1:42:57.680 --> 1:42:59.480
 the conjugation, the charge conjugation.

1:42:59.480 --> 1:43:00.880
 Now that I've done that, I wanna.

1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:01.720
 What's the problem?

1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:02.560
 Shove them off.

1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:04.040
 Okay, great.

1:43:04.040 --> 1:43:06.520
 Because it's easier to talk about T,

1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:08.920
 which is time reversal symmetry.

1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:13.200
 We have very good reasons to think CPT

1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:17.180
 is an accurate symmetry of nature.

1:43:17.180 --> 1:43:19.400
 It's on the same level as relativity

1:43:19.400 --> 1:43:20.960
 and quantum mechanics, basically.

1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:22.600
 So that better be true.

1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:24.800
 Or else we.

1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:26.000
 So it's symmetric when you.

1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:26.840
 When you do.

1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:28.000
 When you do conjugation parity and time.

1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:30.960
 And time and space reversal.

1:43:30.960 --> 1:43:32.320
 If you do all three,

1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:35.320
 then you get the same physical consequences.

1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:39.700
 Now, so, but that means that CP is equivalent to T.

1:43:39.700 --> 1:43:41.640
 But what's observed in the world

1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:45.640
 is that T is not quite an accurate symmetry of nature,

1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:46.720
 either.

1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:51.720
 So most phenomena of, at the fundamental level.

1:43:52.320 --> 1:43:54.700
 So interactions among elementary particles

1:43:54.700 --> 1:43:57.540
 and the basic gravitational interaction.

1:43:59.240 --> 1:44:02.420
 If you ran them backwards in time,

1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:05.400
 you'd get the same laws.

1:44:05.400 --> 1:44:08.920
 So if, again, going back.

1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:11.500
 This time we don't talk about a mirror,

1:44:11.500 --> 1:44:13.220
 but we talk about a movie.

1:44:13.220 --> 1:44:17.940
 If you take a movie and then run it backwards,

1:44:18.820 --> 1:44:20.340
 that's the time reversal.

1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:23.400
 It's good to think about a mirror in time.

1:44:23.400 --> 1:44:25.220
 Yeah, it's like a mirror in time.

1:44:25.220 --> 1:44:29.120
 If you run the movie backwards,

1:44:29.120 --> 1:44:30.680
 it would look very strange

1:44:30.680 --> 1:44:32.800
 if you were looking at complicated objects

1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:37.360
 and a Charlie Chaplin movie or whatever.

1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:40.240
 It would look very strange if you ran it backwards in time.

1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:43.800
 But at the level of basic interactions,

1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:46.000
 if you were able to look at the atoms

1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:49.960
 and the quarks involved, they would obey the same laws.

1:44:49.960 --> 1:44:53.360
 They do a very good approximation, but not exactly.

1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:55.960
 So this is not exactly, that means you could tell.

1:44:55.960 --> 1:44:59.800
 You could tell, but you'd have to do very, very

1:44:59.800 --> 1:45:04.680
 subtle experiments with at high energy accelerators

1:45:04.680 --> 1:45:06.760
 to take a movie that looked different

1:45:06.760 --> 1:45:08.760
 when you ran it backwards.

1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:13.760
 This was a discovery by two great physicists

1:45:13.800 --> 1:45:18.800
 named Jim Cronin and Val Fitch in the mid 1960s.

1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:22.520
 Previous to that, over all the centuries

1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:25.260
 of development of physics with all its precise laws,

1:45:25.260 --> 1:45:28.920
 they did seem to have this gratuitous property

1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:33.040
 that they look the same if you run the equations backwards.

1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:35.320
 It's kind of an embarrassing property actually

1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:38.560
 because life isn't like that.

1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:41.880
 So empirical reality does not have this imagery

1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:42.900
 in any obvious way.

1:45:42.900 --> 1:45:44.960
 And yet the laws did.

1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:46.320
 It's almost like the laws of physics

1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:48.740
 are missing something fundamental about life

1:45:48.740 --> 1:45:51.400
 if it holds that property, right?

1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:54.360
 Well, that's the embarrassing nature of it.

1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:55.240
 Yeah, it's embarrassing.

1:45:55.240 --> 1:46:00.240
 Well, people worked hard at what's,

1:46:01.080 --> 1:46:04.840
 this is a problem that's thought to belong

1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:07.160
 to the foundations of statistical mechanics

1:46:07.160 --> 1:46:10.560
 or the foundations of thermodynamics

1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:14.960
 to understand how behavior,

1:46:14.960 --> 1:46:18.780
 which is grossly not symmetric

1:46:18.780 --> 1:46:21.280
 with respect to reversing the direction of time

1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:24.360
 in large objects, how that can emerge from equations

1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:28.120
 which are symmetric with respect to changing

1:46:28.120 --> 1:46:31.080
 the direction of time to a very good approximation.

1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:33.200
 And that's still an interesting endeavor.

1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:35.200
 That's interesting.

1:46:35.200 --> 1:46:38.640
 And actually it's an exciting frontier of physics now

1:46:38.640 --> 1:46:40.200
 to sort of explore the boundary

1:46:40.200 --> 1:46:42.360
 between when that's true and when it's not true.

1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:44.520
 When you get to smaller objects

1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:46.680
 and exceptions like time crystals.

1:46:47.600 --> 1:46:49.480
 I definitely have to ask you about time crystals

1:46:49.480 --> 1:46:50.320
 in a second here.

1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:53.680
 But so the CP problem and T,

1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:55.680
 so there's all of these.

1:46:55.680 --> 1:46:57.580
 We're in danger of infinite regress,

1:46:57.580 --> 1:46:59.240
 but we have to convert soon.

1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:00.080
 So.

1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:02.160
 Can't possibly be turtles all the way down.

1:47:02.160 --> 1:47:03.440
 We're gonna get to the bottom turtle.

1:47:03.440 --> 1:47:06.280
 So it became,

1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:08.880
 so it got to be a real,

1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:11.200
 I mean, it's a really puzzling thing

1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:15.340
 why the laws should have this very odd property

1:47:15.340 --> 1:47:16.840
 that we don't need.

1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:20.000
 And in fact, it's kind of an embarrassment

1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:22.180
 in addressing empirical reality.

1:47:22.180 --> 1:47:24.680
 But it seemed to be almost,

1:47:24.680 --> 1:47:26.960
 it seemed to be exactly true for a long time.

1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:29.280
 And then almost true.

1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:33.760
 And in way, almost true is even,

1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:35.600
 is more disturbing than exactly true

1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:37.400
 because exactly true,

1:47:37.400 --> 1:47:39.800
 it could have been just a fundamental feature of the world.

1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:42.300
 And at some level you just have to take it as it is.

1:47:42.300 --> 1:47:47.300
 And if it's a beautiful, easily articulatable regularity,

1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:48.700
 you could say that, okay,

1:47:48.700 --> 1:47:51.760
 that's fine as a fundamental law of nature.

1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:53.440
 But to say that it's approximately true,

1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:56.400
 but not exactly, that's weird.

1:47:56.400 --> 1:48:00.920
 So, and then, so there was great progress

1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:05.220
 in the late part of the 20th century

1:48:06.860 --> 1:48:09.260
 in getting to an understanding

1:48:09.260 --> 1:48:11.680
 of fundamental interactions in general

1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:13.680
 that shed light on this issue.

1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:19.800
 It turns out that the basic principles of relativity

1:48:20.900 --> 1:48:22.240
 and quantum mechanics,

1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:27.240
 plus the kind of high degree of symmetry that we found,

1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:28.960
 the so called gauge symmetry

1:48:28.960 --> 1:48:31.980
 that characterizes the fundamental interactions,

1:48:31.980 --> 1:48:33.800
 when you put all that together,

1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:36.560
 it's a very, very constraining framework.

1:48:37.620 --> 1:48:40.560
 And it has some indirect consequences

1:48:42.500 --> 1:48:45.960
 because the possible interactions are so constrained.

1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:48.640
 And one of the indirect consequences

1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:53.640
 is that the possibilities for violating the symmetry

1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:57.920
 between forwards and backwards in time are very limited.

1:48:57.920 --> 1:48:59.400
 They're basically only two.

1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:05.120
 And one of them occurs and leads to a very rich theory

1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:07.600
 that explains the Cronin Fish experiment

1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:09.700
 and a lot of things that have been done subsequently

1:49:09.700 --> 1:49:13.680
 has been used to make all kinds of successful predictions.

1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:18.680
 So that's turned out to be a very rich interaction.

1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:23.160
 It's esoteric and the effects only show up at accelerators

1:49:23.160 --> 1:49:24.360
 and are small and so on,

1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:26.480
 but they might've been very important in the early universe

1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:29.760
 and lead to them be connected to the asymmetry

1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:32.560
 between matter and antimatter in the present universe.

1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:35.420
 And so, but that's another digression.

1:49:36.380 --> 1:49:40.080
 The point is that that was fine.

1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:41.620
 That was a triumph to say

1:49:41.620 --> 1:49:44.920
 that there was one possible kind of interaction

1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:47.320
 that would violate time reversal symmetry.

1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:49.500
 And sure enough, there it is.

1:49:49.500 --> 1:49:54.500
 But the other kind doesn't occur.

1:49:54.760 --> 1:49:55.920
 So we still got a problem.

1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:57.040
 Why doesn't it occur?

1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:01.800
 So we're close to really finally understanding

1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:04.760
 this profound gratuitous feature of the world

1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:08.380
 that is almost but not quite symmetric

1:50:08.380 --> 1:50:12.240
 under reversing the direction of time, but not quite there.

1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:17.080
 And to understand that last bit

1:50:18.520 --> 1:50:21.820
 is a challenging frontier of physics today.

1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:27.520
 And we have a promising proposal for how it works,

1:50:27.520 --> 1:50:29.940
 which is a kind of theory of evolution.

1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:35.600
 So there's this possible interaction,

1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:37.320
 which we call a coupling,

1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:39.120
 and there's a numerical quantity

1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:41.480
 that tells us how strong that is.

1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:43.640
 And traditionally in physics,

1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:46.400
 we think of these kinds of numerical quantities

1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:51.400
 as constants of nature that you just have to put them in.

1:50:54.220 --> 1:50:57.040
 From experiment, they have a certain value and that's it.

1:50:57.040 --> 1:51:01.760
 And who am I to question what God doing?

1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:02.720
 They're just constant.

1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:04.620
 Well, they seem to be just constants.

1:51:04.620 --> 1:51:06.060
 I'm just wondering.

1:51:06.060 --> 1:51:10.340
 But in this case,

1:51:10.340 --> 1:51:15.140
 it's been fruitful to think and work out a theory

1:51:15.140 --> 1:51:20.140
 where that strength of interaction

1:51:22.260 --> 1:51:23.900
 is actually not a constant.

1:51:23.900 --> 1:51:27.220
 It's a fun, it's a field.

1:51:27.220 --> 1:51:31.560
 It's a, fields are the fundamental ingredients

1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:32.420
 of modern physics.

1:51:32.420 --> 1:51:34.060
 Like there's an electron field,

1:51:34.060 --> 1:51:35.180
 there's a photon field,

1:51:35.180 --> 1:51:37.180
 which is also called the electromagnetic field.

1:51:37.180 --> 1:51:39.240
 And so all of these particles

1:51:39.240 --> 1:51:41.700
 are manifestations of different fields.

1:51:41.700 --> 1:51:45.300
 And there could be a field,

1:51:45.300 --> 1:51:47.740
 something that depends on space and time.

1:51:47.740 --> 1:51:52.740
 So a dynamical entity instead of just a constant here.

1:51:53.100 --> 1:51:57.660
 And if you do things in a nice way,

1:51:57.660 --> 1:51:58.720
 that's very symmetric,

1:51:58.720 --> 1:52:02.200
 very much suggested aesthetically by the theory.

1:52:02.200 --> 1:52:05.160
 But the theory we do have,

1:52:05.160 --> 1:52:10.080
 then you find that you get a field

1:52:11.160 --> 1:52:15.580
 which as it evolves from the early universe,

1:52:17.240 --> 1:52:20.840
 settles down to a value

1:52:22.160 --> 1:52:27.160
 that's just right to make the laws

1:52:27.160 --> 1:52:32.160
 very nearly exact, invariant or symmetric

1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:33.640
 with respect to reversal of time.

1:52:33.640 --> 1:52:34.760
 It might appear as a constant,

1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:36.640
 but it's actually a field that evolved over time.

1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:38.500
 It evolved over time, okay.

1:52:38.500 --> 1:52:42.160
 But when you examine this proposal in detail,

1:52:42.160 --> 1:52:47.160
 you find that it hasn't quite settled down to exactly zero.

1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:48.720
 There it's still,

1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:52.040
 the field is still moving around a little bit.

1:52:52.040 --> 1:52:55.660
 And because the motion is so,

1:52:55.660 --> 1:52:59.460
 the motion is so difficult.

1:52:59.460 --> 1:53:00.820
 The material is so rigid.

1:53:00.820 --> 1:53:01.660
 And this material,

1:53:01.660 --> 1:53:03.980
 the field that fills all space is so rigid.

1:53:03.980 --> 1:53:07.200
 Even small amounts of motion can involve lots of energy.

1:53:08.200 --> 1:53:13.200
 And that energy takes the form of particles,

1:53:14.740 --> 1:53:16.740
 fields that are in motion

1:53:16.740 --> 1:53:18.500
 are always associated with particles.

1:53:18.500 --> 1:53:20.500
 And those are the axioms.

1:53:20.500 --> 1:53:23.380
 And if you calculate how much energy

1:53:23.380 --> 1:53:26.620
 is in these residual oscillations,

1:53:26.620 --> 1:53:30.260
 this axiom gas that fills all the universe,

1:53:30.260 --> 1:53:32.300
 if this fundamental theory is correct,

1:53:32.300 --> 1:53:36.460
 you get just the right amount

1:53:36.460 --> 1:53:39.300
 to make the dark matter that astronomers want.

1:53:39.300 --> 1:53:41.780
 And it has just the right properties.

1:53:41.780 --> 1:53:44.260
 So I'd love to believe that.

1:53:44.260 --> 1:53:47.680
 So that might be a thing that unlocks,

1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:50.180
 might be the key to understanding dark matter.

1:53:50.180 --> 1:53:51.540
 Yeah, I'd like to think so.

1:53:51.540 --> 1:53:53.380
 And many, many physicists are coming around

1:53:53.380 --> 1:53:54.220
 to this point of view,

1:53:54.220 --> 1:53:58.100
 which I've been a voice in the wilderness.

1:53:58.100 --> 1:54:00.620
 I was a voice in the wilderness for a long time,

1:54:00.620 --> 1:54:04.620
 but now it's become very popular, maybe even dominant.

1:54:04.620 --> 1:54:05.460
 So almost like,

1:54:05.460 --> 1:54:10.460
 so this axion particle slash field

1:54:10.660 --> 1:54:13.980
 would be the thing that explains dark matter.

1:54:13.980 --> 1:54:14.820
 It explains, yeah,

1:54:14.820 --> 1:54:17.940
 would solve this fundamental question of finally,

1:54:17.940 --> 1:54:22.940
 of why the laws are almost, but not quite exactly the same

1:54:24.620 --> 1:54:26.540
 if you run them backwards in time.

1:54:26.540 --> 1:54:30.380
 And then seemingly in a totally different

1:54:30.380 --> 1:54:31.880
 conceptual universe,

1:54:32.740 --> 1:54:35.300
 it would also provide,

1:54:35.300 --> 1:54:38.020
 give us an understanding of the dark matter.

1:54:38.020 --> 1:54:41.580
 That's not what it was designed for.

1:54:41.580 --> 1:54:45.060
 And the theory wasn't proposed with that in mind,

1:54:45.060 --> 1:54:47.940
 but when you work out the equations, that's what you get.

1:54:47.940 --> 1:54:49.060
 That's always a good sign.

1:54:49.060 --> 1:54:49.900
 Yes.

1:54:51.020 --> 1:54:53.840
 I think I vaguely read somewhere

1:54:53.840 --> 1:54:58.840
 that there may be early experimental validation of axion.

1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:03.120
 Is that, am I reading the wrong?

1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:05.580
 Well, there've been quite a few false alarms

1:55:05.580 --> 1:55:08.100
 and I think there are some of them still,

1:55:08.100 --> 1:55:10.100
 people desperately wanna find this thing.

1:55:10.100 --> 1:55:15.100
 And, but I don't think any of them are convincing

1:55:15.300 --> 1:55:16.140
 at this point,

1:55:16.140 --> 1:55:20.460
 but there are very ambitious experiments

1:55:20.460 --> 1:55:23.000
 and kind of new,

1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:24.940
 you have to design new kinds of antennas

1:55:24.940 --> 1:55:28.340
 that are capable of detecting these predicted particles.

1:55:28.340 --> 1:55:29.900
 And it's very difficult.

1:55:29.900 --> 1:55:31.380
 They interact very, very weakly.

1:55:31.380 --> 1:55:33.740
 If it were easy, it would have been done already.

1:55:33.740 --> 1:55:37.060
 But I think there's good hope

1:55:37.060 --> 1:55:40.980
 that we can get down to the required sensitivity

1:55:40.980 --> 1:55:43.180
 and actually test whether these ideas are right

1:55:44.740 --> 1:55:47.420
 in coming years or maybe decades.

1:55:47.420 --> 1:55:50.460
 And then understand one of the big mysteries,

1:55:50.460 --> 1:55:53.940
 like literally big in terms of its fraction

1:55:53.940 --> 1:55:55.460
 of the universe is dark matter.

1:55:55.460 --> 1:55:56.620
 Yes.

1:55:56.620 --> 1:55:59.020
 Let me ask you about, you mentioned a few times,

1:55:59.020 --> 1:56:00.020
 time crystals.

1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:02.860
 What are they?

1:56:02.860 --> 1:56:05.340
 These things are, it's a very beautiful idea

1:56:05.340 --> 1:56:08.820
 when we start to treat space and time

1:56:10.100 --> 1:56:13.740
 as similar frameworks.

1:56:13.740 --> 1:56:14.580
 Yes, right.

1:56:14.580 --> 1:56:15.420
 Physical phenomena.

1:56:15.420 --> 1:56:17.500
 Right, that's what motivated it.

1:56:17.500 --> 1:56:19.220
 First of all, what are crystals?

1:56:19.220 --> 1:56:20.060
 Yeah.

1:56:20.060 --> 1:56:20.900
 And what are time crystals?

1:56:20.900 --> 1:56:24.540
 Okay, so crystals are orderly arrangements

1:56:24.540 --> 1:56:27.340
 of atoms in space.

1:56:27.340 --> 1:56:30.740
 And many materials,

1:56:30.740 --> 1:56:35.740
 if you cool them down gently, will form crystals.

1:56:38.580 --> 1:56:43.580
 And so we say that that's a state of matter

1:56:43.900 --> 1:56:45.940
 that forms spontaneously.

1:56:45.940 --> 1:56:50.220
 And an important feature of that state of matter

1:56:50.220 --> 1:56:53.900
 is that the end result, the crystal,

1:56:53.900 --> 1:56:58.900
 has less symmetry than the equations

1:57:01.460 --> 1:57:03.100
 that give rise to the crystal.

1:57:03.100 --> 1:57:07.500
 So the equations, the basic equations of physics

1:57:09.260 --> 1:57:12.740
 are the same if you move a little bit.

1:57:12.740 --> 1:57:15.620
 So you can move, they're homogeneous,

1:57:15.620 --> 1:57:16.820
 but crystals aren't.

1:57:16.820 --> 1:57:18.540
 The atoms are in particular place,

1:57:18.540 --> 1:57:20.260
 so they have less symmetry.

1:57:20.260 --> 1:57:25.260
 And time crystals are the same thing in time, basically.

1:57:27.060 --> 1:57:30.220
 But of course, so it's not positions of atoms,

1:57:30.220 --> 1:57:35.220
 but it's orderly behavior that certain states of matter

1:57:38.220 --> 1:57:41.020
 will arrange themselves into spontaneously

1:57:41.020 --> 1:57:44.780
 if you treat them gently

1:57:44.780 --> 1:57:46.780
 and let them do what they want to do.

1:57:46.780 --> 1:57:50.040
 But repeat in that same way indefinitely.

1:57:50.040 --> 1:57:51.460
 That's the crystalline form.

1:57:51.460 --> 1:57:54.940
 You can also have time liquids,

1:57:54.940 --> 1:57:57.420
 or you can have all kinds of other states of matter.

1:57:57.420 --> 1:57:58.960
 You can also have space time crystals

1:57:58.960 --> 1:58:03.740
 where the pattern only repeats if with each step of time,

1:58:03.740 --> 1:58:07.300
 you also move at a certain direction in space.

1:58:07.300 --> 1:58:12.300
 So yeah, basically it's states of matter

1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:17.680
 that displace structure in time spontaneously.

1:58:17.680 --> 1:58:21.120
 So here's the difference.

1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:22.800
 When it happens in time,

1:58:24.900 --> 1:58:27.800
 it sure looks a lot like it's motion,

1:58:27.800 --> 1:58:29.480
 and if it repeats indefinitely,

1:58:29.480 --> 1:58:32.040
 it sure looks a lot like perpetual motion.

1:58:32.040 --> 1:58:32.880
 Yeah.

1:58:32.880 --> 1:58:35.080
 Like looks like free lunch.

1:58:35.080 --> 1:58:39.280
 And I was told that there's no such thing as free lunch.

1:58:39.280 --> 1:58:42.480
 Does this violate laws of thermodynamics?

1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:45.640
 No, but it requires a critical examination

1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:47.920
 of the laws of thermodynamics.

1:58:47.920 --> 1:58:49.840
 I mean, let me say on background

1:58:49.840 --> 1:58:51.560
 that the laws of thermodynamics

1:58:51.560 --> 1:58:55.420
 are not fundamental laws of physics.

1:58:55.420 --> 1:58:56.760
 There are things we prove

1:58:58.920 --> 1:59:01.160
 under certain circumstances emerge

1:59:01.160 --> 1:59:03.400
 from the fundamental laws of physics.

1:59:03.400 --> 1:59:06.680
 They're not, we don't posit them separately.

1:59:06.680 --> 1:59:08.300
 They're meant to be deduced,

1:59:08.300 --> 1:59:10.600
 and they can be deduced under limited circumstances,

1:59:10.600 --> 1:59:12.820
 but not necessarily universally.

1:59:12.820 --> 1:59:15.560
 And we're finding some of the subtleties

1:59:15.560 --> 1:59:18.360
 and sort of accept edge cases

1:59:18.360 --> 1:59:21.060
 where they don't apply in a straightforward way.

1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:23.560
 And this is one.

1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:27.680
 So time crystals do obey,

1:59:27.680 --> 1:59:30.400
 do have this structure in time,

1:59:30.400 --> 1:59:31.980
 but it's not a free lunch

1:59:31.980 --> 1:59:35.740
 because although in a sense, things are moving,

1:59:36.680 --> 1:59:39.100
 they're already doing what they want to do.

1:59:39.100 --> 1:59:40.400
 They're in the,

1:59:40.400 --> 1:59:44.080
 so if you want to extract energy from it,

1:59:44.080 --> 1:59:44.920
 you're gonna be foiled

1:59:44.920 --> 1:59:47.880
 because there's no spare energy there.

1:59:50.360 --> 1:59:53.900
 So you can add energy to it and kind of disturb it,

1:59:53.900 --> 1:59:58.380
 but you can't extract energy from this motion

1:59:58.380 --> 2:00:00.400
 because it's gonna, it wants to do,

2:00:00.400 --> 2:00:03.420
 that's the lowest energy configuration that there is,

2:00:03.420 --> 2:00:06.120
 so you can't get further energy out of it.

2:00:06.120 --> 2:00:08.680
 So in theory, I guess perpetual motion,

2:00:10.200 --> 2:00:13.080
 you would be able to extract energy from it

2:00:13.080 --> 2:00:15.080
 if such a thing was to be created,

2:00:15.080 --> 2:00:17.080
 you can then milk it for energy.

2:00:17.080 --> 2:00:20.320
 Well, what's usually meant

2:00:20.320 --> 2:00:23.040
 in the literature of perpetual motion

2:00:23.040 --> 2:00:27.560
 is a kind of macroscopic motion

2:00:27.560 --> 2:00:29.400
 that you could extract energy from

2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:33.540
 and somehow it would crank back up.

2:00:33.540 --> 2:00:35.160
 That's not the case here.

2:00:35.160 --> 2:00:36.760
 If you want to extract energy,

2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:42.160
 this motion is not something you can extract energy from.

2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:45.400
 If you intervene in the behavior,

2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:48.960
 you can change it, but only by injecting energy,

2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:51.120
 not by taking away energy.

2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:54.160
 You mentioned that a theory of everything

2:00:54.160 --> 2:00:56.480
 may be quite difficult to come by.

2:00:56.480 --> 2:00:58.520
 A theory of everything broadly defined

2:00:58.520 --> 2:01:00.760
 meaning like truly a theory of everything,

2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:03.120
 but let's look at a more narrow theory of everything,

2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:07.160
 which is the way it's used often in physics

2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:12.160
 is a theory that unifies our current laws of physics,

2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:19.480
 general relativity, quantum field theory.

2:01:19.480 --> 2:01:22.680
 Do you have thoughts on this dream

2:01:22.680 --> 2:01:25.380
 of a theory of everything in physics?

2:01:25.380 --> 2:01:26.640
 How close are we?

2:01:26.640 --> 2:01:29.480
 Is there any promising ideas out there in your view?

2:01:29.480 --> 2:01:31.120
 Well, it would be nice to have.

2:01:32.380 --> 2:01:34.080
 It would be aesthetically pleasing.

2:01:35.480 --> 2:01:36.780
 Will it be useful?

2:01:36.780 --> 2:01:38.520
 No, probably not.

2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:43.220
 Well, I shouldn't, it's dangerous to say that,

2:01:43.220 --> 2:01:45.040
 but probably not.

2:01:45.040 --> 2:01:50.040
 I think we, certainly not in the foreseeable future.

2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:54.240
 Maybe to understand black holes.

2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:57.520
 Yeah, but that's, yes, maybe to understand black holes,

2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:00.400
 but that's not useful.

2:02:00.400 --> 2:02:02.700
 That's my book.

2:02:02.700 --> 2:02:04.960
 And well, not only, I mean,

2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:08.320
 to understand it's worse,

2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:09.520
 it's not useful in the sense

2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:12.880
 that we're not gonna be basing any technology anytime soon

2:02:12.880 --> 2:02:16.020
 on black holes, but it's more severe than that,

2:02:16.020 --> 2:02:19.840
 I would say it's that the kinds of questions

2:02:19.840 --> 2:02:24.200
 about black holes that we can't answer

2:02:24.200 --> 2:02:26.480
 within the framework of existing theory

2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:33.480
 are ones that are not going to be susceptible

2:02:33.480 --> 2:02:37.620
 to astronomical observation in the foreseeable future.

2:02:37.620 --> 2:02:41.480
 They're questions about very, very small black holes

2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:44.960
 when quantum effects come into play

2:02:46.720 --> 2:02:48.000
 so that black holes are,

2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:54.900
 not black holes, they're emitting this discovery

2:02:54.900 --> 2:02:57.100
 of Hawking called Hawking radiation,

2:02:57.100 --> 2:03:01.040
 which for astronomical black holes is a tiny, tiny effect

2:03:01.040 --> 2:03:03.600
 that no one has ever observed, it's a prediction

2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:04.440
 that's never been checked.

2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:06.720
 So like supermassive black holes, that doesn't apply?

2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:11.240
 No, no, the predicted rate of radiation

2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:13.600
 from those black holes is so tiny

2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:15.480
 that it's absolutely unobservable

2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:17.920
 and is overwhelmed by all kinds of other effects.

2:03:21.480 --> 2:03:24.420
 So it's not practical in the sense of technology,

2:03:24.420 --> 2:03:26.400
 it's not even practical in the sense

2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:31.400
 of application to astronomy, our existing theory

2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:37.800
 of general relativity and quantum theory

2:03:37.800 --> 2:03:41.680
 and our theory of the different fundamental forces

2:03:41.680 --> 2:03:46.680
 is perfectly adequate to all problems of technology,

2:03:46.680 --> 2:03:51.680
 of technology, for sure, and almost all problems

2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:03.080
 of astrophysics and cosmology that appear

2:04:03.080 --> 2:04:06.560
 except with the notable exception

2:04:06.560 --> 2:04:09.480
 of the extremely early universe, if you want to ask,

2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:11.120
 what happened before the Big Bang

2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:13.020
 or what happened right at the Big Bang,

2:04:13.020 --> 2:04:17.300
 which would be a great thing to understand, of course.

2:04:17.300 --> 2:04:19.140
 Yes. We don't, but.

2:04:19.140 --> 2:04:21.100
 But what about the engineering question?

2:04:21.100 --> 2:04:23.900
 So if we look at space travel,

2:04:23.900 --> 2:04:28.420
 so I think you've spoken with him, Eric Weinstein.

2:04:28.420 --> 2:04:31.900
 Oh, yeah. Really, you know,

2:04:31.900 --> 2:04:36.020
 he says things like we want to get off this planet.

2:04:36.020 --> 2:04:39.140
 His intuition is almost motivated

2:04:39.140 --> 2:04:42.300
 for the engineering project of space exploration

2:04:42.300 --> 2:04:44.700
 in order for us to crack this problem

2:04:44.700 --> 2:04:47.460
 of becoming a multi planetary species,

2:04:47.460 --> 2:04:49.320
 we have to solve the physics problem.

2:04:49.320 --> 2:04:51.460
 His intuition is like, if we figure out this,

2:04:51.460 --> 2:04:55.020
 what he calls the source code, which is like,

2:04:55.980 --> 2:05:00.660
 like a theory of everything might give us clues

2:05:00.660 --> 2:05:04.260
 on how to start hacking the fabric of reality,

2:05:04.260 --> 2:05:06.460
 like getting shortcuts, right?

2:05:06.460 --> 2:05:08.820
 It might. I can't say that, you know,

2:05:08.820 --> 2:05:10.100
 I can't say that it won't,

2:05:10.100 --> 2:05:15.100
 but I can say that in the 1970s and early 1980s,

2:05:16.380 --> 2:05:21.380
 we achieved huge steps in understanding matter.

2:05:23.860 --> 2:05:28.780
 QCD, much better understanding of the weak interaction,

2:05:28.780 --> 2:05:32.460
 much better understanding of quantum mechanics in general.

2:05:32.460 --> 2:05:36.460
 And it's had minimal impact on technology.

2:05:36.460 --> 2:05:38.180
 On rocket design, on propulsion.

2:05:38.180 --> 2:05:42.620
 On rocket design, on anything, any technology whatsoever.

2:05:42.620 --> 2:05:46.360
 And now we're talking about much more esoteric things.

2:05:46.360 --> 2:05:48.800
 And since I don't know what they are,

2:05:48.800 --> 2:05:51.180
 I can't say for sure that they won't affect technology,

2:05:51.180 --> 2:05:52.700
 but I'm very, very skeptical

2:05:52.700 --> 2:05:55.000
 that they would affect technology.

2:05:57.780 --> 2:05:59.680
 Because, you know, to access them,

2:05:59.680 --> 2:06:02.460
 you need very exotic circumstances

2:06:02.460 --> 2:06:04.620
 to make new kinds of particles with high energy.

2:06:04.620 --> 2:06:07.860
 You need accelerators that are very expensive

2:06:07.860 --> 2:06:09.780
 and you don't produce many of them, and so forth.

2:06:09.780 --> 2:06:13.060
 You know, it's just, it's a pipe dream, I think.

2:06:13.060 --> 2:06:15.380
 Yeah, about space exploration.

2:06:15.380 --> 2:06:18.140
 I'm not sure exactly what he has in mind,

2:06:18.140 --> 2:06:23.140
 but to me, it's more a problem of,

2:06:26.700 --> 2:06:29.380
 I don't know, something between biology and...

2:06:29.380 --> 2:06:34.380
 And information processing.

2:06:34.380 --> 2:06:36.980
 Processing, what you mean, how should I...

2:06:37.980 --> 2:06:42.140
 I think human bodies are not well adapted to space.

2:06:43.700 --> 2:06:46.380
 Even Mars, which is the closest thing

2:06:46.380 --> 2:06:49.140
 to a kind of human environment

2:06:49.140 --> 2:06:51.140
 that we're gonna find anywhere close by.

2:06:52.340 --> 2:06:55.880
 Very, very difficult to maintain humans on Mars.

2:06:57.300 --> 2:07:02.300
 And it's gonna be very expensive and very unstable.

2:07:02.300 --> 2:07:07.300
 But I think, however, if we take a broader view

2:07:09.520 --> 2:07:14.520
 of what it means to bring human civilization

2:07:17.460 --> 2:07:20.660
 outside of the Earth, if we're satisfied

2:07:20.660 --> 2:07:25.380
 with sending mines out there that we can converse with

2:07:25.380 --> 2:07:29.180
 and actuators that we can manipulate

2:07:29.180 --> 2:07:33.780
 and sensors that we can get feedback from,

2:07:33.780 --> 2:07:37.180
 I think that's where it's at.

2:07:37.180 --> 2:07:41.580
 And I think that's so much more realistic.

2:07:41.580 --> 2:07:45.820
 And I think that's the long term future

2:07:45.820 --> 2:07:48.180
 of space exploration.

2:07:48.180 --> 2:07:50.660
 It's not hauling human bodies all over the place.

2:07:50.660 --> 2:07:52.840
 That's just silly.

2:07:54.100 --> 2:07:56.780
 It's possible that human bodies...

2:07:56.780 --> 2:07:59.100
 So like you said, it's a biology problem.

2:07:59.100 --> 2:08:03.540
 What's possible is that we extend human life span

2:08:03.540 --> 2:08:07.540
 in some way, we have to look at a bigger picture.

2:08:07.540 --> 2:08:09.420
 It could be just like you're saying,

2:08:09.420 --> 2:08:12.420
 by sending robots with actuators

2:08:12.420 --> 2:08:16.540
 and kind of extending our limbs.

2:08:16.540 --> 2:08:19.180
 But it could also be extending some aspect of our minds,

2:08:19.180 --> 2:08:20.380
 some information, all those kinds of things.

2:08:20.380 --> 2:08:23.820
 And it could be cyborgs, it could be, it could be...

2:08:23.820 --> 2:08:26.620
 No, we're talking, not getting the fun.

2:08:26.620 --> 2:08:31.620
 It could be, you know, it could be human brains

2:08:32.140 --> 2:08:34.340
 or cells that realize something

2:08:34.340 --> 2:08:36.860
 like human brain architecture

2:08:36.860 --> 2:08:41.860
 within artificial environments,

2:08:42.580 --> 2:08:44.860
 you know, shells, if you like,

2:08:44.860 --> 2:08:47.780
 that are more adapted to the conditions of space.

2:08:47.780 --> 2:08:52.780
 And that, yeah, so that's entirely man machine hybrids,

2:08:52.780 --> 2:08:57.780
 as well as sort of remote outposts

2:08:57.940 --> 2:08:59.220
 that we can communicate with.

2:08:59.220 --> 2:09:01.660
 I think those will happen.

2:09:02.500 --> 2:09:05.300
 Yeah, to me, there's some sense in which,

2:09:05.300 --> 2:09:07.340
 as opposed to understanding the physics

2:09:07.340 --> 2:09:12.340
 of the fundamental fabric of the universe,

2:09:15.100 --> 2:09:17.380
 I think getting to the physics of life,

2:09:17.380 --> 2:09:18.740
 the physics of intelligence,

2:09:18.740 --> 2:09:20.860
 the physics of consciousness will,

2:09:20.860 --> 2:09:25.860
 the physics of information that brings,

2:09:27.900 --> 2:09:29.380
 from which life emerges,

2:09:29.380 --> 2:09:32.140
 that will allow us to do space exploration.

2:09:32.140 --> 2:09:34.700
 Yeah, well, I think physics in the larger sense

2:09:34.700 --> 2:09:36.860
 has a lot to contribute here.

2:09:36.860 --> 2:09:39.980
 Not the physics of finding fundamental new laws

2:09:39.980 --> 2:09:44.820
 in the sense of another quark or axions even.

2:09:44.820 --> 2:09:49.820
 But physics in the sense of,

2:09:51.460 --> 2:09:53.500
 physics has a lot of experience

2:09:53.500 --> 2:09:56.660
 in analyzing complex situations

2:09:56.660 --> 2:09:58.260
 and analyzing new states of matter

2:09:58.260 --> 2:10:00.180
 and devising new kinds of instruments

2:10:00.180 --> 2:10:01.580
 that do clever things.

2:10:01.580 --> 2:10:05.940
 Physics in that sense has enormous amounts

2:10:05.940 --> 2:10:09.980
 to contribute to this kind of endeavor.

2:10:09.980 --> 2:10:13.180
 But I don't think that looking

2:10:13.180 --> 2:10:16.620
 for a so called theory of everything

2:10:16.620 --> 2:10:19.020
 has much to do with it at all.

2:10:19.020 --> 2:10:24.020
 What advice would you give to a young person today

2:10:24.820 --> 2:10:26.380
 with a bit of fire in their eyes,

2:10:26.380 --> 2:10:28.100
 high school student, college student,

2:10:28.100 --> 2:10:30.460
 thinking about what to do with their life,

2:10:30.460 --> 2:10:35.060
 maybe advice about career or bigger advice

2:10:35.060 --> 2:10:36.220
 about life in general?

2:10:37.460 --> 2:10:38.900
 Well, first read fundamentals

2:10:38.900 --> 2:10:43.900
 because there I've tried to give some coherent deep advice.

2:10:45.780 --> 2:10:50.140
 That's fundamentals, 10 keys to reality by Frank Kulczyk.

2:10:50.140 --> 2:10:50.980
 So that's a good place to start.

2:10:50.980 --> 2:10:52.260
 Available everywhere.

2:10:52.260 --> 2:10:55.180
 If you wanna learn what I can tell you.

2:10:56.820 --> 2:10:57.740
 Is there an audio book?

2:10:57.740 --> 2:10:58.580
 I read that ebook.

2:10:58.580 --> 2:10:59.420
 Yes, there is an audio book.

2:10:59.420 --> 2:11:00.860
 There's an audio book, that's awesome.

2:11:00.860 --> 2:11:05.220
 I think it's, I can give three pieces of wise advice

2:11:05.220 --> 2:11:08.340
 that I think are generally applicable.

2:11:08.340 --> 2:11:11.780
 One is to cast a wide net,

2:11:13.580 --> 2:11:18.580
 to really look around and see what looks promising,

2:11:19.460 --> 2:11:22.460
 what catches your imagination and promising.

2:11:25.860 --> 2:11:28.380
 Yeah, and those, you have to balance those two things.

2:11:28.380 --> 2:11:30.060
 You could have things that catch your imagination,

2:11:30.060 --> 2:11:32.420
 but don't look promising in the sense

2:11:32.420 --> 2:11:34.580
 that the questions aren't ripe or,

2:11:34.580 --> 2:11:37.900
 and things that you,

2:11:37.900 --> 2:11:42.340
 and part of what makes things attractive is that,

2:11:42.340 --> 2:11:43.940
 whether you thought you liked them or not,

2:11:43.940 --> 2:11:45.980
 is if you can see that there's ferment

2:11:45.980 --> 2:11:47.660
 and new ideas coming up that become,

2:11:47.660 --> 2:11:49.420
 that's attractive in itself.

2:11:49.420 --> 2:11:52.340
 So when I started out, I thought I was,

2:11:52.340 --> 2:11:53.580
 and when I was an undergraduate,

2:11:53.580 --> 2:11:55.420
 I intended to study philosophy

2:11:55.420 --> 2:11:57.660
 or questions of how mind emerges from matter.

2:11:57.660 --> 2:12:00.300
 But I thought that that wasn't really right.

2:12:00.300 --> 2:12:01.260
 Timing isn't right yet.

2:12:01.260 --> 2:12:03.020
 The right, the timing wasn't right

2:12:03.020 --> 2:12:05.220
 for the kind of mathematical thinking

2:12:05.220 --> 2:12:10.220
 and conceptualization that I really enjoy and am good at.

2:12:12.340 --> 2:12:17.260
 But, so that's one thing, cast a wide net, look around.

2:12:18.780 --> 2:12:23.780
 And that's a pretty easy thing to do today

2:12:25.260 --> 2:12:27.060
 because of the internet.

2:12:27.060 --> 2:12:30.060
 You can look at all kinds of things.

2:12:30.060 --> 2:12:30.940
 You have to be careful though

2:12:30.940 --> 2:12:33.460
 because there's a lot of crap also.

2:12:33.460 --> 2:12:36.620
 But you can sort of tell the difference

2:12:36.620 --> 2:12:38.780
 if you do a little digging.

2:12:42.460 --> 2:12:44.940
 So don't settle on just,

2:12:44.940 --> 2:12:46.780
 what your thesis advisor tells you to do

2:12:46.780 --> 2:12:49.100
 or what your teacher tells you to do.

2:12:49.100 --> 2:12:54.100
 Look for yourself and get a sense of what seems promising,

2:12:54.100 --> 2:12:59.100
 not what seemed promising 10 years ago or, so that's one.

2:13:03.620 --> 2:13:08.620
 Another thing is to, is kind of complimentary to that.

2:13:09.980 --> 2:13:11.740
 Well, they're all complimentary.

2:13:12.860 --> 2:13:17.860
 Complimentary to that is to read history

2:13:18.260 --> 2:13:19.860
 and read the masters,

2:13:19.860 --> 2:13:22.300
 the history of ideas and masters of ideas.

2:13:22.300 --> 2:13:27.300
 I'd benefited enormously from, as early in my career,

2:13:28.420 --> 2:13:33.420
 from reading in physics, Einstein in the original

2:13:34.420 --> 2:13:39.420
 and Feynman's lectures as they were coming out and Darwin.

2:13:39.620 --> 2:13:43.540
 You know, these, you can learn what it, and Galileo,

2:13:43.540 --> 2:13:46.700
 you can learn what it is to wrestle with difficult ideas

2:13:46.700 --> 2:13:48.180
 and how great minds did that.

2:13:48.180 --> 2:13:51.220
 You can learn a lot about style,

2:13:51.220 --> 2:13:56.220
 how to write your ideas up and express them in clear ways.

2:13:57.740 --> 2:14:00.180
 And also just a couple of that with,

2:14:00.180 --> 2:14:02.300
 I also enjoy reading biographies.

2:14:02.300 --> 2:14:04.660
 And biographies, yes, similarly, right, yeah.

2:14:04.660 --> 2:14:08.100
 So it gives you the context of the human being

2:14:08.100 --> 2:14:08.940
 that created those ideas.

2:14:08.940 --> 2:14:11.860
 Right, and brings it down to earth in the sense that,

2:14:11.860 --> 2:14:14.100
 you know, it was really human beings who did this.

2:14:14.100 --> 2:14:17.180
 It's not, and they made mistakes.

2:14:17.180 --> 2:14:22.180
 And yeah, I also got inspiration from Bertrand Russell

2:14:22.980 --> 2:14:25.460
 who was a big hero and H.G. Wells and yeah.

2:14:25.460 --> 2:14:30.460
 So read the masters, make contact with great minds.

2:14:31.420 --> 2:14:33.900
 And when you are sort of narrowing down on a subject,

2:14:33.900 --> 2:14:35.460
 learn about the history of the subject

2:14:35.460 --> 2:14:38.380
 because that really puts in context

2:14:38.380 --> 2:14:43.380
 what you're trying to do and also gives a sense of community

2:14:43.980 --> 2:14:46.020
 and grandeur to the whole enterprise.

2:14:46.020 --> 2:14:48.900
 And then the third piece of advice

2:14:48.900 --> 2:14:51.860
 is complimentary to both those,

2:14:51.860 --> 2:14:56.860
 which is sort of to get the basics under control

2:14:58.860 --> 2:15:00.420
 as soon as possible.

2:15:00.420 --> 2:15:04.220
 So if you wanna do theoretical work in science,

2:15:04.220 --> 2:15:08.420
 you know, you have to learn calculus,

2:15:08.420 --> 2:15:11.600
 multivariable calculus, complex variables, group theory.

2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:15.300
 Nowadays, you have to be highly computer literate

2:15:15.300 --> 2:15:16.540
 if you want to do experimental work.

2:15:16.540 --> 2:15:17.980
 You also have to be computer literate

2:15:17.980 --> 2:15:19.660
 and you have to learn about electronics

2:15:19.660 --> 2:15:22.260
 and optics and instruments.

2:15:22.260 --> 2:15:26.860
 So get that under control as soon as possible

2:15:26.860 --> 2:15:31.860
 because it's like learning a language to produce great works

2:15:32.640 --> 2:15:35.580
 and express yourself fluently and with confidence.

2:15:37.980 --> 2:15:39.460
 It should be your native language.

2:15:39.460 --> 2:15:41.420
 These things should be like your native language.

2:15:41.420 --> 2:15:44.660
 So you're not wondering what is the derivative?

2:15:44.660 --> 2:15:49.660
 This is just part of your, it's in your bones,

2:15:50.300 --> 2:15:53.380
 so to speak, and the sooner that you can do that,

2:15:53.380 --> 2:15:55.060
 then the better.

2:15:55.060 --> 2:15:57.980
 So all those things can be done in parallel and should be.

2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:04.520
 You've accomplished some incredible things in your life,

2:16:04.520 --> 2:16:09.520
 but the sad thing about this thing we have is it ends.

2:16:09.520 --> 2:16:14.520
 Do you think about your mortality?

2:16:15.240 --> 2:16:16.440
 Are you afraid of death?

2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:20.440
 Well, afraid is the wrong word.

2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:23.960
 I mean, I wish it weren't going to happen

2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:25.760
 and I'd like to, but.

2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:28.040
 Do you think about it?

2:16:28.040 --> 2:16:30.460
 I, you know, occasionally I think about,

2:16:30.460 --> 2:16:32.400
 well, I think about it very operationally

2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:35.480
 in the sense that there's always a trade off

2:16:35.480 --> 2:16:39.480
 between exploration and exploitation.

2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:42.580
 This is a classic subject in computer science,

2:16:42.580 --> 2:16:46.280
 actually in machine learning that when you're

2:16:46.280 --> 2:16:50.600
 in an unusual circumstance, you want to explore

2:16:50.600 --> 2:16:54.700
 to see what the landscape is and what, and gather data.

2:16:54.700 --> 2:16:57.680
 But then at some point you want to use that,

2:16:57.680 --> 2:17:00.000
 make, decide, make choices and say,

2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:02.040
 this is what I'm going to do and exploit the knowledge

2:17:02.040 --> 2:17:03.360
 you've accumulated.

2:17:03.360 --> 2:17:08.360
 And the longer the period of exploitation you anticipate,

2:17:10.480 --> 2:17:14.600
 the more exploration you should do in new directions.

2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:18.760
 And so for me, I've had to sort of adjust the balance

2:17:18.760 --> 2:17:21.760
 of exploration and exploitation and.

2:17:25.880 --> 2:17:28.180
 That's it, you've explored quite a lot.

2:17:28.180 --> 2:17:31.960
 Yeah, well, I haven't shut off the exploitation at all.

2:17:31.960 --> 2:17:34.000
 I'm still hoping for. The exploration.

2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:35.200
 The exploration, right.

2:17:35.200 --> 2:17:38.280
 I'm still hoping for 10 or 15 years

2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:39.560
 of top flight performance.

2:17:39.560 --> 2:17:44.560
 But the, several years ago now when I was 50 years old,

2:17:47.480 --> 2:17:49.540
 I was at the Institute for Advanced Study

2:17:49.540 --> 2:17:52.500
 and my office was right under Freeman Dyson's office

2:17:52.500 --> 2:17:53.920
 and we were kind of friendly.

2:17:53.920 --> 2:17:58.760
 And, you know, he found out it was my 50th birthday

2:17:58.760 --> 2:18:00.960
 and said, congratulations.

2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:05.040
 And you should feel liberated because no one expects much

2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:07.480
 of a 50 year old theoretical physicist.

2:18:07.480 --> 2:18:10.120
 And he, and he obviously had felt liberated

2:18:10.120 --> 2:18:13.160
 by reaching a certain age.

2:18:13.160 --> 2:18:15.680
 And yeah, there is something to that.

2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:19.280
 I feel, you know, I feel I don't have to catch,

2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:21.640
 I don't have to keep in touch

2:18:21.640 --> 2:18:25.000
 with the latest hypertechnical developments

2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:27.600
 in particle physics or string theory or something.

2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:31.560
 I, because I'm not gonna, I'm really not gonna

2:18:31.560 --> 2:18:33.280
 be exploiting that.

2:18:33.280 --> 2:18:37.640
 But I, but where I am exploring in these directions

2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:40.120
 of machine learning and things like that.

2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:43.040
 And, but then, but I'm also concentrating

2:18:43.040 --> 2:18:46.480
 within physics on exploiting directions

2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:48.000
 that I've already established

2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:50.040
 and the laws that we already have

2:18:50.040 --> 2:18:52.260
 and doing things like,

2:18:52.260 --> 2:18:57.260
 I'm very actively involved in trying to design,

2:18:58.300 --> 2:19:02.620
 helping people, experimentalists and engineers even

2:19:02.620 --> 2:19:07.620
 to design antennas that are capable of detecting axions.

2:19:08.300 --> 2:19:10.980
 So there, and that's, there we're deep

2:19:10.980 --> 2:19:13.140
 in the exploitation stage.

2:19:13.140 --> 2:19:14.940
 It's not a matter of finding the new laws,

2:19:14.940 --> 2:19:17.860
 but of really, you know, using the laws we have

2:19:17.860 --> 2:19:20.860
 to kind of finish the story off.

2:19:20.860 --> 2:19:24.660
 So it's complicated, but I'm, you know,

2:19:25.500 --> 2:19:27.900
 I'm very happy with my life right now

2:19:27.900 --> 2:19:31.700
 and I'm enjoying it and I don't wanna cloud that

2:19:31.700 --> 2:19:36.700
 by thinking too much that it's gonna come to an end.

2:19:39.780 --> 2:19:42.060
 You know, it's a gift I didn't earn.

2:19:42.060 --> 2:19:45.100
 Is there a good thing to say about

2:19:45.100 --> 2:19:50.100
 why this gift that you've gotten

2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:53.120
 and didn't deserve is so damn enjoyable?

2:19:53.120 --> 2:19:57.240
 So like, what's the meaning of this thing, of life?

2:19:57.240 --> 2:20:01.600
 To me, interacting with people I love, my family,

2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:04.920
 and I have a very wide circle of friends now

2:20:04.920 --> 2:20:08.960
 and I'm trying to produce some institutions

2:20:08.960 --> 2:20:12.000
 that will survive me as well as my work

2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:17.000
 and it's just, it's, how should I say?

2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:23.760
 It's a positive feedback loop when you do something

2:20:24.720 --> 2:20:28.360
 and people appreciate it and then you wanna do more

2:20:28.360 --> 2:20:32.220
 and you get rewarded and it's just, how should I say?

2:20:32.220 --> 2:20:34.040
 This is another gift that I didn't earn

2:20:34.040 --> 2:20:37.520
 and don't understand, but I have a dopamine system

2:20:37.520 --> 2:20:42.280
 and yeah, I'm happy to use it.

2:20:42.280 --> 2:20:47.280
 It seems to get energized by the creative process,

2:20:47.360 --> 2:20:48.920
 by the process of exploration.

2:20:48.920 --> 2:20:49.760
 Very much so.

2:20:49.760 --> 2:20:54.240
 And all of that started from the little fluctuations

2:20:56.160 --> 2:20:58.640
 shortly after the Big Bang.

2:20:58.640 --> 2:21:01.640
 Frank, well, whatever those initial conditions

2:21:01.640 --> 2:21:04.600
 and fluctuations did that created you, I'm glad they did.

2:21:04.600 --> 2:21:07.640
 This is, thank you for all the work you've done,

2:21:07.640 --> 2:21:09.280
 for the many people you've inspired,

2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:12.740
 for the many, of the billion, most of your ideas

2:21:12.740 --> 2:21:15.080
 were pretty useless of the several billions,

2:21:16.480 --> 2:21:20.040
 as it is for all humans, but you had quite a few

2:21:20.040 --> 2:21:23.140
 truly special ideas and thank you for bringing those

2:21:23.140 --> 2:21:25.680
 to the world and thank you for wasting your valuable time

2:21:25.680 --> 2:21:27.760
 with me today, it's truly an honor.

2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:31.840
 It's been a joy and I hope people enjoy it

2:21:31.840 --> 2:21:36.840
 and I think the kind of mind expansion that I've enjoyed

2:21:37.120 --> 2:21:41.240
 by interacting with physical reality at this deep level,

2:21:41.240 --> 2:21:45.540
 I think can be conveyed to and enjoyed by many, many people

2:21:45.540 --> 2:21:48.040
 and that's one of my missions in life, to share it.

2:21:48.040 --> 2:21:49.360
 Beautiful.

2:21:49.360 --> 2:21:50.880
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:21:50.880 --> 2:21:54.040
 with Frank Wilczek and thank you to The Information,

2:21:54.040 --> 2:21:58.500
 NatSuite, ExpressVPN, Blinkist and 8sleep.

2:21:58.500 --> 2:22:01.720
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast

2:22:01.720 --> 2:22:03.320
 and now let me leave you with some words

2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:08.100
 from Albert Einstein, nothing happens until something moves.

2:22:08.100 --> 2:22:31.100
 Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
