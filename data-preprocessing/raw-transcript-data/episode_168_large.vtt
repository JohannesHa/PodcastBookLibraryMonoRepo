 The following is a conversation with Silvio McCauley, a computer scientist at MIT,

00:04.800 --> 00:10.320
 winner of the Turing Award, and one of the leading minds in the fields of cryptography,

00:10.320 --> 00:16.320
 information security, game theory, and most recently, cryptocurrency and the theoretical

00:16.320 --> 00:23.600
 foundations of a fully decentralized, secure, and scalable blockchain at Algorand, a company

00:23.600 --> 00:28.480
 of cryptographers, engineers, and mathematicians that he founded in 2017.

00:47.280 --> 00:53.280
 be having many conversations this year on the topic of cryptocurrency. I'm reading and thinking

00:53.280 --> 00:59.520
 and thinking a lot on this topic. I just recently finished reading The Bitcoin Standard, a book I

00:59.520 --> 01:04.960
 highly recommend. As always, with this podcast, I'm approaching it with an open mind, with

01:04.960 --> 01:12.480
 compassion, with as little ego as possible, and yes, with love. I hope you go along with me on

01:12.480 --> 01:20.160
 this journey and don't judge me too harshly on any likely missteps. As usual, I will play devil's

01:20.160 --> 01:27.840
 advocate. I will, on purpose, sometimes ask simple, even dumb questions, all to try and explore the

01:27.840 --> 01:33.840
 space of ideas here with as much grace as I can muster. I have no financial interests here. I

01:33.840 --> 01:39.680
 only have a simple curiosity and a love for knowledge, especially about a set of technologies

01:39.680 --> 01:45.680
 that may very well transform the fabric of human civilization. If you enjoy this thing,

01:59.200 --> 02:05.520
 Let's start with the big and the basic question. What is a blockchain? And why is it interesting?

02:05.520 --> 02:11.920
 Why is it fascinating? Why is it powerful? All right. So a blockchain, think of it, is really

02:11.920 --> 02:19.600
 a common database distributed. Think about it as a ledger in which everybody can write an entry

02:19.600 --> 02:26.640
 in a page. You can write, I can write, and everybody can read, and you have a guarantee

02:26.640 --> 02:32.000
 that everybody has the same copy of the ledger that is in front of you. So whatever you see on

02:32.000 --> 02:40.560
 page seven, anyone else sees on page seven. So what is extraordinary about this is this common

02:40.560 --> 02:48.160
 knowledge thing that I think is really a first for humanity. I mean, if you look at communication,

02:48.880 --> 02:57.520
 like right now, you can communicate very quickly images, photos, but do you have a certainty that

02:57.520 --> 03:02.880
 whatever you have received has been received by everybody else? Not really. And so there's a

03:02.880 --> 03:09.280
 commonality of knowledge and the certainty that everybody can write, nobody has been prevented

03:09.280 --> 03:14.320
 from writing whatever they want. Nobody can erase. Nobody can tear a page of a ledger.

03:14.320 --> 03:20.960
 Nobody can swap page. Nobody can change anything. And that is immutable common record is

03:21.920 --> 03:27.920
 extremely powerful. And there's something fundamental that is decentralized about it.

03:27.920 --> 03:33.600
 So at least in spirit, some degree against maybe a resistance to centralization.

03:33.600 --> 03:41.520
 Absolutely. If it is not decentralized, how can it be common knowledge? If only one person or a

03:41.520 --> 03:47.680
 few people have a ledger, you don't have a ledger, you have to ask, you know, what is on page seven?

03:47.680 --> 03:52.400
 And how do you know that whatever they tell you is on page seven, they tell the same thing to

03:52.400 --> 04:02.000
 everybody else. And so this commonality is extremely powerful. Just to give you an example,

04:02.000 --> 04:08.080
 assume that you do an auction, okay? You have worked very hard, you build a building,

04:08.880 --> 04:14.800
 and now you want to auction it off. Makes sense because you want to auction worldwide,

04:14.800 --> 04:18.720
 better yet, you want to tokenize the building and sell it in all in parcels.

04:20.320 --> 04:26.400
 Now, everybody sees the bids. And you know that everybody sees the bids. You and I see the same

04:26.400 --> 04:32.000
 bids, and so does everybody else. So you know that a fair price has reached, and you know who owns

04:32.000 --> 04:39.440
 what and who has spent how much. And if you do it instead of, otherwise, in a centralized system,

04:39.440 --> 04:46.400
 I put a bid saying, oh, congratulations, Alex, you won, and your price is $12,570. How do you know?

04:47.840 --> 04:56.000
 So if instead of this common knowledge is a very powerful tool for humanity.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.320
 So we return to it from a bunch of different perspectives, including like a technical

05:00.320 --> 05:09.040
 perspective. But you often talk about blockchain and some of these concepts of decentralization,

05:09.040 --> 05:16.960
 scalability, security, all those kinds of things. But one of the most maybe impactful, exciting

05:17.760 --> 05:25.280
 things that leverage the blockchain, this kind of ledger idea of common knowledge is cryptocurrency.

05:25.280 --> 05:31.440
 So in the financial space. So is there, can you say in the same kind of basic way,

05:31.440 --> 05:36.320
 what is cryptocurrency in the context of this common knowledge and in the context of the blockchain?

05:37.040 --> 05:44.320
 Great. Cryptocurrency is a currency that is on such a ledger. So imagine that on the ledger,

05:45.280 --> 05:52.000
 initially, you know that somehow, say you and I are the only owner, each one, let's give it

05:52.000 --> 06:01.040
 ourselves a billion each of whatever this unit. Then I start writing on the ledger,

06:01.040 --> 06:08.240
 I give 100 of these units to my sister, I give this much to my aunt. And then now,

06:08.240 --> 06:13.440
 because it's written on the ledger and everybody can see, my sister can give 57 of these units

06:13.440 --> 06:19.520
 that she received from me to somebody else. And that is money. And that is money because

06:19.520 --> 06:26.400
 you can see that somebody who tenders your payment has really the money there. You don't

06:26.400 --> 06:31.280
 have any more of a doubt when you want to sell an item. If I write you a check, is the check covered?

06:33.680 --> 06:38.800
 Or do I have the money at the moment of a transaction? You really see because the ledger

06:38.800 --> 06:44.560
 is always updated. What you see is what I see, what the merchant sees. You know that the money,

06:44.560 --> 06:52.640
 the money is the most powerful money system there is because it is totally transparent. And so you

06:52.640 --> 06:58.000
 know that you have been paid, and you know that the money is there, you have not to second guess

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
 anything else. So the common knowledge applied there is you're basically mimicking the same kind

07:04.000 --> 07:10.320
 of thing you would get in the physical space, which is if you give 100 bucks or 100 of that

07:10.320 --> 07:18.480
 thing, whatever of that cryptocurrency to your sister, the actual transfer is as real as you

07:18.480 --> 07:28.880
 giving like a basket of apples to your sister. So in the case in the physical space, the common

07:28.880 --> 07:35.280
 knowledge is in the physics of the atoms. And then it's digital space, the common knowledge

07:35.280 --> 07:43.440
 is in this ledger. And so that transfer holds the same kind of power, but now it's operating

07:43.440 --> 07:52.000
 in the digital space. Again, I apologize for a set of ridiculous questions, but you mentioned

07:52.960 --> 08:00.320
 cryptocurrencies and money. What is money? Why do we have money? Do you think about this

08:00.320 --> 08:08.720
 kind of from this high philosophical level at times of this tool, this idea that we humans

08:08.720 --> 08:13.120
 have all kind of came up with and seem to be using effectively to do stuff?

08:15.360 --> 08:22.720
 Money is a social construct, okay, in my opinion. And this has been somehow people always felt

08:22.720 --> 08:30.400
 that somehow money is a way to allow us to transact, even though we want different things. So

08:30.400 --> 08:39.760
 I have two sheep, and then you have one cow, and I want the cow, but you are looking for

08:39.760 --> 08:44.880
 blankets instead, you know, so to have money is really simplifies this. But at the end of

08:44.880 --> 08:49.600
 it, that's why a bit was invented. And you started with gold, you started with

08:49.600 --> 08:56.080
 the coinage, then you started with the check. But at the end of the day, money is essentially

08:56.080 --> 09:01.680
 a social construct because you know that what you receive, you can actually spend with somebody

09:01.680 --> 09:08.880
 else. And so there is a kind of a social pact and social belief that you have. At the end of the day,

09:09.600 --> 09:17.920
 even barter requires these beliefs that other people are going to accept

09:17.920 --> 09:24.480
 the quote unquote currency you offer them. Because if I'm a mason, and you ask me to build a wall

09:25.600 --> 09:31.760
 in your field, and I did, and you, in exchange, you give me a thousand sheep,

09:32.480 --> 09:37.440
 what am I going to do? Eat them all? No, I have to feed them. And if I don't feed them, they die,

09:37.440 --> 09:45.120
 and my value is zero. So in receiving this livestock, I must believe that somebody else

09:45.120 --> 09:53.200
 will accept them in return for something else. So money is a social belief, social shared belief

09:53.200 --> 09:58.960
 system that makes people transact. That's fascinating. I didn't even think about that,

09:58.960 --> 10:06.800
 that you're actually, you have a deep like network of beliefs about how society operates.

10:06.800 --> 10:12.240
 So the value is assigned even to sheep, based on that everyone will continue operating how they

10:12.240 --> 10:19.680
 were previously operating. Somebody will feed the sheep. I didn't even think about that. That's

10:19.680 --> 10:26.480
 fascinating. So that directly transfers to the space of money and then to the space of digital

10:26.480 --> 10:33.600
 money, cryptocurrency. Okay. Does it bother you sort of intellectually when this money that is

10:33.600 --> 10:40.400
 a social construct is not directly tied to physical goods like gold, for example?

10:40.400 --> 10:49.280
 Not at all, because after all, gold has some industrial value. Nobody delights it. It's a

10:49.280 --> 10:55.760
 metal. It doesn't oxidate. It has some good things about it. But does this industrial value

10:55.760 --> 11:01.920
 really represent the value to which it now is traded? No. So gold is another way to express

11:01.920 --> 11:07.200
 our belief. I give you an ounce of gold, you treat it like, oh, somebody else will want this

11:07.200 --> 11:14.480
 for doing something else. So it is really this notion of this. Money is a mental construct,

11:14.480 --> 11:21.200
 is really, and is shared, is a social construct, I really believe. And so some people feel that

11:21.200 --> 11:28.960
 it's physical, so therefore gold exists. Then, as you know now, countries, most sophisticated

11:30.160 --> 11:35.360
 country right now, they print their own money and you believe that they are not going to

11:35.360 --> 11:42.560
 exaggerate it with inflation. Not everybody believes it, but at least they are not going

11:42.560 --> 11:49.680
 to exaggerate it blatantly. And therefore you receive it because you know that somebody else

11:49.680 --> 11:54.080
 will accept it, will have faith in the currency and so on and so forth. But whether it's gold,

11:54.080 --> 11:59.600
 whether it's livestock, whatever it is, money is really a shared belief.

11:59.600 --> 12:07.200
 So there is something, you know, and I've been reading more and more about different cryptocurrencies.

12:07.200 --> 12:14.880
 There is a kind of belief that the scarcity of a particular resource like Bitcoin has a

12:14.880 --> 12:23.040
 limited amount and it's tied to physical, you know, to proof of work. So it's tied to physical

12:23.040 --> 12:28.880
 reality in terms of how much you can mine effectively and so on. That that's an

12:28.880 --> 12:34.880
 important feature of money. Do you think that's an important feature to be a part of whatever

12:34.880 --> 12:40.800
 the money is? That is certainly a very useful part. So at some point in time, you know,

12:40.800 --> 12:46.320
 assume that money is something that all of a sudden we say, daisies are money, are the currency.

12:46.880 --> 12:52.480
 Then, you know, I offer you 10 daisies in payment of whatever goods and services you want to

12:52.480 --> 12:59.520
 provide. But at the end of the day, if you know that you can cultivate it and generate them at

12:59.520 --> 13:07.440
 will, then perhaps, you know, you should not accept my payment. Here is a bouquet of daisies.

13:08.320 --> 13:14.400
 So you need some kind of a scarcity. The inability to create it suddenly out of nothing

13:14.400 --> 13:24.560
 is unimportant. And it's not an intrinsic necessity, but it's much easier to accept

13:24.560 --> 13:30.480
 once you know that there is a fixed number of units of whatever currency there is and therefore

13:30.480 --> 13:37.040
 you can mentally understand I'm getting, you know, this much of this piece of a pie and therefore

13:37.040 --> 13:43.600
 I consider myself paid. I understand what I'm receiving. You described the goals of a blockchain.

13:43.600 --> 13:48.720
 You have a nice presentation on this as scalability, security, and decentralization.

13:49.680 --> 13:54.960
 And you challenged the blockchain trilemma that claims you can only have two of the three.

13:55.600 --> 14:02.000
 So let's talk about each. What is scalability in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrency?

14:02.000 --> 14:09.760
 What does scalability mean? So remember, we said that the blockchain is a ledger and each page

14:09.760 --> 14:16.320
 receives a, gets some transaction and everybody can write in these pages of the ledger. Nobody

14:16.320 --> 14:21.760
 can be stopped from writing and everybody can read them. Okay. Scalability means how fast can

14:21.760 --> 14:28.640
 you write? Just imagine that you can write an entry in this special shared ledger once every

14:28.640 --> 14:32.800
 hour. Well, you know, what are you going to do if you have no one transaction of an hour,

14:33.440 --> 14:38.880
 the world doesn't go around. So you need to have scalability means here that you can

14:38.880 --> 14:47.040
 then somehow write a lot of transaction and then you can read them and everybody can validate them.

14:47.040 --> 14:54.080
 And that is the speed and the number of transactions per second and the fact that

14:54.080 --> 15:01.040
 they are shared. So you want to have this speed not only in writing, but in sharing and

15:01.040 --> 15:09.120
 in inspection for validity. This is scalability. The world is big. The world wants to interact,

15:09.120 --> 15:13.520
 the people want to interact with each other and you better be prepared to have a ledger

15:13.520 --> 15:17.520
 in which you can write lots and lots and lots of transactions in this special way very,

15:17.520 --> 15:22.800
 very, very quickly. So maybe from a more mathematical perspective or can we say

15:22.800 --> 15:27.760
 something about how much scalability is needed for a world that is big?

15:27.760 --> 15:36.400
 Well, it really depends how many transactions you want, but remember that I think right now

15:36.400 --> 15:45.120
 yet to go into at least 1000s of transactions per second, even if you look at credit cards,

15:46.480 --> 15:54.320
 we are going to go from an average of 1600 to peaks of 20,000 or 40,000, something like this.

15:54.320 --> 16:01.200
 But remember, it's not only a question of a transaction per se, but the value is that the

16:01.200 --> 16:08.400
 transaction is actually being shared and visible to everybody and the certainty that that is the

16:08.400 --> 16:15.600
 case. I can print on my own printer way more transactions, but nobody has the time to see

16:15.600 --> 16:22.480
 or to inspect. That doesn't count. So you want scalability at this common knowledge level.

16:22.480 --> 16:28.320
 That is the challenge. I also meant from a perspective of like a complexity analysis.

16:28.320 --> 16:35.200
 So when you get more and more people involved, doesn't need to scale in some kind of way that

16:38.240 --> 16:41.760
 do you like to see certain kind of properties in order to say something is scalable?

16:42.560 --> 16:48.320
 Oh, absolutely. I took a little bit implicitly that the people transacting are actually very

16:48.320 --> 16:54.080
 different. So if there is a two people who can do thousands of transactions per second with each

16:54.080 --> 16:58.320
 other, this is not so interesting. What do we really need is to say there are billions of

16:58.320 --> 17:03.760
 people at any point in time, you know, thousands and thousands of them want to transact with each

17:03.760 --> 17:12.160
 other and you want to support to that. So Algorand, it solves, so that's the company,

17:12.160 --> 17:17.280
 the team of cryptographers and mathematicians, engineers, so on, that challenged the blockchain

17:17.280 --> 17:24.800
 trilemma. So let's break it down in terms of achieving scalability. How do we achieve scalability

17:25.600 --> 17:31.120
 in the space of blockchain, in the space of cryptocurrency? Okay. So scalability, security,

17:31.680 --> 17:36.480
 remember, and decentralization, right? So that's what they want. What's the best way to approach?

17:36.480 --> 17:41.520
 Can we break it down? Let's start with scalability and think about how do we achieve it? Well,

17:41.520 --> 17:48.560
 to achieve it one at a time is perhaps easy, even security. If nobody transacts,

17:48.560 --> 17:56.160
 nobody loses money. So that is secure, but it's not scalable. So let me tell you, I'm a cryptographer,

17:56.160 --> 18:04.240
 so I try to fight the bad guys. And what you want is that the vesselager that we discussed before

18:04.240 --> 18:12.080
 cannot be tampered with. So you must think of it as a special link that nobody can erase. Then

18:12.080 --> 18:22.320
 it has to be, everybody should be able to read and not to alter the pages or the content of the pages.

18:22.320 --> 18:28.640
 That's okay. But you know what? That is actually easy cryptographically. Easy cryptographically

18:28.640 --> 18:35.120
 means you can use tools invented 50 years ago, which in cryptographic time is prehistory, okay?

18:35.120 --> 18:42.320
 We cavemen working around and solve the problem in cryptography land. But there is really a

18:42.320 --> 18:46.720
 fundamental problem, which is really almost a social, seems a political problem, is to say,

18:48.480 --> 18:58.080
 who the hell chooses or publishes the next page of the ledger? I mean, that is really the challenge.

18:58.080 --> 19:03.120
 This ledger, you can always add a page because more and more transaction had to be written on

19:03.120 --> 19:08.880
 there. And somebody has to assemble this transaction, put them on a page and add the

19:08.880 --> 19:14.640
 next page. Who is the somebody who chooses the page and adds it on? Who can be trusted to do it?

19:14.640 --> 19:19.680
 Exactly. Assume it is me for what I'm being, not that I want to volunteer for the job, but

19:20.320 --> 19:25.520
 then I would have more power than any absolute monarch in history, because I would have a

19:25.520 --> 19:32.080
 tremendous power to say, these are the transactions that the entire world should see. And whatever I

19:32.080 --> 19:38.960
 don't write, this transaction will never see the light of day. I mean, no one had any such a power

19:38.960 --> 19:47.200
 in history. So it's very important to do that. And that is the quintessential problem in a blockchain.

19:47.200 --> 19:52.000
 And people have thought about it to say, it's not me, it's not you. But for instance,

19:52.000 --> 19:57.200
 in proof of work, what people say is, okay, it's not me, it's not you, you know what it is?

19:58.000 --> 20:04.320
 We make a very difficult, we invented a cryptographic puzzle, very hard to solve.

20:04.320 --> 20:10.800
 The first one to solve it has the right to add one page to the ledger on behalf of everybody else.

20:12.240 --> 20:19.120
 That now seems okay, because sometimes I solve a puzzle before you do, sometimes you solve

20:19.120 --> 20:22.640
 before I do, or before somebody else solves it, it's okay.

20:22.640 --> 20:28.320
 And presumably, the effort you put in is somehow correlated with how much trust

20:29.520 --> 20:32.640
 you should be given to add to the ledger.

20:33.440 --> 20:38.400
 Yeah, so somehow you want to make sure that you need to work because you want to prevent,

20:39.360 --> 20:46.080
 you want to make sure that you get one solution every 10 minutes, say, like in a particular

20:46.080 --> 20:51.600
 example of Bitcoin, so that it is very rare that two pages are added at the same time.

20:51.600 --> 20:58.560
 Because if I solve a puzzle at the same time you do, it could happen that if it happens once or

20:58.560 --> 21:06.000
 twice, we can survive it. But if it happens every other page is a double page, then which of the two

21:06.000 --> 21:13.040
 is the real page, it becomes a problem. So that's why in Bitcoin, it is important to have a substantial

21:13.040 --> 21:19.680
 amount of work so that no matter how many people try on Earth to solve a puzzle, you have one

21:19.680 --> 21:26.080
 solution out of how many people are trying every 10 minutes. So that you have, you distance these

21:26.080 --> 21:31.600
 pages, and you have the time to propagate through the network a solution and the page attached to

21:31.600 --> 21:38.000
 it. And therefore, there is one page at a time that is added. And you say, well, why don't we

21:38.000 --> 21:46.160
 do it? We have a solution. Well, first of all, a page every 10 minutes is not fast enough. It's a

21:46.160 --> 21:53.280
 question of scalability. And second of all, to ensure that no matter how many people try, you

21:53.280 --> 22:00.720
 get one page every 10 minutes, one solution to the riddle every 10 minutes. This means that the riddle

22:00.720 --> 22:09.040
 becomes very, very hard. And to have a chance to solve it within 10 minutes, you must have such an

22:09.040 --> 22:15.040
 expensive apparatus in terms of specialized computers, not one, not two, but thousands and

22:15.040 --> 22:20.320
 thousands of them. And they produce tons of heat, okay? They dissipate heat like maniac. And then

22:20.320 --> 22:26.400
 you have to refrigerate them too. And so then now you have air conditioning galore to add to the

22:26.400 --> 22:33.680
 thing. It becomes so expensive that fewer and fewer and fewer people can actually compete in

22:33.680 --> 22:46.000
 order to add to the page. And the problem becomes so crucial that in Bitcoin, depending on which

22:46.000 --> 22:51.760
 day of the week you look at it, you are going to have two or three mining pools that are really

22:51.760 --> 22:58.480
 the ones that are capable of controlling the chain. So you're saying that's almost like

22:58.480 --> 23:07.520
 at least a centralization. Right. It started being decentralized, but the expenses became

23:07.520 --> 23:11.600
 higher and higher and higher. When the cost becomes higher and higher, fewer and fewer

23:11.600 --> 23:19.760
 people can afford them. And then it becomes de facto centralized, right? Yeah. And a different

23:19.760 --> 23:26.160
 type of approach is instead, for instance, a delegated proof of stake, which is also

23:26.880 --> 23:34.480
 very easy to explain, essentially boils down to say, well, look at these 21 people, say, okay?

23:35.600 --> 23:40.960
 Don't they look honest? Yes, they do. In fact, I believe that they're going to remain honest

23:40.960 --> 23:46.000
 for the foreseeable future. So why don't we do ourselves a favor? Let's entrust them

23:46.000 --> 23:54.000
 to add the page on behalf of all of us to the ledger. Okay. Okay. But now we are going to say,

23:54.000 --> 23:59.840
 is this centralized or decentralized? Well, 21 is better than one, but to say is very little.

23:59.840 --> 24:04.720
 So if you look at when people rebelled to centralize power, I don't know, the French

24:04.720 --> 24:11.600
 revolutions, okay? There was a monarch and the nobles. Were there 21 nobles? No, there were

24:11.600 --> 24:18.240
 thousands of them, but there were millions and millions of disempowered citizens. So one is

24:18.240 --> 24:23.760
 centralized, 21 is also centralized, right? So that's delegated proof of stake. Delegated. It's

24:23.760 --> 24:29.760
 kind of like representative democracy, I guess. Yes, which is good. It's working great, right?

24:29.760 --> 24:39.440
 It's working great. Well, it's better than the single monarch, right? There's problems.

24:39.440 --> 24:49.440
 There are problems. And so we were looking for a different, when thinking about Algorand,

24:49.440 --> 24:56.640
 for a different approach. And so we have an approach that is really, really decentralized

24:56.640 --> 25:04.560
 because essentially it works as follows. You have a bunch of tokens, right? These are the tokens

25:04.560 --> 25:12.080
 that have equal power. And you have say 10 billions of tokens distributed to the entire

25:12.080 --> 25:21.280
 world. And the owners, each token has a chance to add the ledger, equal probability to everybody

25:21.280 --> 25:29.760
 else. In fact, actually, if you want, here is how it works. So think about by some magic

25:29.760 --> 25:35.360
 cryptographic process, which is not magic, it's mathematics, but think of it as magic. Assume that

25:36.240 --> 25:43.920
 you select a thousand tokens and so sometimes a random, okay? And you have a guarantee that the

25:43.920 --> 25:51.680
 random selected. And then the owners of these 1000 tokens somehow agree on the next page,

25:51.680 --> 25:59.680
 they all sign it, and that is the next page. Okay? So it is clear that nobody has the power

25:59.680 --> 26:09.280
 but in a while, one of your tokens is selected and you are in charge of this committee to select

26:09.280 --> 26:16.560
 the next page. But this goes around very quickly. So, and if you look at this, the equation really

26:16.560 --> 26:23.760
 is that it's not really centralized. And because for agreeing on the same page, it is important

26:23.760 --> 26:31.440
 that the 1000 tokens that you randomly selected are in honest ends, the majority of them.

26:32.160 --> 26:37.920
 So which, if the majority of the tokens are in honest ends, that is essentially true because

26:37.920 --> 26:44.560
 if the majority of the tokens are in honest ends, if you select, say 90% of the people are,

26:46.000 --> 26:51.040
 90% of the tokens are in honest ends. So can you randomly select a thousand,

26:51.040 --> 26:58.160
 in this thousand you find the 501 tokens in bad ends. Very, very improbable.

26:58.160 --> 27:05.680
 So basically, when a large fraction of people are honest, then you can use randomness as a powerful

27:05.680 --> 27:13.120
 tool to get decentralization. So what does honesty mean? And now we're into the social

27:13.120 --> 27:23.040
 side of things, which is how do we know that like the fraction, a large fraction of people

27:23.040 --> 27:28.000
 or participating parties are honest? That is an excellent question. So by the way,

27:28.000 --> 27:33.360
 first of all, we should realize that the same thing is for every other system. When you look

27:33.360 --> 27:41.040
 at proof of work, you rely that the majority of the mining power is in honest ends. When you look

27:41.040 --> 27:47.920
 at delegated proof of stake, you rely that the majority of these 21 people are honest. What is

27:47.920 --> 27:54.960
 the difference? The difference is that in these other systems, you should say the whole economy

27:54.960 --> 28:04.400
 is secure if the majority of this small piece of economy are honest. And that is a big question.

28:04.400 --> 28:12.960
 But instead, in Algorand, in our approach, we say the whole economy is secure if the majority

28:12.960 --> 28:18.640
 of the economy is honest. In other words, who can subvert Algorand is not a majority of a small

28:18.640 --> 28:24.400
 group, but is a majority of the token holders had to conspire with each other in order to sink the

28:24.400 --> 28:29.600
 very economy for which they own the majority of. That I think it is a bit harder to...

28:29.600 --> 28:36.000
 Like a self destructive majority, essentially. And you're also making me realize that basically

28:36.800 --> 28:43.520
 every system that we have in the world today assumes that the majority of participants is

28:43.520 --> 28:50.400
 honest. Yes. The only difference is the majority of whom. And in some cases, the majority of a club

28:51.040 --> 28:53.600
 and in our case is the majority of the whole system.

28:53.600 --> 29:02.400
 The whole system. Okay. So that's... So through that kind of random sampling,

29:02.400 --> 29:09.520
 you can achieve decentralization. You can achieve... So the scalability, I understand.

29:10.080 --> 29:16.160
 And then the security that you're referring to, basically the security comes from the fact that

29:16.160 --> 29:23.120
 the sample selected would likely include honest people. So it's very difficult to... So by the way,

29:23.120 --> 29:30.240
 the security, as you mentioned, you're referring to is basically security against dishonesty,

29:31.360 --> 29:37.280
 right? Or manipulation or whatever. Yes. Yes. So essentially when what you're going to do is to

29:37.280 --> 29:42.320
 the following and say, well, Silvio, I understood what you're saying, but somebody has to randomly

29:42.320 --> 29:46.560
 randomly selected these tokens, then I believe you. So then who does this random selection?

29:46.560 --> 29:52.000
 That's a good point. And in Algorand, we do something a little bit unorthodox.

29:52.800 --> 30:00.480
 Essentially is the token choose themselves at random. And you say, if you think about it,

30:00.480 --> 30:05.200
 that seems to be a terrible idea. Because if you want to say, choose yourself at random,

30:05.200 --> 30:11.360
 and whoever chooses himself is a thousand people committee, you choose the page for the rest of us.

30:11.360 --> 30:16.240
 Mm hmm. And because if I'm a bad person, I'm going to select myself over and over again,

30:16.240 --> 30:22.080
 because I want to be part of the committee every single time. But not so fast. So what do we do

30:22.640 --> 30:26.240
 in Algorand? What does it mean that I select myself? That each one of us,

30:26.960 --> 30:34.080
 in the privacy of our own computer, actually a laptop, what you do is that you execute your own

30:34.080 --> 30:42.480
 individual lottery. And think about that you pull a lever of a slot machine, you can only pull the

30:42.480 --> 30:48.560
 lever once, not until you win, not enough times until you win. And when you pull the lever, case

30:48.560 --> 30:54.640
 one, either you win, in such a case, you have a winning ticket. Or you lose, you don't get any

30:54.640 --> 31:00.480
 winning ticket. So if you don't have a winning ticket, you can say anything you want about the

31:00.480 --> 31:07.760
 next page in the ledger, nobody pays attention. But if you ever win a ticket, people say, Oh,

31:07.760 --> 31:12.720
 wow, this is one of the 1000 winning tickets, we better pay attention to what he or she says.

31:13.280 --> 31:20.400
 And that's how it works. And the lottery is a cryptographic lottery, which means that even if I

31:20.400 --> 31:27.040
 am an entire nation, extremely powerful, with incredible computing powers, I don't have the

31:27.040 --> 31:33.920
 ability to improve even minimally my probability of one of my token winning the lottery. And

31:33.920 --> 31:41.200
 that's how it happens. So everybody pulls the lever, the 1000 random winners say, Oh, here is

31:41.200 --> 31:46.800
 my winning ticket. And here is my opinion up or down about the block. These are the ones that

31:46.800 --> 31:53.440
 count. And if you think about it, while this is distributed, because there is, in the case of

31:53.440 --> 31:59.120
 Algon, there is 10 billion tokens and you selected 1000 of them more distributed than this, you

31:59.120 --> 32:06.480
 cannot get. And then why is this scalable? Because what do you have to do? Okay, you have to do the

32:06.480 --> 32:13.280
 lottery. How long the lottery takes? It takes actually one microsecond. Whether you have one

32:13.280 --> 32:19.520
 token or two tokens or a billion tokens is always one microsecond of computation, which is very

32:19.520 --> 32:26.160
 fast. We don't hit the planet with a microsecond of computation. And finally, why is this secure?

32:27.120 --> 32:35.600
 Because even if I were a very evil and very, very powerful individual, I'm so powerful that I can

32:35.600 --> 32:42.880
 corrupt anybody I want instantaneously in the world, whom would I want to corrupt? The people

32:42.880 --> 32:49.360
 in the committee so that I can choose the page of the ledger. But I do have a problem. I do not

32:49.360 --> 32:55.840
 know whom I should corrupt. Should I corrupt this lady in Shanghai, this other guy in Paris?

32:56.400 --> 33:00.640
 Because I don't know. The winners are random, so I don't know whom I should corrupt.

33:01.360 --> 33:06.640
 But once the winner comes forward and says, here is my winning ticket, and you propagate

33:06.640 --> 33:11.360
 your winning ticket across the network, together with your opinion about the block,

33:11.920 --> 33:18.480
 now I know who they are. For sure, I can corrupt all 1000 of them given to my incredible powers.

33:18.480 --> 33:25.040
 But so what? Whatever they said, they already said, and their winning tickets and their opinions

33:25.040 --> 33:31.200
 are virally propagated across the network. And I do not have the power, no more than the US

33:31.200 --> 33:37.120
 government or any government has the power, to put back in the bottle a message virally

33:37.120 --> 33:44.560
 propagated by WikiLeaks. So everything you just described is kind of is fascinating,

33:44.560 --> 33:50.080
 a set of ideas. And, you know, online I've been reading quite a bit, and people are really excited

33:50.080 --> 33:58.560
 about the set of ideas. Nevertheless, it is not the dominating technology today. So Bitcoin,

33:58.560 --> 34:05.920
 in terms of cryptocurrency, is the most popular cryptocurrency, and then Ethereum, and so on.

34:05.920 --> 34:09.920
 So it's useful to kind of comment. We already talked about proof of work a little bit.

34:09.920 --> 34:15.840
 But what, in your sense, does Bitcoin get right? And where is it lacking?

34:16.560 --> 34:22.000
 Okay, so the first thing that Bitcoin got right is to understand that there was the need

34:22.800 --> 34:29.840
 of a cryptocurrency. And that, in my opinion, they deserve all the success because they said

34:29.840 --> 34:34.400
 the time is right for this idea. Because very often, it's not enough to be right here to be

34:34.400 --> 34:40.720
 right at the right time. And somebody got it right there. So hat off to Bitcoin for that.

34:42.640 --> 34:52.800
 And so what they got right is that it is hard to subvert and change the ledger, to cancel a

34:52.800 --> 35:00.160
 transaction. It's not impossible. That is very hard. What they did not get right is somehow that

35:00.160 --> 35:07.680
 it is a great store of value, currency wise. But money is not only a question that you store it

35:07.680 --> 35:13.760
 and you put under the mattress. Money wants to be transacted. And the transaction bitcoins are very

35:13.760 --> 35:19.920
 little. So if you want to store value, everybody needs a store of value. Might as well use Bitcoin.

35:19.920 --> 35:27.360
 I mean, it's the plan. But if you don't look at that for a moment, at least it's a great store

35:27.360 --> 35:32.480
 of value. And everybody needs a store of value. But most of the time, we want to transact. We

35:32.480 --> 35:38.080
 want to interact. We don't put the money under the mattress. So we wanted to embed. They didn't get

35:38.080 --> 35:44.960
 it right. That is too slow to transact. Too few transactions. There's a scalability issue.

35:45.520 --> 35:52.720
 Is it possible to build stuff on top of Bitcoin that sort of fixes the scalability? I mean,

35:52.720 --> 35:58.480
 this is the thing you look at. There's a bunch of technologies that kind of hit the right

36:00.240 --> 36:07.200
 need at the right time and they have flaws, but we kind of build infrastructures on top of them

36:07.200 --> 36:14.880
 over time to fix it as opposed to getting it right from the beginning. Or is it difficult to do?

36:14.880 --> 36:21.120
 Well, that is difficult to do. So you're talking to somebody that when I decided to throw my heart

36:21.120 --> 36:27.680
 in the arena and I decided, first of all, as I said before, I much admire my predecessors. I

36:27.680 --> 36:36.000
 mean, they got it right, a lot of things. And I really admire for that. But I had a choice to

36:36.000 --> 36:41.120
 make. Either I patch something that has holes all over the place or I start from scratch. I decided

36:41.120 --> 36:46.640
 to start from scratch because sometimes it's a better way. So what about Ethereum, which looks

36:46.640 --> 36:52.320
 like proof of stake and a lot of different innovative ideas that kind of improve or seek

36:52.320 --> 36:57.200
 to improve on some of the flaws of Bitcoin. Ethereum made another great idea. So they

36:57.200 --> 37:05.760
 figured out that money and payments are important as they are. They are only the first level, the

37:05.760 --> 37:12.480
 first stepping stone. The next level are smart contracts. And they were at the vision to say

37:12.480 --> 37:20.640
 the people will need smart contract, which allow me and you to somehow to transact securely without

37:20.640 --> 37:26.080
 being shopped around by a trusted third party, by a mediator. By the way, because mediators are hard

37:26.080 --> 37:32.960
 to find. And in fact, maybe even impossible to find if you live in Thailand and I live in New

37:32.960 --> 37:39.280
 Zealand, maybe we don't have a common person that we know and trust. And even if we find them,

37:39.280 --> 37:48.560
 guess what? They want to be paid. So much so that 6% of the world GDP goes into financial friction,

37:48.560 --> 37:52.880
 which is essentially third party. So the head of right of the world needed that.

37:53.920 --> 38:04.400
 But again, the scalability is not there. And the system of smart contracts in Ethereum is slow

38:04.400 --> 38:12.720
 and expensive. And I believe that is not enough to satisfy the appetite and the need that we have

38:12.720 --> 38:19.040
 for smart contracts. Well, what do you make of just as a small sort of aside in human history,

38:19.040 --> 38:24.560
 perhaps it's a big one is NFT, the non fungible tokens. Do you find those interesting technically,

38:24.560 --> 38:32.800
 or is it more interesting on the social side of things? Well, both. I think NFTs are actually

38:32.800 --> 38:46.000
 great. So you are an artist to create a song or it could be a piece of art. He has many unique

38:46.000 --> 38:54.560
 representations of a unique piece where there is an artifact of something dreamed up by you and

38:55.360 --> 39:01.280
 has unique representations that now you can trade. And the important part is that now you have this

39:01.280 --> 39:10.640
 is not only the NFTs themselves, but the ability to trade them quickly, fast, securely, knowing

39:11.520 --> 39:18.400
 who owns which rights. And that gives a totally new opportunity for content creators to be

39:18.400 --> 39:25.040
 remunerated for what they do. But ultimately, you still have to have that scalability, security

39:25.040 --> 39:33.680
 and decentralization to make it, you know, to make it work for bigger and bigger applications.

39:33.680 --> 39:37.680
 Correct. Yeah. Yeah. I still wonder what kind of applications are yet to be

39:38.800 --> 39:44.880
 like enabled by it because so much. The interesting thing about NFTs, you know,

39:44.880 --> 39:51.760
 if you look outside of art is just like money, you can start playing with different social

39:51.760 --> 40:01.920
 constructs, is you can start playing with the ideas. You can start playing with even like

40:01.920 --> 40:10.320
 investing. Somebody was talking about almost creating an economy out of like creative people

40:10.320 --> 40:15.520
 or influencers. Like if you start a YouTube channel or something like that, you can invest

40:15.520 --> 40:21.680
 in that person and you can start trading their creations. And then almost like create a market

40:22.240 --> 40:29.440
 out of people's ideas, out of people's creations, out of the people themselves that generate those

40:29.440 --> 40:33.200
 creations. And there's a lot of interesting possibilities of what you can do with that.

40:33.200 --> 40:40.880
 I mean, it seems ridiculous, but you're basically creating a hierarchy of value, maybe artificial

40:40.880 --> 40:47.680
 in the digital world and are trading that. But in so doing are inspiring people to create.

40:48.880 --> 40:55.600
 So maybe as a sort of our economy gets better and better and better where actual work in the

40:55.600 --> 41:01.760
 physical space becomes less and less in terms of its importance, maybe we'll completely be operating

41:01.760 --> 41:09.120
 in the digital space where these kinds of economies have more and more power. And then

41:09.120 --> 41:15.600
 you have to have this kind of blockchains to the scalability, security, and decentralization.

41:15.600 --> 41:22.400
 And then decentralization is of course the tricky one because people in power start to get nervous.

41:23.200 --> 41:29.600
 Absolutely. Once in power, you're always nervous that you'll be supplanted by somebody else.

41:29.600 --> 41:34.880
 But this is your job. Congratulations, you got the job, the top job, and now everybody wants it.

41:34.880 --> 41:41.600
 Well, what is your sense about our time and the future hope about the decentralization

41:42.560 --> 41:50.800
 of power? Do you think that's something that we can actually achieve given that power corrupts

41:50.800 --> 41:56.000
 and absolute power corrupts absolutely, and it's so wonderful to be absolutely powerful?

41:57.520 --> 42:02.720
 Well, good question. So first of all, I believe that by the way, there is a

42:02.720 --> 42:09.040
 complex question, Lex, and like all the rest of your questions.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.160
 I'm so very sorry.

42:13.920 --> 42:18.800
 It's okay. I am enjoying it. So there are two things. First of all,

42:19.360 --> 42:24.560
 power has been centralized for a variety of reasons. When you want to get it, it's easier

42:24.560 --> 42:32.400
 for somebody, even a single person, to grab power. But there is also some kind of a technology,

42:33.360 --> 42:40.480
 lack thereof, that justified having power. Because in a society in which even communication,

42:40.480 --> 42:46.960
 never mind blockchain, which is common knowledge, but even simple unilateral communication is hard,

42:46.960 --> 42:59.680
 it is much easier to say, you do as I say. So there is a little bit of a technology barrier.

42:59.680 --> 43:04.720
 But I think that now to get to this common knowledge, it is a totally different story.

43:04.720 --> 43:09.840
 Now we have finally the technology for doing this. So that is one part. But I really believe

43:09.840 --> 43:18.960
 that by having a distributed system, you have actually a much more stable and durable system.

43:19.840 --> 43:24.720
 Because not only for corruption, but even for things that go astray, and given a long enough

43:24.720 --> 43:33.680
 time by a strange version of Murphy's law, whatever goes wrong, goes wrong. And if the

43:33.680 --> 43:43.520
 power is diffused, you actually are much more stable. If you look at any complex living being,

43:43.520 --> 43:49.760
 it's distributed. I mean, I don't have somebody who says, okay, tell Silvio now it's time to eat.

43:50.560 --> 43:54.400
 You have millions of cells in your body. You have billions of bacteria.

43:54.400 --> 43:59.840
 Exactly. Help me in the guts. We are in a soup that somehow keeps us alive.

43:59.840 --> 44:09.200
 So strange enough, however, when we design systems, we design them centralized. We ourselves

44:09.200 --> 44:15.760
 are distributed beings. And when we plan to say, okay, I want to create an architecture,

44:15.760 --> 44:24.320
 how about I make a pyramid, I put this on the top and the power flows down. And so again,

44:24.320 --> 44:29.200
 it's a little bit perhaps of a technology problem. But now the technology is there.

44:29.200 --> 44:36.080
 So that is a big challenge to rethink how we want to organize power in a very large system and

44:37.840 --> 44:42.800
 distribute a system, in my opinion, much more resilient. Let's put it this way. There was

44:45.920 --> 44:53.680
 Italian compatriots, Machiavelli, who looked at the time, there was a bunch of small state

44:53.680 --> 44:58.560
 democratic Republic of Florence and Venice and the other thing. And there was the Ottoman Empire

44:58.560 --> 45:04.160
 that at the time was an empire and the Sultan was very centralized. And he made a political

45:04.160 --> 45:09.840
 observation that goes roughly to say, whenever you have such a centralized thing, it's very hard

45:09.840 --> 45:16.960
 to overtake that former government is centralized. But if you get it, it's so easy to keep

45:17.840 --> 45:26.400
 the population. While instead these other things are much more resilient. When the power is

45:26.400 --> 45:33.280
 distributed, it's going to be lasting for a much longer time. And ultimately maybe the human spirit

45:33.280 --> 45:36.960
 wants that kind of resilience, wants that kind of distribution. It's just that we didn't have

45:36.960 --> 45:41.440
 technology throughout history. Machiavelli didn't have the computer, the internet.

45:43.040 --> 45:48.720
 That is certainly part of a reason. Yes. You've written an interesting blog post. If we

45:48.720 --> 45:56.960
 just take a step out of the realm of bits and into the realm of governance, you wrote a blog

45:56.960 --> 46:03.120
 post about making Algorand governance decentralized. Can you explain what that means, the philosophy

46:03.120 --> 46:09.600
 behind that? How you decentralized basically all aspects of this kind of system?

46:09.600 --> 46:20.480
 Let's start with the philosophy. I really believe that nothing fixed lasts very long.

46:21.760 --> 46:30.240
 So I really believe that life is about intelligent adaptation. Things change, and we have to be

46:30.240 --> 46:42.400
 nimble and adjust to change. When I see a lot of a crypto project, I'm actually very proud to say

46:42.400 --> 46:50.400
 it's fixed in stone. Code is law. Law is code. I verify the code. It will never change. You go,

46:50.400 --> 46:56.320
 wow. When I'm saying this is a recipe to me of disaster, not immediately, but soon. Just imagine

46:56.320 --> 47:04.880
 you take an ocean liner, and you want to go, I don't know, from Lisbon to New York, and you set

47:04.880 --> 47:15.200
 a course, iceberg, no iceberg, tempest, no tempest. It doesn't matter. You need a teal. You need to

47:15.200 --> 47:25.920
 correct. You need to adjust. By the way, you would design Algorand with the idea that the code was

47:25.920 --> 47:32.880
 evolving as the needs. Of course, there is a system in which every time there is an adjustment,

47:32.880 --> 47:39.920
 you must have essentially a vote that right now is orchestrated at 90% of the stake. They say,

47:39.920 --> 47:45.680
 okay, we are ready. We agree on the next version, and we pick up this version. So we are able to

47:45.680 --> 47:51.840
 evolve without losing too many components left and right. But I think without evolving, any system

47:51.840 --> 47:59.760
 essentially becomes aesthetic and is going to shrivel and die sooner or later. That is needed.

48:01.200 --> 48:06.960
 What you want to do on the blockchain, you have a perfect platform in which you can log

48:08.480 --> 48:14.080
 your wishes, your votes, your things, so that you have a guarantee that whatever vote you express

48:14.080 --> 48:20.480
 is actually seen by everybody else. Everybody sees really the outcome, call it a referendum,

48:20.480 --> 48:27.280
 of a change. And Vete is, in my opinion, a system that wants to live long as to adapt.

48:28.640 --> 48:33.040
 There is an interesting question about leaders. I've talked to Vitalik Buterin. I'll probably

48:33.040 --> 48:40.720
 talk to him again soon. He's one of the leaders, maybe one of the faces of the Ethereum project.

48:40.720 --> 48:47.760
 And it's interesting. You have Satoshi Nakamoto, who's the face of Bitcoin, I guess. But he's

48:47.760 --> 48:56.800
 faceless. He, she, they. It does seem like in our whatever it is, maybe it's 20th century,

48:57.360 --> 49:04.400
 maybe it's Machiavellian thinking, but we seek leaders. Leaders have value. Linus Torvalds,

49:04.400 --> 49:14.240
 the leader of Linux, the open source development a lot. It's not that the leadership is sort of

49:14.240 --> 49:24.400
 dogmatic, but it's inspiring. And it's also powerful in that through leaders, we propagate

49:24.400 --> 49:30.080
 the vision. Like the vision of the project is more stable. Maybe not the details, but the vision.

49:30.640 --> 49:36.640
 And so do you think there's value to, because there's a tension between decentralization

49:36.640 --> 49:41.760
 and leadership, like in visionaries. What do you make of that tension?

49:41.760 --> 49:46.240
 SL. Okay. So I really believe that, that's another great question. I think of it,

49:47.680 --> 49:52.720
 I really believe in the power of emotions. I think the emotion are of a creative impulse

49:52.720 --> 49:59.760
 of everybody else. And therefore it's very easy for a leader to be a physical person, a real

49:59.760 --> 50:07.040
 being, and that interprets our emotions. And by the way, these emotions have to resonate.

50:07.040 --> 50:13.200
 And what is good is that the more intimate our emotions are, the more universal they are,

50:13.200 --> 50:19.360
 paradoxically. The more personal, the more everybody else somehow magically agrees and

50:19.360 --> 50:25.600
 feels a bit of the same. And it's very important to have a leader in the initial phase that

50:26.480 --> 50:31.520
 generates out of nothing something. That is important leadership. But then the true tested

50:31.520 --> 50:37.680
 leadership is to disappear after you lead the community. So in my opinion, the quintessential

50:37.680 --> 50:48.000
 leader according to my vision is George Washington. He served for one term, he served for another

50:48.000 --> 50:54.080
 term, and then all of a sudden he retired and became a private citizen. And two hundred and

50:54.080 --> 51:00.640
 change years later, we still are, with some defects, but we have done a lot of things right.

51:00.640 --> 51:04.640
 And we have been able to evolve. That to me is success in leadership.

51:05.280 --> 51:10.800
 While instead you contrast our experiment with a lot of our experiment. I've done so much so well

51:10.800 --> 51:16.080
 that I want another four years. And why shouldn't I be only a four and I have another eight?

51:16.640 --> 51:21.920
 Why should it be another eight? Give me 16 and I will fix all your problems. And then is the type,

51:21.920 --> 51:29.200
 in my opinion, of failed leadership. Leadership ought to be really lead, ignite, and disappear.

51:29.200 --> 51:34.800
 And if you don't disappear, the system is going to die with you. It is not a good idea for everybody

51:34.800 --> 51:40.080
 else. So we've been talking a little bit about cryptocurrency, but is there spaces where

51:40.720 --> 51:45.680
 this kind of blockchain ideas that you're describing, which I find fascinating,

51:47.040 --> 51:52.320
 do you think they can revolutionize some other aspects of our world that's not just money?

51:52.320 --> 51:59.920
 A lot of things are going to be revolutionized is independent of finance. By the way,

51:59.920 --> 52:07.600
 I really believe that finance is an incredible form of freedom. I mean,

52:07.600 --> 52:11.760
 if I'm free to do everything I want, but I don't have the means to do anything, that's a bad idea.

52:11.760 --> 52:18.720
 So I really think financial freedom is very, very important. But you just can say that against

52:18.720 --> 52:24.080
 you know, censorship, you write something on the chain and now nobody can take it out.

52:24.080 --> 52:35.120
 That is a very important way to express our view. And then the transparency that you give,

52:35.120 --> 52:41.520
 because everybody can see what's happening on the blockchain. So transparency is not money.

52:41.520 --> 52:49.520
 But I believe that transparency actually is a very important ingredient also of finance. Let's put

52:49.520 --> 52:57.760
 this way, as much as I'm enthusiastic about blockchain and decentralized finance, and we have

52:57.760 --> 53:03.280
 actually our expression, we're creating this future five, because as much as we want to do,

53:03.280 --> 53:11.680
 we must agree that the first guarantee of financial growth and prosperity are really

53:11.680 --> 53:16.720
 the legal system, the courts. Because we may not think about them and say, oh, the courts

53:16.720 --> 53:22.640
 are a bunch of boring lawyers. But without them, I'm saying there is no certainty. There is no

53:24.160 --> 53:29.600
 notion of equality. There is no notion that you can resolve your disputes thing. That's

53:29.600 --> 53:35.040
 what thrives commerce and things. And so what I really believe that the blockchain actually

53:35.040 --> 53:41.440
 makes a lot of this trust essentially automatic, but make it impossible to cheat in very way. You

53:41.440 --> 53:49.040
 don't even need to go to court if nobody can change the ledger. So essentially it's a way of

53:50.880 --> 53:55.680
 you cannot solve an illegal system that reduces to a blockchain. But what I'm saying, a big chunk

53:55.680 --> 54:01.920
 of it can actually be guaranteed. And there is no reason why technology should be antagonistic

54:03.680 --> 54:09.120
 to legal scholarship. It could be actually coexisting and one should start to doing the

54:09.120 --> 54:15.280
 interest things that the technology alone cannot do. And then you go from there. But I think that

54:16.160 --> 54:23.920
 essentially blockchain can affect all kinds of our behavior.

54:23.920 --> 54:30.400
 Yeah. So in some sense, the transparency, the required transparency ensures honesty,

54:30.400 --> 54:34.320
 prevents corruption. So there's a lot of systems that could use that. And the legal system is one

54:34.320 --> 54:40.880
 of them. There's a little bit of attention that I wonder if you can speak to where this kind of

54:40.880 --> 54:49.440
 transparency, there's a tension with privacy. Is it possible to achieve privacy if wanted

54:49.440 --> 54:55.440
 on a blockchain? Do you have ideas about different technologies that can do that? People have been

54:55.440 --> 55:04.000
 playing with different ideas. So absolutely. The answer is yes. And by the way, I'm a cryptographer.

55:04.000 --> 55:13.200
 Right. Okay. So I really believe in privacy and I believe in and I've devoted a big chunk of my

55:13.200 --> 55:20.320
 life to guarantee privacy, even when it seems almost impossible to have it. And it is possible

55:20.320 --> 55:28.560
 to have it also in the blockchain too. However, I believe in timing as well. And I believe that

55:28.560 --> 55:41.200
 the people have the right to understand their system they live in. And right now people can

55:41.200 --> 55:50.560
 understand the blockchain to be something that cannot be altered and is transparent. And that

55:50.560 --> 55:59.520
 is good enough. And there is a pseudo privacy for the fact that who knows if this public key belongs

55:59.520 --> 56:05.440
 to me or to you. And I can, when I want to change my money from one public key, I split it to other

56:05.440 --> 56:09.520
 public keys, going to figure out which one is Silvio or all of them are Silvio or only one of

56:09.520 --> 56:15.600
 Silvio. Who knows? So you get some vanilla privacy, not the one I could talk. And I think it's good

56:15.600 --> 56:21.680
 enough because, and it's important for now that we absorb this stage. Because in the next stage,

56:21.680 --> 56:27.040
 we must understand the privacy tool rather than taking on faith. When the public starts saying,

56:27.040 --> 56:31.120
 I believe in the scientists and whatever they say, I swear by them. And therefore,

56:31.120 --> 56:35.520
 the term is private is private and nobody understands it very well. We need a much more

56:35.520 --> 56:44.400
 educated about the tools we are using. And so I look forward to deploying more and more privacy

56:44.400 --> 56:53.680
 on the blockchain, but we are not, I will not rush to it until the people understand and are behind

56:53.680 --> 56:59.760
 whatever we have right now. So you build privacy on top of the power of the blockchain. You have

56:59.760 --> 57:06.320
 to first understand the power of the blockchain. Yes. So Algorand is like one of the most exciting,

57:06.320 --> 57:11.520
 technically at least from my perspective, technologies, ideas in this whole space.

57:12.160 --> 57:16.960
 What's the future of Algorand look like? Is it possible for it to dominate the world?

57:17.760 --> 57:26.320
 Let's put it this way. I certainly working very hard with a great team to give the best blockchain

57:26.320 --> 57:34.640
 that one can demand and enjoy. And they said, I really believe that there is going to be,

57:35.680 --> 57:42.080
 it's not a winner takes them all. So it's going to be a few blockchains and each one is going to

57:42.080 --> 57:49.600
 have its own brand and it's going to be great at something. And sometimes it's scalability,

57:49.600 --> 57:56.320
 sometimes it's your views, sometimes it's a thing. And it's important to have a dialogue between

57:56.320 --> 58:01.440
 these things. And I'm sure, and I'm working very hard to make sure that Algorand is one of them,

58:01.440 --> 58:11.920
 but I don't believe that it's even desirable to have a winner takes all because we need to express

58:11.920 --> 58:16.400
 different things. But the important thing is going to have enough interoperability with

58:16.400 --> 58:23.520
 various systems so that you can transfer your assets where you have the best tool to service

58:23.520 --> 58:28.560
 them, whatever your needs are at the time. So there's an idea, I don't know, they call

58:28.560 --> 58:35.600
 themselves Bitcoin maximalists, which is essentially the bet that the philosophy that

58:36.400 --> 58:42.560
 Bitcoin will eat the world. So you're talking about, it's good to have variety.

58:42.560 --> 58:50.640
 Their claim is it's good to have the best technology dominate the medium of exchange,

58:50.640 --> 58:57.040
 the medium of store of value, the money, the digital currency space.

58:58.160 --> 59:01.840
 What's your sense of the positives and the negatives of that?

59:03.360 --> 59:12.400
 So I feel people are smart and it's going to be very hard for anybody to win. And because

59:12.400 --> 59:19.840
 people want more and more things. There is an Italian saying that translates well, I think.

59:20.640 --> 59:27.040
 It goes, the appetite grows while eating. I think you understand what he means. So I say,

59:27.040 --> 59:33.520
 I'm not hungry. Okay, food. Let me try this. So we want more and more and more. And when you find

59:33.520 --> 59:39.360
 something like Bitcoin, which are already very good things to say, but it does something very

59:39.360 --> 59:47.680
 well, but it's a static, I mean, store of value. Yes, I think it's a great way for the rest. You

59:47.680 --> 59:53.920
 know, it would be a sad world if the world in which we are so anchoring down, so defensive

59:53.920 --> 59:59.840
 that we want to store value and hide it under the mattress. I long for a world in which is open.

59:59.840 --> 1:00:05.600
 People want to transact, interact with each other. And therefore, when you want to store value,

1:00:05.600 --> 1:00:12.320
 one, perhaps one chain, where you want to have to transact, maybe is another. I'm not saying that,

1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:17.200
 you know, one chain cannot be store of value or another thing, but I really believe,

1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:25.120
 I believe in the ingenuity of people and in the innovation that is intrinsic to the human nature.

1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:28.880
 We want always different things. So how can it be something invented,

1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:33.200
 whatever it is decades ago, is going to fulfill the needs of our future generations.

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:43.200
 I'm not going to fulfill my needs, let alone my kids or their kids. We are going to have a

1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:50.240
 different world and things will evolve. So you believe that life, intelligent life,

1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:58.800
 is ultimately about adaptability and evolving. So static loses in the end.

1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:05.680
 Yes. Let me ask the, well, first the ridiculous question. Do you have any

1:01:05.680 --> 1:01:10.880
 clue who Satoshi Nakamoto is? Is that even an interesting question?

1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:19.920
 Well, your questions are very interesting. So, and I think, so I would say, first of all,

1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:25.360
 it's not me. Okay. And I can prove it because, you know, if I were Satoshi Nakamoto, I would

1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:31.680
 have not found an algorithm. It takes a totally different principle to approach to the system.

1:01:31.680 --> 1:01:36.800
 But the other thing, who is Satoshi Nakamoto? You know what the right answer is? It's not him

1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:46.080
 or her or them. Satoshi Nakamoto is Bitcoin. Because to me, it's such a coherent proof of

1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:52.640
 work that at the end, the creator and the creation identify themselves. So you say,

1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:57.280
 okay, I understand Michelangelo. Okay. He did the Sistine Chapel. Fine. He did the

1:01:57.280 --> 1:02:04.480
 St. Peter's Dome. Fine. He did the Moses of the Pieta statue. Fine. But besides this,

1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:10.160
 who was Michelangelo? That's the wrong question. It's his own work. That is Michelangelo.

1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:18.640
 So I think that when you look at the Bitcoin is a piece of work that as it defects, yes,

1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:26.160
 like anything human, but it was captivated the imaginations of millions of people as subverted

1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:34.720
 the status quo. And I'm saying, you know, whoever this person of people are, he's living in this

1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:43.360
 piece of work. I mean, it is Bitcoin. The idea of the work is bigger. We forget that sometimes.

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:49.200
 It's something about our biology likes to see a face and attach a face to the idea when really

1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:54.320
 the idea is the thing we love. The idea is the thing that impact the idea is the thing that

1:02:54.320 --> 1:03:00.080
 ultimately we, you know, Steve Jobs or somebody like that, we associate with the Mac or the iPhone

1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:05.920
 with just everything he did at Apple. Apple, actually the company is Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs,

1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:13.520
 the man is a pales in comparison to the creation. Correct. And the sense of aesthetics that has

1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:19.680
 brought to the daily lives and very often aesthetic wins in the long, in the long,

1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:25.440
 in the long game. And these are very elegant design product. And when you say, Oh,

1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:31.360
 elegance, very few people care about it. Apparently millions and millions and millions

1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:36.320
 and millions of people do because we are attacked by beauty and these are beautifully designed

1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:44.400
 products. And, and, and, you know, and they've in addition to ever the technological aspect

1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:50.400
 of the other thing. And I think, yes, that is, yeah, as the Stajewski said, beauty will save

1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:57.760
 the world. So I'm, I'm with you on that one. Right. It currently seems like cryptocurrency,

1:03:57.760 --> 1:04:07.120
 all these different technologies are gathering a lot of excitement, not just in our discourse,

1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:13.600
 but in their like scale of financial impact. A lot of companies are starting to invest in Bitcoin.

1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:25.760
 Do you think that the main method of store value and exchange of value, basically money will soon

1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:28.640
 or at some point in the century will become cryptocurrency?

1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:36.240
 Yes. So mind you, as I said, that the notion of cryptocurrency, like any other fundamental human

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:44.960
 notion has to evolve, but yes. So I think of it, uh, he has a lot of momentum behind it.

1:04:45.520 --> 1:04:55.120
 Um, it's not only static as a visa programmable money as a smart contract. It allows a peer to

1:04:55.120 --> 1:05:01.520
 peer interaction among people who don't even know each other. Right. Uh, and they don't even,

1:05:01.520 --> 1:05:06.400
 therefore I cannot even trust each other just because they never saw each other.

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:12.400
 So I think it's so powerful that, uh, uh, is going to do this said again,

1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:20.080
 a particular cryptocurrency should develop and cryptocurrency will all develop. But the answer

1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:28.000
 is yes, we are going towards a much more, uh, unless we have a society, a sudden crisis for

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:34.080
 different reasons, which nobody hopes there's always an asteroid. There's always something,

1:05:34.080 --> 1:05:38.640
 uh, nuclear war and all the existential crisis that we kind of think about,

1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:44.560
 including artificial intelligence. Uh, okay. It's funny. You mentioned that, um,

1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:50.400
 um, Michelangelo and Steve jobs, you know, set of ideas represents the person's work.

1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:55.440
 So we talked about Algorand, which is a super interesting set of technologies, but,

1:05:56.240 --> 1:06:05.520
 you know, he did also win the touring award. You have a bunch of, you have a bunch of ideas that

1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:12.800
 are, you know, seminal ideas. So can we talk about cryptography for a little bit? What is the most

1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:19.520
 beautiful idea in cryptography or computer science or mathematics in general asking somebody who has

1:06:19.520 --> 1:06:26.400
 explored the depths of all? Well, there are a few contenders

1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:38.880
 and, uh, either your work or, uh, or other words, uh, let's leave my work aside and, uh, and, uh,

1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:49.120
 so, but one powerful idea and is, uh, both an old idea in some sense and a very, very modern one.

1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:57.520
 And, uh, in my opinion is this idea of a one way function. So a function that easy to evaluate.

1:06:57.520 --> 1:07:06.480
 So given X, you can compute F of X easily, but given F of X is very hard to go back to X. Okay.

1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:17.120
 Think like breaking a glass, easy. Reconstruct the glass harder. Frying an egg, easy. From the

1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:23.920
 fried egg to go back to the original egg, harder. If you want to be extreme, killing a living being,

1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:31.840
 unfortunately, easy. The other way around, very hard. And so the fact that the notion of a function,

1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:37.520
 whichever a recipe that is in front of your eyes to transform an X into F of X,

1:07:37.520 --> 1:07:43.200
 and then from F of X, even though you see the recipe to transform it, you cannot go back to X.

1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:53.440
 That in my opinion is one of the most elegant and momentous notions that there are. And it is a

1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:58.960
 computational notion because of the difficulties in a computational sense. And it's a mathematical

1:07:58.960 --> 1:08:05.360
 notion because we were talking about function. And it's so fruitful because that is actually

1:08:05.360 --> 1:08:10.320
 the foundation of all cryptography. And let me tell you, it's an old notion

1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:19.600
 because very often in any mythology that we think of, the most powerful gods or goddesses are the

1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:27.040
 ones of X and the opposite of X, the gods of love and death. And when you take opposites,

1:08:27.040 --> 1:08:32.960
 they don't just erase one another, you create something way more powerful. And this one,

1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:40.480
 the function is extremely powerful because essentially becomes something that is easy

1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:48.400
 for the good guys and hard for the bad guys. So for instance, in pseudo random number generation,

1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:54.880
 the easy part of the function corresponds, you want to generate bits very quickly. And hard is

1:08:54.880 --> 1:09:02.160
 predicting what the next bit is. It doesn't look the same. One is X f of X going from X f of X to

1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:12.080
 X. What does it do? Predicting bits. By a magic of reductions in mathematical apparatus, this simple

1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:18.240
 function morphs itself into pseudo random generation. This simple function morphs itself in

1:09:18.240 --> 1:09:23.920
 digital signature scheme in which digitally signing should be easy and forging should be

1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:28.800
 and forging should be hard. Again, a digital signature is not going from X to f of X,

1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:37.440
 but the magic and the richness of this notion is that it is so powerful that it morphs in all

1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:44.720
 kinds of incredible constructs. And in both these two opposites coexist, the easy and the hard,

1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:52.160
 and in my opinion is a very, very elegant notion. That simple notion ties together cryptography,

1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:59.520
 and like you said, pseudo random number generation. You have work on pseudo random functions.

1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:08.240
 What are those? What's the difference in those and the generators, the pseudo random number

1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:16.000
 generators? How do they work? Let's go back to pseudo random number generation. First of all,

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.600
 people think that the pseudo random number generation generates a random number. Not true,

1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:28.320
 because I don't believe that from nothing you can get something. So nothing from nothing.

1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:34.080
 But randomness, you cannot create it out of nothing, but what you could do

1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:41.840
 is that it can be expanded. In other words, if you give me somehow 300 random bits,

1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:48.560
 truly random bits, then I can give you 300,000, 300 million, 300 trillions, 300 quadrillions,

1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:55.840
 as many as you want random bits, so that even though I tell you the recipe by which I produce

1:10:55.840 --> 1:11:02.320
 these bits, but I don't tell you the initial 300 random numbers, I keep them secret, and you see

1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:09.200
 all the bits I produced so far, if you were to bet, given all the bits produced so far,

1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:15.120
 what is the next bit in my sequence? Better than 50, 50. Of course, 50, 50, anybody can guess.

1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:23.200
 But to be inferring something, you have to be a bit better. Then the effort to do this extra bit

1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:29.360
 is so enormous that is de facto random. So that is a pseudo random generator, are these

1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:37.200
 expanders of secret randomness, which goes extremely fast. Okay, that said, what is that?

1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:43.600
 Expanders of secret randomness, beautifully put. Okay, so every time somebody, if you're a

1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:49.120
 programmer, is using a function that's not called pseudo random, it's called random usually,

1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:54.320
 you know, these programming languages, and it's generating different, that's essentially

1:11:54.320 --> 1:12:00.480
 expanding the secret randomness. But they should. In the past, actually, most of the library,

1:12:00.480 --> 1:12:07.920
 they used something pre modern cryptography, unfortunately. They would be better served

1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:17.040
 with 300 real seed random number, and then expand them properly, as we know now.

1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:25.520
 But that has been a very old idea. In fact, one of the best philosophers have debated

1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:31.680
 whether the world was deterministic or probabilistic. Very big questions, right?

1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:33.520
 Does God play dice?

1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:40.720
 Exactly. Einstein says it does, it doesn't. But in fact, now we have a language that even

1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:45.280
 at the Albert time was not around, but it was this complex theory of modern

1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:52.480
 complexity based cryptography. And now we know that if the universe has 300 random bits,

1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:58.000
 whether where is random or probabilistic or deterministic, it doesn't matter,

1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:04.560
 because you can expand this initial seed of randomness forever in which all the experiments

1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:08.720
 you could do, all the inferences you could do, all the things you could do, they are,

1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:13.680
 you are not be able to distinguish them from truly random. So if you are not able to distinguish

1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:21.120
 truly random from this super duper pseudo randomness, are they really different things?

1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:27.200
 So many to become really philosophical. So for things to be different, but I don't have

1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:32.480
 in my lifetime, in the lifetime of the universe, any method to set them aside,

1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:38.480
 well, I should be intellectually honest, say, well, pseudo random in this special

1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:40.400
 fraction is as good as random.

1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:46.560
 Do you think true randomness is possible? And what does that mean?

1:13:48.160 --> 1:13:52.320
 So practically speaking, exactly as you said, if you're being honest,

1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:57.680
 that the pseudo randomness approaches true randomness pretty quickly.

1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:03.840
 But is it, maybe this is a philosophical question. Is there such a thing as true randomness?

1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:13.680
 Well, the answer is actually maybe, but if it exists, most probably it's expensive to get.

1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:19.040
 And in any case, if I give you one of mine,

1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:26.560
 you will never tell them apart by any other shape, no matter how much you work on it.

1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:32.640
 So in some sense, if it exists or not, it really is a quote philosophical sense in the

1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:38.240
 colloquial way to say that we cannot somehow pin it down.

1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:43.360
 Do you ever, again, just to stay unphilosophical for a bit, for a brief moment,

1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:52.640
 do you ever think about free will and whether that exists because ultimately free will sort of

1:14:52.640 --> 1:14:59.680
 is this experience that we have, like we're making choices, even though it appears that,

1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:05.520
 you know, the world is deterministic at the core. I mean, that's against the debate,

1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:13.520
 but if it is in fact deterministic at the lowest possible level, at the physics level,

1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:20.240
 how do you make, if it is deterministic, how do you make sense of the difference between the

1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:24.640
 experience of us feeling like we're making a choice and the whole thing being deterministic?

1:15:25.200 --> 1:15:30.640
 So first of all, let me give you a gut reaction to the question. And the gut reaction is that

1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:39.920
 it is important that we believe that there exists free will. And second of all, almost

1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:48.960
 by weird logic, if we believe it exists, then it does exist. Okay. So it's very important for our

1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:55.840
 social apparatus, for our sense of ourselves that it exists. And the moment in which, you know,

1:15:55.840 --> 1:16:02.080
 we so want to, we almost conjure it up in existence. But again, I really feel that if

1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:11.280
 you look at some point, the space of free will seems to shrink. We realize how more and more,

1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:17.680
 how much of our, say, genetic apparatus dictates who we are, why we prefer certain things than

1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:23.760
 others, right, and why we react to noises of music. We really prefer poetry and everything

1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:31.040
 else. We may explain even all this. But at the end of the day, whether it exists in a

1:16:31.040 --> 1:16:38.720
 philosophical sense or not, it's like randomness. If pseudo random is as good as random vis a vis

1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:42.560
 lifetime of the universe, our experience, then it doesn't really matter.

1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:48.400
 Yeah. So, you know, we're talking about randomness. I wonder if I can weave in

1:16:48.400 --> 1:16:55.280
 quantum mechanics for a brief moment. There's a, you know, a lot of advancements on the quantum

1:16:55.280 --> 1:17:02.640
 computing side. So leveraging quantum mechanics to perform a new kind of computation, and there's

1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:08.880
 concern of that being a threat to a lot of the basic assumptions that underlie cryptography.

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:16.800
 What do you think? Do you think quantum computing will challenge a lot of cryptography? Will

1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:20.640
 cryptography be able to defend all those kinds of things?

1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:25.440
 Okay, great. So first of all, for the record, and not because I think it matters, but it's

1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:32.400
 important to set the record, there are people who continue to contend that quantum mechanics exist,

1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:37.840
 but that's nothing to do with computing. It's not going to accelerate it, at least, you know,

1:17:37.840 --> 1:17:45.600
 very basic, you know, hard computation. That is a belief that you cannot take it out. I'm a little

1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:52.320
 bit more agnostic about it, but I really believe, going back to whatever I said about the one way

1:17:52.320 --> 1:17:58.960
 function. So one way function, what is it? That is a cryptography. So does quantum computing

1:17:58.960 --> 1:18:04.160
 challenge the one way function? Essentially, you can boil it down to does quantum computing

1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:08.720
 challenge the one way function. What is one way function? Easy in one direction, hard in the other.

1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:16.560
 Okay, but if quantum computing exists, when you define what it is easy, it's not easy by a classical

1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:22.640
 computer and hard by a classical computer, but easy for a quantum computer, that's a bad idea.

1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:30.720
 But once easy means it should be easy for a quantum and hard for also quantum. Then you can

1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:36.720
 see that you are, yes, it's a challenge, but you have hope because you can absorb if one computing

1:18:36.720 --> 1:18:44.000
 really realizes and becomes available according to the promises, then you can use them also for the

1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:50.720
 easy part. And once you use it from the easy part, the choices that you have a one way function,

1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:57.680
 they multiply. So, okay, so they particularly candidates of one way function, they not only

1:18:57.680 --> 1:19:06.080
 candidates of one way function, they not be one way anymore, but quantum one way function may

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:18.480
 continue to exist. And so I really believe that for life to be meaningful, this one way function

1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:28.240
 had to exist. Because just imagine that anything that is becomes easy to do. I mean, what kind of

1:19:28.240 --> 1:19:35.120
 life is it? I mean, so you need that. And if something is hard, but it's so hard to generate,

1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:39.920
 you'll never find something which is hard for you. You want to that there is abundance,

1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:44.960
 that is easy to produce hard problem. That's my opinion is why life is interesting,

1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:54.080
 because pop up really, really speed. So in some sense, I almost think that I do hope they exist

1:19:54.080 --> 1:19:59.440
 if they don't exist, somehow life is way less interesting than it actually is.

1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:05.920
 Yeah, it does. That's funny. It does seem like the one way function is fundamental to all of life,

1:20:05.920 --> 1:20:12.720
 which is the emergence of the complexity that we see around us seem to require the one way function.

1:20:12.720 --> 1:20:18.960
 I don't know if you play with cellular automata. That's just another formulation of.

1:20:18.960 --> 1:20:22.000
 I know, but it's very simple.

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:28.640
 It's almost a very simple illustration of starting out with simple rules in one way,

1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:34.080
 being able to generate incredible amounts of complexity. But then you ask the question,

1:20:34.080 --> 1:20:44.160
 can I reverse that? And it's just surprising how difficult it is to reverse that. It's surprising,

1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:52.240
 even in constrained situations, it's very difficult to prove anything that it almost,

1:20:52.240 --> 1:20:58.160
 I mean, the sad thing about it. Well, I don't know if it's sad, but it seems like we don't

1:20:58.160 --> 1:21:04.960
 even have the mathematical tools to reverse engineer stuff. I don't know if they exist or not,

1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:08.640
 but in the space of cellular automata, where you start with something simple and you create

1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:14.000
 something incredibly complex, can you take something, a small picture of that complex

1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:19.520
 and reverse engineer? That's kind of what we're doing as scientists here. You're seeing the result

1:21:19.520 --> 1:21:24.400
 of the complexity and you're trying to come up with some universal law that generate all of this.

1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:29.280
 What is the theory of everything? What are the basic physics laws that generated this whole

1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:35.120
 thing? And there's a hope that you should be able to do that, but it gets, it's difficult.

1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:40.560
 Yeah. But there is also some poetry on the fact that it's difficult because it gives us some

1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:48.000
 mystery to life, without which, I mean, it's not so fun. Life is no business fun.

1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:52.720
 Can we talk about interactive proofs a little bit and zero knowledge proofs? What are those?

1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:55.200
 What are those? How do they work?

1:21:55.200 --> 1:22:06.560
 So interactive proof actually is a modern realization and conceptualization of something

1:22:06.560 --> 1:22:12.880
 that we knew was true, that is easy to go to lecture. In fact, that's my motivation.

1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:17.520
 We invented schools to go to lecture. We don't say, oh, I'm the minister of education. I published

1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:24.880
 this book. You read it. This is book for this year, this book for this year. We spend a lot

1:22:24.880 --> 1:22:31.600
 of our treasury in educating our kids and in person, educating, go to class, interact with

1:22:31.600 --> 1:22:37.920
 teacher, on the blackboard and chalk on my time. Now we can have a whiteboard and presumably you're

1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:46.240
 going to have actually this magic pens and a display instead. But the idea is that interactively

1:22:46.240 --> 1:22:53.280
 you can convey truth much more efficiently. We knew this psychologically. It's better to

1:22:53.280 --> 1:23:00.320
 hear an explanation than just to belabor some paper. Same thing. So interactive proofs is a

1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:06.320
 way to do the following. Rather than doing some complicated, very long papers and possibly

1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:12.720
 infinitely long proofs, exponentially long proofs, you say the following. If this theorem is true,

1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:18.560
 there is a game that is associated to the theorem. If the theorem is true, this game,

1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:25.680
 I have a winning strategy that I can win half of the time, no matter what you do.

1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:30.240
 So then you say, well, is the theorem true? You believe me. Why should I believe you? Okay,

1:23:30.240 --> 1:23:38.000
 let's play. If I prove that I have a strategy and I win the first time and I win the second time,

1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:45.440
 then I lose a third time. But I win more than half of the time, or I win, say, all the time

1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:50.080
 if the theorem is true, and at least at most half of the time if the theorem is false, you

1:23:50.080 --> 1:23:59.520
 statistically get convinced. You can verify this quickly. And therefore, when the game typically

1:23:59.520 --> 1:24:06.480
 is extremely fast, so you generate a miniature game in which if the theorem is true, I win all

1:24:06.480 --> 1:24:12.480
 the time, and if the theorem is false, I can win at most half of the time. And if I win, win, win,

1:24:12.480 --> 1:24:16.640
 win, win, win, win, win, you can deduce either the theorem is true, which most probably is my

1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:25.760
 case of the week, or I've been very, very unlucky because it's like if I had 100 coin tosses and I

1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:33.520
 got 100 heads. Very improbable. So that is a way. And so this transformation from the formal

1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:41.520
 statement of a proof into a game that can be quickly played, and you can draw statistics

1:24:41.520 --> 1:24:50.400
 how many times you win, is one of a big conquest of modern complexity theory. And in fact,

1:24:50.400 --> 1:24:57.040
 actually has highlighted the notion of a proof as it really gives us a new insight of what to

1:24:57.040 --> 1:25:05.760
 be true means and what truth is and what proofs are. So these are legitimately proofs. So what

1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:17.200
 kind of mysteries can it allow us to unlock and prove? You said truth. So what does it allow us?

1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:24.160
 What kind of truth does that allow us to arrive at? So it enlarges the realm of what is provable

1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:29.840
 because in some sense of the classical way of proving things was extremely

1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:34.720
 inefficient from the verifier point of view. Yes.

1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:41.680
 Right. And so therefore, there is so much proof that you can take. But in this way,

1:25:41.680 --> 1:25:49.920
 you can actually very quickly, in minutes, verify something that is the correctness of an assertion

1:25:49.920 --> 1:25:56.720
 that otherwise would have taken a lifetime to belabor and check all the passages of a very,

1:25:56.720 --> 1:26:02.560
 very, very long proof. And you better check all of them because if you don't check one line,

1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:08.240
 an error can be in that line. And so you have to go linearly through all the stuff rather than

1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:13.920
 bypass this. So you enlarge a tremendous amount what the proof is. And in addition,

1:26:13.920 --> 1:26:20.080
 once you have the idea that essentially a proof system is something that

1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:28.880
 allows me to convince you of a true statement, but does not allow me to convince you of a false

1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:35.920
 statement, and that at the end is proof. Proof can be beautiful, should be elegant,

1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:43.840
 but at the end is true or false. It is possible to prove the truth and it should be impossible

1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:49.760
 or statistically extremely hard to prove something false. And if you do this, you can prove way,

1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:56.720
 way more once you understand this. And on top of it, we got some insight like in this zero

1:26:56.720 --> 1:27:04.320
 knowledge proofs that is in something which you took for granted where the same knowledge

1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:11.920
 and verification are actually separate concepts. So you can verify that an assertion is correct

1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:18.320
 without having any idea why this is so. And so people failed to say, if you want to verify

1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:22.320
 something, you have to have the proof. Once you have the proof, you know why it's true,

1:27:22.320 --> 1:27:33.120
 you have the proof itself. So somehow you can totally differentiate knowledge and verification

1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:37.280
 validity. So totally, you can decide if something is true and still have no idea.

1:27:37.280 --> 1:27:38.880
 Is there a good example in your mind?

1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:47.600
 Oh, actually, you know, at the beginning, we labored to find the first zero knowledge proof.

1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:53.280
 Then we found a second, then we found a third. And then a few years later, actually, we proved

1:27:53.280 --> 1:28:01.760
 a theorem which essentially says every theorem, no matter what about, can be explained in a zero

1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:10.640
 knowledge way. So it's not a class of theorem, but all theorems. And it's a very powerful thing. So

1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:18.000
 we were really, for thousands of years, bought this identity between knowledge and verification

1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:23.600
 had to be hand in hand together, and for no reason at all. I mean, we had to develop a

1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:28.880
 way of technology. As you know, I'm very big on technology because it makes us more human

1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:37.200
 and make us understand more things than before. And I think that's a good thing.

1:28:37.760 --> 1:28:43.600
 So this interactive proof process, there's power in games.

1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:43.840
 Yes.

1:28:43.840 --> 1:28:49.200
 And you've recently gotten into, recently, I'm not sure you can correct me, mechanism design.

1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:50.240
 Yeah.

1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:58.720
 So first of all, maybe you can explain what mechanism design is and the fascinating

1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:02.480
 space of playing with games and designing games.

1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:10.480
 Mechanism design is that you want a certain behavior to arise. If you want to organize

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:17.200
 a societal structure or something, you want to have some orderly behavior to arise because

1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:26.240
 it is important for your goals. But you know that people, they don't care what my goals are.

1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:32.960
 They care about maximizing their utility. So put it crassly, making money. The more money,

1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:36.320
 the better, so to speak. I'm exaggerating.

1:29:36.320 --> 1:29:39.280
 Self interest in whatever way then.

1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:48.640
 So what you want to do is, ideally, what you want to do is to design a game so that

1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:56.880
 while people play it, so to maximize their self interest, they achieve the social goal

1:29:56.880 --> 1:30:03.760
 and behavior that I want. That is really the best type of thing. And it is a very

1:30:03.760 --> 1:30:18.560
 hard science and art to design these games. And it challenges us to actually come up with

1:30:18.560 --> 1:30:24.880
 solution concepts for a way to analyzing the games that need to be broader. And I think

1:30:25.760 --> 1:30:32.320
 game theory has developed a bunch of very compelling ways to analyze the game,

1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:37.920
 that if the game has the best property, you can have a pretty good guarantee that it's going to

1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:45.360
 be played in a given way. But as it turns out, and not surprisingly, these tools have a range

1:30:45.360 --> 1:30:50.080
 of action like anything else. All these so called the technical resolution concept,

1:30:50.080 --> 1:30:54.880
 the way to analyze the game, like dominant strategy equilibrium, if something comes to mind,

1:30:54.880 --> 1:31:02.720
 would be very meaningful. But as a limited power, in some sense, the games that can be

1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:05.680
 admit to such a way to be analyzed.

1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:09.920
 There's a very specific kind of games and the rules are set, the constraints are set,

1:31:09.920 --> 1:31:11.840
 the utilities are all set.

1:31:11.840 --> 1:31:19.040
 Yes. So if you want to reason, if there is a way, say, that you can analyze a restricted

1:31:19.040 --> 1:31:26.240
 class of games this way, but most games don't fall into this restricted class, then what do I do?

1:31:26.240 --> 1:31:35.280
 When you need to enlarge a way what a rational player can do. So for instance, in my opinion,

1:31:35.280 --> 1:31:44.080
 at least in some of my, I played with this for a few years, and I was doing some exoteric things,

1:31:44.080 --> 1:31:50.640
 I'm sure, in the space that was not exactly mainstream. And then I changed my interest in

1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:58.000
 blockchain. But what I'm saying for a while I was doing. So for instance, to me, is a way in which

1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:04.720
 I design the game, and you don't have the best move for you. The best move is the move that is

1:32:04.720 --> 1:32:08.800
 best for you, no matter what the other players are doing. Sometimes a game doesn't have that,

1:32:08.800 --> 1:32:15.280
 okay, it's too much to ask. But I can design the game such that given the option in front of you

1:32:15.280 --> 1:32:20.560
 say, oh, these are really stupid for me, take them aside. But these, these are not stupid.

1:32:21.200 --> 1:32:27.760
 So if you design the game so that in any combination of non stupid things that the player

1:32:27.760 --> 1:32:36.320
 can do, I achieve what I want, I'm done. I don't care to find the very unique equilibrium. I don't

1:32:36.320 --> 1:32:41.360
 give a damn. I want to say, well, as long as you don't do stupid things, and nobody else does

1:32:41.360 --> 1:32:48.640
 stupid things, good social things outcome arise, I should be equally happy. And so I really believe

1:32:48.640 --> 1:33:01.360
 that this type of analysis is possible and has a bigger radius. So it reaches more games, more

1:33:01.360 --> 1:33:07.920
 classes or games. And after that, we have to enlarge it again. And it's going to be, we're

1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:15.520
 going to have fun because human behavior can be conceptualized in many ways. And it's a long game.

1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:20.480
 It's a long game. Do you have favorite games that you're looking at now? I mean, I suppose

1:33:20.480 --> 1:33:26.800
 your work with blockchain and Algorand is a kind of game that you're basically this mechanism

1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:34.720
 design, design the game such that it's scalable, secure and decentralized, right? Yes. And very

1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:43.840
 often you have to say, and you must also design so that the incentives are, and tell you the truth,

1:33:43.840 --> 1:33:51.280
 whatever little I learned from my venture in mechanism design is that incentives are very

1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:59.040
 hard to design because people are very complex creatures. And so somehow the way we design

1:33:59.040 --> 1:34:08.000
 Algorand is a totally different way, essentially with no incentives, essentially. But technically

1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:16.560
 speaking, there is a notion that is actually believable, right? So that to say people want

1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:23.920
 to maximize their utility. Yes. Up to a point. Let me tell you. Assume that if you are honest,

1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:30.720
 you make a hundred bucks. But if you are dishonest, no matter how dishonest you are,

1:34:30.720 --> 1:34:35.840
 you can only make a hundred bucks and one cent. What are you going to be? I'm saying,

1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:42.080
 you know what? Technically speaking, even that one cent, nobody bothers and say,

1:34:42.080 --> 1:34:46.640
 how much am I going to make by honest? A hundred. If I'm devious and if I'm a criminal,

1:34:46.640 --> 1:34:51.280
 100 bucks and one cent, you know, I might as well be honest. Okay. So that essentially is called,

1:34:51.280 --> 1:35:00.160
 you know, Epsilon utility equilibrium, but I think it's good. And that's what we design

1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:07.600
 essentially means that, you know, having no incentives is actually a good thing because

1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:13.280
 prevent people from reasoning, how else are you going to gain the system? But why can we achieve

1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:18.640
 an algorithm to have no incentives and in Bitcoin instead, you have to pay the miners because they

1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:26.080
 do a tremendous amount of work. Because if you have to do a lot of work, then you demand to be

1:35:26.080 --> 1:35:31.360
 paid accordingly. Because you, right? But if I'm going to say you have to add two and two equal

1:35:31.360 --> 1:35:35.600
 to four, how much you want me to pay for this? If you don't give me this, I don't add the two

1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:40.240
 and two. I would say you can add two and two in your sleep. You don't need to be paid to add the

1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:46.320
 two and two. So the idea is that if we make the system so efficient, so that generating the next

1:35:46.320 --> 1:35:52.640
 block is so damn simple, it doesn't hit the universe, let alone my computer, let alone

1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:59.360
 take some microsecond of computation, I might as well not being received incentives for doing that

1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:03.680
 and try to incentivize some other part of the system, but not to the main consensus,

1:36:03.680 --> 1:36:06.800
 which is a mechanism for generating and adding block to the chain.

1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:15.600
 Since you're Italian, Sicilian, I also heard rumors that you are a connoisseur of food.

1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:25.360
 If I said today's the last day you get to be alive, you shouldn't have trusted me.

1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:29.760
 You never know with a Russian whether you're going to make it out or not. Well, if you had

1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:36.240
 one last meal, you can travel somewhere in the world. Either you make it or somebody else makes

1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:44.320
 it. What's that going to look like? All right. If it's one last meal, I must say in this era of

1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:56.000
 COVID, I have not been able to see my mom. My mom was a fantastic chef and had this very

1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:00.880
 traditional food. As you know, the very traditional food are great for a reason,

1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:08.160
 because they survived hundreds of years of culinary innovation. There is one very laborious

1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:16.160
 thing, which is, you heard the name, which is parmigiana, but to do it is a piece of

1:37:16.160 --> 1:37:22.160
 art. So many hours that only my mom could do it. If we have one last meal, I want a parmigiana.

1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:30.960
 Okay. What's the laborious process? Is it the ingredients? Is it the actual process?

1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:34.640
 Is it the atmosphere and the humans involved?

1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:45.200
 The latter. The ingredient like in any other, in the Italian cuisine, believes in very few

1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:55.520
 ingredients. If you take say quintessential Italian recipe, spaghetti pesto. Pesto is olive oil,

1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:06.880
 very good extra virgin olive oil, basil, pine nuts, pepper, clove of garlic, not too much,

1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:15.360
 otherwise you overpower everything. And then to do either two schools of thought, parmesan or pecorino

1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:22.320
 or a mix of the two. I mentioned six ingredients. That is typical Italian. I understand that there

1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:26.960
 are other cuisines, for instance, a French cuisine, which is extremely sophisticated

1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:33.360
 and extremely combinatorial, or some Chinese cuisine, which has a lot of many more ingredients

1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:40.000
 than this. And yet the art is to put them together a lot of things. In Italy is really the striving

1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:45.840
 for simplicity, yet to find few ingredients, but the right ingredients to create something.

1:38:45.840 --> 1:38:54.000
 So in parmigiana, the ingredients are eggplants, tomatoes, basil, but how to put them together

1:38:54.000 --> 1:39:04.560
 and the process is an act of love, labor and love. You can spend the entire day,

1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:09.040
 I'm not exaggerating, but the entire morning for sure to do it properly.

1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:14.800
 Yeah, as a Japanese cuisine too, there's a mastery to the simplicity with the sushi. I don't know

1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:19.280
 if you've seen Giorgio's of sushi, but there's a mastery to that that's propagated through the

1:39:19.280 --> 1:39:25.360
 generations. It's fascinating. You know, people love it when I ask about books. I don't know

1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:32.960
 if books, whether fiction, nonfiction, technical or completely non technical had an impact on your

1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:37.360
 life throughout. If there's anything you would recommend or even just mention as something that

1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:45.280
 gave you an insight or moved you in some way. So, okay. So I don't know if I can comment because

1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:50.480
 in some sense you almost had to be Italian or to be such a scholar, but being Italian,

1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:59.520
 one thing that really impressed me tremendously is the Divine Comedy. It is a medieval poem,

1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:07.280
 a very long poem divided in three parts, hell, purgatory and paradise. Okay. And that is the

1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:19.200
 non trivial story of a middle man gets into a crisis, personal crisis. And then out of this

1:40:19.200 --> 1:40:27.600
 crisis he purifies, makes a catastrophe, purifies himself more and more and more until he's become

1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:35.280
 capable of actually meeting God. Okay. And that is actually a complex story. So you have to get

1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:43.760
 some very sophisticated language, maybe Latin at that point. We are talking about 1200s Italy,

1:40:45.920 --> 1:40:52.800
 in Florence. And this guy instead, he chose his own dialect, not spoken outside his own immediate

1:40:52.800 --> 1:41:01.920
 circle, a Florentine dialect. Actually, Dante really made Italian, Italian. How can you express

1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:10.240
 such a sophisticated thing? And then the point is that these words that nobody actually knew

1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:16.080
 because they were essentially dialect and plus a bunch of very intricate rhymes in which they had

1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:23.440
 to rhyme with things. And it turns out that by getting meaning from the things that rhyme,

1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:29.680
 you essentially guess what the word means and you invent Italian and you communicate

1:41:29.680 --> 1:41:35.200
 it by almost osmosis what you want. It's a miracle of communication. In a dialect,

1:41:35.200 --> 1:41:40.320
 a very poor language, very unsophisticated to express very sophisticated situation.

1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:50.480
 I love it. People love it, Italians and not Italian. But what I got of it is that very often

1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:58.000
 limitations are our strength. Because if you limit yourself at a very poor language,

1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:04.080
 somehow you get out of it and you achieve even better form of communication using a hyper

1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:08.640
 sophisticated literary language with lots of resonance from the prior books so that you can

1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:13.280
 actually instantaneously quote. He couldn't quote anything because nothing was written in Italian

1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:21.840
 before him. So I really felt that limitations are our strength. And I think that rather than

1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:29.600
 complaining about the limitations, we should embrace them because if we embrace our limitation,

1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:36.000
 limited as we are, we find very creative solutions that people with less limitation we have,

1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:41.760
 we would not even think about it. So limitations are kind of superpower if you choose to see it

1:42:41.760 --> 1:42:49.440
 that way. Since you speak both languages, is there something that's lost in translation to you? Is

1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:55.120
 there something you can express in Italian that you can't in English and vice versa maybe? Is

1:42:55.120 --> 1:43:00.240
 there something you could say to the musicality of the language? I mean, I've been to Italy a few

1:43:00.240 --> 1:43:09.360
 times and I'm not sure if it's the actual words, but the people are certainly very, there's body

1:43:09.360 --> 1:43:16.720
 language too. There's just the whole being is language. So I don't know if you miss some of that

1:43:16.720 --> 1:43:25.360
 when you're speaking English in this country. Yes. In fact, actually, certainly I miss it.

1:43:25.360 --> 1:43:33.040
 And somehow it was a sacrifice that I made consciously by the time I arrived. I knew that

1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:40.720
 this, I was not going to express myself at that level. And it was actually a sacrifice because

1:43:40.720 --> 1:43:47.360
 given to you also your mother tongue is Russian. So you know that you can be very expressive in

1:43:47.360 --> 1:43:53.520
 your mother tongue and not very expressive in a new tongue, a new language. And then what people

1:43:53.520 --> 1:43:58.880
 think of you in the new language, because when the precise of expression of things, it generates,

1:43:59.840 --> 1:44:08.720
 it shows elegance or it shows knowledge or it shows as a census or it shows as a caste or

1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:12.160
 education, whatever it is. So all of a sudden I found myself on the bottom.

1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:22.720
 So I had to fight all my way up, back up. But what I'm saying, their limitations are actually

1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:30.000
 our strength. In fact, it's a trick to limit yourself to exceed. And there are examples in

1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:38.640
 history. If you think about Hernan Cortes, he goes to invade Mexico. He has what, a few hundred

1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:44.560
 people with him and he has a hundred thousand people in arms on the other side. First thing he

1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:53.520
 does, he limits himself. He sinks his own ship. There is no return. And at that point he actually

1:44:53.520 --> 1:45:01.040
 manages. That's really profound. I actually, first of all, this inspiring to me, I feel like I have

1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:07.200
 quite a few limitations, but more practically on the Russian side, I'm going to try to do a couple

1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:13.280
 of really big and really tough interviews in Russian. Once COVID lifts a little bit, I'm

1:45:13.280 --> 1:45:21.280
 traveling to Russia and I'll keep your advice in mind that the limitations is a kind of superpower.

1:45:21.280 --> 1:45:28.480
 We should use it to our advantage because you do feel less, like you're not able to convey

1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:34.720
 your wisdom in the Russian language. Cause I moved here when I was 13. So you don't,

1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:40.480
 the parts of life you live under a certain language are the parts of life you're able

1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:48.160
 to communicate. I became a thoughtful, deeply thoughtful human in English.

1:45:48.160 --> 1:45:56.400
 But the pain from World War II, the music of the people that was instilled with me in Russian.

1:45:56.400 --> 1:46:01.600
 So I can carry both of those and there's limitations in both. I can't say philosophically

1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:08.160
 profound stuff in Russian, but I can't in English express like that melancholy feeling

1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:11.840
 of like the people. And so combining those two, I'll somehow.

1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:18.880
 Oh, beautifully said. Thanks for sharing. This is great. Yes. I totally understand you. Yes.

1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:24.960
 You've accomplished some incredible things in the space of science, in the space of

1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:32.560
 technology, in the space of theory and engineering. Do you have advice for somebody young,

1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:37.840
 an undergraduate student, somebody in high school or anyone who just feels young

1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:43.120
 about life or about career, about making their way in this world?

1:46:43.920 --> 1:46:50.480
 So I was telling before that I believe in emotion and my thing is to be true to your

1:46:51.360 --> 1:46:58.480
 own emotion. And that I think that if you do that, you're doing well because it's a life well spent

1:46:59.200 --> 1:47:05.840
 and you are going never tire because you want to solve all these emotional knots that

1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:13.360
 always intrigued you from the beginning. And I really believe that to live meaningfully,

1:47:13.360 --> 1:47:20.320
 creatively, and yet to live your emotional life. So I really believe that whether you're a scientist

1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:25.360
 or an artist even more, but a scientist, I think of them as artists as well. If you are a human

1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:31.840
 being, so you are really to live fully your emotions and to the extent possible, sometimes

1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:39.520
 emotions can be overbearing and my advice is try to express them with more and more confident.

1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:45.200
 Sometimes it's hard, but you are going to be much more fulfilled than by suppressing them.

1:47:45.840 --> 1:47:49.120
 What about love? One of the big ones. What role does that play?

1:47:50.400 --> 1:47:58.720
 That's the bigger part of emotions. It's a scary thing. It's a lot of vulnerability that comes

1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:10.400
 with love, but there is also so much energy and power and love in all senses and in the traditional

1:48:10.400 --> 1:48:19.040
 sense, but also in the sense of a broader sense for humanity, this feeling, this compassion that

1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:28.560
 makes us one with other people and the suffering of other people. All of this is very scary stuff,

1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:37.280
 but it's really the fabric of life. Well, the sad thing is it really hurts to lose it.

1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:43.040
 Yes, that's why the vulnerability comes with it. That's the thing about emotion is

1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:51.440
 the up and the down and the down seems to come always with up, but the up only comes with the

1:48:51.440 --> 1:49:01.680
 down. Let me ask you about the ultimate down, which is unfortunately we humans are mortal

1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:10.240
 or appear to be for the most part. Do you think about your own mortality? Do you fear death?

1:49:11.200 --> 1:49:19.840
 I hope so. Without death, there is no life. At least there is no meaningful life. Death is

1:49:19.840 --> 1:49:26.480
 actually in some sense our ultimate motivator to live a beautiful and meaningful life. I myself

1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:33.760
 felt as a young man that unless I got something that I wanted to do, I don't know why I got this

1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:39.760
 idea of something to say. If I'm not able to say, I would suicide. Maybe it was a way to motivate

1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:44.720
 myself, but you don't need to motivate it because in some sense, unfortunately, death is there.

1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:55.280
 So you better get up and do your thing because that is the best motivation to live fully.

1:49:56.160 --> 1:49:59.040
 Well, what do you hope your legacy is?

1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:06.720
 You mentioned you have two kids.

1:50:06.720 --> 1:50:20.560
 Yes. I really feel that on one side is my biological legacy and that is my two kids

1:50:21.840 --> 1:50:31.840
 and their kids, hopefully. That is one side. The other thing is this common enterprise,

1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:41.440
 which is society. I really feel that my legacy would be better by providing security and privacy.

1:50:42.400 --> 1:50:48.720
 Actually, for me, it's metaphorical to say I want to give you the ability to interact more and take

1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:55.280
 more risks and reach out more for more people as difficult and dangerous as it may seem.

1:50:55.280 --> 1:51:02.400
 But my whole scientific work is about to guarantee privacy and give you the security

1:51:02.400 --> 1:51:08.400
 of interaction. Not only in a transaction, like it would be a blockchain transaction, but

1:51:09.040 --> 1:51:17.280
 that is really one of the hardcore of my emotional problems. I think that these are

1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:22.800
 the problems I want to tackle. Ultimately, privacy and security is freedom.

1:51:22.800 --> 1:51:28.800
 Freedom is at the core of this. It's dangerous. It's like the emotion thing,

1:51:30.400 --> 1:51:34.080
 but ultimately, that's how we create all the beautiful things around us. Do you think there's

1:51:34.080 --> 1:51:42.000
 meaning to it all, this life, except the urgency that death provides and us anxious

1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:48.800
 beings create cool stuff along the way? Is there a deeper meaning? If it is, what is it?

1:51:48.800 --> 1:51:53.200
 Well, meaning of life. Actually, there are three meanings of life.

1:51:53.760 --> 1:51:54.320
 Great.

1:51:54.320 --> 1:52:00.480
 That's great. One, to seek. Two, to seek. And three, to seek.

1:52:01.040 --> 1:52:04.640
 To seek what? Or is there no answer to that?

1:52:04.640 --> 1:52:10.880
 There's no answer to that. I really think that the journey is more important than the destination,

1:52:10.880 --> 1:52:19.840
 whatever that be. I think that is a journey and is, in my opinion, at the end of the day,

1:52:19.840 --> 1:52:29.120
 I must admit, meaningful in itself. We must admit that maybe whatever your destination might be,

1:52:30.240 --> 1:52:37.920
 at the end, we may never get there, but hell was a great ride towards it.

1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:43.680
 Well, I don't think there's a better way to end this, Silvio. Thank you for wasting your extremely

1:52:43.680 --> 1:52:50.240
 valuable time with me today, joining on this journey of seeking something together. We found

1:52:50.240 --> 1:52:54.800
 nothing, but it was very fun. I really enjoyed it. Thank you so much for talking to us.

1:52:54.800 --> 1:52:59.120
