00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
 The following is a conversation with Stephen Schwarzman,

00:03.120 --> 00:05.760
 CEO and cofounder of Blackstone,

00:05.760 --> 00:08.240
 one of the world's leading investment firms

00:08.240 --> 00:12.920
 with over $530 billion of assets under management.

00:12.920 --> 00:17.880
 He's one of the most successful business leaders in history.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.920
 I recommend his recent book called What It Takes

00:20.920 --> 00:24.440
 that tells stories and lessons from his personal journey.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.320
 Stephen is a philanthropist

00:26.320 --> 00:28.680
 and one of the wealthiest people in the world,

00:28.680 --> 00:31.200
 recently signing the Giving Pledge,

00:31.200 --> 00:33.840
 thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth

00:33.840 --> 00:36.080
 to philanthropic causes.

00:36.080 --> 00:41.080
 As an example, in 2018, he donated $350 million to MIT

00:41.920 --> 00:45.160
 to help establish his new College of Computing,

00:45.160 --> 00:48.160
 the mission of which promotes interdisciplinary, big,

00:48.160 --> 00:51.880
 bold research in artificial intelligence.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.280
 For those of you who know me,

00:53.280 --> 00:55.840
 know that MIT is near and dear to my heart

00:55.840 --> 00:57.400
 and always will be.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.400
 It was and is a place where I believe big, bold,

01:01.400 --> 01:03.520
 revolutionary ideas have a home,

01:03.520 --> 01:05.040
 and that is what is needed

01:05.040 --> 01:08.320
 in artificial intelligence research in the coming decades.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.120
 Yes, there's institutional challenges,

01:11.120 --> 01:13.200
 but also there's power

01:13.200 --> 01:15.600
 in the passion of individual researchers,

01:15.600 --> 01:17.600
 from undergrad to PhD,

01:17.600 --> 01:20.480
 from young scientists to senior faculty.

01:20.480 --> 01:23.560
 I believe the dream to build intelligence systems

01:23.560 --> 01:26.400
 burns brighter than ever in the halls of MIT.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.600
 This conversation was recorded recently,

01:28.600 --> 01:31.040
 but before the outbreak of the pandemic.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.200
 For everyone feeling the burden of this crisis,

01:33.200 --> 01:35.080
 I'm sending love your way.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.360
 Stay strong, we're in this together.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.120
 As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now,

01:55.120 --> 01:56.800
 and never any ads in the middle

01:56.800 --> 01:58.960
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.280
 I hope that works for you,

02:00.280 --> 02:02.200
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.720
 Quick summary of the ads.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.880
 Chris Hadfield explaining how rockets work,

02:58.880 --> 03:01.600
 and the experience of being launched into space alone

03:01.600 --> 03:03.320
 is worth the money.

 I've been using ExpressVPN for many years.

03:25.740 --> 03:26.680
 I love it.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.520
 It's easy to use, press the big power on button,

03:29.520 --> 03:31.280
 and your privacy is protected.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.600
 And, if you like, you can make it look

03:33.600 --> 03:36.360
 like your location is anywhere else in the world.

03:36.360 --> 03:39.400
 I might be in Boston now, but it can make you look like

03:39.400 --> 03:42.280
 I'm in New York, London, Paris,

03:42.280 --> 03:44.360
 or anywhere else in the world.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.840
 This has a large number of obvious benefits.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.760
 Certainly, it allows you to access international versions

03:49.760 --> 03:52.520
 of streaming websites like the Japanese Netflix

03:52.520 --> 03:54.440
 or the UK Hulu.

03:54.440 --> 03:57.400
 ExpressVPN works on any device you can imagine.

03:57.400 --> 04:01.120
 I use it on Linux, shout out to Ubuntu 2004,

04:01.120 --> 04:05.520
 Windows, Android, but it's available everywhere else too.

04:13.140 --> 04:16.660
 And now, here's my conversation with Stephen Schwarzman.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.720
 Let's start with a tough question.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.840
 What idea do you believe,

04:21.840 --> 04:24.880
 whether grounded in data or in intuition,

04:24.880 --> 04:27.540
 that many people you respect disagree with you on?

04:28.640 --> 04:32.140
 Well, there isn't all that much anymore

04:32.140 --> 04:34.800
 since the world's so transparent.

04:34.800 --> 04:39.800
 But one of the things I believe in and put it in the book,

04:39.800 --> 04:43.920
 the book, what it takes is if you're gonna do something,

04:43.920 --> 04:46.200
 do something very consequential.

04:46.200 --> 04:51.040
 Do something that's quite large, if you can, that's unique.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.240
 Because if you operate in that kind of space,

04:54.240 --> 04:57.760
 when you're successful, it's a huge impact.

04:57.760 --> 05:02.440
 The prospect of success enables you to recruit people

05:02.440 --> 05:04.320
 who wanna be part of that.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.840
 And those type of large opportunities

05:06.840 --> 05:09.480
 are pretty easily described.

05:09.480 --> 05:14.480
 And so, not everybody likes to operate at scale.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.160
 Some people like to do small things

05:16.160 --> 05:21.160
 because it is meaningful for them emotionally.

05:21.320 --> 05:25.400
 And so, occasionally, you get a disagreement on that.

05:25.400 --> 05:30.000
 But those are life choices rather than commercial choices.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
 That's interesting.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.880
 What good and bad comes with going big?

05:34.880 --> 05:39.880
 We often, in America, think big is good.

05:41.320 --> 05:44.040
 What's the benefit, what's the cost

05:44.040 --> 05:45.920
 in terms of just bigger than business,

05:45.920 --> 05:49.160
 but life, happiness, the pursuit of happiness?

05:49.160 --> 05:51.840
 Well, you do things that make you happy.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.640
 It's not mandated.

05:53.640 --> 05:56.040
 And everybody's different.

05:56.040 --> 06:00.720
 And some people, if they have talent,

06:00.720 --> 06:02.480
 like playing pro football,

06:02.480 --> 06:06.200
 other people just like throwing the ball around,

06:07.240 --> 06:09.040
 not even being on a team.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.760
 What's better?

06:10.760 --> 06:12.360
 Depends what your objectives are.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.080
 Depends what your talent is.

06:15.440 --> 06:19.720
 Depends what gives you joy.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.520
 So, in terms of going big,

06:21.520 --> 06:24.200
 is it both for impact on the world

06:24.200 --> 06:27.640
 and because you personally gives you joy?

06:27.640 --> 06:31.960
 Well, it makes it easier to succeed, actually.

06:31.960 --> 06:35.040
 Because if you catch something, for example,

06:35.040 --> 06:39.600
 that's cyclical, that's a huge opportunity,

06:39.600 --> 06:42.680
 then you usually can find some place

06:42.680 --> 06:46.960
 within that huge opportunity where you can make it work.

06:46.960 --> 06:51.440
 If you're prosecuting a really small thing

06:51.440 --> 06:56.200
 and you're wrong, you don't have many places to go.

06:56.200 --> 07:00.320
 So, I've always found that the easy place to be

07:00.320 --> 07:05.320
 and the ability where you can concentrate human resources,

07:07.720 --> 07:12.720
 get people excited about doing really impactful big things,

07:13.240 --> 07:16.520
 and you can afford to pay them, actually.

07:16.520 --> 07:20.720
 Because the bigger thing can generate much more

07:20.720 --> 07:24.880
 in the way of financial resources.

07:24.880 --> 07:28.480
 So, that brings people out of talent to help you.

07:28.480 --> 07:33.480
 And so, all together, it's a virtuous circle, I think.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.240
 How do you know an opportunity when you see one

07:37.240 --> 07:40.200
 in terms of the one you wanna go big on?

07:40.200 --> 07:42.680
 Is it intuition, is it facts?

07:43.640 --> 07:48.640
 Is it back and forth deliberation with people you trust?

07:48.800 --> 07:50.640
 What's the process?

07:50.640 --> 07:52.640
 Is it art, is it science?

07:52.640 --> 07:54.200
 Well, it's pattern recognition.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.720
 And how do you get to pattern recognition?

07:57.720 --> 08:00.200
 First, you need to understand the patterns

08:00.200 --> 08:02.920
 and the changes that are happening.

08:02.920 --> 08:07.920
 And that's either, it's observational on some level.

08:08.760 --> 08:13.760
 You can call it data or you can just call it listening

08:14.680 --> 08:18.040
 to unusual things that people are saying

08:18.040 --> 08:19.960
 that they haven't said before.

08:19.960 --> 08:24.320
 And I've always tried to describe this.

08:24.320 --> 08:29.320
 It's like seeing a piece of white lint on a black dress.

08:29.440 --> 08:33.280
 But most people disregard that piece of lint.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.920
 They just see the dress.

08:34.920 --> 08:37.080
 I always see the lint.

08:37.080 --> 08:41.720
 And I'm fascinated by how did something get someplace

08:41.720 --> 08:43.480
 it's not supposed to be?

08:43.480 --> 08:47.120
 So, it doesn't even need to be a big discrepancy.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.880
 But if something shouldn't be someplace

08:49.880 --> 08:54.880
 in a constellation of facts that sort of made sense

08:56.360 --> 09:01.360
 in a traditional way, I've learned that if you focus

09:01.360 --> 09:05.920
 on why one discordant note is there,

09:05.920 --> 09:09.480
 that's usually a key to something important.

09:09.480 --> 09:14.480
 And if you can find two of those discordant notes,

09:14.720 --> 09:17.680
 that's usually a straight line to someplace.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.480
 And that someplace is not where you've been.

09:20.480 --> 09:24.360
 And usually when you figure out that things are changing

09:24.360 --> 09:27.360
 or have changed and you describe them,

09:27.360 --> 09:29.160
 which you have to be able to do

09:29.160 --> 09:33.240
 because it's not some odd intuition.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.680
 It's just focusing on facts.

09:35.680 --> 09:39.000
 It's almost like a scientific discovery, if you will.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.280
 When you describe it to other people in the real world,

09:42.280 --> 09:46.840
 they tend to do absolutely nothing about it.

09:46.840 --> 09:51.160
 And that's because humans are comfortable

09:51.160 --> 09:53.120
 in their own reality.

09:53.120 --> 09:57.400
 And if there's no particular reason at that moment

09:57.400 --> 10:00.080
 to shake them out of their reality,

10:00.080 --> 10:03.600
 they'll stay in it even if they're ultimately

10:03.600 --> 10:05.320
 completely wrong.

10:05.320 --> 10:09.120
 And I've always been stunned that when I explain

10:09.120 --> 10:13.000
 where we're going, what we're doing and why,

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
 almost everyone just says, that's interesting.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.640
 And they continue doing what they're doing.

10:20.640 --> 10:24.920
 And so I think it's pretty easy to do that.

10:26.440 --> 10:29.000
 But what you need is a huge data set.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.280
 So before AI and people's focus on data,

10:33.280 --> 10:36.160
 I've sort of been doing this mostly my whole life.

10:36.160 --> 10:40.400
 I'm not a scientist, I'm not let alone a computer scientist.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.320
 And you can just hear what people are saying

10:43.320 --> 10:46.280
 when somebody says something or you observe something

10:46.280 --> 10:48.480
 that simply doesn't make sense.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.520
 That's when you really go to work.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.920
 The rest of it's just processing.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.320
 You know, on a quick tangent,

10:55.320 --> 10:57.400
 pattern recognition is a term often used

10:57.400 --> 10:58.960
 throughout the history of AI.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.480
 That's the goal of artificial intelligence

11:01.480 --> 11:03.400
 is pattern recognition, right?

11:03.400 --> 11:08.400
 But there's, I would say, various flavors of that.

11:08.400 --> 11:12.600
 So usually pattern recognition refers to the process

11:12.600 --> 11:17.200
 of the, we said dress and the lint on the dress.

11:17.200 --> 11:21.120
 Pattern recognition is very good at identifying the dress

11:21.120 --> 11:24.880
 as looking at the pattern that's always there,

11:24.880 --> 11:27.000
 that's very common and so on.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.920
 You almost refer to a pattern that's like

11:28.920 --> 11:33.840
 in what's called outlier detection in computer science,

11:33.840 --> 11:38.200
 right, the rare thing, the small thing.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.800
 Now, AI is not often good at that.

11:41.800 --> 11:46.240
 Do you, just almost philosophically,

11:46.240 --> 11:48.880
 the kind of decisions you made in your life

11:48.880 --> 11:52.040
 based scientifically almost on data,

11:52.040 --> 11:55.000
 do you think AI in the future will be able to do?

11:55.000 --> 11:59.400
 Is it something that could be put down into code

11:59.400 --> 12:01.440
 or is it still deeply human?

12:01.440 --> 12:07.440
 It's tough for me to say since I don't have domain knowledge

12:09.040 --> 12:14.040
 in AI to know everything that could or might occur.

12:14.960 --> 12:19.720
 I know, sort of in my own case,

12:19.720 --> 12:22.840
 that most people don't see any of that.

12:22.840 --> 12:27.840
 I just assumed it was motivational, you know,

12:27.840 --> 12:32.920
 but it's also sort of, it's hardwiring.

12:32.920 --> 12:38.560
 What are you wired or programmed to be finding or looking for?

12:38.560 --> 12:41.960
 It's not what happens every day.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.640
 That's not interesting, frankly.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.080
 I mean, that's what people mostly do.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.960
 I do a bunch of that too because, you know,

12:49.960 --> 12:52.520
 that's what you do in normal life.

12:52.520 --> 12:57.080
 But I've always been completely fascinated

12:57.080 --> 13:00.200
 by the stuff that doesn't fit.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.800
 Or the other way of thinking about it,

13:02.800 --> 13:07.400
 it's determining what people want

13:07.400 --> 13:10.040
 without them saying it.

13:11.520 --> 13:14.520
 That's a different kind of pattern.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.160
 You can see everything they're doing.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.360
 There's a missing piece.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.360
 They don't know it's missing.

13:20.360 --> 13:23.400
 You think it's missing given the other facts.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.080
 You know about them and you deliver that

13:27.080 --> 13:28.840
 and then that becomes, you know,

13:28.840 --> 13:33.320
 sort of very easy to sell to them.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.280
 To linger on this point a little bit,

13:35.280 --> 13:37.760
 you've mentioned that in your family,

13:37.760 --> 13:38.680
 when you were growing up,

13:38.680 --> 13:41.680
 nobody raised their voice in anger or otherwise.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.240
 And you said that this allows you to learn to listen

13:44.240 --> 13:46.040
 and hear some interesting things.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.560
 Can you elaborate as you have been on that idea,

13:50.560 --> 13:54.240
 what do you hear about the world if you listen?

13:54.240 --> 13:57.400
 Well, you have to listen really intensely

13:57.400 --> 14:01.120
 to understand what people are saying

14:01.120 --> 14:03.560
 as well as what people are intending

14:03.560 --> 14:06.720
 because it's not necessarily the same thing.

14:07.800 --> 14:12.800
 And people mostly give themselves away

14:14.120 --> 14:16.600
 no matter how clever they think they are.

14:16.600 --> 14:21.600
 Particularly if you have the full array of inputs.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.600
 In other words, if you look at their face,

14:24.600 --> 14:28.200
 you look at their eyes, which are the window on the soul,

14:28.200 --> 14:33.200
 it's very difficult to conceal what you're thinking.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.560
 You look at facial expressions and posture.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.480
 You listen to their voice, which changes.

14:41.120 --> 14:44.880
 You know, when you're talking about something

14:44.880 --> 14:46.800
 you're comfortable with or not,

14:46.800 --> 14:48.720
 are you speaking faster?

14:48.720 --> 14:51.880
 Is the amplitude of what you're saying higher?

14:51.880 --> 14:56.200
 Most people just give away what's really on their mind.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.600
 You know, they're not that clever.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.600
 They're busy spending their time thinking about

15:00.600 --> 15:03.520
 what they're in the process of saying.

15:03.520 --> 15:07.960
 And so if you just observe that, not in a hostile way,

15:07.960 --> 15:10.360
 but just in an evocative way

15:10.360 --> 15:12.960
 and just let them talk for a while,

15:12.960 --> 15:16.080
 they'll more or less tell you almost completely

15:16.080 --> 15:17.800
 what they're thinking,

15:17.800 --> 15:21.680
 even the stuff they don't want you to know.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.720
 And once you know that, of course,

15:24.720 --> 15:29.200
 it's sort of easy to play that kind of game

15:29.200 --> 15:31.160
 because they've already told you

15:31.160 --> 15:32.480
 everything you need to know.

15:32.480 --> 15:37.080
 And so it's easy to get to a conclusion

15:37.080 --> 15:40.520
 if there's meant to be one, an area of common interest,

15:40.520 --> 15:44.800
 since you know almost exactly what's on their mind.

15:44.800 --> 15:48.040
 And so that's an enormous advantage

15:48.040 --> 15:51.840
 as opposed to just walking in someplace

15:51.840 --> 15:54.000
 and somebody telling you something

15:54.000 --> 15:56.400
 and you believing what they're saying.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.880
 There are so many different levels of communication.

16:01.120 --> 16:05.080
 So a powerful approach to life you discuss in the book

16:05.080 --> 16:08.000
 on the topic of listening and really hearing people

16:08.000 --> 16:10.240
 is figuring out what the biggest problem,

16:10.240 --> 16:12.960
 bothering a particular individual or group is

16:12.960 --> 16:15.560
 and coming up with a solution to that problem

16:15.560 --> 16:18.720
 and presenting them with a solution, right?

16:20.080 --> 16:24.280
 In fact, you brilliantly describe a lot of simple things

16:24.280 --> 16:26.520
 that most people just don't do.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.040
 It's kind of obvious,

16:28.040 --> 16:31.240
 find the problem that's bothering somebody deeply.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.560
 And as you said, I think you've implied

16:33.560 --> 16:36.320
 that they will usually tell you what the problem is,

16:36.320 --> 16:39.320
 but can you talk about this process

16:39.320 --> 16:43.120
 of seeing what the biggest problem for a person is,

16:43.120 --> 16:44.360
 trying to solve it,

16:44.360 --> 16:47.760
 and maybe a particularly memorable example?

16:47.760 --> 16:52.060
 Sure, if you know you're gonna meet somebody,

16:52.060 --> 16:55.840
 there are two types of situations, chance meetings,

16:55.840 --> 16:59.320
 and the second is you know you're gonna meet somebody.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.320
 So let's take the easiest one,

17:01.320 --> 17:04.160
 which is you know you're gonna meet somebody.

17:04.160 --> 17:09.160
 And you start trying to make pretend you're them.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.200
 It's really easy.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.740
 What's on their mind?

17:13.880 --> 17:16.280
 What are they thinking about in their daily life?

17:16.280 --> 17:19.040
 What are the big problems they're facing?

17:19.040 --> 17:24.040
 So if they're, you know, to make it a really easy example,

17:24.540 --> 17:26.280
 you know, make pretend, you know,

17:26.280 --> 17:28.760
 they're like president of the United States.

17:28.760 --> 17:31.720
 Doesn't have to be this president, could be any president.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.440
 So you sort of know what's more or less on their mind

17:34.440 --> 17:37.260
 because the press keeps reporting it.

17:37.260 --> 17:40.960
 And you see it on television, you hear it.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.440
 People discuss it.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.160
 So you know if you're gonna be running into somebody

17:45.160 --> 17:47.400
 in that kind of position.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.760
 You sort of know what they look like already.

17:50.760 --> 17:52.120
 You know what they sound like.

17:52.120 --> 17:56.000
 You know what their voice is like.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.360
 And you know what they're focused on.

17:58.360 --> 18:01.440
 And so if you're gonna meet somebody like that,

18:01.440 --> 18:05.360
 what you should do is take the biggest unresolved issue

18:05.360 --> 18:09.120
 that they're facing and come up with

18:09.120 --> 18:11.680
 a few interesting solutions

18:11.680 --> 18:15.080
 that basically haven't been out there.

18:16.040 --> 18:19.140
 Or that you haven't heard anybody else

18:19.140 --> 18:20.000
 always thinking about.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.680
 So just to give you an example,

18:21.680 --> 18:24.360
 I was sort of in the early 1990s

18:24.360 --> 18:26.420
 and I was invited to something at the White House

18:26.420 --> 18:29.400
 which was a big deal for me because I was like,

18:29.400 --> 18:30.940
 you know, a person from no place.

18:30.940 --> 18:35.320
 And you know, I had met the president once before

18:35.320 --> 18:37.200
 because it was President Bush

18:37.200 --> 18:40.360
 because his son was in my dormitory.

18:40.360 --> 18:43.000
 So I had met him at Parents Day.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.360
 I mean it's just like the oddity of things.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.760
 So I knew I was gonna see him

18:47.760 --> 18:50.400
 because that's where the invitation came from.

18:51.560 --> 18:54.040
 And so there was something going on

18:54.040 --> 18:57.320
 and I just thought about two or three ways

18:57.320 --> 19:00.960
 to approach that issue.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.400
 And you know, at that point I was separated

19:04.400 --> 19:08.720
 and so I had brought a date to the White House

19:08.720 --> 19:12.440
 and so I saw the president

19:12.440 --> 19:16.040
 and we sort of went over in a corner for about 10 minutes

19:16.040 --> 19:18.480
 and discussed whatever this issue was.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.000
 And I later went back to my date.

19:22.000 --> 19:22.840
 It was a little rude

19:22.840 --> 19:25.800
 but it was meant to be confidential conversation

19:25.800 --> 19:27.720
 and I barely knew her.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.560
 And you know, she said,

19:29.560 --> 19:31.520
 what were you talking about all that time?

19:31.520 --> 19:33.440
 I said, well, you know,

19:33.440 --> 19:35.160
 there's something going on in the world

19:35.160 --> 19:37.960
 and I've thought about different ways

19:37.960 --> 19:40.800
 of perhaps approaching that and he was interested.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.080
 And the answer is of course he was interested.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.380
 Why wouldn't he be interested?

19:45.380 --> 19:47.840
 There didn't seem to be an easy outcome.

19:47.840 --> 19:51.360
 And so, you know, conversations of that type,

19:51.360 --> 19:53.800
 once somebody knows you're really thinking

19:53.800 --> 19:58.600
 about what's good for them and good for the situation,

19:58.600 --> 20:01.880
 it has nothing to do with me.

20:01.880 --> 20:05.480
 I mean, it's really about being in service,

20:05.480 --> 20:08.640
 you know, to the situation.

20:08.640 --> 20:12.080
 Then people trust you and they'll tell you other things

20:12.080 --> 20:17.080
 because they know your motives are basically very pure.

20:17.360 --> 20:20.560
 You're just trying to resolve a difficult situation

20:20.560 --> 20:21.920
 or help somebody do it.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.960
 So these types of things, you know,

20:24.960 --> 20:27.600
 that's a planned situation, that's easy.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.720
 Sometimes you just come upon somebody

20:29.720 --> 20:31.980
 and they start talking and you know,

20:31.980 --> 20:34.940
 that requires, you know, like different skills.

20:34.940 --> 20:38.020
 You know, you can ask them,

20:38.020 --> 20:39.440
 what have you been working on lately?

20:39.440 --> 20:41.480
 What are you thinking about?

20:41.480 --> 20:43.320
 You can ask them, you know,

20:43.320 --> 20:45.720
 has anything been particularly difficult?

20:45.720 --> 20:48.960
 And you know, you can ask most people

20:48.960 --> 20:53.960
 if they trust you for some reason, they'll tell you.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.000
 And then you have to instantly go to work on it.

20:58.860 --> 21:02.120
 And you know, that's not as good

21:02.120 --> 21:03.640
 as having some advanced planning,

21:03.640 --> 21:08.640
 but you know, almost everything going on is like out there.

21:10.880 --> 21:15.340
 And people who are involved with interesting situations,

21:15.340 --> 21:20.340
 they're playing in the same ecosystem.

21:20.980 --> 21:25.540
 They just have different roles in the ecosystem.

21:25.540 --> 21:29.080
 And you know, you could do that

21:29.080 --> 21:31.140
 with somebody who owns a pro football team

21:32.100 --> 21:34.240
 that loses all the time.

21:34.240 --> 21:37.300
 We specialize in those in New York.

21:37.300 --> 21:41.460
 And you know, you already have analyzed

21:41.460 --> 21:43.280
 why they're losing, right?

21:43.280 --> 21:48.240
 Inevitably, it's because they don't have a great quarterback,

21:48.240 --> 21:50.340
 they don't have a great coach,

21:50.340 --> 21:52.420
 and they don't have a great general manager

21:52.420 --> 21:55.180
 who knows how to hire the best talent.

21:55.180 --> 21:59.200
 Those are the three reasons why a team fails, right?

21:59.200 --> 22:01.160
 Because there are salary caps,

22:01.160 --> 22:03.380
 so every team pays a certain amount of money

22:03.380 --> 22:04.840
 for all their players.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.000
 So it's gotta be those three positions.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.500
 So if you're talking with somebody like that,

22:09.500 --> 22:13.460
 inevitably, even though it's not structured,

22:13.460 --> 22:16.780
 you'll know how their team's doing

22:16.780 --> 22:19.240
 and you'll know pretty much why.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.420
 And if you start asking questions about that,

22:22.420 --> 22:24.940
 they're typically very happy to talk about it

22:24.940 --> 22:27.020
 because they haven't solved that problem.

22:27.020 --> 22:29.620
 In some cases, they don't even know that's the problem.

22:29.620 --> 22:31.300
 It's pretty easy to see it.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.620
 So, you know, I do stuff like that,

22:33.620 --> 22:38.620
 which I find is intuitive as a process,

22:38.620 --> 22:43.540
 but, you know, leads to really good results.

22:43.540 --> 22:46.680
 Well, the funny thing is when you're smart,

22:48.220 --> 22:51.400
 for smart people, it's hard to escape their own ego

22:51.400 --> 22:53.520
 and the space of their own problems,

22:53.520 --> 22:55.680
 which is what's required

22:55.680 --> 22:58.220
 to think about other people's problems.

22:58.220 --> 23:01.040
 It requires for you to let go of the fact

23:01.040 --> 23:03.780
 that your own problems are all important

23:03.780 --> 23:05.700
 and then to talk about your,

23:05.700 --> 23:09.240
 I think while it seems obvious

23:09.240 --> 23:11.860
 and I think quite brilliant,

23:11.860 --> 23:14.580
 it's just a difficult leap for many people,

23:14.580 --> 23:16.340
 especially smart people,

23:16.340 --> 23:19.380
 to empathize with, truly empathize with the problems

23:19.380 --> 23:20.220
 of others.

23:21.140 --> 23:23.380
 Well, I have a competitive advantage,

23:23.380 --> 23:27.660
 which is, I don't think I'm so smart.

23:29.220 --> 23:31.820
 So, you know, it's not a problem for me.

23:31.820 --> 23:33.460
 Well, the truly smartest people I know

23:33.460 --> 23:34.820
 say that exact same thing.

23:34.820 --> 23:39.580
 Yeah, being humble is really useful,

23:39.580 --> 23:41.480
 competitive advantage, as you said.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.440
 How do you stay humble?

23:44.440 --> 23:46.960
 Well, I haven't changed much.

23:46.960 --> 23:47.800
 Since?

23:47.800 --> 23:51.100
 Since I was in my mid teens.

23:51.100 --> 23:54.800
 You know, I was raised partly in the city

23:54.800 --> 23:56.340
 and partly in the suburbs.

23:58.280 --> 24:03.280
 And, you know, whatever the values I had at that time,

24:03.280 --> 24:05.700
 those are still my values.

24:05.700 --> 24:08.300
 I call them like middle class values,

24:08.300 --> 24:10.300
 that's how I was raised.

24:10.300 --> 24:14.740
 And I've never changed, why would I?

24:14.740 --> 24:16.300
 That's who I am.

24:16.300 --> 24:21.140
 And so the accoutrement of, you know,

24:21.140 --> 24:25.580
 the rest of your life has gotta be put on the same,

24:25.580 --> 24:28.480
 you know, like solid foundation of who you are.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.220
 Because if you start losing who you really are,

24:31.220 --> 24:32.700
 who are you?

24:32.700 --> 24:37.180
 So I've never had the desire to be somebody else.

24:37.180 --> 24:40.740
 I just do other things now that I wouldn't do

24:40.740 --> 24:43.940
 as a, you know, sort of as a middle class kid

24:43.940 --> 24:45.340
 from Philadelphia.

24:45.340 --> 24:48.660
 I mean, my life has morphed on a certain level.

24:48.660 --> 24:52.580
 But part of the strength of having integrity

24:52.580 --> 24:57.580
 of personality is that you can remain in touch

24:57.580 --> 25:02.580
 with everybody who comes from that kind of background.

25:04.160 --> 25:07.320
 And, you know, even though I do some things

25:07.320 --> 25:09.000
 that aren't like that, you know,

25:09.000 --> 25:12.340
 in terms of people I meet or situations I'm in,

25:12.340 --> 25:15.040
 I always look at it through the same lens.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.800
 And that's very psychologically comfortable

25:18.760 --> 25:22.500
 and doesn't require me to make any real adjustments

25:22.500 --> 25:25.200
 in my life and I just keep plowing ahead.

25:25.200 --> 25:29.500
 There's a lot of activity in progress in recent years

25:29.500 --> 25:31.300
 around effective altruism.

25:32.620 --> 25:34.500
 I wanted to bring this topic with you

25:34.500 --> 25:37.100
 because it's an interesting one from your perspective.

25:38.220 --> 25:39.980
 You can put it in any kind of terms,

25:39.980 --> 25:44.300
 but it's philanthropy that focuses on maximizing impact.

25:44.300 --> 25:47.340
 How do you see the goal of philanthropy,

25:47.340 --> 25:50.020
 both from a personal motivation perspective

25:50.020 --> 25:53.580
 and the societal big picture impact perspective?

25:53.580 --> 25:55.940
 Yeah, I don't think about philanthropy

25:55.940 --> 25:58.980
 the way you would expect me to, okay?

25:58.980 --> 26:03.980
 I look at, you know, sort of solving big issues,

26:04.420 --> 26:09.420
 addressing big issues, starting new organizations to do it,

26:09.500 --> 26:12.060
 much like we do in our business.

26:12.060 --> 26:14.300
 You know, we keep growing our business

26:14.300 --> 26:17.620
 not by taking the original thing and making it larger,

26:17.620 --> 26:22.260
 but continually seeing new things and building those.

26:22.260 --> 26:26.380
 And, you know, sort of marshaling financial resources,

26:26.380 --> 26:30.420
 human resources, and in our case,

26:30.420 --> 26:32.120
 because we're in the investment business,

26:32.120 --> 26:33.980
 we find something new that looks like

26:33.980 --> 26:36.780
 it's gonna be terrific and we do that

26:36.780 --> 26:38.740
 and it works out really well.

26:38.740 --> 26:42.300
 All I do in what you would call philanthropy

26:42.300 --> 26:47.300
 is look at other opportunities to help society.

26:47.300 --> 26:50.380
 And I end up starting something new,

26:50.380 --> 26:53.100
 marshaling people, marshaling a lot of money,

26:53.100 --> 26:56.820
 and then at the end of that kind of creative process,

26:56.820 --> 26:59.740
 somebody typically asks me to write a check.

26:59.740 --> 27:01.940
 I don't wake up and say,

27:01.940 --> 27:05.460
 how can I give large amounts of money away?

27:05.460 --> 27:10.460
 I look at issues that are important for people.

27:10.620 --> 27:13.700
 In some cases, I do smaller things.

27:13.700 --> 27:18.700
 Because it's important to a person, and, you know,

27:18.700 --> 27:21.060
 I can relate to that person.

27:21.060 --> 27:24.540
 There's some unfairness that's happened to them.

27:24.540 --> 27:26.940
 And so in situations like that,

27:26.940 --> 27:29.820
 I'd give money anonymously and help them out.

27:29.820 --> 27:34.820
 And, you know, it's like a miniature version

27:35.460 --> 27:37.540
 of addressing something really big.

27:37.540 --> 27:41.700
 So, you know, at MIT, I'm a little bit

27:41.700 --> 27:46.660
 you know, at MIT, I've done a big thing,

27:46.660 --> 27:49.860
 you know, helping to start this new school of computing.

27:49.860 --> 27:51.940
 And I did that because, you know,

27:51.940 --> 27:56.940
 I saw that, you know, there's sort of like a global race on

27:57.220 --> 28:00.700
 in AI, quantum, and other major technologies.

28:00.700 --> 28:05.700
 And I thought that the US could use more enhancement

28:06.860 --> 28:09.700
 from a competitive perspective.

28:09.700 --> 28:12.340
 And I also, because I get to China a lot

28:12.340 --> 28:16.060
 and I travel around a lot compared to a regular person,

28:17.140 --> 28:21.020
 you know, I can see the need to have control

28:21.020 --> 28:23.140
 of these types of technologies.

28:23.140 --> 28:26.340
 So when they're introduced, we don't create a mess

28:26.340 --> 28:30.740
 like we did with the internet and with social media.

28:30.740 --> 28:33.420
 Unintended consequence, you know,

28:33.420 --> 28:36.540
 that's creating all kinds of issues and freedom of speech

28:36.540 --> 28:39.380
 and the functioning of liberal democracies.

28:39.380 --> 28:41.580
 So with AI, it was pretty clear

28:41.580 --> 28:44.980
 that there was enormous difference of views

28:44.980 --> 28:48.740
 around the world by the relatively few practitioners

28:48.740 --> 28:51.500
 in the world who really knew what was going on.

28:51.500 --> 28:55.900
 And by accident, I knew a bunch of these people,

28:55.900 --> 28:59.940
 you know, who were like big famous people.

28:59.940 --> 29:01.980
 And I could talk to them and say,

29:01.980 --> 29:04.260
 why do you think this is a force for bad?

29:05.140 --> 29:08.700
 And someone else, why do you feel this is a force for good?

29:08.700 --> 29:13.500
 And how do we move forward with the technology

29:13.500 --> 29:18.500
 by the same time, make sure that whatever is potentially,

29:19.460 --> 29:22.380
 you know, sort of on the bad side of this technology

29:22.380 --> 29:26.220
 with, you know, for example, disruption of workforces

29:26.220 --> 29:29.700
 and things like that, that could happen much faster

29:29.700 --> 29:32.100
 than the industrial revolution.

29:32.100 --> 29:33.380
 What do we do about that?

29:33.380 --> 29:35.980
 And how do we keep that under control

29:35.980 --> 29:39.540
 so that the really good things about these technologies,

29:39.540 --> 29:41.860
 which will be great things,

29:41.860 --> 29:44.980
 not good things are allowed to happen?

29:44.980 --> 29:49.980
 So to me, you know, this was one of the great issues

29:52.100 --> 29:53.900
 facing society.

29:53.900 --> 29:57.420
 The number of people who were aware of it were very small.

29:57.420 --> 30:00.460
 I just accidentally got sucked into it.

30:00.460 --> 30:06.420
 And as soon as I saw it, I went, oh my God, this is mega,

30:06.420 --> 30:09.980
 both on a competitive basis globally,

30:09.980 --> 30:13.620
 but also in terms of protecting society

30:13.620 --> 30:15.540
 and benefiting society.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.620
 So that's how I got involved.

30:17.620 --> 30:20.140
 And at the end, you know, sort of the right thing

30:20.140 --> 30:22.380
 that we figured out was, you know,

30:22.380 --> 30:26.180
 sort of double MIT's computer science faculty

30:26.180 --> 30:30.900
 and basically create the first AI enabled university

30:30.900 --> 30:32.500
 in the world.

30:32.500 --> 30:35.660
 And, you know, in effect, be an example,

30:35.660 --> 30:38.460
 a beacon to the rest of the research community

30:38.460 --> 30:40.900
 around the world academically,

30:40.900 --> 30:49.300
 and create, you know, a much more robust U.S. situation,

30:49.300 --> 30:52.940
 competitive situation among the universities.

30:52.940 --> 30:55.820
 Because if MIT was going to raise a lot of money

30:55.820 --> 30:59.340
 and double its faculty, well, you could bet that,

30:59.340 --> 31:02.460
 you know, a number of other universities

31:02.460 --> 31:03.420
 were going to do the same thing.

31:03.420 --> 31:08.260
 At the end of it, it would be great for knowledge creation,

31:08.260 --> 31:12.980
 you know, great for the United States, great for the world.

31:12.980 --> 31:19.580
 And so I like to do things that I think are really positive,

31:19.580 --> 31:23.060
 things that other people aren't acting on,

31:23.060 --> 31:25.940
 that I see for whatever the reason.

31:25.940 --> 31:29.220
 First, it's just people I meet and what they say,

31:29.220 --> 31:32.940
 and I can recognize when something really profound

31:32.940 --> 31:35.380
 is about to happen or needs to.

31:35.380 --> 31:39.100
 And I do it, and at the end of the situation,

31:39.100 --> 31:43.300
 somebody says, can you write a check to help us?

31:43.300 --> 31:44.860
 And then the answer is sure.

31:44.860 --> 31:48.260
 I mean, because if I don't, the vision won't happen.

31:48.260 --> 31:52.420
 But it's the vision of whatever I do

31:52.420 --> 31:54.380
 that is compelling.

31:54.380 --> 31:59.540
 And essentially, I love that idea of whether it's small

31:59.540 --> 32:01.940
 at the individual level or really big,

32:01.940 --> 32:06.820
 like the gift to MIT to launch the College of Computing.

32:06.820 --> 32:14.500
 It starts with a vision, and you see philanthropy as,

32:14.500 --> 32:18.460
 the biggest impact you can have is by launching something new,

32:18.460 --> 32:22.500
 especially on an issue that others aren't really addressing.

32:22.500 --> 32:25.700
 And I also love the notion, and you're absolutely right,

32:25.700 --> 32:30.580
 that there's other universities, Stanford, CMU,

32:30.580 --> 32:33.460
 I'm looking at you, that would essentially,

32:33.460 --> 32:39.500
 the seed will create other, it'll have a ripple effect

32:39.500 --> 32:42.500
 that potentially might help US be a leader

32:42.500 --> 32:44.300
 or continue to be a leader in AI.

32:44.300 --> 32:49.060
 It's potentially a very transformative research

32:49.060 --> 32:50.020
 direction.

32:50.020 --> 32:52.220
 Just to linger on that point a little bit,

32:52.220 --> 32:55.980
 what is your hope long term for the impact

32:55.980 --> 33:00.260
 the college here at MIT might have in the next five, 10,

33:00.260 --> 33:03.580
 even 20, or let's get crazy, 30, 50 years?

33:03.580 --> 33:06.100
 Well, it's very difficult to predict the future

33:06.100 --> 33:08.460
 when you're dealing with knowledge production

33:08.460 --> 33:11.140
 and creativity.

33:11.140 --> 33:16.220
 MIT has, obviously, some unique aspects.

33:16.220 --> 33:22.780
 Globally, there's four big academic surveys.

33:22.780 --> 33:25.460
 I forget whether it was QS, there's

33:25.460 --> 33:31.100
 the Times in London, the US News, and whatever.

33:31.100 --> 33:34.900
 And one of these recently, MIT, was ranked number one

33:34.900 --> 33:37.620
 in the world.

33:37.620 --> 33:41.420
 So leave aside whether you're number three somewhere else,

33:41.420 --> 33:47.140
 in the great sweep of humanity, this is pretty amazing.

33:47.140 --> 33:53.580
 So you have a really remarkable aggregation of human talent

33:53.580 --> 33:55.180
 here.

33:55.180 --> 33:58.380
 And where it goes, it's hard to tell.

33:58.380 --> 34:03.220
 You have to be a scientist to have the right feel.

34:03.220 --> 34:08.620
 But what's important is you have a critical mass of people.

34:08.620 --> 34:12.620
 And I think it breaks into two buckets.

34:12.620 --> 34:15.700
 One is scientific advancement.

34:15.700 --> 34:21.500
 And if the new college can help either

34:21.500 --> 34:25.780
 serve as a convening force within the university

34:25.780 --> 34:33.020
 or help coordination and communication among people,

34:33.020 --> 34:36.780
 that's a good thing, absolute good thing.

34:36.780 --> 34:41.580
 The second thing is in the AI ethics area,

34:41.580 --> 34:48.940
 which is, in a way, equally important.

34:48.940 --> 34:55.620
 Because if the science side creates blowback

34:55.620 --> 35:03.980
 so that science is a bit crippled in terms

35:03.980 --> 35:09.020
 of going forward because society's reaction to knowledge

35:09.020 --> 35:13.140
 advancement in this field becomes really hostile,

35:13.140 --> 35:15.460
 then you've sort of lost the game

35:15.460 --> 35:18.980
 in terms of scientific progress and innovation.

35:18.980 --> 35:22.980
 And so the AI ethics piece is super important

35:22.980 --> 35:29.500
 because in a perfect world, MIT would

35:29.500 --> 35:32.460
 serve as a global convener.

35:32.460 --> 35:38.420
 Because what you need is you need the research universities.

35:38.420 --> 35:46.460
 You need the companies that are driving AI and quantum work.

35:46.460 --> 35:49.500
 You need governments who will ultimately

35:49.500 --> 35:53.460
 be regulating certain elements of this.

35:53.460 --> 35:59.540
 And you also need the media to be knowledgeable and trained

35:59.540 --> 36:09.020
 so we don't get overreactions to one situation, which then goes

36:09.020 --> 36:12.540
 viral and it ends up shutting down

36:12.540 --> 36:18.660
 avenues that are perfectly fine to be walking down or running

36:18.660 --> 36:20.540
 down that avenue.

36:20.540 --> 36:25.580
 But if enough discordant information,

36:25.580 --> 36:34.020
 not even correct necessarily, sort of gets

36:34.020 --> 36:36.900
 pushed around society, then you can end up

36:36.900 --> 36:40.700
 with a really hostile regulatory environment and other things.

36:40.700 --> 36:44.540
 So you have four drivers that have

36:44.540 --> 36:50.220
 to be sort of integrated.

36:50.220 --> 36:55.100
 And so if the new school of computing

36:55.100 --> 36:58.540
 can be really helpful in that regard,

36:58.540 --> 37:02.100
 then that's a real service to science.

37:02.100 --> 37:05.100
 And it's a service to MIT.

37:05.100 --> 37:10.060
 So that's why I wanted to get involved for both areas.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.820
 And the hope is for me, for others,

37:12.820 --> 37:17.620
 for everyone, for the world, is for this particular college

37:17.620 --> 37:22.980
 of computing to be a beacon and a connector for these ideas.

37:22.980 --> 37:23.820
 Yeah, that's right.

37:23.820 --> 37:31.940
 I mean, I think MIT is perfectly positioned to do that.

37:31.940 --> 37:35.220
 So you've mentioned the media, social media, the internet

37:35.220 --> 37:41.900
 as this complex network of communication with flaws,

37:41.900 --> 37:44.140
 perhaps, perhaps you can speak to them.

37:44.140 --> 37:50.500
 But I personally think that science and technology

37:50.500 --> 37:58.140
 has its flaws, but ultimately is, one, sexy, exciting.

37:58.140 --> 38:01.180
 It's the way for us to explore and understand

38:01.180 --> 38:02.940
 the mysteries of our world.

38:02.940 --> 38:06.900
 And two, perhaps more importantly for some people,

38:06.900 --> 38:09.700
 it's a huge way to, a really powerful way

38:09.700 --> 38:12.540
 to grow the economy, to improve the quality of life

38:12.540 --> 38:13.620
 for everyone.

38:13.620 --> 38:19.060
 So how do we get, how do you see the media, social media,

38:19.060 --> 38:26.060
 the internet as a society having a healthy discourse

38:26.060 --> 38:30.220
 about science, first of all, one that's factual

38:30.220 --> 38:33.140
 and two, one that finds science exciting,

38:33.140 --> 38:36.540
 that invests in science, that pushes it forward,

38:36.540 --> 38:41.620
 especially in this science fiction, fear filled field

38:41.620 --> 38:43.460
 of artificial intelligence?

38:43.460 --> 38:45.780
 Well, I think that's a little above my pay grade

38:45.780 --> 38:50.060
 because trying to control social media

38:50.060 --> 38:52.820
 to make it do what you want to do

38:52.820 --> 38:56.580
 appears to be beyond almost anybody's control.

38:56.580 --> 39:00.820
 And the technology is being used to create

39:00.820 --> 39:04.060
 what I call the tyranny of the minorities.

39:04.060 --> 39:07.940
 A minority is defined as two or three people

39:07.940 --> 39:09.300
 on a street corner.

39:09.300 --> 39:11.340
 Doesn't matter what they look like.

39:11.340 --> 39:13.500
 Doesn't matter where they came from.

39:13.500 --> 39:19.940
 They're united by that one issue that they care about.

39:19.940 --> 39:26.860
 And their job is to enforce their views on the world.

39:26.860 --> 39:30.860
 And in the political world, people just

39:30.860 --> 39:34.100
 are manufacturing truth.

39:34.100 --> 39:36.340
 And they throw it all over.

39:36.340 --> 39:38.980
 And it affects all of us.

39:38.980 --> 39:45.220
 And sometimes people are just hired to do that.

39:45.220 --> 39:46.780
 It's amazing.

39:46.780 --> 39:48.740
 And you think it's one person.

39:48.740 --> 39:55.340
 It's really just sort of a front for a particular point of view.

39:55.340 --> 39:59.860
 And this has become exceptionally disruptive

39:59.860 --> 40:01.860
 for society.

40:01.860 --> 40:03.500
 And it's dangerous.

40:03.500 --> 40:07.420
 And it's undercutting the ability of liberal democracies

40:07.420 --> 40:09.020
 to function.

40:09.020 --> 40:11.980
 And I don't know how to get a grip on this.

40:11.980 --> 40:16.260
 And I was really surprised when we was up here

40:16.260 --> 40:24.500
 for the announcement last spring of the College of Computing.

40:24.500 --> 40:27.580
 And they had all these famous scientists, some of whom

40:27.580 --> 40:32.660
 were involved with the invention of the internet.

40:32.660 --> 40:36.460
 And almost every one of them got up and said,

40:36.460 --> 40:39.180
 I think I made a mistake.

40:39.180 --> 40:41.500
 And as a non scientist, I never thought

40:41.500 --> 40:44.100
 I'd hear anyone say that.

40:44.100 --> 40:48.660
 And what they said is, more or less, to make it simple,

40:48.660 --> 40:52.660
 we thought this would be really cool inventing the internet.

40:52.660 --> 40:55.020
 We could connect everyone in the world.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.820
 We can move knowledge around.

40:56.820 --> 40:58.980
 It was instantaneous.

40:58.980 --> 41:01.260
 It's a really amazing thing.

41:01.260 --> 41:04.380
 He said, I don't know that there was anyone

41:04.380 --> 41:07.540
 who ever thought about social media coming out of that

41:07.540 --> 41:12.580
 and the actual consequences for people's lives.

41:12.580 --> 41:17.580
 There's always some younger person.

41:17.580 --> 41:19.700
 I just saw one of these yesterday.

41:19.700 --> 41:21.380
 It's reported on the national news

41:21.380 --> 41:25.740
 who killed himself when people use social media

41:25.740 --> 41:30.500
 to basically sort of ridicule him or something of that type.

41:30.500 --> 41:33.460
 This is dead.

41:33.460 --> 41:35.780
 This is dangerous.

41:35.780 --> 41:43.660
 And so I don't have a solution for that other

41:43.660 --> 41:46.940
 than going forward, you can end up

41:46.940 --> 41:50.060
 with this type of outcome using AI.

41:50.060 --> 41:56.180
 To make this kind of mistake twice is unforgivable.

41:56.180 --> 42:02.180
 So interestingly, at least in the West and parts of China,

42:02.180 --> 42:08.900
 people are quite sympathetic to the whole concept of AI ethics

42:08.900 --> 42:13.620
 and what gets introduced when and cooperation

42:13.620 --> 42:17.460
 within your own country, within your own industry,

42:17.460 --> 42:20.420
 as well as globally to make sure

42:20.420 --> 42:24.260
 that the technology is a force for good.

42:24.260 --> 42:25.660
 And that really interesting topic.

42:25.660 --> 42:28.660
 Since 2007, you've had a relationship

42:28.660 --> 42:32.820
 with senior leadership with a lot of people in China

42:32.820 --> 42:36.020
 and an interest in understanding modern China,

42:36.020 --> 42:39.540
 their culture, their world, much like with Russia.

42:39.540 --> 42:42.180
 I'm from Russia originally.

42:42.180 --> 42:44.980
 Americans are told a very narrow, one sided story

42:44.980 --> 42:48.660
 about China that I'm sure misses a lot

42:48.660 --> 42:53.260
 of fascinating complexity, both positive and negative.

42:53.260 --> 42:57.020
 What lessons about Chinese culture, its ideas as a nation,

42:57.020 --> 43:00.540
 its future do you think Americans should know about,

43:00.540 --> 43:02.860
 deliberate on, think about?

43:02.860 --> 43:06.100
 Well, it's sort of a wide question

43:06.100 --> 43:09.500
 that you're asking about.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.860
 China is a pretty unusual place.

43:11.860 --> 43:15.940
 First, it's huge.

43:15.940 --> 43:17.660
 It's physically huge.

43:17.660 --> 43:19.980
 It's got a billion three people.

43:19.980 --> 43:24.940
 And the character of the people isn't as well understood

43:24.940 --> 43:27.300
 in the United States.

43:27.300 --> 43:34.020
 Chinese people are amazingly energetic.

43:34.020 --> 43:37.220
 If you're one of a billion three people,

43:37.220 --> 43:40.100
 one of the things you've got to be focused on

43:40.100 --> 43:44.900
 is how do you make your way through a crowd

43:44.900 --> 43:50.940
 of a billion 2.99999 other people.

43:50.940 --> 43:52.900
 No, the word for that is competitive.

43:52.900 --> 43:57.100
 Yes, they are individually highly energetic,

43:57.100 --> 44:02.900
 highly focused, always looking for some opportunity

44:02.900 --> 44:07.740
 for themselves because they need to,

44:07.740 --> 44:11.940
 because there's an enormous amount of just literally people

44:11.940 --> 44:12.460
 around.

44:12.460 --> 44:17.860
 And so what I've found is they'll

44:17.860 --> 44:21.780
 try and find a way to win for themselves.

44:21.780 --> 44:25.900
 And their country is complicated because it basically

44:25.900 --> 44:29.540
 doesn't have the same kind of functional laws

44:29.540 --> 44:34.020
 that we do in the United States and the West.

44:34.020 --> 44:39.740
 And the country is controlled really

44:39.740 --> 44:44.340
 through a web of relationships you have with other people

44:44.340 --> 44:47.500
 and the relationships that those other people have

44:47.500 --> 44:48.860
 with other people.

44:48.860 --> 44:53.860
 So it's an incredibly dynamic culture

44:53.860 --> 44:56.860
 where if somebody knocks somebody up

44:56.860 --> 44:59.620
 on the top who's three levels above you

44:59.620 --> 45:01.300
 and is, in effect, protecting you,

45:01.300 --> 45:08.260
 then you're like a floating molecule there

45:08.260 --> 45:12.140
 without tethering except the one or two layers above you.

45:12.140 --> 45:14.180
 But that's going to get affected.

45:14.180 --> 45:15.940
 So it's a very dynamic system.

45:15.940 --> 45:19.940
 And getting people to change is not that easy

45:19.940 --> 45:23.780
 because if there aren't really functioning laws,

45:23.780 --> 45:27.380
 it's only the relationships that everybody has.

45:27.380 --> 45:30.900
 And so when you decide to make a major change

45:30.900 --> 45:33.980
 and you sign up for it, something

45:33.980 --> 45:36.420
 is changing in your life.

45:36.420 --> 45:40.700
 There won't necessarily be all the same people on your team.

45:40.700 --> 45:43.660
 And that's a very high risk enterprise.

45:43.660 --> 45:46.260
 So when you're dealing with China,

45:46.260 --> 45:50.940
 it's important to know almost what everybody's relationship

45:50.940 --> 45:52.740
 is with somebody.

45:52.740 --> 45:55.860
 So when you suggest doing something differently,

45:55.860 --> 45:59.100
 you line up these forces.

45:59.100 --> 46:02.740
 In the West, it's usually you talk to a person

46:02.740 --> 46:04.900
 and they figure out what's good for them.

46:04.900 --> 46:06.340
 It's a lot easier.

46:06.340 --> 46:08.820
 And in that sense, in a funny way,

46:08.820 --> 46:11.420
 it's easier to make change in the West,

46:11.420 --> 46:14.860
 just the opposite of what people think.

46:14.860 --> 46:17.220
 But once the Chinese system adjusts

46:17.220 --> 46:22.500
 to something that's new, everybody's on the team.

46:22.500 --> 46:23.540
 It's hard to change them.

46:23.540 --> 46:28.740
 But once they're changed, they are incredibly focused in a way

46:28.740 --> 46:31.860
 that it's hard for the West to do

46:31.860 --> 46:35.020
 in a more individualistic culture.

46:35.020 --> 46:38.700
 So there are all kinds of fascinating things.

46:42.580 --> 46:46.820
 One thing that might interest the people who are listening

46:46.820 --> 46:50.900
 who are more technologically based than some other group.

46:50.900 --> 46:56.060
 I was with one of the top people in the government

46:56.060 --> 47:00.060
 a few weeks ago, and he was telling me that every school

47:00.060 --> 47:08.700
 child in China is going to be taught computer science.

47:08.700 --> 47:14.980
 Now, imagine 100% of these children.

47:14.980 --> 47:20.060
 This is such a large number of human beings.

47:20.060 --> 47:22.820
 Now, that doesn't mean that every one of them

47:22.820 --> 47:25.260
 will be good at computer science.

47:25.260 --> 47:28.780
 But if it's sort of like in the West,

47:28.780 --> 47:33.420
 if it's like math or English, everybody's going to take it.

47:33.420 --> 47:35.540
 Not everybody's great at English.

47:35.540 --> 47:36.540
 They don't write books.

47:36.540 --> 47:38.220
 They don't write poetry.

47:38.220 --> 47:41.180
 And not everybody's good at math.

47:41.180 --> 47:44.780
 Somebody like myself, I sort of evolved to the third grade,

47:44.780 --> 47:47.740
 and I'm still doing flashcards.

47:47.740 --> 47:50.220
 I didn't make it further in math.

47:50.220 --> 47:54.660
 But imagine everybody in their society

47:54.660 --> 47:58.380
 is going to be involved with computer science.

47:58.380 --> 48:01.180
 I'd just even pause on that.

48:01.180 --> 48:05.180
 I think computer science involves,

48:05.180 --> 48:07.940
 at the basic beginner level, programming.

48:07.940 --> 48:11.380
 And the idea that everybody in the society

48:11.380 --> 48:18.620
 would have some ability to program a computer is incredible.

48:18.620 --> 48:20.340
 For me, it's incredibly exciting,

48:20.340 --> 48:24.980
 and I think that should give the United States pause

48:24.980 --> 48:28.100
 and consider what...

48:28.100 --> 48:31.300
 Talking about sort of philanthropy and launching things,

48:31.300 --> 48:33.780
 there's nothing like launching,

48:33.780 --> 48:38.180
 sort of investing in young youth, the education system,

48:38.180 --> 48:40.380
 because that's where everything launches.

48:40.380 --> 48:41.220
 Yes.

48:41.220 --> 48:42.620
 Well, we've got a complicated system

48:42.620 --> 48:45.700
 because we have over 3,000 school districts

48:45.700 --> 48:47.380
 around the country.

48:47.380 --> 48:50.900
 China doesn't worry about that as a concept.

48:50.900 --> 48:55.220
 They make a decision at the very top of the government

48:55.220 --> 48:57.380
 that that's what they want to have happen,

48:57.380 --> 48:59.460
 and that is what will happen.

48:59.460 --> 49:07.020
 And we're really handicapped by this distributed power

49:07.020 --> 49:08.180
 in the education area,

49:08.180 --> 49:10.820
 although some people involved with that area

49:10.820 --> 49:13.860
 will think it's great.

49:13.860 --> 49:17.060
 But you would know better than I do

49:17.060 --> 49:18.900
 what percent of American children

49:18.900 --> 49:23.220
 have computer science exposure.

49:23.220 --> 49:29.460
 My guess, no knowledge, would be 5% or less.

49:29.460 --> 49:33.060
 And if we're going to be going into a world

49:33.060 --> 49:37.380
 where the other major economic power,

49:37.380 --> 49:42.580
 sort of like ourselves, has got like 100% and we got 5%,

49:42.580 --> 49:49.060
 and the whole computer science area is the future,

49:49.060 --> 49:52.980
 then we're purposely or accidentally actually

49:52.980 --> 49:54.900
 handicapping ourselves,

49:54.900 --> 50:00.300
 and our system doesn't allow us to adjust quickly to that.

50:00.300 --> 50:06.300
 So, you know, issues like this I find fascinating.

50:06.300 --> 50:08.340
 And, you know, if you're lucky enough

50:08.340 --> 50:12.540
 to go to other countries, which I do,

50:12.540 --> 50:14.580
 and you learn what they're thinking,

50:14.580 --> 50:22.700
 then it informs what we ought to be doing in the United States.

50:22.700 --> 50:25.580
 So the current administration, Donald Trump,

50:25.580 --> 50:29.820
 has released an executive order on artificial intelligence.

50:29.820 --> 50:31.820
 Not sure if you're familiar with it.

50:31.820 --> 50:36.300
 In 2019, looking several years ahead,

50:36.300 --> 50:38.740
 how does America sort of,

50:38.740 --> 50:41.780
 we've mentioned in terms of the big impact,

50:41.780 --> 50:47.980
 we hope your investment in MIT will have a ripple effect,

50:47.980 --> 50:51.740
 but from a federal perspective, from a government perspective,

50:51.740 --> 50:55.660
 how does America establish, with respect to China,

50:55.660 --> 50:57.780
 leadership in the world at the top

50:57.780 --> 51:00.260
 for research and development in AI?

51:00.260 --> 51:04.060
 I think that you have to get the federal government

51:04.060 --> 51:07.660
 in the game in a big way,

51:07.660 --> 51:13.540
 and that this leap forward technologically,

51:13.540 --> 51:17.340
 which is going to happen with or without us,

51:17.340 --> 51:19.980
 you know, really should be with us,

51:19.980 --> 51:23.500
 and it's an opportunity, in effect,

51:23.500 --> 51:28.380
 for another moonshot kind of mobilization

51:28.380 --> 51:30.860
 by the United States.

51:30.860 --> 51:38.220
 I think the appetite actually is there to do that.

51:38.220 --> 51:41.380
 At the moment, what's getting in the way

51:41.380 --> 51:45.980
 is the kind of poisonous politics we have,

51:45.980 --> 51:52.500
 but if you go below the lack of cooperation,

51:52.500 --> 51:59.100
 which is almost the defining element of American democracy

51:59.100 --> 52:00.940
 right now in the Congress,

52:00.940 --> 52:04.660
 if you talk to individual members, they get it,

52:04.660 --> 52:08.020
 and they would like to do something.

52:08.020 --> 52:11.060
 Another part of the issue is we're running huge deficits.

52:11.060 --> 52:13.820
 We're running trillion dollar plus deficits.

52:13.820 --> 52:19.540
 So how much money do you need for this initiative?

52:19.540 --> 52:21.460
 Where does it come from?

52:21.460 --> 52:24.260
 Who's prepared to stand up for it?

52:24.260 --> 52:27.100
 Because if it involves taking away resources

52:27.100 --> 52:32.740
 from another area, our political system is not real flexible.

52:32.740 --> 52:41.260
 To do that, if you're creating this kind of initiative,

52:41.260 --> 52:45.220
 which we need, where does the money come from?

52:45.220 --> 52:47.380
 And trying to get money

52:47.380 --> 52:49.540
 when you've got trillion dollar deficits,

52:49.540 --> 52:50.860
 in a way, could be easy.

52:50.860 --> 52:52.220
 What's the difference of a trillion

52:52.220 --> 52:54.580
 and a trillion and a little more?

52:54.580 --> 52:58.620
 But, you know, it's hard with the mechanisms of Congress.

52:58.620 --> 53:06.340
 But what's really important is this is not an issue

53:06.340 --> 53:12.540
 that is unknown, and it's viewed as a very important issue.

53:12.540 --> 53:15.900
 And there's almost no one in the Congress

53:15.900 --> 53:18.980
 when you sit down and explain what's going on

53:18.980 --> 53:22.140
 who doesn't say, we've got to do something.

53:22.140 --> 53:26.020
 Let me ask the impossible question.

53:26.020 --> 53:30.660
 You didn't endorse Donald Trump, but after he was elected,

53:30.660 --> 53:38.860
 you have given him advice, which seems to me a great thing

53:38.860 --> 53:42.060
 to do, no matter who the president is,

53:42.060 --> 53:47.140
 to positively contribute to this nation by giving advice.

53:47.140 --> 53:50.580
 And yet, you've received a lot of criticism for this.

53:50.580 --> 53:54.100
 So on the previous topic of science and technology

53:54.100 --> 53:59.740
 and government, how do we have a healthy discourse,

53:59.740 --> 54:05.500
 give advice, get excited conversation with the government

54:05.500 --> 54:09.620
 about science and technology without it becoming politicized?

54:09.620 --> 54:12.100
 Well, it's very interesting.

54:12.100 --> 54:17.260
 So when I was young, before there was a moonshot,

54:17.260 --> 54:22.300
 we had a president named John F. Kennedy from Massachusetts

54:22.300 --> 54:23.060
 here.

54:23.060 --> 54:27.700
 And in his inaugural address as president,

54:27.700 --> 54:31.700
 he asked not what your country can do for you,

54:31.700 --> 54:34.860
 but what you can do for your country.

54:34.860 --> 54:40.340
 We had a generation of people my age, basically people,

54:40.340 --> 54:45.180
 who grew up with that credo.

54:45.180 --> 54:49.980
 And sometimes you don't need to innovate.

54:49.980 --> 54:52.700
 You can go back to basic principles.

54:52.700 --> 54:55.860
 And that's good basic principle.

54:55.860 --> 54:58.620
 What can we do?

54:58.620 --> 55:04.540
 Americans have GDP per capita of around $60,000.

55:04.540 --> 55:08.180
 It's not equally distributed, but it's big.

55:08.180 --> 55:15.980
 And people have, I think, an obligation to help

55:15.980 --> 55:17.220
 their country.

55:17.220 --> 55:19.140
 And I do that.

55:19.140 --> 55:28.740
 And apparently, I take some grief from some people who

55:28.740 --> 55:33.580
 project on me things I don't even vaguely believe.

55:33.580 --> 55:36.980
 But I'm quite simple.

55:36.980 --> 55:41.060
 I tried to help the previous president, President Obama.

55:41.060 --> 55:42.660
 He was a good guy.

55:42.660 --> 55:44.420
 And he was a different party.

55:44.420 --> 55:46.660
 And I tried to help President Bush.

55:46.660 --> 55:48.580
 And he's a different party.

55:48.580 --> 55:57.180
 And I sort of don't care that much about what the parties are.

55:57.180 --> 56:01.420
 I care about, even though I'm a big donor for the Republicans,

56:01.420 --> 56:08.220
 but what motivates me is, what are the problems we're facing?

56:08.220 --> 56:13.500
 Can I help people get to a good outcome that

56:13.500 --> 56:16.620
 will stand any test?

56:16.620 --> 56:24.860
 But we live in a world now where the filters and the hostility

56:24.860 --> 56:30.100
 is so unbelievable.

56:30.100 --> 56:34.140
 In the 1960s, when I went to school and university,

56:34.140 --> 56:40.060
 I went to Yale, we had so much stuff going on.

56:40.060 --> 56:43.820
 We had a war called the Vietnam War.

56:43.820 --> 56:47.660
 We had sort of black power starting.

56:47.660 --> 56:54.580
 And we had a sexual revolution with the birth control pill.

56:54.580 --> 57:02.980
 And there was one other major thing going on,

57:02.980 --> 57:05.460
 the drug revolution.

57:05.460 --> 57:08.020
 There hasn't been a generation that

57:08.020 --> 57:17.460
 had more stuff going on in a four year period than my era.

57:17.460 --> 57:23.460
 Yet, there wasn't this kind of instant hostility

57:23.460 --> 57:26.220
 if you believed something different.

57:26.220 --> 57:32.180
 Everybody lived together and respected the other person.

57:32.180 --> 57:37.780
 And I think that this type of change needs to happen.

57:37.780 --> 57:41.580
 And it's got to happen from the leadership

57:41.580 --> 57:44.420
 of our major institutions.

57:44.420 --> 57:48.660
 And I don't think that leaders can

57:48.660 --> 57:53.780
 be bullied by people who are against sort

57:53.780 --> 57:56.300
 of the classical version of free speech

57:56.300 --> 58:00.420
 and letting open expression and inquiry.

58:00.420 --> 58:05.420
 That's what universities are for, among other things,

58:05.420 --> 58:06.820
 Socratic methods.

58:06.820 --> 58:18.940
 And so I have, in the midst of this onslaught of oddness,

58:18.940 --> 58:22.900
 I believe in still the basic principles.

58:22.900 --> 58:26.540
 And we're going to have to find a way to get back to that.

58:26.540 --> 58:31.420
 And that doesn't start with the people sort of in the middle

58:31.420 --> 58:36.300
 to the bottom who are using these kinds of screens

58:36.300 --> 58:41.260
 to shout people down and create an uncooperative environment.

58:41.260 --> 58:46.140
 It's got to be done at the top with core principles that

58:46.140 --> 58:48.340
 are articulated.

58:48.340 --> 58:53.580
 And ironically, if people don't sign on

58:53.580 --> 58:56.900
 to these kind of core principles where people are equal

58:56.900 --> 59:02.980
 and speech can be heard and you don't have these enormous

59:02.980 --> 59:06.940
 shout down biases subtly or out loud,

59:06.940 --> 59:09.580
 then they don't belong at those institutions.

59:09.580 --> 59:12.100
 They're violating the core principles.

59:12.100 --> 59:18.180
 And that's how you end up making change.

59:18.180 --> 59:21.660
 But you have to have courageous people who

59:21.660 --> 59:26.220
 are willing to lay that out for the benefit of not just

59:26.220 --> 59:31.620
 their institutions, but for society as a whole.

59:31.620 --> 59:35.740
 So I believe that will happen.

59:35.740 --> 59:41.580
 But it needs the commitment of senior people

59:41.580 --> 59:42.700
 to make it happen.

59:42.700 --> 59:43.660
 Courage.

59:43.660 --> 59:47.820
 And I think for such great leaders, great universities,

59:47.820 --> 59:49.300
 there's a huge hunger for it.

59:49.300 --> 59:53.260
 So I am too very optimistic that it will come.

59:53.260 --> 59:56.420
 I'm now personally taking a step into building a startup

59:56.420 --> 1:00:00.740
 first time, hoping to change the world, of course.

1:00:00.740 --> 1:00:03.380
 There are thousands, maybe more, maybe millions

1:00:03.380 --> 1:00:06.100
 of other first time entrepreneurs like me.

1:00:06.100 --> 1:00:08.060
 What advice?

1:00:08.060 --> 1:00:09.420
 You've gone through this process.

1:00:09.420 --> 1:00:14.060
 You've talked about the suffering, the emotional turmoil

1:00:14.060 --> 1:00:15.540
 it all might entail.

1:00:15.540 --> 1:00:20.220
 What advice do you have for those people taking that step?

1:00:20.220 --> 1:00:23.260
 I'd say it's a rough ride.

1:00:23.260 --> 1:00:28.860
 And you have to be psychologically prepared

1:00:28.860 --> 1:00:33.060
 for things going wrong with frequency.

1:00:33.060 --> 1:00:38.340
 You have to be prepared to be put in situations where you're

1:00:38.340 --> 1:00:40.620
 being asked to solve problems you didn't even

1:00:40.620 --> 1:00:43.020
 know those problems existed.

1:00:43.020 --> 1:00:47.140
 For example, renting space, it's not really a problem

1:00:47.140 --> 1:00:48.620
 unless you've never done it.

1:00:48.620 --> 1:00:52.060
 You have no idea what a lease looks like.

1:00:52.060 --> 1:00:56.820
 You don't even know the relevant rent in a market.

1:00:56.820 --> 1:00:58.580
 So everything is new.

1:00:58.580 --> 1:01:00.740
 Everything has to be learned.

1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:04.460
 What you realize is that it's good to have other people

1:01:04.460 --> 1:01:07.660
 with you who've had some experience in areas

1:01:07.660 --> 1:01:09.780
 where you don't know what you're doing.

1:01:09.780 --> 1:01:13.140
 Unfortunately, an entrepreneur starting

1:01:13.140 --> 1:01:14.620
 doesn't know much of anything.

1:01:14.620 --> 1:01:18.140
 So everything is something new.

1:01:18.140 --> 1:01:24.420
 And I think it's important not to be alone,

1:01:24.420 --> 1:01:28.660
 because it's sort of overwhelming.

1:01:28.660 --> 1:01:33.660
 And you need somebody to talk to other than a spouse or a loved

1:01:33.660 --> 1:01:38.340
 one, because even they get bored with your problems.

1:01:38.340 --> 1:01:43.940
 And so getting a group, if you look at Alibaba,

1:01:43.940 --> 1:01:47.580
 Jack Ma was telling me they basically

1:01:47.580 --> 1:01:52.420
 were like at financial death's door at least twice.

1:01:52.420 --> 1:01:55.940
 And the fact that it wasn't just Jack.

1:01:55.940 --> 1:01:57.940
 I mean, people think it is, because he

1:01:57.940 --> 1:02:02.420
 became the sort of public face and the driver.

1:02:02.420 --> 1:02:08.380
 But a group of people who can give advice,

1:02:08.380 --> 1:02:13.460
 share situations to talk about, that's really important.

1:02:13.460 --> 1:02:15.900
 And that's not just referring to the small details

1:02:15.900 --> 1:02:17.100
 like renting space.

1:02:17.100 --> 1:02:17.600
 No.

1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:20.500
 It's also the psychological burden.

1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:24.700
 Yeah, and because most entrepreneurs at some point

1:02:24.700 --> 1:02:27.780
 question what they're doing, because it's not going so well.

1:02:27.780 --> 1:02:29.180
 Or they're screwing it up, and they

1:02:29.180 --> 1:02:34.100
 don't know how to unscrew it up, because we're all learning.

1:02:34.100 --> 1:02:38.700
 And it's hard to be learning when there are like 25 variables

1:02:38.700 --> 1:02:39.340
 going on.

1:02:39.340 --> 1:02:43.820
 If you're missing four big ones, you can really make a mess.

1:02:43.820 --> 1:02:50.940
 And so the ability to, in effect, have either an outsider

1:02:50.940 --> 1:02:53.340
 who's really smart that you can rely on

1:02:53.340 --> 1:02:57.460
 for certain type of things, or other people who are working

1:02:57.460 --> 1:03:03.380
 with you on a daily basis, most people

1:03:03.380 --> 1:03:06.260
 who haven't had experience believe

1:03:06.260 --> 1:03:10.700
 in the myth of the one person, one great person,

1:03:10.700 --> 1:03:15.580
 makes outcomes, creates outcomes that are positive.

1:03:15.580 --> 1:03:18.660
 Most of us, it's not like that.

1:03:18.660 --> 1:03:22.860
 If you look back over a lot of the big successful tech

1:03:22.860 --> 1:03:28.020
 companies, it's not typically one person.

1:03:28.020 --> 1:03:30.860
 And you will know these stories better than I do,

1:03:30.860 --> 1:03:32.400
 because it's your world, not mine.

1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:35.300
 But even I know that almost every one of them

1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:36.860
 had two people.

1:03:36.860 --> 1:03:40.380
 If you look at Google, that's what they had.

1:03:40.380 --> 1:03:43.660
 And that was the same at Microsoft at the beginning.

1:03:43.660 --> 1:03:48.180
 And it was the same at Apple.

1:03:48.180 --> 1:03:50.020
 People have different skills.

1:03:50.020 --> 1:03:53.300
 And they need to play off of other people.

1:03:53.300 --> 1:03:59.660
 So the advice that I would give you

1:03:59.660 --> 1:04:03.420
 is make sure you understand that so you don't head off

1:04:03.420 --> 1:04:08.280
 in some direction as a lone wolf and find that either you

1:04:08.280 --> 1:04:13.740
 can't invent all the solutions or you make bad decisions

1:04:13.740 --> 1:04:15.700
 on certain types of things.

1:04:15.700 --> 1:04:18.020
 This is a team sport.

1:04:18.020 --> 1:04:22.460
 Entrepreneur means you're alone, in effect.

1:04:22.460 --> 1:04:24.260
 And that's the myth.

1:04:24.260 --> 1:04:27.420
 But it's mostly a myth.

1:04:27.420 --> 1:04:29.900
 Yeah, I think, and you talk about this in your book,

1:04:29.900 --> 1:04:31.940
 and I could talk to you about it forever,

1:04:31.940 --> 1:04:36.740
 the harshly self critical aspect to your personality

1:04:36.740 --> 1:04:39.780
 and to mine as well in the face of failure.

1:04:39.780 --> 1:04:41.820
 It's a powerful tool, but it's also

1:04:41.820 --> 1:04:49.180
 a burden that's very interesting to walk that line.

1:04:49.180 --> 1:04:53.020
 But let me ask in terms of people around you,

1:04:53.020 --> 1:04:56.140
 in terms of friends, in the bigger

1:04:56.140 --> 1:04:57.940
 picture of your own life, where do you

1:04:57.940 --> 1:05:02.700
 put the value of love, family, friendship

1:05:02.700 --> 1:05:06.580
 in the big picture journey of your life?

1:05:06.580 --> 1:05:12.140
 Well, ultimately, all journeys are alone.

1:05:12.140 --> 1:05:13.340
 It's great to have support.

1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:23.980
 And when you go forward and say your job is

1:05:23.980 --> 1:05:26.260
 to make something work, and that's your number one

1:05:26.260 --> 1:05:31.500
 priority, and you're going to work at it to make it work,

1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:33.900
 it's like superhuman effort.

1:05:33.900 --> 1:05:38.220
 People don't become successful as part time workers.

1:05:38.220 --> 1:05:40.580
 It doesn't work that way.

1:05:40.580 --> 1:05:48.420
 And if you're prepared to make that 100% to 120% effort,

1:05:48.420 --> 1:05:51.500
 you're going to need support, and you're

1:05:51.500 --> 1:05:53.140
 going to have to have people involved

1:05:53.140 --> 1:05:56.300
 with your life who understand that that's really

1:05:56.300 --> 1:05:59.180
 part of your life.

1:05:59.180 --> 1:06:01.580
 Sometimes you're involved with somebody,

1:06:01.580 --> 1:06:04.820
 and they don't really understand that.

1:06:04.820 --> 1:06:09.140
 And that's a source of conflict and difficulty.

1:06:09.140 --> 1:06:13.500
 But if you're involved with the right people,

1:06:13.500 --> 1:06:20.140
 whether it's a dating relationship or a spousal

1:06:20.140 --> 1:06:28.820
 relationship, you have to involve them in your life,

1:06:28.820 --> 1:06:36.540
 but not burden them with every minor triumph or mistake.

1:06:36.540 --> 1:06:41.060
 They actually get bored with it after a while.

1:06:41.060 --> 1:06:45.900
 And so you have to set up different types of ecosystems.

1:06:45.900 --> 1:06:48.300
 You have your home life.

1:06:48.300 --> 1:06:50.140
 You have your love life.

1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:51.620
 You have children.

1:06:51.620 --> 1:06:55.900
 And that's the enduring part of what you do.

1:06:55.900 --> 1:07:00.420
 And then on the other side, you've got the unpredictable

1:07:00.420 --> 1:07:07.220
 nature of this type of work.

1:07:07.220 --> 1:07:12.980
 What I say to people at my firm who are younger, usually,

1:07:12.980 --> 1:07:16.420
 well, everybody's younger, but people

1:07:16.420 --> 1:07:19.780
 who are of an age where they're just

1:07:19.780 --> 1:07:24.500
 having their first child, or maybe they have two children,

1:07:24.500 --> 1:07:31.140
 that it's important to make sure they go away

1:07:31.140 --> 1:07:37.540
 with their spouse at least once every two months to just

1:07:37.540 --> 1:07:42.620
 some lovely place where there are no children, no issues,

1:07:42.620 --> 1:07:45.740
 sometimes once a month if they're

1:07:45.740 --> 1:07:48.380
 sort of energetic and clever.

1:07:48.380 --> 1:07:49.700
 And that

1:07:49.700 --> 1:07:51.740
 Escape the craziness of it all.

1:07:51.740 --> 1:07:58.100
 Yeah, and reaffirm your values as a couple.

1:07:58.100 --> 1:08:00.940
 And you have to have fun.

1:08:00.940 --> 1:08:04.780
 If you don't have fun with the person you're with,

1:08:04.780 --> 1:08:07.460
 and all you're doing is dealing with issues,

1:08:07.460 --> 1:08:09.580
 then that gets pretty old.

1:08:09.580 --> 1:08:14.580
 And so you have to protect the fun element of your life

1:08:14.580 --> 1:08:15.540
 together.

1:08:15.540 --> 1:08:18.740
 And the way to do that isn't by hanging around the house

1:08:18.740 --> 1:08:22.540
 and dealing with sort of more problems.

1:08:22.540 --> 1:08:27.340
 You have to get away and reinforce and reinvigorate

1:08:27.340 --> 1:08:28.340
 your relationship.

1:08:28.340 --> 1:08:31.740
 And whenever I tell one of our younger people about that,

1:08:31.740 --> 1:08:33.540
 they sort of look at me, and it's

1:08:33.540 --> 1:08:35.820
 like the scales are falling off of their eyes.

1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:39.060
 And they're saying, jeez, I hadn't thought about that.

1:08:39.060 --> 1:08:41.340
 I'm so enmeshed in all these things.

1:08:41.340 --> 1:08:42.820
 But that's a great idea.

1:08:42.820 --> 1:08:45.260
 And that's something, as an entrepreneur,

1:08:45.260 --> 1:08:47.660
 you also have to do.

1:08:47.660 --> 1:08:50.620
 You just can't let relationships slip

1:08:50.620 --> 1:08:53.540
 because you're half overwhelmed.

1:08:53.540 --> 1:08:54.300
 Beautifully put.

1:08:54.300 --> 1:08:57.340
 And I think there's no better place to end it.

1:08:57.340 --> 1:08:58.700
 Steve, thank you so much.

1:08:58.700 --> 1:08:59.620
 I really appreciate it.

1:08:59.620 --> 1:09:01.020
 It was an honor to talk to you.

1:09:01.020 --> 1:09:02.820
 My pleasure.

1:09:02.820 --> 1:09:04.500

 And now, let me leave you with some words

1:09:33.860 --> 1:09:38.140
 from Stephen Schwarzman's book, What It Takes.

1:09:38.140 --> 1:09:41.500
 It's as hard to start and run a small business

1:09:41.500 --> 1:09:43.780
 as it is to start a big one.

1:09:43.780 --> 1:09:46.900
 You will suffer the same toll financially and psychologically

1:09:46.900 --> 1:09:49.500
 as you bludgeon it into existence.

1:09:50.340 --> 1:09:53.540
 It's hard to raise the money and to find the right people.

1:09:53.540 --> 1:09:56.620
 So if you're going to dedicate your life to a business,

1:09:56.620 --> 1:09:59.740
 which is the only way it will ever work,

1:09:59.740 --> 1:10:02.660
 you should choose one with the potential to be huge.

1:10:02.660 --> 1:10:15.540
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
