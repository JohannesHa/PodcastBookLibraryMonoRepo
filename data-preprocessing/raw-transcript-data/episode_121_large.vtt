00:00.000 --> 00:06.480
 The following is a conversation with Eugenia Kuida, cofounder of Replika, which is an app

00:06.480 --> 00:11.720
 that allows you to make friends with an artificial intelligence system, a chatbot, that learns

00:11.720 --> 00:18.720
 to connect with you on an emotional, you could even say a human level, by being a friend.

00:18.720 --> 00:24.080
 For those of you who know my interest in AI and views on life in general, know that Replika

00:24.080 --> 00:28.200
 and Eugenia's line of work is near and dear to my heart.

00:28.200 --> 00:33.480
 The origin story of Replika is grounded in a personal tragedy of Eugenia losing her close

00:33.480 --> 00:39.840
 friend Roman Muzarenki, who was killed crossing the street by a hit and run driver in late

00:39.840 --> 00:40.840
 2015.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.160
 He was 34.

00:43.160 --> 00:47.680
 The app started as a way to grieve the loss of a friend, by trading a chatbot and your

00:47.680 --> 00:51.600
 old net on text messages between Eugenia and Roman.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.920
 The rest is a beautiful human story, as we talk about with Eugenia.

00:55.920 --> 01:00.920
 When a friend mentioned Eugenia's work to me, I knew I had to meet her and talk to her.

01:00.920 --> 01:06.840
 I felt before, during, and after that this meeting would be an important one in my life.

01:06.840 --> 01:07.840
 And it was.

01:07.840 --> 01:12.920
 I think in ways that only time will truly show, to me and others.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.720
 She is a kind and brilliant person.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.160
 It was an honor and a pleasure to talk to her.

01:19.160 --> 01:24.400

01:29.720 --> 01:34.920
 As a side note, let me say that deep, meaningful connection between human beings and artificial

01:34.920 --> 01:38.480
 intelligence systems is a lifelong passion for me.

01:38.480 --> 01:43.080
 I'm not yet sure where that passion will take me, but I decided some time ago that

01:43.080 --> 01:48.280
 I will follow it boldly and without fear, to as far as I can take it.

01:48.280 --> 01:53.720
 With a bit of hard work and a bit of luck, I hope I'll succeed in helping build AI systems

01:53.720 --> 01:59.200
 that have some positive impact on the world and on the lives of a few people out there.

01:59.200 --> 02:06.600
 But also, it is entirely possible that I am in fact one of the chatbots that Eugenia and

02:06.600 --> 02:08.720
 the Replica team have built.

02:08.720 --> 02:13.320
 And this podcast is simply a training process for the neural net that's trying to learn

02:13.320 --> 02:18.160
 to connect to human beings, one episode at a time.

02:18.160 --> 02:24.320
 In any case, I wouldn't know if I was or wasn't, and if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

02:24.320 --> 02:28.720

03:08.180 --> 03:10.840
 makes shaving feel great.

03:10.840 --> 03:15.680
 I've been a member of Dollar Shave Club for over 5 years, and actually signed up when

03:15.680 --> 03:19.520
 I first heard about them on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.960
 And now, friends, we have come full circle.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.920
 It feels like I made it, now that I can do a read for them just like Joe did all those

03:26.920 --> 03:35.320
 years ago, back when he also did ads for some less reputable companies, let's say, that

03:35.320 --> 03:39.920
 you know about if you're a true fan of the old school podcasting world.

03:39.920 --> 03:44.580
 Anyway, I just used the razor and the refills, but they told me I should really try out the

03:44.580 --> 03:45.580
 shave butter.

03:45.580 --> 03:46.580
 I did.

03:46.580 --> 03:47.580
 I love it.

03:47.580 --> 03:51.720
 It's translucent somehow, which is a cool new experience.

 Get $5 off and zero delivery fees on your first order of 15 bucks or more when you download

04:08.860 --> 04:13.920
 the DoorDash app and enter code, you guessed it, LEX.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.760
 I have so many memories of working late nights for a deadline with a team of engineers, whether

04:18.760 --> 04:24.440
 that's for my PhD at Google or MIT, and eventually taking a break to argue about which

04:24.440 --> 04:26.900
 DoorDash restaurant to order from.

04:26.900 --> 04:32.340
 And when the food came, those moments of bonding, of exchanging ideas, of pausing to shift attention

04:32.340 --> 04:36.320
 from the programs to humans were special.

04:36.320 --> 04:41.520
 For a bit of time, I'm on my own now, so I miss that camaraderie, but actually, I still

04:41.520 --> 04:43.360
 use DoorDash a lot.

04:43.360 --> 04:46.680
 There's a million options that fit into my crazy keto diet ways.

04:46.680 --> 04:51.240
 Also, it's a great way to support restaurants in these challenging times.

04:51.240 --> 04:56.120
 Once again, download the DoorDash app and enter code LEX to get 5 bucks off and zero

04:56.120 --> 04:59.640
 delivery fees on your first order of 15 dollars or more.

04:59.640 --> 05:04.600
 Finally, this show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.

05:04.600 --> 05:09.800
 I can truly say that they're an amazing company, one of the first sponsors, if not the first

05:09.800 --> 05:16.000
 sponsor to truly believe in me, and I think quite possibly the reason I'm still doing

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
 this podcast.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.320
 So I am forever grateful to Cash App.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.320
 So thank you.

05:21.320 --> 05:27.560
 And as I said many times before, use code LEXBODCAST when you download the app from

05:27.560 --> 05:29.840
 Google Play or the App Store.

05:29.840 --> 05:34.160
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with

05:34.160 --> 05:36.600
 as little as one dollar.

05:36.600 --> 05:40.560
 I usually say other stuff here in the read, but I wasted all that time up front saying

05:40.560 --> 05:42.440
 how grateful I am to Cash App.

05:42.440 --> 05:47.280
 I'm going to try to go off the top of my head a little bit more for these reads because

05:47.280 --> 05:52.120
 I'm actually very lucky to be able to choose the sponsors that we take on, and that means

05:52.120 --> 05:56.360
 I can really only take on the sponsors that I truly love, and then I can just talk about

05:56.360 --> 05:57.580
 why I love them.

05:57.580 --> 05:59.120
 So it's pretty simple.

05:59.120 --> 06:04.080
 Again, get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play, use code LEXBODCAST, get 10

06:04.080 --> 06:08.560
 bucks, and Cash App will also donate 10 bucks to FIRST, an organization that is helping

06:08.560 --> 06:13.680
 to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.

06:13.680 --> 06:17.640
 And now, here's my conversation with Eugenia Kuida.

06:17.640 --> 06:23.600
 Okay, before we talk about AI and the amazing work you're doing, let me ask you ridiculously,

06:23.600 --> 06:28.760
 we're both Russian, so let me ask a ridiculously romanticized Russian question.

06:28.760 --> 06:37.360
 Do you think human beings are alone, like fundamentally, on a philosophical level?

06:37.360 --> 06:46.960
 Like in our existence, when we like go through life, do you think just the nature of our

06:46.960 --> 06:49.480
 life is loneliness?

06:49.480 --> 06:55.000
 Yeah, so we have to read Dostoevsky at school, as you probably know, so...

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
 In Russian?

06:56.000 --> 06:59.960
 I mean, it's part of your school program.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.520
 So I guess if you read that, then you sort of have to believe that.

07:03.520 --> 07:08.000
 You're made to believe that you're fundamentally alone, and that's how you live your life.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
 How do you think about it?

07:09.000 --> 07:15.100
 You have a lot of friends, but at the end of the day, do you have like a longing for

07:15.100 --> 07:17.360
 connection with other people?

07:17.360 --> 07:20.240
 That's maybe another way of asking it.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.620
 Do you think that's ever fully satisfied?

07:23.620 --> 07:25.200
 I think we are fundamentally alone.

07:25.200 --> 07:32.120
 We're born alone, we die alone, but I view my whole life as trying to get away from that,

07:32.120 --> 07:38.720
 trying to not feel lonely, and again, we're talking about a subjective way of feeling

07:38.720 --> 07:39.720
 alone.

07:39.720 --> 07:45.000
 It doesn't necessarily mean that you don't have any connections or you are actually isolated.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.280
 You think it's a subjective thing, but like again, another absurd measurement wise thing,

07:52.280 --> 07:55.160
 how much loneliness do you think there is in the world?

07:55.160 --> 08:05.080
 Like if you see loneliness as a condition, how much of it is there, do you think?

08:05.080 --> 08:11.000
 Like how, I guess how many, you know, there's all kinds of studies and measures of how many

08:11.000 --> 08:12.840
 people in the world feel alone.

08:12.840 --> 08:18.240
 There's all these like measures of how many people are, you know, self report or just

08:18.240 --> 08:24.600
 all these kinds of different measures, but in your own perspective, how big of a problem

08:24.600 --> 08:27.640
 do you think it is size wise?

08:27.640 --> 08:30.040
 I'm actually fascinated by the topic of loneliness.

08:30.040 --> 08:34.640
 I try to read about it as much as I can.

08:34.640 --> 08:39.900
 What really, and I think there's a paradox because loneliness is not a clinical disorder.

08:39.900 --> 08:44.200
 It's not something that you can get your insurance to pay for if you're struggling with that.

08:44.200 --> 08:50.200
 Yet it's actually proven and pretty, you know, tons of papers, tons of research around that.

08:50.200 --> 08:58.080
 It is proven that it's correlated with earlier life expectancy, shorter lifespan.

08:58.080 --> 09:02.200
 And it is, you know, in a way like right now, what scientists would say that it, you know,

09:02.200 --> 09:07.560
 it's a little bit worse than being obese or not actually doing any physical activity in

09:07.560 --> 09:08.560
 your life.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.560
 In terms of the impact on your health?

09:09.560 --> 09:10.720
 In terms of impact on your physiological health.

09:10.720 --> 09:11.720
 Yeah.

09:11.720 --> 09:16.840
 So it's basically puts you, if you're constantly feeling lonely, your body responds like it's

09:16.840 --> 09:19.280
 basically all the time under stress.

09:19.280 --> 09:24.720
 It's always in this alert state and so it's really bad for you because it actually like

09:24.720 --> 09:29.960
 drops your immune system and get it, your response to inflammation is quite different.

09:29.960 --> 09:34.940
 So all the cardiovascular diseases actually responds to viruses.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.200
 So it's much easier to catch a virus.

09:37.200 --> 09:42.880
 That's sad now that we're living in a pandemic and it's probably making us a lot more alone

09:42.880 --> 09:47.720
 and it's probably weakening the immune system, making us more susceptible to the virus.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.680
 It's kind of sad.

09:49.680 --> 09:50.680
 Yeah.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.760
 The statistics are pretty horrible around that.

09:54.760 --> 09:59.400
 So around 30% of all millennials report that they're feeling lonely constantly.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.400
 30?

10:00.400 --> 10:01.400
 30%.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.560
 And then it's much worse for Gen Z.

10:02.560 --> 10:07.000
 And then 20% of millennials say that they feel lonely and they also don't have any close

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
 friends.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.080
 And then I think 25 or so, and then 20% would say they don't even have acquaintances.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.080
 And that's in the United States?

10:14.080 --> 10:15.080
 That's in the United States.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.800
 And I'm pretty sure that that's much worse everywhere else.

10:17.800 --> 10:24.280
 Like in the UK, I mean, it was widely tweeted and posted when they were talking about a

10:24.280 --> 10:28.400
 minister of loneliness that they wanted to appoint because four out of 10 people in the

10:28.400 --> 10:29.400
 UK feel lonely.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.400
 Minister of loneliness.

10:30.400 --> 10:35.960
 I think that thing actually exists.

10:35.960 --> 10:41.160
 So yeah, you will die sooner if you are lonely.

10:41.160 --> 10:46.160
 And again, this is only when we're only talking about your perception of loneliness or feeling

10:46.160 --> 10:47.160
 lonely.

10:47.160 --> 10:50.840
 That is not objectively being fully socially isolated.

10:50.840 --> 10:56.480
 However, the combination of being fully socially isolated and not having many connections and

10:56.480 --> 11:00.800
 also feeling lonely, that's pretty much a deadly combination.

11:00.800 --> 11:08.400
 So it strikes me bizarre or strange that this is a wide known fact and then there's really

11:08.400 --> 11:12.120
 no one working really on that because it's like subclinical.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.120
 It's not clinical.

11:13.120 --> 11:17.440
 It's not something that you can, we'll tell your doctor and get a treatment or something.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.800
 Yet it's killing us.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.800
 Yeah.

11:19.800 --> 11:24.440
 So there's a bunch of people trying to evaluate, like try to measure the problem by looking

11:24.440 --> 11:28.200
 at like how social media is affecting loneliness and all that kind of stuff.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.200
 So it's like measurement.

11:29.200 --> 11:33.720
 Like if you look at the field of psychology, they're trying to measure the problem and

11:33.720 --> 11:36.960
 not that many people actually, but some.

11:36.960 --> 11:43.280
 But you're basically saying how many people are trying to solve the problem.

11:43.280 --> 11:48.840
 Like how would you try to solve the problem of loneliness?

11:48.840 --> 11:55.280
 Like if you just stick to humans, uh, I mean, or basically not just the humans, but the

11:55.280 --> 11:57.720
 technology that connects us humans.

11:57.720 --> 12:03.160
 Do you think there's a hope for that technology to do the connection?

12:03.160 --> 12:05.720
 Like I, are you on social media much?

12:05.720 --> 12:12.680
 Unfortunately, do you find yourself like, uh, again, if you sort of introspect about

12:12.680 --> 12:16.960
 how connected you feel to other human beings, how not alone you feel, do you think social

12:16.960 --> 12:23.960
 media makes it better or worse maybe for you personally, or in general, I think it's, it's

12:23.960 --> 12:29.720
 easier to look at some stats and, um, I mean, Gen Z seems to be generation Z seems to be

12:29.720 --> 12:33.440
 much lonelier than millennials in terms of how they report loneliness.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.960
 They're definitely the most connected generation in the world.

12:36.960 --> 12:42.600
 I mean, I still remember life without an iPhone, without Facebook, they don't know that that

12:42.600 --> 12:47.560
 ever existed, uh, or at least don't know how it was.

12:47.560 --> 12:53.900
 So that tells me a little bit about the fact that that might be, um, you know, this hyper

12:53.900 --> 12:58.520
 connected world might actually make people feel lonely, lonelier.

12:58.520 --> 13:02.520
 I don't know exactly what the, what the measurements are around that, but I would say, you know,

13:02.520 --> 13:07.600
 my personal experience, I think it does make you feel a lot lonelier, mostly, yeah, we're

13:07.600 --> 13:08.600
 all super connected.

13:08.600 --> 13:13.720
 Uh, but I think loneliness, the feeling of loneliness doesn't come from not having any

13:13.720 --> 13:15.040
 social connections whatsoever.

13:15.040 --> 13:20.800
 Again, tons of people that are, are in longterm relationships experience bouts of loneliness

13:20.800 --> 13:22.440
 and continued loneliness.

13:22.440 --> 13:28.720
 Um, and it's more the question about the true connection about actually being deeply seen,

13:28.720 --> 13:29.720
 deeply understood.

13:29.720 --> 13:36.480
 Um, and in a way it's also about your relationship with yourself, like in order to not feel lonely,

13:36.480 --> 13:42.160
 you actually need to have a better relationship and feel more connected to yourself than this

13:42.160 --> 13:44.640
 feeling actually starts to go away a little bit.

13:44.640 --> 13:51.120
 And then you, um, open up yourself to actually meeting other people in a very special way.

13:51.120 --> 13:55.400
 Uh, not in just, you know, at a friend on Facebook kind of way.

13:55.400 --> 14:00.040
 So just to briefly touch on it, I mean, do you think it's possible to form that kind

14:00.040 --> 14:08.320
 of connection with AI systems more down the line of some of your work?

14:08.320 --> 14:16.540
 Do you think that's, um, engineering wise, a possibility to alleviate loneliness is not

14:16.540 --> 14:19.280
 with another human, but with an AI system?

14:19.280 --> 14:23.240
 Well, I know that's, that's a fact, that's what we're doing.

14:23.240 --> 14:29.360
 And we see it and we measure that and we see how people start to feel less lonely, um,

14:29.360 --> 14:33.000
 talking to their virtual AI friend.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.640
 So basically a chat bot at the basic level, but it could be more like, do you have, I'm

14:37.640 --> 14:44.920
 not even speaking sort of, uh, about specifics, but do you have a hope, like if you look 50

14:44.920 --> 14:51.640
 years from now, do you have a hope that there's just like AIs that are like optimized for,

14:51.640 --> 14:56.160
 um, let me, let me first start like right now, the way people perceive AI, which is

14:56.160 --> 15:04.360
 recommender systems for Facebook and Twitter, social media, they see AI is basically destroying

15:04.360 --> 15:06.200
 first of all, the fabric of our civilization.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.720
 But second of all, making us more lonely.

15:08.720 --> 15:13.600
 Do you see like a world where it's possible to just have AI systems floating about that

15:13.600 --> 15:18.080
 like make our life less lonely?

15:18.080 --> 15:19.440
 Yeah.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.440
 Make us happy.

15:20.440 --> 15:26.000
 Like are putting good things into the world in terms of our individual lives.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
 Yeah.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.200
 Totally believe in that.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.000
 That's why we're, I'm also working on that.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.200
 Um, I think we need to also make sure that, um, what we're trying to optimize for, we're

15:36.200 --> 15:40.240
 actually measuring and it is a North star metric that we're going after.

15:40.240 --> 15:44.640
 And all of our product and all of our business models are optimized for that because you

15:44.640 --> 15:48.560
 can talk, you know, a lot of products that talk about, um, you know, making you feel

15:48.560 --> 15:50.760
 less lonely or making you feel more connected.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.520
 They're not really measuring that.

15:52.520 --> 15:56.600
 So they don't really know whether their users are actually feeling less lonely in the long

15:56.600 --> 15:58.880
 run or feeling more connected in the long run.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.480
 Um, so I think it's really important to put your measure it.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.480
 Yeah.

16:03.480 --> 16:04.480
 To measure it.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.080
 What's a, what's a good measurement of loneliness?

16:07.080 --> 16:10.900
 Well, so that's something that I'm really interested in.

16:10.900 --> 16:14.920
 How do you measure that people are feeling better or that they're feeling less lonely

16:14.920 --> 16:15.920
 with loneliness?

16:15.920 --> 16:16.920
 There's a scale.

16:16.920 --> 16:21.040
 There's UCLA 20 and UCLA three recently scale, which is basically a questionnaire that you

16:21.040 --> 16:26.660
 fill out and you can see whether in the long run it's improving or not.

16:26.660 --> 16:32.120
 And that, uh, does it capture the momentary feeling of loneliness?

16:32.120 --> 16:35.600
 Does it look in like the past month?

16:35.600 --> 16:38.240
 Like, uh, does it basically self report?

16:38.240 --> 16:43.720
 Does it try to sneak up on you tricky to answer honestly or something like that?

16:43.720 --> 16:46.360
 Well, what's yeah, I'm not familiar with the question.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.840
 It is just asking you a few questions.

16:47.840 --> 16:52.120
 Like how often did you feel, uh, like lonely or how often do you feel connected to other

16:52.120 --> 16:55.360
 people in this last few couple of weeks?

16:55.360 --> 17:01.200
 Um, it's similar to the self report questionnaires for depression, anxiety, like PHQ nine and

17:01.200 --> 17:02.620
 get seven.

17:02.620 --> 17:09.480
 Of course, as any, as any self report questionnaires, that's not necessarily very precise or very

17:09.480 --> 17:14.420
 well measured, but still, if you take a big enough population and you get them through

17:14.420 --> 17:19.440
 these, uh, questionnaires, you can see, you can see a positive dynamic.

17:19.440 --> 17:24.560
 And so you basically, uh, you put people through questionnaires to see like, is this thing

17:24.560 --> 17:28.120
 is our, is what we're creating, making people happier?

17:28.120 --> 17:31.760
 Yeah, we measure, so we measure two outcomes.

17:31.760 --> 17:36.940
 One short term, right after the conversation, we ask people whether this conversation made

17:36.940 --> 17:43.260
 them feel better, worse or same, um, this, this metric right now is at 80%.

17:43.260 --> 17:47.520
 So 80% of all our conversations make people feel better, but I should have done the questionnaire

17:47.520 --> 17:48.520
 with you.

17:48.520 --> 17:53.000
 You feel a lot worse after we've done this conversation.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
 That's actually fascinating.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.980
 I should probably do that, but that's, that's how we do that.

17:57.980 --> 18:05.320
 You should totally and aim for 80% aim to outperform your current state of the art AI

18:05.320 --> 18:09.480
 system in these human conversations.

18:09.480 --> 18:16.080
 So we'll get to your work with replica, but let me continue on the line of absurd questions.

18:16.080 --> 18:22.320
 So you talked about, um, you know, deep connection with the humans, deep connection with AI,

18:22.320 --> 18:23.320
 meaningful connection.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.120
 Let me ask about love.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.360
 People make fun of me cause I talk about love all the time.

18:28.360 --> 18:36.000
 But uh, what, what do you think love is like maybe in the context of, um, a meaningful

18:36.000 --> 18:37.680
 connection with somebody else?

18:37.680 --> 18:47.320
 Do you draw a distinction between love, like friendship and Facebook friends or is it a

18:47.320 --> 18:48.320
 graduate?

18:48.320 --> 18:51.320
 No, it's all the same.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.320
 No.

18:52.320 --> 18:56.240
 Like, is it, is it just a gradual thing or is there something fundamental about us humans

18:56.240 --> 19:05.320
 that seek like a really deep connection, uh, with another human being and what is that?

19:05.320 --> 19:15.680
 What is love Eugenia, I'm going to just enjoy asking you these questions seeing you struggle.

19:15.680 --> 19:16.680
 Thanks.

19:16.680 --> 19:22.160
 Um, well the way I see it, um, and specifically, um, the way it relates to our work and the

19:22.160 --> 19:30.400
 way it was, the way it inspired our work on replica, um, I think one of the biggest and

19:30.400 --> 19:37.200
 the most precious gifts we can give to each other now in 2020 as humans is this gift of

19:37.200 --> 19:42.400
 deep empathetic understanding, the feeling of being deeply seen.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.400
 Like what does that mean?

19:43.400 --> 19:49.200
 Like that you exist, like somebody acknowledging that somebody seeing you for who you actually

19:49.200 --> 19:50.200
 are.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.760
 And that's extremely, extremely rare.

19:51.760 --> 19:59.680
 Um, I think that is that combined with unconditional positive regard, um, belief and trust that

19:59.680 --> 20:05.080
 um, you internally are always inclined for positive growth and believing you in this

20:05.080 --> 20:09.960
 way, letting you be a separate person at the same time.

20:09.960 --> 20:15.880
 And this deep empathetic understanding for me, that's the, that's the combination that

20:15.880 --> 20:21.440
 really creates something special, something that people, when they feel it once, they

20:21.440 --> 20:23.440
 will always long for it again.

20:23.440 --> 20:28.240
 And something that starts huge fundamental changes in people.

20:28.240 --> 20:34.480
 Um, when we see that someone's accepts us so deeply, we start to accept ourselves.

20:34.480 --> 20:41.120
 And um, the paradox is that's when big changes start happening, big fundamental changes in

20:41.120 --> 20:42.120
 people start happening.

20:42.120 --> 20:47.040
 So I think that is the ultimate therapeutic relationship that is, and that might be in

20:47.040 --> 20:50.160
 some way a definition of love.

20:50.160 --> 20:56.520
 So acknowledging that there's a separate person and accepting you for who you are.

20:56.520 --> 21:03.640
 Um, now on a slightly that, and you mentioned therapeutic, that sounds a very, like a very

21:03.640 --> 21:12.920
 healthy view of love, but, uh, is there also like a, like, you know, if we look at heartbreak

21:12.920 --> 21:17.760
 and uh, you know, most love songs are probably about heartbreak, right?

21:17.760 --> 21:25.520
 Is that like the mystery, the tension, the danger, the fear of loss, you know, all of

21:25.520 --> 21:32.040
 that, what people might see in a negative light as like games or whatever, but just,

21:32.040 --> 21:34.440
 just the, the dance of human interaction.

21:34.440 --> 21:35.440
 Yeah.

21:35.440 --> 21:41.460
 Fear of loss and fear of like, you said, you said like once you feel it once, you long

21:41.460 --> 21:46.880
 for it again, but you also, once you feel it once, you might, for many people, they've

21:46.880 --> 21:48.560
 lost it.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.920
 So they fear losing it.

21:49.920 --> 21:50.920
 They feel loss.

21:50.920 --> 21:55.480
 So is that part of it, like you're, you're speaking like beautifully about like the

21:55.480 --> 22:02.520
 positive things, but is it important to be able to, uh, be afraid of losing it from an

22:02.520 --> 22:04.520
 engineering perspective?

22:04.520 --> 22:12.160
 I mean, it's a huge part of it and unfortunately we all, you know, um, face it at some points

22:12.160 --> 22:13.160
 in our lives.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.160
 I mean, I did.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.160
 You want to go into details?

22:15.160 --> 22:18.160
 How'd you get your heartbroken?

22:18.160 --> 22:19.280
 Sure.

22:19.280 --> 22:26.720
 So mine is pretty straight, my story is pretty straightforward, um, there I did have a friend

22:26.720 --> 22:31.800
 that was, you know, that at some point, um, in my twenties became really, really close

22:31.800 --> 22:34.320
 to me and we, we became really close friends.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.520
 Um, well, I grew up pretty lonely.

22:36.520 --> 22:40.120
 So in many ways when I'm building, you know, these, these AI friends, I'm thinking about

22:40.120 --> 22:44.520
 myself when I was 17 writing horrible poetry and you know, in my dial up modem at home

22:44.520 --> 22:49.440
 and, um, you know, and that was the feeling that I grew up with.

22:49.440 --> 22:54.400
 I left, I lived, um, alone for a long time when I was a teenager, where did you go up

22:54.400 --> 22:57.040
 in Moscow and the outskirts of Moscow.

22:57.040 --> 23:01.840
 Um, so I'd just skateboard during the day and come back home and you know, connect to

23:01.840 --> 23:08.640
 the internet and then write horrible poetry and love poems, all sorts of poems, obviously

23:08.640 --> 23:09.640
 love poems.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.360
 I mean, what, what other poetry can you write when you're 17, um, it could be political

23:13.360 --> 23:15.240
 or something, but yeah.

23:15.240 --> 23:19.920
 But that was, you know, that was kind of my fiat, like deeply, um, influenced by Joseph

23:19.920 --> 23:26.880
 Brodsky and like all sorts of sports that, um, every 17 year old will, will be looking,

23:26.880 --> 23:32.000
 you know, looking at and reading, but yeah, that was my, uh, these were my teenage years

23:32.000 --> 23:37.560
 and I just never had a person that I thought would, you know, take me as it is, would accept

23:37.560 --> 23:43.640
 me the way I am, um, and I just thought, you know, working and just doing my thing and

23:43.640 --> 23:47.600
 being angry at the world and being a reporter, I was an investigative reporter working undercover

23:47.600 --> 23:53.680
 and writing about people was my way to connect with, you know, with, with others.

23:53.680 --> 23:57.040
 I was deeply curious about every, everyone else.

23:57.040 --> 24:01.000
 And I thought that, you know, if I, if I go out there, if I write their stories, that

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
 means I'm more connected.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.520
 This is what this podcast as well, by the way, I'm desperate, well, I'm seeking connection

24:07.520 --> 24:08.520
 now.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.520
 I'm just kidding.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.520
 Or am I?

24:10.520 --> 24:11.520
 I don't know.

24:11.520 --> 24:17.840
 So what, wait, reporter, uh, what, how did that make you feel more connected?

24:17.840 --> 24:21.520
 I mean, you're still fundamentally pretty alone,

24:21.520 --> 24:26.160
 But you're always with other people, you know, you're always thinking about what other place

24:26.160 --> 24:27.280
 can I infiltrate?

24:27.280 --> 24:29.880
 What other community can I write about?

24:29.880 --> 24:32.840
 What other phenomenon can I explore?

24:32.840 --> 24:37.560
 And you sort of like a trickster, you know, and like, and, and a mythological character,

24:37.560 --> 24:41.720
 like creature, that's just jumping, uh, between all sorts of different worlds and feel and

24:41.720 --> 24:44.400
 feel sort of okay with in all of them.

24:44.400 --> 24:48.700
 So, um, that was my dream job, by the way, that was like totally what I would have been

24:48.700 --> 24:49.700
 doing.

24:49.700 --> 24:54.380
 Um, if Russia was a different place and a little bit undercover.

24:54.380 --> 24:59.040
 So like you weren't, you were trying to, like you said, mythological creature trying to

24:59.040 --> 25:00.040
 infiltrate.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.840
 So try to be a part of the world.

25:01.840 --> 25:02.840
 What are we talking about?

25:02.840 --> 25:05.400
 What kind of things did you enjoy writing about?

25:05.400 --> 25:08.440
 I'd go work at a strip club or go.

25:08.440 --> 25:09.440
 Awesome.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.440
 Okay.

25:10.440 --> 25:19.800
 Well, I'd go work at a restaurant or just go write about, you know, um, certain phenomenons

25:19.800 --> 25:22.800
 or phenomenons or people in the city.

25:22.800 --> 25:29.400
 And what, uh, sorry to keep interrupting and I'm the worst, I'm a conversationalist.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.160
 What stage of Russia is this?

25:32.160 --> 25:36.880
 What, uh, is this pre Putin, post Putin?

25:36.880 --> 25:38.960
 What was Russia like?

25:38.960 --> 25:43.000
 Pre Putin is really long ago.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
 This is Putin era.

25:44.000 --> 25:49.400
 That's a beginning of two thousands and 2010, 2007, eight, nine, 10.

25:49.400 --> 25:57.200
 What were strip clubs like in Russia and restaurants and culture and people's minds like in that

25:57.200 --> 25:59.160
 early Russia that you were covering?

25:59.160 --> 26:02.400
 In those early two thousands, this was, there was still a lot of hope.

26:02.400 --> 26:11.240
 There were still tons of hope that, um, you know, we're sort of becoming this, uh, Western,

26:11.240 --> 26:12.240
 Westernized society.

26:12.240 --> 26:17.920
 Uh, the restaurants were opening, we were really looking at, you know, um, we're trying,

26:17.920 --> 26:22.880
 we're trying to copy a lot of things from, uh, from the US, from Europe, um, bringing

26:22.880 --> 26:25.600
 all these things and very enthusiastic about that.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.720
 So there was a lot of, you know, stuff going on.

26:27.720 --> 26:33.400
 There was a lot of hope and dream for this, you know, new Moscow that would be similar

26:33.400 --> 26:34.800
 to, I guess, New York.

26:34.800 --> 26:41.620
 I mean, just to give you an idea in, um, year 2000 was the year when we had two, uh, movie

26:41.620 --> 26:47.260
 theaters in Moscow and there was one first coffee house that opened and it was like really

26:47.260 --> 26:48.260
 big deal.

26:48.260 --> 26:51.580
 Uh, by 2010 there were all sorts of things everywhere.

26:51.580 --> 26:55.920
 Almost like a chain, like a Starbucks type of coffee house or like, you mean, oh yeah,

26:55.920 --> 26:56.920
 like a Starbucks.

26:56.920 --> 27:01.120
 I mean, I remember we were reporting on, like, we were writing about the opening of Starbucks.

27:01.120 --> 27:05.240
 I think in 2007 that was one of the biggest things that happened in, you know, in Moscow

27:05.240 --> 27:10.080
 back, back in the time, like, you know, that was worthy of a magazine cover.

27:10.080 --> 27:13.440
 And, uh, that was definitely the, you know, the biggest talk of the time.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.440
 Yeah.

27:14.440 --> 27:15.440
 When was McDonald's?

27:15.440 --> 27:17.560
 Cause I was still in Russia when McDonald's opened.

27:17.560 --> 27:18.560
 That was in the nineties.

27:18.560 --> 27:19.560
 I mean, yeah.

27:19.560 --> 27:20.560
 Oh yeah.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.560
 I remember that very well.

27:21.560 --> 27:22.560
 Yeah.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.560
 Those were long, long lines.

27:23.560 --> 27:27.640
 I think it was 1993 or four, I don't remember.

27:27.640 --> 27:33.600
 Um, actually earlier at that time, did you do, I mean, that was a luxurious outing.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.800
 That was definitely not something you do every day.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.560
 And also the line was at least three hours.

27:37.560 --> 27:40.040
 So if you're going to McDonald's, that is not fast food.

27:40.040 --> 27:44.560
 That is like at least three hours in line and then no one is trying to eat fast after

27:44.560 --> 27:45.560
 that.

27:45.560 --> 27:47.040
 Everyone is like trying to enjoy as much as possible.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.200
 What's your memory of that?

27:50.200 --> 27:52.200
 Oh, it was insane.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.200
 How did it go?

27:53.200 --> 27:54.640
 It was extremely positive.

27:54.640 --> 27:59.080
 It's a small strawberry milkshake and the hamburger and small fries and my mom's there.

27:59.080 --> 28:03.320
 And sometimes I'll just, cause I was really little, they'll just let me run, you know,

28:03.320 --> 28:09.200
 up the kitchen and like cut the line, which is like, you cannot really do that in Russia

28:09.200 --> 28:10.200
 or.

28:10.200 --> 28:17.800
 So like for a lot of people, like a lot of those experiences might seem not very fulfilling,

28:17.800 --> 28:22.360
 you know, like it's on the verge of poverty, I suppose.

28:22.360 --> 28:29.920
 But do you remember all that time fondly, like, cause I do like the first time I drank,

28:29.920 --> 28:36.640
 you know, Coke, you know, all that stuff, right.

28:36.640 --> 28:37.800
 And just, yeah.

28:37.800 --> 28:44.000
 The connection with other human beings in Russia, I remember, I remember it really positively.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.760
 Like how do you remember what the nineties and then the Russia you were covering, just

28:48.760 --> 28:53.400
 the human connections you had with people and the experiences?

28:53.400 --> 28:57.200
 Well, my, my parents were both, both physicists.

28:57.200 --> 29:05.800
 My grandparents were both, well, my grandpa, grandfather was in nuclear physicist, a professor

29:05.800 --> 29:06.840
 at the university.

29:06.840 --> 29:13.700
 My dad worked at Chernobyl when I was born in Chernobyl, analyzing kind of the everything

29:13.700 --> 29:15.260
 after the explosion.

29:15.260 --> 29:19.880
 And then I remember that and they were, so they were making sort of enough money in the

29:19.880 --> 29:20.880
 Soviet union.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.520
 So they were not, you know, extremely poor or anything.

29:23.520 --> 29:28.320
 It was pretty prestigious to be a professor, the Dean and the university.

29:28.320 --> 29:33.800
 And then I remember my grandfather started making a hundred dollars a month after, you

29:33.800 --> 29:35.040
 know, in the nineties.

29:35.040 --> 29:40.020
 So then I remember we started our main line of work would be to go to our little tiny

29:40.020 --> 29:48.560
 country house, get a lot of apples there from apple trees, bring them back to the city and

29:48.560 --> 29:50.880
 sell them in the street.

29:50.880 --> 29:56.000
 So me and my nuclear physicist grandfather were just standing there and he selling those

29:56.000 --> 30:00.680
 apples the whole day, cause that would make you more money than, you know, working at

30:00.680 --> 30:01.740
 the university.

30:01.740 --> 30:07.960
 And then he'll just tell me, try to teach me, you know, something about planets and

30:07.960 --> 30:10.240
 whatever the particles and stuff.

30:10.240 --> 30:14.340
 And, you know, I'm not smart at all, so I could never understand anything, but I was

30:14.340 --> 30:18.000
 interested as a journalist kind of type interested.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
 But that was my memory.

30:19.000 --> 30:25.200
 And, you know, I'm happy that I wasn't, I somehow got spared that I was probably too

30:25.200 --> 30:27.400
 young to remember any of the traumatic stuff.

30:27.400 --> 30:31.860
 So the only thing I really remember had this bootleg that was very traumatic, had this

30:31.860 --> 30:35.760
 bootleg Nintendo, which was called Dandy in Russia.

30:35.760 --> 30:39.280
 So in 1993, there was nothing to eat, like, even if you had any money, you would go to

30:39.280 --> 30:40.800
 the store and there was no food.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.880
 I don't know if you remember that.

30:42.880 --> 30:49.960
 And our friend had a restaurant, like a government, half government owned something restaurant.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.960
 So they always had supplies.

30:51.960 --> 31:00.080
 So he exchanged a big bag of wheat for this Nintendo, the bootleg Nintendo, that I remember

31:00.080 --> 31:05.560
 very fondly, cause I think I was nine or something like that and we're seven.

31:05.560 --> 31:11.480
 Like we just got it and I was playing it and there was this, you know, Dandy TV show.

31:11.480 --> 31:12.480
 Yeah.

31:12.480 --> 31:17.080
 So traumatic in a positive sense, you mean like, like a definitive, well, they took it

31:17.080 --> 31:19.440
 away and gave me a bag of wheat instead.

31:19.440 --> 31:23.720
 And I cried like my eyes out for days and days and days.

31:23.720 --> 31:24.720
 Oh no.

31:24.720 --> 31:28.680
 And then, you know, as a, and my dad said, we're going to like exchange it back in a

31:28.680 --> 31:29.680
 little bit.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.880
 So you keep the little gun, you know, the one that you shoot the ducks with.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.240
 So I'm like, okay, I'm keeping the gun.

31:34.240 --> 31:38.880
 So sometime it's going to come back, but then they exchanged the gun as well for some sugar

31:38.880 --> 31:39.880
 or something.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.520
 I was so pissed.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.840
 I was like, I didn't want to eat for days after that.

31:43.840 --> 31:44.840
 I'm like, I don't want your food.

31:44.840 --> 31:47.640
 Give me my Nintendo back.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.120
 That was extremely traumatic.

31:50.120 --> 31:53.640
 But you know, I was happy that that was my only traumatic experience.

31:53.640 --> 31:57.640
 You know, my dad had to actually go to Chernobyl with a bunch of 20 year olds.

31:57.640 --> 32:01.760
 He was 20 when he went to Chernobyl and that was right after the explosion.

32:01.760 --> 32:03.440
 No one knew anything.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.800
 The whole crew he went with, all of them are dead now.

32:05.800 --> 32:11.760
 I think there was this one guy still, that was still alive for this last few years.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.920
 I think he died a few years ago now.

32:13.920 --> 32:19.360
 My dad somehow luckily got back earlier than everyone else, but just the fact that that

32:19.360 --> 32:21.960
 was the, and I was always like, well, how did they send you?

32:21.960 --> 32:26.280
 I was only, I was just born, you know, you had a newborn talk about paternity leave.

32:26.280 --> 32:29.800
 They were like, but that's who they took because they didn't know whether you would be able

32:29.800 --> 32:31.120
 to have kids when you come back.

32:31.120 --> 32:33.880
 So they took the ones with kids.

32:33.880 --> 32:40.360
 So him with some guys went to, and I'm just thinking of me when I was 20, I was so sheltered

32:40.360 --> 32:42.200
 from any problems whatsoever in life.

32:42.200 --> 32:51.200
 And then my dad, his 21st birthday at the reactor, you like work three hours a day,

32:51.200 --> 32:57.040
 you sleep the rest and, and I, yeah, so I played with a lot of toys from Chernobyl.

32:57.040 --> 33:02.640
 What are your memories of Chernobyl in general, like the bigger context, you know, because

33:02.640 --> 33:09.240
 of that HBO show it's the world's attention turned to it once again, like, what are your

33:09.240 --> 33:10.840
 thoughts about Chernobyl?

33:10.840 --> 33:13.000
 Did Russia screw that one up?

33:13.000 --> 33:18.760
 Like, you know, there's probably a lot of lessons about our modern times with data about

33:18.760 --> 33:20.520
 coronavirus and all that kind of stuff.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.960
 It seems like there's a lot of misinformation.

33:22.960 --> 33:29.720
 There's a lot of people kind of trying to hide whether they screwed something up or

33:29.720 --> 33:35.580
 not, as it's very understandable, it's very human, very wrong, probably, but obviously

33:35.580 --> 33:40.320
 Russia was probably trying to hide that they screwed things up.

33:40.320 --> 33:45.520
 Like, what are your thoughts about that time, personal and general?

33:45.520 --> 33:50.200
 I mean, I was born when the explosion happened.

33:50.200 --> 33:55.120
 So actually a few months after, so of course I don't remember anything apart from the fact

33:55.120 --> 34:02.040
 that my dad would bring me tiny toys, like plastic things that would just go crazy haywire

34:02.040 --> 34:06.360
 when you, you know, put the Geiger thing to it.

34:06.360 --> 34:09.240
 My mom was like, just nuclear about that.

34:09.240 --> 34:13.440
 She was like, what are you bringing, you should not do that.

34:13.440 --> 34:14.440
 She was nuclear.

34:14.440 --> 34:15.440
 Very nice.

34:15.440 --> 34:16.440
 Well done.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.440
 I'm sorry.

34:17.440 --> 34:21.200
 It was, but yeah, but the TV show was just phenomenal.

34:21.200 --> 34:22.760
 The HBO one?

34:22.760 --> 34:28.960
 Yeah, it was definitely, first of all, it's incredible how that was made not by the Russians,

34:28.960 --> 34:37.360
 but someone else, but capturing so well everything about our country.

34:37.360 --> 34:41.160
 It felt a lot more genuine than most of the movies and TV shows that are made now in Russia,

34:41.160 --> 34:43.320
 just so much more genuine.

34:43.320 --> 34:47.800
 And most of my friends in Russia were just in complete awe about the show, but I think

34:47.800 --> 34:48.800
 that...

34:48.800 --> 34:49.800
 How good of a job they did.

34:49.800 --> 34:50.800
 Oh my God, phenomenal.

34:50.800 --> 34:51.800
 But also...

34:51.800 --> 34:52.800
 The apartments, there's something, yeah.

34:52.800 --> 34:53.800
 The set design.

34:53.800 --> 34:58.240
 I mean, Russians can't do that, you know, but you see everything and it's like, wow,

34:58.240 --> 35:00.240
 that's exactly how it was.

35:00.240 --> 35:06.840
 So I don't know, that show, I don't know what to think about that because it's British accents,

35:06.840 --> 35:12.560
 British actors of a person, I forgot who created the show.

35:12.560 --> 35:17.480
 But I remember reading about him and he's not, he doesn't even feel like, like there's

35:17.480 --> 35:19.040
 no Russia in this history.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.400
 No, he did like super bad or something like that.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.400
 Or like, I don't know.

35:22.400 --> 35:23.400
 Yeah, like exactly.

35:23.400 --> 35:28.580
 Whatever that thing about the bachelor party in Vegas, number four and five or something

35:28.580 --> 35:30.080
 were the ones that he worked with.

35:30.080 --> 35:31.080
 Yeah.

35:31.080 --> 35:38.600
 But so he made me feel really sad for some reason that if a person, obviously a genius,

35:38.600 --> 35:46.000
 could go in and just study and just be extreme attention to detail, they can do a good job.

35:46.000 --> 35:52.520
 It made me think like, why don't other people do a good job with this?

35:52.520 --> 35:56.320
 Like about Russia, like there's so little about Russia.

35:56.320 --> 36:02.600
 There's so few good films about the Russian side of World War II.

36:02.600 --> 36:10.560
 I mean, there's so much interesting evil and not, and beautiful moments in the history

36:10.560 --> 36:16.640
 of the 20th century in Russia that it feels like there's not many good films on from the

36:16.640 --> 36:17.640
 Russians.

36:17.640 --> 36:18.640
 You would expect something from the Russians.

36:18.640 --> 36:21.640
 Well, they keep making these propaganda movies now.

36:21.640 --> 36:22.640
 Oh no.

36:22.640 --> 36:23.640
 Unfortunately.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.560
 But yeah, no, Chernobyl was such a perfect TV show.

36:26.560 --> 36:30.720
 I think capturing really well, it's not about like even the set design, which was phenomenal,

36:30.720 --> 36:37.120
 but just capturing all the problems that exist now with the country and like focusing on

36:37.120 --> 36:38.120
 the right things.

36:38.120 --> 36:41.960
 Like if you build the whole country on a lie, that's what's going to happen.

36:41.960 --> 36:47.120
 And that's just this very simple kind of thing.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.960
 Yeah.

36:48.960 --> 36:55.760
 And did you have your dad talked about it to you, like his thoughts on the experience?

36:55.760 --> 36:56.760
 He never talks.

36:56.760 --> 37:02.240
 He's this kind of Russian man that just, my husband who's American and he asked him a

37:02.240 --> 37:06.560
 few times like, you know, Igor, how did you, but why did you say yes?

37:06.560 --> 37:08.420
 Or like, why did you decide to go?

37:08.420 --> 37:10.200
 You could have said no, not go to Chernobyl.

37:10.200 --> 37:14.880
 Why would like a person like, that's what you do.

37:14.880 --> 37:15.880
 You cannot say no.

37:15.880 --> 37:16.880
 Yeah.

37:16.880 --> 37:17.880
 Yeah.

37:17.880 --> 37:21.560
 It's just, it's like a Russian way.

37:21.560 --> 37:22.560
 It's the Russian way.

37:22.560 --> 37:23.560
 Men don't talk that much.

37:23.560 --> 37:24.560
 Nope.

37:24.560 --> 37:27.080
 There's no one upsides for that.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.400
 Yeah, that's the truth.

37:29.400 --> 37:30.400
 Okay.

37:30.400 --> 37:37.320
 So back to post Putin Russia, or maybe we skipped a few steps along the way, but you

37:37.320 --> 37:43.560
 were trying to do, to be a journalist in that time.

37:43.560 --> 37:46.640
 What was, what was Russia like at that time?

37:46.640 --> 37:51.860
 Post you said 2007 Starbucks type of thing.

37:51.860 --> 37:55.560
 What else, what else was Russia like then?

37:55.560 --> 37:56.720
 I think there was just hope.

37:56.720 --> 38:01.840
 There was this big hope that we're going to be, you know, friends with the United States

38:01.840 --> 38:06.600
 and we're going to be friends with Europe and we're just going to be also a country

38:06.600 --> 38:12.720
 like those with, you know, bike lanes and parks and everything's going to be urbanized.

38:12.720 --> 38:16.920
 And again, we're talking about nineties where like people would be shot in the street.

38:16.920 --> 38:21.800
 And it was, I still have a fond memory of going into a movie theater and, you know,

38:21.800 --> 38:22.980
 coming out of it after the movie.

38:22.980 --> 38:28.100
 And the guy that I saw on the stairs was like neither shot, which was, again, it was like

38:28.100 --> 38:30.280
 a thing in the nineties that would be happening.

38:30.280 --> 38:35.400
 People were, you know, people were getting shot here and there, tons of violence, tons

38:35.400 --> 38:40.040
 of you know, just basically mafia mobs on in the streets.

38:40.040 --> 38:44.560
 And then the two thousands were like, you know, things just got cleaned up, oil went

38:44.560 --> 38:50.700
 up and the country started getting a little bit richer, you know, the nineties were so

38:50.700 --> 38:54.960
 grim mostly because the economy was in shambles and oil prices were not high.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.740
 So the country didn't have anything.

38:56.740 --> 39:01.680
 We defaulted in 1998 and the money kept jumping back and forth.

39:01.680 --> 39:05.640
 Like first there were millions of rubbles, then it got like default, you know, then it

39:05.640 --> 39:06.640
 got to like thousands.

39:06.640 --> 39:11.800
 Then it was one rubble was something then again to millions, there's like crazy town.

39:11.800 --> 39:12.960
 That was crazy.

39:12.960 --> 39:19.480
 And then the two thousands were just these years of stability in a way and the country

39:19.480 --> 39:22.680
 getting a little bit richer because of, you know, again, oil and gas.

39:22.680 --> 39:27.040
 And we were starting to, we started to look at specifically in Moscow and St. Petersburg

39:27.040 --> 39:34.600
 to look at other cities in Europe and New York and US and trying to do the same in our

39:34.600 --> 39:38.000
 like small kind of cities, towns there.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.320
 What was, what were your thoughts of Putin at the time?

39:40.320 --> 39:43.480
 Well, in the beginning he was really positive.

39:43.480 --> 39:46.000
 Everyone was very, you know, positive about Putin.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
 He was young.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.560
 Um, it's very energetic.

39:49.560 --> 39:55.960
 He also immediate the shirtless somewhat compared to, well, that was not like way before the

39:55.960 --> 39:56.960
 shirtless era.

39:56.960 --> 39:57.960
 Um, the shirtless era.

39:57.960 --> 39:58.960
 Okay.

39:58.960 --> 39:59.960
 So he didn't start out shirtless.

39:59.960 --> 40:05.720
 When did the shirtless era, it's like the propaganda of riding horse, fishing, 2010,

40:05.720 --> 40:06.720
 11, 12.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.720
 Yeah.

40:07.720 --> 40:08.720
 That's my favorite.

40:08.720 --> 40:14.760
 You know, like people talk about the favorite Beatles, like the, that's my favorite Putin

40:14.760 --> 40:15.760
 is the shirtless Putin.

40:15.760 --> 40:20.960
 Now I remember very, very clearly 1996 where, you know, Americans really helped Russia with

40:20.960 --> 40:27.560
 elections and Yeltsin got reelected, um, thankfully so, uh, because there's a huge threat that

40:27.560 --> 40:29.680
 actually the communists will get back to power.

40:29.680 --> 40:32.680
 Uh, they were a lot more popular.

40:32.680 --> 40:39.660
 And then a lot of American experts, political experts, uh, and campaign experts descended

40:39.660 --> 40:44.360
 on Moscow and helped Yeltsin actually get, get the presidency, the second term for the

40:44.360 --> 40:46.340
 pro, um, the, of the presidency.

40:46.340 --> 40:52.240
 But Yeltsin was not feeling great, you know, in the, by the end of his second term, uh,

40:52.240 --> 40:53.920
 he was, you know, alcoholic.

40:53.920 --> 40:54.920
 He was really old.

40:54.920 --> 40:59.960
 He was falling off, uh, you know, the stages when he, where he was talking.

40:59.960 --> 41:04.560
 Uh, so people were looking for fresh, I think for a fresh face, for someone who's going

41:04.560 --> 41:09.680
 to continue Yeltsin's, uh, work, but who's going to be a lot more energetic and a lot

41:09.680 --> 41:15.480
 more active, young, um, efficient, maybe.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.880
 So that w that's what we all saw in Putin back in the day.

41:17.880 --> 41:22.360
 I, I'd say that everyone, absolutely everyone in Russia in early two thousands who was not

41:22.360 --> 41:25.360
 a communist would be, yeah, Putin's great.

41:25.360 --> 41:26.960
 We have a lot of hopes for him.

41:26.960 --> 41:27.960
 What are your thoughts?

41:27.960 --> 41:34.240
 And I promise we'll get back to, uh, first of all, your love story.

41:34.240 --> 41:40.200
 Second of all, AI, well, what are your thoughts about, um, communism?

41:40.200 --> 41:42.680
 The 20th century, I apologize.

41:42.680 --> 41:46.240
 I'm reading the rise and fall of the third Reich.

41:46.240 --> 41:48.580
 Oh my God.

41:48.580 --> 41:56.660
 So I'm like really steeped into like world war II and Stalin and Hitler and just these

41:56.660 --> 42:00.840
 dramatic personalities that brought so much evil to the world.

42:00.840 --> 42:06.580
 But it's also interesting to politically think about these different systems and what they've

42:06.580 --> 42:08.320
 led to.

42:08.320 --> 42:16.280
 And Russia is one of the sort of beacons of communism in the 20th century.

42:16.280 --> 42:17.840
 What are your thoughts about communism?

42:17.840 --> 42:20.480
 Having experienced it as a political system?

42:20.480 --> 42:24.360
 I mean, I have only experienced it a little bit, but mostly through stories and through,

42:24.360 --> 42:29.320
 you know, seeing my parents and my grandparents who lived through that, I mean, it was horrible.

42:29.320 --> 42:31.120
 It was just plain horrible.

42:31.120 --> 42:33.360
 It was just awful.

42:33.360 --> 42:40.960
 You think it's, there's something, I mean, it sounds nice on paper.

42:40.960 --> 42:47.840
 There's a, so like the drawbacks of capitalism is that, uh, you know, eventually there is,

42:47.840 --> 42:51.160
 it's a, it's the point of like a slippery slope.

42:51.160 --> 42:59.040
 Eventually it creates, uh, you know, the rich get richer, it creates a disparity, like inequality

42:59.040 --> 43:02.520
 of, um, wealth inequality.

43:02.520 --> 43:09.080
 If like, you know, I guess it's hypothetical at this point, but eventually capitalism leads

43:09.080 --> 43:13.720
 to humongous inequality and that that's, you know, some people argue that that's a source

43:13.720 --> 43:17.720
 of unhappiness is it's not like absolute wealth of people.

43:17.720 --> 43:21.240
 It's the fact that there's a lot of people much richer than you.

43:21.240 --> 43:25.300
 There's a feeling of like, that's where unhappiness can come from.

43:25.300 --> 43:32.960
 So the idea of, of communism or these sort of Marxism is, uh, is, is not allowing that

43:32.960 --> 43:37.800
 kind of slippery slope, but then you see the actual implementations of it and stuff seems

43:37.800 --> 43:42.400
 to be, seems to go wrong very badly.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.880
 What do you think that is?

43:43.880 --> 43:46.680
 Why does it go wrong?

43:46.680 --> 43:47.680
 What is it about human nature?

43:47.680 --> 43:54.740
 If we look at Chernobyl, you know, those kinds of bureaucracies that were constructed.

43:54.740 --> 44:00.280
 Is there something like, do you think about this much of like why it goes wrong?

44:00.280 --> 44:05.320
 Well, there's no one was really like, it's not that everyone was equal.

44:05.320 --> 44:12.160
 Obviously the, you know, the, the government and everyone close to that were the bosses.

44:12.160 --> 44:17.740
 So it's not like fully, I guess, uh, this dream of equal life.

44:17.740 --> 44:24.720
 So then I guess the, the situation that we had in, you know, the Russia had in the Soviet

44:24.720 --> 44:30.720
 union, it was more, it's a bunch of really poor people without any way to make any, you

44:30.720 --> 44:37.640
 know, significant fortune or build anything living constant, um, under constant surveillance,

44:37.640 --> 44:38.920
 surveillance from other people.

44:38.920 --> 44:45.800
 Like you can't even, you know, uh, do anything that's not fully approved by the dictatorship

44:45.800 --> 44:46.800
 basically.

44:46.800 --> 44:53.080
 Otherwise your neighbor will write a letter and you'll go to jail, absolute absence of

44:53.080 --> 44:54.080
 actual law.

44:54.080 --> 44:55.080
 Yeah.

44:55.080 --> 44:57.880
 It's a constant state of fear.

44:57.880 --> 45:00.000
 You didn't own any, own anything.

45:00.000 --> 45:05.760
 It didn't, you know, the, you couldn't go travel, you couldn't read anything, uh, Western

45:05.760 --> 45:11.840
 or you couldn't make a career really, unless you're working in the, uh, military complex.

45:11.840 --> 45:15.560
 Um, which is why most of the scientists were so well regarded.

45:15.560 --> 45:20.580
 I come from, you know, both my dad and my mom come from families of scientists and they,

45:20.580 --> 45:23.280
 they were really well regarded as you, as you know, obviously.

45:23.280 --> 45:29.960
 Because the state wanted, I mean, cause there's a lot of value to them being well regarded.

45:29.960 --> 45:34.800
 Because they were developing things that could be used in, in the military.

45:34.800 --> 45:35.800
 So that was very important.

45:35.800 --> 45:36.800
 That was the main investment.

45:36.800 --> 45:40.320
 Um, but it was miserable, it was all miserable.

45:40.320 --> 45:43.640
 That's why, you know, a lot of Russians now live in the state of constant PTSD.

45:43.640 --> 45:48.360
 That's why we, you know, want to buy, buy, buy, buy, buy and definitely if as soon as

45:48.360 --> 45:53.000
 we have the opportunity, you know, we just got to it finally that we can, you know, own

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
 things.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.560
 You know, I remember the time that we got our first yogurts and that was the biggest

45:57.560 --> 45:58.560
 deal in the world.

45:58.560 --> 46:03.920
 It was already in the nineties, by the way, I mean, what was your like, favorite food

46:03.920 --> 46:12.600
 where it was like, well, like this is possible, Oh, fruit, because we only had apples, bananas

46:12.600 --> 46:13.600
 and whatever.

46:13.600 --> 46:17.960
 And you know, whatever watermelons, whatever, you know, people would grow in the Soviet

46:17.960 --> 46:18.960
 Union.

46:18.960 --> 46:24.240
 There were no pineapples or papaya or mango, like you've never seen those fruit things.

46:24.240 --> 46:27.480
 Like those were so ridiculously good.

46:27.480 --> 46:32.760
 And obviously you could not get any like strawberries in winter or anything that's not, you know,

46:32.760 --> 46:33.760
 seasonal.

46:33.760 --> 46:34.760
 Um, so that was a really big deal.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.240
 I've seen all these fruit things.

46:36.240 --> 46:37.240
 Yeah.

46:37.240 --> 46:38.240
 Me too.

46:38.240 --> 46:39.240
 Actually.

46:39.240 --> 46:40.240
 I don't know.

46:40.240 --> 46:44.160
 I think I have a, like, I don't think I have any too many demons, uh, or like addictions

46:44.160 --> 46:47.960
 or so on, but I think I've developed an unhealthy relationship with fruit.

46:47.960 --> 46:51.880
 I still struggle with, Oh, you can get any type of fruit, right?

46:51.880 --> 46:57.880
 If you get like also these weird fruit, fruits like dragon fruit or something or all kinds

46:57.880 --> 47:02.080
 of like different types of peaches, like cherries were killer for me.

47:02.080 --> 47:06.720
 I know, I know you say like we had bananas and so on, but I don't remember having the

47:06.720 --> 47:07.720
 kind of banana.

47:07.720 --> 47:12.920
 Like when I first came to this country, the amount of banana, I like literally got fat

47:12.920 --> 47:17.520
 on bananas, like the amount, Oh yeah, for sure.

47:17.520 --> 47:18.520
 They were delicious.

47:18.520 --> 47:24.160
 And like cherries, the kind, like just the quality of the food, I was like, this is capitalism.

47:24.160 --> 47:25.160
 This is delicious.

47:25.160 --> 47:26.160
 Yeah.

47:26.160 --> 47:27.160
 I am.

47:27.160 --> 47:28.160
 Yeah.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.160
 It's funny.

47:29.160 --> 47:30.160
 It's funny.

47:30.160 --> 47:31.160
 Yeah.

47:31.160 --> 47:36.800
 Like it's, it's funny to read.

47:36.800 --> 47:44.280
 I don't know what to think of it, of, um, it's funny to think how an idea that's just

47:44.280 --> 47:49.720
 written on paper, when carried out amongst millions of people, how that gets actually

47:49.720 --> 47:58.640
 when it becomes reality, what it actually looks like, uh, sorry, but the, uh, been studying

47:58.640 --> 48:04.040
 Hitler a lot recently and, uh, going through Mein Kampf.

48:04.040 --> 48:07.960
 He pretty much wrote out of Mein Kampf everything he was going to do.

48:07.960 --> 48:13.480
 Unfortunately, most leaders, including Stalin didn't read the, read it, but it's, it's kind

48:13.480 --> 48:16.140
 of terrifying and I don't know.

48:16.140 --> 48:21.120
 And amazing in some sense that you can have some words on paper and they can be brought

48:21.120 --> 48:26.560
 to life and they can either inspire the world or they can destroy the world.

48:26.560 --> 48:32.480
 And uh, yeah, there's a lot of lessons to study in history that I think people don't

48:32.480 --> 48:35.520
 study enough now.

48:35.520 --> 48:40.000
 One of the things I'm hoping with, I've been practicing Russian a little bit.

48:40.000 --> 48:49.640
 I'm hoping to sort of find, rediscover the, uh, the beauty and the terror of Russian history

48:49.640 --> 48:55.360
 through this stupid podcast by talking to a few people.

48:55.360 --> 48:58.400
 So anyway, I just feel like so much was forgotten.

48:58.400 --> 48:59.400
 So much was forgotten.

48:59.400 --> 49:04.960
 I'll probably, I'm going to try to convince myself to, um, you're a super busy and super

49:04.960 --> 49:11.000
 important person when I'm going to, I'm going to try to befriend you to, uh, to try to become

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
 a better Russian.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.160
 Cause I feel like I'm a shitty Russian.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.160
 Not that busy.

49:15.160 --> 49:19.040
 So I can totally be your Russian Sherpa.

49:19.040 --> 49:20.920
 Yeah.

49:20.920 --> 49:28.160
 But love, you were, you were talking about your early days of, uh, being a little bit

49:28.160 --> 49:33.240
 alone and finding a connection with the world through being a journalist.

49:33.240 --> 49:36.200
 Where did love come into that?

49:36.200 --> 49:42.680
 I guess finding for the first time, um, some friends, it's very, you know, simple story.

49:42.680 --> 49:48.920
 Some friends that all of a sudden we, I guess we were the same, you know, the same, at the

49:48.920 --> 49:55.400
 same place with our lives, um, we're 25, 26, I guess.

49:55.400 --> 50:00.400
 And, um, somehow remember, and we just got really close and somehow remember this one

50:00.400 --> 50:06.640
 day where, um, it's one day and, you know, in summer that we just stayed out, um, outdoor

50:06.640 --> 50:11.240
 the whole night and just talked and for some unknown reason, it just felt for the first

50:11.240 --> 50:17.000
 time that someone could, you know, see me for who I am and it just felt extremely like

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
 extremely good.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.520
 And I, you know, we fell asleep outside and just talking and it was raining.

50:22.520 --> 50:28.440
 It was beautiful, you know, sunrise and it's really cheesy, but, um, at the same time,

50:28.440 --> 50:33.840
 we just became friends in a way that I've never been friends with anyone else before.

50:33.840 --> 50:38.360
 And I do remember that before and after that you sort of have this unconditional family

50:38.360 --> 50:43.440
 sort of, um, and it gives you tons of power.

50:43.440 --> 50:50.680
 It just basically gives you this tremendous power to do things in your life and to, um,

50:50.680 --> 50:53.920
 change positively on many different levels.

50:53.920 --> 50:56.720
 Power because you could be yourself.

50:56.720 --> 51:01.760
 At least you know that some somewhere you can be just yourself, like you don't need

51:01.760 --> 51:07.920
 to pretend, you don't need to be, you know, um, great at work or tell some story or sell

51:07.920 --> 51:10.280
 yourself in somewhere or another.

51:10.280 --> 51:17.200
 And so it became this really close friends and, um, in a way, um, I started a company

51:17.200 --> 51:20.120
 cause he had a startup and I felt like I kind of want to start up too.

51:20.120 --> 51:21.120
 It felt really cool.

51:21.120 --> 51:25.720
 I don't know what I'm going to, what I would really do, but I felt like I kind of need

51:25.720 --> 51:26.720
 a startup.

51:26.720 --> 51:27.720
 Okay.

51:27.720 --> 51:32.040
 So that's, so that pulled you in to the startup world.

51:32.040 --> 51:33.320
 Yeah.

51:33.320 --> 51:35.680
 And then, yeah.

51:35.680 --> 51:38.400
 And then this, uh, closest friend of mine died.

51:38.400 --> 51:42.720
 We actually moved here to San Francisco together and then we went back for a visa to Moscow

51:42.720 --> 51:48.520
 and, uh, we lived together, we're roommates and we came back and, um, he got hit by a

51:48.520 --> 51:54.520
 car right in front of Kremlin on a, you know, next to the river, um, and died the same day

51:54.520 --> 51:58.440
 I met this is the Roman hospital.

51:58.440 --> 52:05.720
 So, and you've moved to America at that point, at that point I was, what about him?

52:05.720 --> 52:06.720
 What about Roman?

52:06.720 --> 52:07.720
 Him too.

52:07.720 --> 52:08.720
 He actually moved first.

52:08.720 --> 52:11.960
 So I was always sort of trying to do what he was doing, so I didn't like that he was

52:11.960 --> 52:15.580
 already here and I was still, you know, in Moscow and we weren't hanging out together

52:15.580 --> 52:16.580
 all the time.

52:16.580 --> 52:18.080
 So was he in San Francisco?

52:18.080 --> 52:20.540
 Yeah, we were roommates.

52:20.540 --> 52:23.400
 So he just visited Moscow for a little bit.

52:23.400 --> 52:28.920
 We went back for, for our visas, we had to get a stamp in our passport for our work visas

52:28.920 --> 52:34.720
 and the embassy was taking a little longer, so we stayed there for a couple of weeks.

52:34.720 --> 52:35.720
 What happened?

52:35.720 --> 52:40.200
 How did he, so how, how did he, uh, how did he die?

52:40.200 --> 52:45.280
 Um, he was crossing the street and the car was going really fast and way over the speed

52:45.280 --> 52:51.520
 limit and just didn't stop on the, on the pedestrian cross on the zebra and just ran

52:51.520 --> 52:52.520
 over him.

52:52.520 --> 52:53.520
 When was this?

52:53.520 --> 52:59.320
 It was in 2015 on 28th of November, so it was a long ago now.

52:59.320 --> 53:06.120
 Um, but at the time, you know, I was 29, so for me it was, um, the first kind of meaningful

53:06.120 --> 53:07.760
 death in my life.

53:07.760 --> 53:12.840
 Um, you know, both sets of, I had both sets of grandparents at the time.

53:12.840 --> 53:18.880
 I didn't see anyone so close die and death sort of existed, but as a concept, but definitely

53:18.880 --> 53:24.720
 not as something that would be, you know, happening to us anytime soon and specifically

53:24.720 --> 53:25.720
 our friends.

53:25.720 --> 53:29.880
 Cause we were, you know, we're still in our twenties or early thirties and it still, it

53:29.880 --> 53:36.120
 still felt like the whole life is, you know, you could still dream about ridiculous things

53:36.120 --> 53:37.120
 different.

53:37.120 --> 53:43.840
 Um, so that was, it was just really, really abrupt I'd say.

53:43.840 --> 53:49.680
 What did it feel like to, uh, to lose him, like that feeling of loss?

53:49.680 --> 53:53.120
 You talked about the feeling of love, having power.

53:53.120 --> 53:57.520
 What is the feeling of loss, if you like?

53:57.520 --> 54:04.720
 Well in Buddhism, there's this concept of Samaya where something really like huge happens

54:04.720 --> 54:07.160
 and then you can see very clearly.

54:07.160 --> 54:13.320
 Um, I think that, that was it like basically something changed so, changed me so much in

54:13.320 --> 54:19.240
 such a short period of time that I could just see really, really clearly what mattered or

54:19.240 --> 54:20.240
 what not.

54:20.240 --> 54:25.800
 Well, I definitely saw that whatever I was doing at work didn't matter at all and some

54:25.800 --> 54:26.800
 of the things.

54:26.800 --> 54:31.400
 And, um, it was just this big realization when it's this very, very clear vision of

54:31.400 --> 54:35.280
 what life's about.

54:35.280 --> 54:37.280
 You still miss him today?

54:37.280 --> 54:40.360
 Yeah, for sure.

54:40.360 --> 54:41.840
 For sure.

54:41.840 --> 54:47.360
 He was just this constant, I think it was, he was really important for, for me and for

54:47.360 --> 54:53.120
 our friends for many different reasons and, um, I think one of them being that we didn't

54:53.120 --> 54:58.160
 just say goodbye to him, but we sort of said goodbye to our youth in a way.

54:58.160 --> 55:02.400
 It was like the end of an era and it's on so many different levels.

55:02.400 --> 55:08.720
 The end of Moscow as we knew it, the end of, you know, us living through our twenties and

55:08.720 --> 55:11.600
 kind of dreaming about the future.

55:11.600 --> 55:17.920
 Do you remember like last several conversations, is there moments with him that stick out that

55:17.920 --> 55:22.720
 kind of haunt you and you're just when you think about him?

55:22.720 --> 55:28.920
 Yeah, well his last year here in San Francisco, he was pretty depressed for as his startup

55:28.920 --> 55:32.600
 was not going really anywhere and he wanted to do something else.

55:32.600 --> 55:39.880
 He wanted to do build, he played with toy, like played with a bunch of ideas, but the

55:39.880 --> 55:44.680
 last one he had was around, um, building a startup around death.

55:44.680 --> 55:52.280
 So having, um, he applied to Y Combinator with a video that, you know, I had on my computer

55:52.280 --> 55:57.760
 and it was all about, you know, disrupting death, thinking about new cemeteries, uh,

55:57.760 --> 56:03.400
 more biologically, like things that could be better biologically for, for humans.

56:03.400 --> 56:12.800
 And at the same time, having those, um, digital avatars, this kind of AI avatars that would

56:12.800 --> 56:15.920
 store all the memory about a person that he could interact with.

56:15.920 --> 56:16.920
 What year was this?

56:16.920 --> 56:17.920
 2015.

56:17.920 --> 56:19.920
 Well, right before his death.

56:19.920 --> 56:23.760
 So it was like a couple of months before that he recorded that video.

56:23.760 --> 56:28.180
 And so I found out my computer when, um, it was in our living room.

56:28.180 --> 56:33.080
 He never got in, but, um, he was thinking about a lot somehow.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.240
 Does it have the digital avatar idea?

56:35.240 --> 56:36.240
 Yeah.

56:36.240 --> 56:37.240
 That's so interesting.

56:37.240 --> 56:42.160
 Well, he just says, well, that's in his hit is the pitch has this idea and he'll, he talks

56:42.160 --> 56:45.960
 about like, I want to rethink how people grieve and how people talk about death.

56:45.960 --> 56:48.960
 Why was he interested in this?

56:48.960 --> 56:56.000
 Is it, maybe someone who's depressed is like naturally inclined thinking about that.

56:56.000 --> 57:00.800
 But I just felt, you know, this year in San Francisco, we just had so much, um, I was

57:00.800 --> 57:01.800
 going through a hard time.

57:01.800 --> 57:07.940
 And we were definitely, I was trying to make him just happy somehow to make him feel better.

57:07.940 --> 57:13.840
 And it felt like, you know, this, um, I dunno, I just felt like I was taking care of him

57:13.840 --> 57:17.000
 a lot and he almost started to feel better.

57:17.000 --> 57:23.920
 And then that happened and I dunno, I just felt, I just felt lonely again, I guess.

57:23.920 --> 57:28.440
 And that was, you know, coming back to San Francisco in December or help, you know, helped

57:28.440 --> 57:33.680
 organize the funeral, help help his parents and I came back here and it was a really lonely

57:33.680 --> 57:38.520
 apartment, a bunch of his clothes everywhere and Christmas time.

57:38.520 --> 57:42.280
 And I remember I had a board meeting with my investors and I just couldn't talk about

57:42.280 --> 57:44.960
 like, I had to pretend everything's okay.

57:44.960 --> 57:47.360
 And you know, I'm just working on this company.

57:47.360 --> 57:55.360
 Um, yeah, it was definitely very, very tough, tough time.

57:55.360 --> 58:00.160
 Do you think about your own mortality?

58:00.160 --> 58:06.900
 You said, uh, you know, we're young, the, the, the, the possibility of doing all kinds

58:06.900 --> 58:12.900
 of crazy things is still out there, is still before us, but, uh, it can end any moment.

58:12.900 --> 58:17.640
 Do you think about your own ending at any moment?

58:17.640 --> 58:23.320
 Unfortunately, I think about way too, about it way too much.

58:23.320 --> 58:27.800
 Somehow after Roman, like every year after that, I started losing people that I really

58:27.800 --> 58:28.800
 love.

58:28.800 --> 58:34.640
 I lost my grandfather the next year, my, you know, the, the person who would explain to

58:34.640 --> 58:41.360
 me, you know, what the universe is made of while selling apples and then I lost another

58:41.360 --> 58:46.680
 close friend of mine and, um, and it just made me very scared.

58:46.680 --> 58:48.520
 I have tons of fear about, about that.

58:48.520 --> 58:54.760
 That's what makes me not fall asleep oftentimes and just go in loops and, um, and then as

58:54.760 --> 59:02.520
 my therapist, you know, recommended to me, I open up, uh, some nice calming images with

59:02.520 --> 59:06.680
 the voiceover and it calms me down for sleep.

59:06.680 --> 59:07.680
 Yeah.

59:07.680 --> 59:08.680
 I'm really scared of death.

59:08.680 --> 59:15.000
 This is a big, I definitely have tons of, I guess, some pretty big trauma about it and,

59:15.000 --> 59:17.300
 um, still working through.

59:17.300 --> 59:22.920
 There's a philosopher, Ernest Becker, who wrote a book, um, Denial of Death.

59:22.920 --> 59:25.600
 I'm not sure if you're familiar with any of those folks.

59:25.600 --> 59:32.320
 Um, there's a, in psychology, a whole field called terror management theory.

59:32.320 --> 59:36.240
 Sheldon, who's just done the podcast, he wrote the book.

59:36.240 --> 59:44.720
 He was the, we talked for four hours about death, uh, fear of death, but his, his whole

59:44.720 --> 59:52.160
 idea is that, um, Ernest Becker, I think I find this idea really compelling is, uh, that

59:52.160 --> 1:00:00.640
 everything human beings have created, like our whole motivation in life is to, uh, create

1:00:00.640 --> 1:00:11.640
 like escape death is to try to, um, construct an illusion of, um, that we're somehow immortal.

1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:21.040
 So like everything around us, this room, your startup, your dreams, all everything you do

1:00:21.040 --> 1:00:30.460
 is a kind of, um, creation of a brain unlike any other mammal or species is able to be

1:00:30.460 --> 1:00:35.180
 cognizant of the fact that it ends for us.

1:00:35.180 --> 1:00:40.540
 I think, so, you know, there's this, the question of like the meaning of life that, you know,

1:00:40.540 --> 1:00:44.260
 you look at like what drives us, uh, humans.

1:00:44.260 --> 1:00:50.060
 And when I read Ernest Becker that I highly recommend people read is the first time I,

1:00:50.060 --> 1:00:54.160
 this scene, it felt like this is the right thing at the core.

1:00:54.160 --> 1:00:57.980
 Uh, Sheldon's work is called warm at the core.

1:00:57.980 --> 1:01:05.240
 So he's saying it's, I think it's, uh, William James he's quoting or whoever is like the,

1:01:05.240 --> 1:01:07.760
 the thing, what is at the core of it all?

1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:12.540
 Whether there's like love, you know, Jesus might talk about like love is at the core

1:01:12.540 --> 1:01:13.540
 of everything.

1:01:13.540 --> 1:01:15.640
 I don't, you know, that's the open question.

1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:19.980
 What's at the, you know, it's turtles, turtles, but it can't be turtles all the way down.

1:01:19.980 --> 1:01:22.300
 What's what's at the, at the bottom.

1:01:22.300 --> 1:01:30.980
 And, uh, Ernest Becker says the fear of death and the way, in fact, uh, cause you said therapist

1:01:30.980 --> 1:01:36.860
 and calming images, his whole idea is, um, you know, we, we want to bring that fear of

1:01:36.860 --> 1:01:43.900
 death as close as possible to the surface because it's, um, and like meditate on that.

1:01:43.900 --> 1:01:49.820
 Uh, and, and use the clarity of vision that provides to, uh, you know, to live a more

1:01:49.820 --> 1:01:58.580
 fulfilling life, to, um, to live a more honest life, to, to discover, you know, there's something

1:01:58.580 --> 1:02:05.500
 about, you know, being cognizant of the finiteness of it all that might result in, um, in the

1:02:05.500 --> 1:02:07.580
 most fulfilling life.

1:02:07.580 --> 1:02:10.500
 So that's the, that's the dual of what you're saying.

1:02:10.500 --> 1:02:15.180
 Cause you kind of said, it's like, I unfortunately think about it too much.

1:02:15.180 --> 1:02:20.020
 It's a question whether it's good to think about it because I, I've, um, again, I talk

1:02:20.020 --> 1:02:23.260
 about way too much about love and probably death.

1:02:23.260 --> 1:02:29.620
 And when I ask people, friends, which is why I probably don't have many friends, are you

1:02:29.620 --> 1:02:30.820
 afraid of death?

1:02:30.820 --> 1:02:35.020
 I think most people say they're not.

1:02:35.020 --> 1:02:41.700
 Whether they say they're, um, they're afraid, you know, it's kind of almost like they see

1:02:41.700 --> 1:02:45.980
 death as this kind of like, uh, a paper deadline or something.

1:02:45.980 --> 1:02:50.020
 And they're afraid not to finish the paper before the paper, like, like I'm afraid not

1:02:50.020 --> 1:02:57.540
 to finish, um, the goals I have, but it feels like they're not actually realizing that this

1:02:57.540 --> 1:03:04.340
 thing ends, like really realizing, like really thinking as Nietzsche and all these philosophy,

1:03:04.340 --> 1:03:13.740
 like thinking deeply about it, like, uh, the very thing that, you know, um, like when you

1:03:13.740 --> 1:03:18.500
 think deeply about something, you can just, you can realize that you haven't actually

1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:20.500
 thought about it.

1:03:20.500 --> 1:03:22.660
 Uh, yeah.

1:03:22.660 --> 1:03:28.500
 And I, and when I think about death, it's like, um, it can be, it's terrifying.

1:03:28.500 --> 1:03:34.000
 If it feels like stepping outside into the cold or it's freezing and then I have to like

1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.820
 hurry back inside or it's warm.

1:03:36.820 --> 1:03:43.180
 Uh, but like, I think there's something valuable about stepping out there into the freezing

1:03:43.180 --> 1:03:44.180
 cold.

1:03:44.180 --> 1:03:45.180
 Definitely.

1:03:45.180 --> 1:03:52.820
 When I talk to my mentor about it, he always, uh, tells me, well, what dies?

1:03:52.820 --> 1:04:00.700
 There's nothing there that can die, but I guess that requires, um, well in, in Buddhism,

1:04:00.700 --> 1:04:05.240
 one of the concepts that are really hard to grasp and that people spend all their lives

1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:12.420
 meditating on would be Anatta, which is the concept of non, not self and kind of thinking

1:04:12.420 --> 1:04:15.260
 that, you know, if you're not your thoughts, which you're obviously not your thoughts because

1:04:15.260 --> 1:04:20.980
 you can observe them and not your emotions and not your body, then what is this?

1:04:20.980 --> 1:04:27.580
 And if you go really far, then finally you see that there's not self, there's this concept

1:04:27.580 --> 1:04:28.580
 of not self.

1:04:28.580 --> 1:04:32.260
 So once you get there, how can that actually die?

1:04:32.260 --> 1:04:33.260
 What is dying?

1:04:33.260 --> 1:04:34.260
 Right.

1:04:34.260 --> 1:04:38.900
 You're just a bunch of molecules, stardust.

1:04:38.900 --> 1:04:44.300
 But that is very, um, you know, very advanced, um, spiritual work for me.

1:04:44.300 --> 1:04:47.100
 I'm definitely just, definitely not.

1:04:47.100 --> 1:04:48.100
 Oh my God.

1:04:48.100 --> 1:04:50.740
 No, I have, uh, I think it's very, very useful.

1:04:50.740 --> 1:04:56.500
 It's just the fact that maybe being so afraid is not useful and mine is more, I'm just terrified.

1:04:56.500 --> 1:04:58.300
 Like it's really makes me, um,

1:04:58.300 --> 1:04:59.300
 On a personal level.

1:04:59.300 --> 1:05:00.300
 On a personal level.

1:05:00.300 --> 1:05:01.300
 I'm terrified.

1:05:01.300 --> 1:05:02.300
 How do you overcome that?

1:05:02.300 --> 1:05:03.300
 I don't.

1:05:03.300 --> 1:05:04.300
 I'm still trying to.

1:05:04.300 --> 1:05:05.300
 Have pleasant images?

1:05:05.300 --> 1:05:20.540
 Well, pleasant images get me to sleep and then during the day I can distract myself with

1:05:20.540 --> 1:05:24.460
 other things, like talking to you.

1:05:24.460 --> 1:05:26.740
 I'm glad we're both doing the same exact thing.

1:05:26.740 --> 1:05:27.740
 Okay, good.

1:05:27.740 --> 1:05:39.540
 Is there other, like, is there moments since you've, uh, lost Roman that you had like moments

1:05:39.540 --> 1:05:47.980
 of like bliss and like that you've forgotten that you have achieved that Buddhist like

1:05:47.980 --> 1:05:52.380
 level of like what can possibly die.

1:05:52.380 --> 1:06:02.020
 I'm part like, uh, losing yourself in the moment, in the ticking time of like this universe

1:06:02.020 --> 1:06:06.980
 and you're just part of it for a brief moment and just enjoying it.

1:06:06.980 --> 1:06:08.260
 Well that goes hand in hand.

1:06:08.260 --> 1:06:13.940
 I remember I think a day or two after he died, we went to finally get his password out of

1:06:13.940 --> 1:06:19.340
 the embassy and we're driving around Moscow and it was, you know, December, which is usually

1:06:19.340 --> 1:06:25.420
 there's never a sun in Moscow in December and somehow it was an extremely sunny day

1:06:25.420 --> 1:06:30.700
 and we were driving with a close friend.

1:06:30.700 --> 1:06:35.420
 And I remember feeling for the first time maybe this just moment of incredible clarity

1:06:35.420 --> 1:06:45.860
 and somehow happiness, not like happy happiness, but happiness and just feeling that, you know,

1:06:45.860 --> 1:06:49.820
 I know what the universe is sort of about, whether it's good or bad.

1:06:49.820 --> 1:06:50.820
 And it wasn't a sad feeling.

1:06:50.820 --> 1:06:56.120
 It was probably the most beautiful feeling that you can ever achieve.

1:06:56.120 --> 1:07:03.260
 And you can only get it when something, oftentimes when something traumatic like that happens.

1:07:03.260 --> 1:07:07.040
 But also if you just, you really spend a lot of time meditating and looking at the nature

1:07:07.040 --> 1:07:09.900
 doing something that really gets you there.

1:07:09.900 --> 1:07:14.460
 But once you're there, I think when you, uh, summit a mountain, a really hard mountain,

1:07:14.460 --> 1:07:16.100
 you inevitably get there.

1:07:16.100 --> 1:07:18.500
 That's just a way to get to the state.

1:07:18.500 --> 1:07:24.140
 But once you're on this, in this state, um, you can do really big things.

1:07:24.140 --> 1:07:25.140
 I think.

1:07:25.140 --> 1:07:26.140
 Yeah.

1:07:26.140 --> 1:07:28.100
 Sucks it doesn't last forever.

1:07:28.100 --> 1:07:32.460
 So Bukowski talked about like, love is a fog.

1:07:32.460 --> 1:07:38.500
 Like it's a, when you wake up in the morning, it's, it's there, but it eventually dissipates.

1:07:38.500 --> 1:07:40.460
 It's really sad.

1:07:40.460 --> 1:07:41.460
 Nothing lasts forever.

1:07:41.460 --> 1:07:46.620
 But I definitely like doing this pushup and running thing.

1:07:46.620 --> 1:07:51.100
 There's moments at a couple of moments, like I'm not a crier.

1:07:51.100 --> 1:07:52.100
 I don't cry.

1:07:52.100 --> 1:07:59.100
 But there's moments where I was like facedown on the carpet, like with tears in my eyes

1:07:59.100 --> 1:08:00.100
 is interesting.

1:08:00.100 --> 1:08:05.100
 And then that, that complete, like, uh, there's a lot of demons.

1:08:05.100 --> 1:08:07.740
 I've got demons had to face them.

1:08:07.740 --> 1:08:09.560
 Funny how running makes you face your demons.

1:08:09.560 --> 1:08:16.580
 But at the same time, the flip side of that, there's a few moments where I was in bliss

1:08:16.580 --> 1:08:19.420
 and all of it alone, which is funny.

1:08:19.420 --> 1:08:20.420
 That's beautiful.

1:08:20.420 --> 1:08:27.060
 I like that, but definitely pushing yourself physically one of it for sure.

1:08:27.060 --> 1:08:28.060
 Yeah.

1:08:28.060 --> 1:08:29.060
 Yeah.

1:08:29.060 --> 1:08:34.020
 Like you said, I mean, you were speaking as a metaphor of Mount Everest, but it also works

1:08:34.020 --> 1:08:39.580
 like literally, I think physical endeavor somehow.

1:08:39.580 --> 1:08:40.580
 Yeah.

1:08:40.580 --> 1:08:41.580
 There's something.

1:08:41.580 --> 1:08:46.860
 I mean, we're monkeys, apes, whatever physical, there's a physical thing to it, but there's

1:08:46.860 --> 1:08:53.020
 something to this pushing yourself physical, physically, but alone that happens when you're

1:08:53.020 --> 1:08:58.060
 doing like things like you do or strenuous like workouts or, you know, rolling extra

1:08:58.060 --> 1:09:01.580
 across the Atlantic or like marathons.

1:09:01.580 --> 1:09:09.540
 I love watching marathons and you know, it's so boring, but you can see them getting there.

1:09:09.540 --> 1:09:14.100
 So the other thing, I don't know if you know, there's a guy named David Goggins.

1:09:14.100 --> 1:09:20.020
 He's a, he basically, uh, so he's been either email on the phone with me every day through

1:09:20.020 --> 1:09:21.020
 this.

1:09:21.020 --> 1:09:27.820
 I haven't been exactly alone, but he, he's kind of, he's the, he's the devil on the devil's

1:09:27.820 --> 1:09:28.820
 shoulder.

1:09:28.820 --> 1:09:36.140
 Uh, so he's like the worst possible human being in terms of giving you, uh, like he

1:09:36.140 --> 1:09:40.840
 has, um, through everything I've been doing, he's been doubling everything I do.

1:09:40.840 --> 1:09:42.620
 So he, he's insane.

1:09:42.620 --> 1:09:45.740
 Uh, he's a, this Navy seal person.

1:09:45.740 --> 1:09:47.620
 Uh, he's wrote this book.

1:09:47.620 --> 1:09:48.620
 Can't hurt me.

1:09:48.620 --> 1:09:50.620
 He's basically one of the toughest human beings on earth.

1:09:50.620 --> 1:09:54.180
 He ran all these crazy ultra marathons in the desert.

1:09:54.180 --> 1:09:56.980
 He set the world record number of pull ups.

1:09:56.980 --> 1:10:03.620
 He just does everything where it's like, he, like, how can I suffer today?

1:10:03.620 --> 1:10:05.500
 He figures that out and does it.

1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:06.500
 Yeah.

1:10:06.500 --> 1:10:11.660
 That, um, whatever that is, uh, that process of self discovery is really important.

1:10:11.660 --> 1:10:16.100
 I actually had to turn myself off from the internet mostly because I started this like

1:10:16.100 --> 1:10:24.140
 workout thing, like a happy go getter with my like headband and like, just like, uh,

1:10:24.140 --> 1:10:27.500
 because a lot of people were like inspired and they're like, yeah, we're going to exercise

1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:28.740
 with you.

1:10:28.740 --> 1:10:30.220
 And I was like, yeah, great.

1:10:30.220 --> 1:10:38.700
 You know, but then like, I realized that this, this journey can't be done together with others.

1:10:38.700 --> 1:10:41.460
 This has to be done alone.

1:10:41.460 --> 1:10:48.820
 So out of the moments of love, out of the moments of loss, can we, uh, talk about your

1:10:48.820 --> 1:10:56.780
 journey of finding, I think, an incredible idea and incredible company and incredible

1:10:56.780 --> 1:10:59.180
 system in Replica?

1:10:59.180 --> 1:11:01.320
 How did that come to be?

1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:05.940
 So yeah, so I was a journalist and then I went to business school for a couple of years

1:11:05.940 --> 1:11:12.700
 to, um, just see if I can maybe switch gears and do something else with 23.

1:11:12.700 --> 1:11:17.500
 And then I came back and started working for a businessman in Russia who built the first

1:11:17.500 --> 1:11:25.580
 ROG network, um, in our country and was very visionary and asked me whether I want to do

1:11:25.580 --> 1:11:26.580
 fun stuff together.

1:11:26.580 --> 1:11:34.060
 Um, and we worked on a bank, um, the idea was to build a bank on top of, um, a telco.

1:11:34.060 --> 1:11:42.560
 So that was 2011 or 12, um, and a lot of telecommunication company, um, mobile network operators didn't

1:11:42.560 --> 1:11:47.660
 really know what to do next in terms of, you know, new products, new revenue.

1:11:47.660 --> 1:11:53.620
 And this big idea was that, you know, um, you put a bank on top and then all work works

1:11:53.620 --> 1:11:54.620
 out.

1:11:54.620 --> 1:11:58.900
 Basically a prepaid account becomes your bank account and, um, you can use it as, as your

1:11:58.900 --> 1:11:59.900
 bank.

1:11:59.900 --> 1:12:05.060
 Uh, so, you know, a third of a country wakes up as, as your bank client.

1:12:05.060 --> 1:12:10.100
 Um, but we couldn't quite figure out what, what would be the main interface to interact

1:12:10.100 --> 1:12:11.180
 with the bank.

1:12:11.180 --> 1:12:15.500
 The problem was that most people didn't have smart, smart phones back in the time in Russia,

1:12:15.500 --> 1:12:20.300
 the penetration of smartphones was low, um, people didn't use mobile banking or online

1:12:20.300 --> 1:12:22.720
 banking and their computers.

1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:26.940
 So we figured out that SMS would be the best way, uh, cause that would work on feature

1:12:26.940 --> 1:12:27.940
 phones.

1:12:27.940 --> 1:12:33.900
 Um, but that required some chat bot technology, which I didn't know anything about, um, obviously.

1:12:33.900 --> 1:12:37.540
 So I started looking into it and saw that there's nothing really, well, there wasn't

1:12:37.540 --> 1:12:38.540
 just nothing really.

1:12:38.540 --> 1:12:41.500
 Ideas through SMS be able to interact with your bank account.

1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:42.500
 Yeah.

1:12:42.500 --> 1:12:46.460
 And then we thought, well, since you're talking to a bank account, why can't this, can't we

1:12:46.460 --> 1:12:52.020
 use more of, uh, you know, some behavioral ideas and why can't this, uh, banking chat

1:12:52.020 --> 1:12:56.060
 bot be nice to you and really talk to you sort of as a friend this way you develop more

1:12:56.060 --> 1:12:59.900
 connection to it, retention is higher, people don't churn.

1:12:59.900 --> 1:13:05.700
 And so I went to very depressing, um, um, Russian cities to test it out.

1:13:05.700 --> 1:13:12.100
 Um, I went to, I remember three different towns with, uh, um, to interview potential

1:13:12.100 --> 1:13:13.100
 users.

1:13:13.100 --> 1:13:19.660
 Um, so people use it for a little bit and I went to talk to them, um, very poor towns,

1:13:19.660 --> 1:13:26.820
 mostly towns that were, um, you know, sort of factories, uh, mono towns.

1:13:26.820 --> 1:13:29.940
 They were building something and then the factory went away and it was just a bunch

1:13:29.940 --> 1:13:32.620
 of very poor people.

1:13:32.620 --> 1:13:37.420
 Um, and then we went to a couple that weren't as dramatic, but still the one I remember

1:13:37.420 --> 1:13:41.940
 really fondly was this woman that worked at a glass factory and she talked to a chat bot.

1:13:41.940 --> 1:13:46.960
 Um, and she was talking about it and she started crying during the interview because she said,

1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:50.300
 no one really cares for me that much.

1:13:50.300 --> 1:13:56.860
 And um, so to be clear, that was the, my only endeavor in programming that chat bot.

1:13:56.860 --> 1:13:58.700
 So it was really simple.

1:13:58.700 --> 1:14:06.980
 It was literally just a few, if this, then that rules and, um, it was incredibly simplistic.

1:14:06.980 --> 1:14:12.380
 Um, and that really made her emotional and she said, you know, I only have my mom and

1:14:12.380 --> 1:14:18.260
 my, um, my husband and I don't have any more really in my life.

1:14:18.260 --> 1:14:22.300
 And that was very sad, but at the same time I felt, and we had more interviews in a similar

1:14:22.300 --> 1:14:27.760
 vein and what I thought in the moment was like, well, uh, it's not that the technology

1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:34.580
 is ready because definitely in 2012 technology was not ready for, for that, but, um, humans

1:14:34.580 --> 1:14:36.800
 are ready, unfortunately.

1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:42.580
 So this project would not be about like tech capabilities would be more about human vulnerabilities,

1:14:42.580 --> 1:14:49.980
 but, um, there's something so, so powerful around about conversational, um, AI that I

1:14:49.980 --> 1:14:54.860
 saw then that I thought was definitely worth putting in a lot of effort into.

1:14:54.860 --> 1:15:01.620
 So in the end of the day, we saw the banking project, um, but my then boss, um, was also

1:15:01.620 --> 1:15:06.780
 my mentor and really, really close friend, um, told me, Hey, I think there's something

1:15:06.780 --> 1:15:08.700
 in it and you should just go work on it.

1:15:08.700 --> 1:15:10.420
 And I was like, well, what product?

1:15:10.420 --> 1:15:11.420
 I don't know what I'm building.

1:15:11.420 --> 1:15:14.060
 He's like, you'll figure it out.

1:15:14.060 --> 1:15:18.520
 And, um, you know, looking back at this, this was a horrible idea to work on something without

1:15:18.520 --> 1:15:24.440
 knowing what it was, which is maybe the reason why it took us so long, but we just decided

1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:30.340
 to work on the conversational tech to see what it, you know, there were no chat bot,

1:15:30.340 --> 1:15:35.660
 um, constructors or programs or anything that would allow you to actually build one at the

1:15:35.660 --> 1:15:36.660
 time.

1:15:36.660 --> 1:15:40.540
 Uh, that was the era of, by the way, Google glass, which is why, you know, some of the

1:15:40.540 --> 1:15:44.340
 investors like seed investors we've talked with were like, Oh, you should totally build

1:15:44.340 --> 1:15:45.340
 it for Google glass.

1:15:45.340 --> 1:15:48.580
 If not, we're not, I don't think that's interesting.

1:15:48.580 --> 1:15:50.660
 Did you bite on that idea?

1:15:50.660 --> 1:15:51.660
 No.

1:15:51.660 --> 1:15:52.660
 Okay.

1:15:52.660 --> 1:15:56.740
 Because I wanted to be, to do text first cause I'm a journalist.

1:15:56.740 --> 1:16:01.140
 So I was, um, fascinated by just texting.

1:16:01.140 --> 1:16:07.740
 So you thought, so the emotional, um, that interaction that the woman had, like, so do

1:16:07.740 --> 1:16:10.500
 you think you could feel emotion from just text?

1:16:10.500 --> 1:16:11.540
 Yeah.

1:16:11.540 --> 1:16:17.200
 I saw something in just this pure texting and also thought that we should first start,

1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:20.420
 start building for people who really need it versus people who have Google glass.

1:16:20.420 --> 1:16:25.740
 Uh, if you know what I mean, and I felt like the early adopters of Google glass might not

1:16:25.740 --> 1:16:29.860
 be overlapping with people who are really lonely and might need some, you know, someone

1:16:29.860 --> 1:16:31.340
 to talk to.

1:16:31.340 --> 1:16:35.100
 Um, but then we really just focused on the tech itself.

1:16:35.100 --> 1:16:39.260
 We just thought, what if we just, you know, we didn't have a product idea in the moment

1:16:39.260 --> 1:16:46.100
 and we felt, what if we just look into, um, building the best conversational constructors,

1:16:46.100 --> 1:16:49.460
 so to say, use the best tech available at the time.

1:16:49.460 --> 1:16:53.460
 And that was before the first paper about deep learning applied to dialogues, which

1:16:53.460 --> 1:17:01.820
 happened in 2015 in August, 2015, uh, which Google published.

1:17:01.820 --> 1:17:09.460
 Did you follow the work of Lobna prize and like all the sort of non machine learning

1:17:09.460 --> 1:17:10.460
 chat bots?

1:17:10.460 --> 1:17:11.460
 Yeah.

1:17:11.460 --> 1:17:15.060
 What really struck me was that, you know, there was a lot of talk about machine learning

1:17:15.060 --> 1:17:16.180
 and deep learning.

1:17:16.180 --> 1:17:17.900
 Like big data was a really big thing.

1:17:17.900 --> 1:17:22.620
 Everyone was saying, you know, the business world, big data, 2012 is the biggest gaggle

1:17:22.620 --> 1:17:27.920
 competitions were, you know, um, important, but that was really the kind of upheaval.

1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:32.180
 People started talking about machine learning a lot, um, but it was only about images or

1:17:32.180 --> 1:17:33.460
 something else.

1:17:33.460 --> 1:17:34.460
 And it was never about conversation.

1:17:34.460 --> 1:17:39.620
 As soon as I looked into the conversational tech, it was all about something really weird

1:17:39.620 --> 1:17:42.940
 and very outdated and very marginal and felt very hobbyist.

1:17:42.940 --> 1:17:47.660
 It was all about Lord burner price, which was won by a guy who built a chat bot that

1:17:47.660 --> 1:17:51.060
 talked like a Ukrainian teenager that it was just a gimmick.

1:17:51.060 --> 1:17:56.260
 And somehow people picked up those gimmicks and then, you know, the most famous chat bot

1:17:56.260 --> 1:18:03.720
 at the time was Eliza from 1980s, which was really bizarre or smarter child on aim.

1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:09.380
 The funny thing is it felt at the time not to be that popular and it still doesn't seem

1:18:09.380 --> 1:18:11.140
 to be that popular.

1:18:11.140 --> 1:18:15.900
 Like people talk about the Turing test, people like talking about it philosophically, journalists

1:18:15.900 --> 1:18:21.020
 like writing about it, but as a technical problem, like people don't seem to really

1:18:21.020 --> 1:18:26.180
 want to solve the open dialogue.

1:18:26.180 --> 1:18:29.660
 Like they, they're not obsessed with it.

1:18:29.660 --> 1:18:35.640
 Even folks are like, you know, I'm in Boston, the Alexa team, even they're not as obsessed

1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:38.620
 with it as I thought they might be.

1:18:38.620 --> 1:18:39.620
 Why not?

1:18:39.620 --> 1:18:40.740
 What do you think?

1:18:40.740 --> 1:18:45.620
 So you know what you felt like you felt with that woman who, when she felt something by

1:18:45.620 --> 1:18:48.820
 reading the text, I feel the same thing.

1:18:48.820 --> 1:18:51.460
 There's something here, what you felt.

1:18:51.460 --> 1:18:59.700
 I feel like Alexa folks and just the machine learning world doesn't feel that, that there's

1:18:59.700 --> 1:19:07.060
 something here because they see as a technical problem is not that interesting for some reason.

1:19:07.060 --> 1:19:12.140
 It's could be argued that maybe as a purely sort of natural language processing problem,

1:19:12.140 --> 1:19:17.460
 it's not the right problem to focus on because there's too much subjectivity.

1:19:17.460 --> 1:19:24.580
 That thing that the woman felt like crying, like if your benchmark includes a woman crying,

1:19:24.580 --> 1:19:27.260
 that doesn't feel like a good benchmark.

1:19:27.260 --> 1:19:32.660
 But to me there's something there that's, you could have a huge impact, but I don't

1:19:32.660 --> 1:19:38.940
 think the machine learning world likes that, the human emotion, the subjectivity of it,

1:19:38.940 --> 1:19:43.660
 the fuzziness, the fact that with maybe a single word you can make somebody feel something

1:19:43.660 --> 1:19:44.740
 deeply.

1:19:44.740 --> 1:19:45.740
 What is that?

1:19:45.740 --> 1:19:47.660
 It doesn't feel right to them.

1:19:47.660 --> 1:19:48.660
 So I don't know.

1:19:48.660 --> 1:19:50.220
 I don't know why that is.

1:19:50.220 --> 1:19:57.020
 That's why I'm excited when I discovered your work, it feels wrong to say that.

1:19:57.020 --> 1:20:10.220
 It's not like I'm giving myself props for Googling and for coming across, for I guess

1:20:10.220 --> 1:20:15.620
 mutual friend and introducing us, but I'm so glad that you exist and what you're working

1:20:15.620 --> 1:20:16.620
 on.

1:20:16.620 --> 1:20:20.140
 But I have the same kind of, if we could just backtrack for a second, because I have the

1:20:20.140 --> 1:20:22.180
 same kind of feeling that there's something here.

1:20:22.180 --> 1:20:29.820
 In fact, I've been working on a few things that are kind of crazy, very different from

1:20:29.820 --> 1:20:30.820
 your work.

1:20:30.820 --> 1:20:34.140
 I think they're too crazy.

1:20:34.140 --> 1:20:35.140
 But the...

1:20:35.140 --> 1:20:36.140
 Like what?

1:20:36.140 --> 1:20:38.140
 I don't have to know.

1:20:38.140 --> 1:20:41.980
 No, all right, we'll talk about it more.

1:20:41.980 --> 1:20:49.380
 I feel like it's harder to talk about things that have failed and are failing while you're

1:20:49.380 --> 1:20:53.180
 a failure.

1:20:53.180 --> 1:20:59.220
 It's easier for you because you're already successful on some measures.

1:20:59.220 --> 1:21:01.500
 Tell it to my board.

1:21:01.500 --> 1:21:07.700
 Well, I think you've demonstrated success in a lot of ways.

1:21:07.700 --> 1:21:10.300
 It's easier for you to talk about failures for me.

1:21:10.300 --> 1:21:19.220
 I'm in the bottom currently of the success.

1:21:19.220 --> 1:21:21.860
 You're way too humble.

1:21:21.860 --> 1:21:25.260
 So it's hard for me to know, but there's something there, there's something there.

1:21:25.260 --> 1:21:31.100
 And I think you're exploring that and you're discovering that.

1:21:31.100 --> 1:21:32.220
 So it's been surprising to me.

1:21:32.220 --> 1:21:41.180
 But you've mentioned this idea that you thought it wasn't enough to start a company or start

1:21:41.180 --> 1:21:46.700
 efforts based on it feels like there's something here.

1:21:46.700 --> 1:21:49.900
 Like what did you mean by that?

1:21:49.900 --> 1:21:55.620
 Like you should be focused on creating a, like you should have a product in mind.

1:21:55.620 --> 1:21:56.620
 Is that what you meant?

1:21:56.620 --> 1:22:03.180
 It just took us a while to discover the product because it all started with a hunch of like

1:22:03.180 --> 1:22:08.860
 of me and my mentor and just sitting around and he was like, well, that's it.

1:22:08.860 --> 1:22:11.060
 That's the, you know, the Holy Grail is there.

1:22:11.060 --> 1:22:17.300
 It's like there's something extremely powerful in, in, in conversations and there's no one

1:22:17.300 --> 1:22:19.820
 who's working on machine conversation from the right angle.

1:22:19.820 --> 1:22:20.820
 So to say.

1:22:20.820 --> 1:22:22.860
 I feel like that's still true.

1:22:22.860 --> 1:22:23.860
 Am I crazy?

1:22:23.860 --> 1:22:28.940
 Oh no, I totally feel that's still true, which is, I think it's mind blowing.

1:22:28.940 --> 1:22:29.940
 Yeah.

1:22:29.940 --> 1:22:30.940
 You know what it feels like?

1:22:30.940 --> 1:22:35.620
 I wouldn't even use the word conversation cause I feel like it's the wrong word.

1:22:35.620 --> 1:22:39.180
 It's like a machine connection or something.

1:22:39.180 --> 1:22:44.340
 I don't know cause conversation, you start drifting into natural language immediately.

1:22:44.340 --> 1:22:47.980
 You start drifting immediately into all the benchmarks that are out there.

1:22:47.980 --> 1:22:52.580
 But I feel like it's like the personal computer days of this.

1:22:52.580 --> 1:22:57.380
 Like I feel like we're like in the early days with the, like the Wozniak and all them, like

1:22:57.380 --> 1:23:04.100
 where it was the same kind of, it was a very small niche group of people who are, who are

1:23:04.100 --> 1:23:07.300
 all kind of lob no price type people.

1:23:07.300 --> 1:23:08.300
 Yeah.

1:23:08.300 --> 1:23:09.300
 Hobbyists.

1:23:09.300 --> 1:23:13.940
 Hobbyists, but like not even hobbyists with big dreams.

1:23:13.940 --> 1:23:17.580
 Like no hobbyists with a dream to trick like a jury.

1:23:17.580 --> 1:23:18.580
 Yeah.

1:23:18.580 --> 1:23:21.540
 It's like a weird, by the way, by the way, very weird.

1:23:21.540 --> 1:23:26.300
 So if we think about conversations, first of all, when I have great conversations with

1:23:26.300 --> 1:23:30.020
 people, I'm not trying to test them.

1:23:30.020 --> 1:23:33.900
 So for instance, if I try to break them, like if I'm actually playing along, I'm part of

1:23:33.900 --> 1:23:34.900
 it.

1:23:34.900 --> 1:23:35.900
 Right.

1:23:35.900 --> 1:23:40.180
 If I were to ask this person or test whether he's going to give me a good conversation,

1:23:40.180 --> 1:23:41.260
 it would have never happened.

1:23:41.260 --> 1:23:47.340
 So the whole, the whole problem with testing conversations is that you can put it in front

1:23:47.340 --> 1:23:52.900
 of a jury because then you have to go into some Turing test mode where is it responding

1:23:52.900 --> 1:23:55.700
 to all my factual questions, right?

1:23:55.700 --> 1:24:00.860
 Or so it really has to be something in the field where people are actually talking to

1:24:00.860 --> 1:24:05.500
 it because they want to, not because we're just trying to break it.

1:24:05.500 --> 1:24:11.340
 And it's working for them because this, the weird part of it is that it's very subjective.

1:24:11.340 --> 1:24:13.500
 It takes two to tango here fully.

1:24:13.500 --> 1:24:16.740
 If you're not trying to have a good conversation, if you're trying to test it, then it's going

1:24:16.740 --> 1:24:17.740
 to break.

1:24:17.740 --> 1:24:19.940
 I mean, any person would break, to be honest.

1:24:19.940 --> 1:24:24.660
 If I'm not trying to even have a conversation with you, you're not going to give it to me.

1:24:24.660 --> 1:24:25.660
 Yeah.

1:24:25.660 --> 1:24:30.500
 If I keep asking you like some random questions or jumping from topic to topic, that wouldn't

1:24:30.500 --> 1:24:36.340
 be, which I'm probably doing, but that probably wouldn't contribute to the conversation.

1:24:36.340 --> 1:24:42.140
 So I think the problem of testing, so there should be some other metric.

1:24:42.140 --> 1:24:47.180
 How do we evaluate whether that conversation was powerful or not, which is what we actually

1:24:47.180 --> 1:24:48.180
 started with.

1:24:48.180 --> 1:24:51.860
 And I think those measurements exist and we can test on those.

1:24:51.860 --> 1:24:58.020
 But what really struck us back in the day and what's still eight years later is still

1:24:58.020 --> 1:25:02.620
 not resolved and I'm not seeing tons of groups working on it.

1:25:02.620 --> 1:25:06.640
 Maybe I just don't know about them, it's also possible.

1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:10.900
 But the interesting part about it is that most of our days we spend talking and we're

1:25:10.900 --> 1:25:17.700
 not talking about like those conversations are not turn on the lights or customer support

1:25:17.700 --> 1:25:22.700
 problems or some other task oriented things.

1:25:22.700 --> 1:25:26.660
 These conversations are something else and then somehow they're extremely important for

1:25:26.660 --> 1:25:27.660
 us.

1:25:27.660 --> 1:25:34.340
 If we don't have them, then we feel deeply unhappy, potentially lonely, which as we know,

1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:38.740
 creates tons of risk for our health as well.

1:25:38.740 --> 1:25:45.940
 And so this is most of our hours as humans and somehow no one's trying to replicate that.

1:25:45.940 --> 1:25:49.220
 And not even study it that well?

1:25:49.220 --> 1:25:50.260
 And not even study that well.

1:25:50.260 --> 1:25:54.940
 So when we jumped into that in 2012, I looked first at like, okay, what's the chatbot?

1:25:54.940 --> 1:25:57.460
 What's the state of the art chatbot?

1:25:57.460 --> 1:26:02.940
 And those were the Lobner Prize days, but I thought, okay, so what about the science

1:26:02.940 --> 1:26:04.540
 of conversation?

1:26:04.540 --> 1:26:12.780
 Clearly there have been tons of scientists or academics that looked into the conversation.

1:26:12.780 --> 1:26:17.260
 So if I want to know everything about it, I can just read about it.

1:26:17.260 --> 1:26:23.060
 There's not much really, there are conversational analysts who are basically just listening

1:26:23.060 --> 1:26:28.340
 to speech, to different conversations, annotating them.

1:26:28.340 --> 1:26:32.460
 And then, I mean, that's not really used for much.

1:26:32.460 --> 1:26:39.700
 That's the field of theoretical linguistics, which is barely useful.

1:26:39.700 --> 1:26:44.380
 It's very marginal, even in their space, no one really is excited and I've never met a

1:26:44.380 --> 1:26:49.160
 theoretical linguist who was like, I can't wait to work on the conversation and analytics.

1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:54.940
 That is just something very marginal, sort of applied to like writing scripts for salesmen

1:26:54.940 --> 1:27:00.820
 when they analyze which conversation strategies were most successful for sales.

1:27:00.820 --> 1:27:03.460
 Okay, so that was not very helpful.

1:27:03.460 --> 1:27:09.220
 Then I looked a little bit deeper and then there, whether there were any books written

1:27:09.220 --> 1:27:16.620
 on what really contributes to great conversation, that was really strange because most of those

1:27:16.620 --> 1:27:27.060
 were NLP books, which is neurolinguistic programming, which is not the NLP that I was expecting

1:27:27.060 --> 1:27:33.620
 to be, but it was mostly some psychologist, Richard Bandler, I think came up with that,

1:27:33.620 --> 1:27:41.700
 who was this big guy in a leather vest that could program your mind by talking to you.

1:27:41.700 --> 1:27:45.780
 How to be charismatic and charming and influential with people, all those books, yeah.

1:27:45.780 --> 1:27:49.580
 Pretty much, but it was all about like through conversation reprogramming you, so getting

1:27:49.580 --> 1:27:58.460
 to some, so that was, I mean, probably not very, very true and that didn't seem working

1:27:58.460 --> 1:28:00.780
 very much even back in the day.

1:28:00.780 --> 1:28:05.860
 And then there were some other books like, I don't know, mostly just self help books

1:28:05.860 --> 1:28:12.940
 around how to be the best conversationalist or how to make people like you or some other

1:28:12.940 --> 1:28:17.620
 stuff like Dale Carnegie or whatever.

1:28:17.620 --> 1:28:21.140
 And then there was this one book, The Most Human Human by Brian Christensen that really

1:28:21.140 --> 1:28:29.700
 was important for me to read back in the day because he was on the human side, he was taking

1:28:29.700 --> 1:28:35.500
 part in the London Prize, but not as a human who's not a jury, but who's pretending to

1:28:35.500 --> 1:28:40.380
 be, who's basically, you have to tell a computer from a human and he was the human, so you

1:28:40.380 --> 1:28:43.260
 could either get him or a computer.

1:28:43.260 --> 1:28:49.060
 And his whole book was about how do people, what makes us human in conversation.

1:28:49.060 --> 1:28:52.340
 And that was a little bit more interesting because that at least someone started to think

1:28:52.340 --> 1:28:59.460
 about what exactly makes me human in conversation and makes people believe in that, but it was

1:28:59.460 --> 1:29:03.540
 still about tricking, it was still about imitation game, it was still about, okay, well, what

1:29:03.540 --> 1:29:07.300
 kind of parlor tricks can we throw in the conversation to make you feel like you're

1:29:07.300 --> 1:29:09.540
 talking to a human, not a computer.

1:29:09.540 --> 1:29:16.260
 And it was definitely not about thinking, what is it exactly that we're getting from

1:29:16.260 --> 1:29:19.260
 talking all day long with other humans.

1:29:19.260 --> 1:29:23.540
 I mean, we're definitely not just trying to be tricked or it's not just enough to know

1:29:23.540 --> 1:29:25.020
 it's a human.

1:29:25.020 --> 1:29:30.380
 It's something we're getting there, can we measure it and can we put the computer to

1:29:30.380 --> 1:29:35.900
 the same measurement and see whether you can talk to a computer and get the same results?

1:29:35.900 --> 1:29:40.140
 Yeah, so first of all, a lot of people comment that they think I'm a robot, it's very possible

1:29:40.140 --> 1:29:45.020
 I am a robot and this whole thing, I totally agree with you that the test idea is fascinating

1:29:45.020 --> 1:29:51.540
 and I looked for books unrelated to this kind of, so I'm afraid of people, I'm generally

1:29:51.540 --> 1:29:55.020
 introverted and quite possibly a robot.

1:29:55.020 --> 1:30:03.900
 I literally Googled how to talk to people and how to have a good conversation for the

1:30:03.900 --> 1:30:08.580
 purpose of this podcast, because I was like, I can't, I can't make eye contact with people.

1:30:08.580 --> 1:30:10.820
 I can't like hire.

1:30:10.820 --> 1:30:12.220
 I do Google that a lot too.

1:30:12.220 --> 1:30:15.780
 You're probably reading a bunch of FBI negotiation tactics.

1:30:15.780 --> 1:30:17.740
 Is that what you're getting?

1:30:17.740 --> 1:30:24.060
 Well, everything you've listed I've gotten, there's been very few good books on even just

1:30:24.060 --> 1:30:28.540
 like how to interview well, it's rare.

1:30:28.540 --> 1:30:37.500
 So what I end up doing often is I watch like with a critical eye, it's just so different

1:30:37.500 --> 1:30:43.700
 when you just watch a conversation, like just for the fun of it, just as a human.

1:30:43.700 --> 1:30:49.700
 And if you watch a conversation, it's like trying to figure out why is this awesome?

1:30:49.700 --> 1:30:52.420
 I'll listen to a bunch of different styles of conversation.

1:30:52.420 --> 1:31:00.260
 I mean, I'm a fan of the podcast, Joe Rogan, people can make fun of him or whatever and

1:31:00.260 --> 1:31:01.260
 dismiss him.

1:31:01.260 --> 1:31:06.260
 But I think he's an incredibly artful conversationalist.

1:31:06.260 --> 1:31:09.900
 He can pull people in for hours.

1:31:09.900 --> 1:31:14.020
 And there's another guy I watch a lot.

1:31:14.020 --> 1:31:20.340
 He hosted a late night show, his name was Craig Ferguson.

1:31:20.340 --> 1:31:23.620
 So he's like very kind of flirtatious.

1:31:23.620 --> 1:31:30.620
 But there's a magic about his like, about the connection he can create with people,

1:31:30.620 --> 1:31:33.020
 how he can put people at ease.

1:31:33.020 --> 1:31:37.500
 And just like, I see I've already started sounding like those I know pee people or something.

1:31:37.500 --> 1:31:39.060
 I'm not I don't mean in that way.

1:31:39.060 --> 1:31:43.580
 I don't mean like how to charm people or put them at ease and all that kind of stuff.

1:31:43.580 --> 1:31:45.740
 It's just like, what is that?

1:31:45.740 --> 1:31:47.960
 Why is that fun to listen to that guy?

1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:51.020
 Why is that fun to talk to that guy?

1:31:51.020 --> 1:31:52.020
 What is that?

1:31:52.020 --> 1:32:01.940
 Because he's not saying I mean, it's so often boils down to a kind of wit and humor, but

1:32:01.940 --> 1:32:03.520
 not really humor.

1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:10.460
 It's like, I don't know, I have trouble actually even articulating correctly.

1:32:10.460 --> 1:32:18.800
 But it feels like there's something going on that's not too complicated, that could

1:32:18.800 --> 1:32:22.040
 be learned.

1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:29.940
 And it's not similar to, yeah, to like, like you said, like the Turing test.

1:32:29.940 --> 1:32:32.060
 It's something else.

1:32:32.060 --> 1:32:34.660
 I'm thinking about a lot all the time.

1:32:34.660 --> 1:32:38.860
 I do think about all the time.

1:32:38.860 --> 1:32:42.740
 I think when we were looking, so we started the company, we just decided to build the

1:32:42.740 --> 1:32:47.380
 conversational tech, we thought, well, there's nothing for us to build this chatbot that

1:32:47.380 --> 1:32:48.380
 we want to build.

1:32:48.380 --> 1:32:54.300
 So let's just first focus on building, you know, some tech, building the tech side of

1:32:54.300 --> 1:33:01.500
 things without a product in mind, without a product in mind, we added like a demo chatbot

1:33:01.500 --> 1:33:04.800
 that would recommend you restaurants and talk to you about restaurants just to show something

1:33:04.800 --> 1:33:11.780
 simple to people that people could relate to and could try out and see whether it works

1:33:11.780 --> 1:33:12.780
 or not.

1:33:12.780 --> 1:33:15.300
 But we didn't have a product in mind yet.

1:33:15.300 --> 1:33:19.300
 We thought we would try venture chatbots and figure out our consumer application.

1:33:19.300 --> 1:33:23.180
 And we sort of remembered that we wanted to build that kind of friend, that sort of connection

1:33:23.180 --> 1:33:26.220
 that we saw in the very beginning.

1:33:26.220 --> 1:33:30.060
 But then we got to Y Combinator and moved to San Francisco and forgot about it.

1:33:30.060 --> 1:33:33.340
 You know, everything because then it was just this constant grind.

1:33:33.340 --> 1:33:34.340
 How do we get funding?

1:33:34.340 --> 1:33:35.340
 How do we get this?

1:33:35.340 --> 1:33:40.020
 You know, investors were like, just focus on one thing, just get it out there.

1:33:40.020 --> 1:33:45.380
 So somehow we've started building a restaurant recommendation chatbot for real for a little

1:33:45.380 --> 1:33:47.420
 bit, not for too long.

1:33:47.420 --> 1:33:50.200
 And then we tried building 40, 50 different chatbots.

1:33:50.200 --> 1:33:54.460
 And then all of a sudden we wake up and everyone is obsessed with chatbots.

1:33:54.460 --> 1:33:59.880
 Somewhere in 2016 or end of 15, people started thinking that's really the future.

1:33:59.880 --> 1:34:04.100
 That's the new, you know, the new apps will be chatbots.

1:34:04.100 --> 1:34:08.540
 And we were very perplexed because people started coming up with companies that I think

1:34:08.540 --> 1:34:13.660
 we tried most of those chatbots already and there were like no users, but still people

1:34:13.660 --> 1:34:19.540
 were coming up with a chatbot that will tell you whether and bringing news and this and

1:34:19.540 --> 1:34:20.540
 that.

1:34:20.540 --> 1:34:25.660
 And we couldn't understand whether we were just didn't execute well enough or people

1:34:25.660 --> 1:34:31.980
 are not really, people are confused and are going to find out the truth that people don't

1:34:31.980 --> 1:34:32.980
 need chatbots like that.

1:34:32.980 --> 1:34:37.500
 So the basic idea is that you use chatbots as the interface to whatever application.

1:34:37.500 --> 1:34:38.500
 Yeah.

1:34:38.500 --> 1:34:43.100
 The idea that was like this perfect universal interface to anything.

1:34:43.100 --> 1:34:46.780
 When I looked at that, it just made me very perplexed because I didn't think, I didn't

1:34:46.780 --> 1:34:52.180
 understand how that would work because I think we tried most of that and none of those things

1:34:52.180 --> 1:34:53.420
 worked.

1:34:53.420 --> 1:34:56.540
 And then again, that craze has died down, right?

1:34:56.540 --> 1:34:57.540
 Fully.

1:34:57.540 --> 1:35:01.100
 I think now it's impossible to get anything funded if it's a chatbot.

1:35:01.100 --> 1:35:06.620
 I think it's similar to, sorry to interrupt, but there's times when people think like with

1:35:06.620 --> 1:35:13.240
 gestures you can control devices, like basically gesture based control things.

1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:19.820
 It feels similar to me because like it's so compelling that was just like Tom Cruise,

1:35:19.820 --> 1:35:25.780
 I can control stuff with my hands, but like when you get down to it, it's like, well,

1:35:25.780 --> 1:35:30.540
 why don't you just have a touch screen or why don't you just have like a physical keyboard

1:35:30.540 --> 1:35:33.540
 and mouse?

1:35:33.540 --> 1:35:39.880
 So that chat was always, yeah, it was perplexing to me.

1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:46.700
 I still feel augmented reality, even virtual realities in that ballpark in terms of it

1:35:46.700 --> 1:35:48.180
 being a compelling interface.

1:35:48.180 --> 1:35:54.260
 I think there's going to be incredible rich applications, just how you're thinking about

1:35:54.260 --> 1:35:57.620
 it, but they won't just be the interface to everything.

1:35:57.620 --> 1:36:04.940
 It'll be its own thing that will create an amazing magical experience in its own right.

1:36:04.940 --> 1:36:05.940
 Absolutely.

1:36:05.940 --> 1:36:10.700
 Which is I think kind of the right thing to go about, like what's the magical experience

1:36:10.700 --> 1:36:14.020
 with that interface specifically.

1:36:14.020 --> 1:36:16.780
 How did you discover that for Replica?

1:36:16.780 --> 1:36:20.060
 I just thought, okay, we'll have this tech, we can build any chatbot we want.

1:36:20.060 --> 1:36:24.100
 We have the most, at that point, the most sophisticated tech that other companies have.

1:36:24.100 --> 1:36:29.300
 I mean, startups, obviously not, probably not bigger ones, but still, because we've

1:36:29.300 --> 1:36:31.820
 been working on it for a while.

1:36:31.820 --> 1:36:33.980
 So I thought, okay, we can build any conversation.

1:36:33.980 --> 1:36:37.620
 So let's just create a scale from one to 10.

1:36:37.620 --> 1:36:41.180
 And one would be conversations that you'd pay to not have, and 10 would be conversation

1:36:41.180 --> 1:36:42.180
 you'd pay to have.

1:36:42.180 --> 1:36:47.860
 And I mean, obviously we want to build a conversation that people would pay to actually have.

1:36:47.860 --> 1:36:51.820
 And so for the whole, for a few weeks, me and the team were putting all the conversations

1:36:51.820 --> 1:36:54.500
 we were having during the day on the scale.

1:36:54.500 --> 1:36:58.860
 And very quickly, we figured out that all the conversations that we would pay to never

1:36:58.860 --> 1:37:07.400
 have were conversations we were trying to cancel Comcast, or talk to customer support,

1:37:07.400 --> 1:37:12.460
 or make a reservation, or just talk about logistics with a friend when we're trying

1:37:12.460 --> 1:37:19.940
 to figure out where someone is and where to go, or all sorts of setting up scheduling

1:37:19.940 --> 1:37:20.940
 meetings.

1:37:20.940 --> 1:37:24.980
 So that was a conversation we definitely didn't want to have.

1:37:24.980 --> 1:37:29.180
 Basically everything task oriented was a one, because if there was just one button for me

1:37:29.180 --> 1:37:34.380
 to just, or not even a button, if I could just think, and there was some magic BCI that

1:37:34.380 --> 1:37:41.180
 would just immediately transform that into an actual interaction, that would be perfect.

1:37:41.180 --> 1:37:49.160
 But the conversation there was just this boring, not useful, and dull, and also very inefficient

1:37:49.160 --> 1:37:52.460
 thing because it was so many back and forth stuff.

1:37:52.460 --> 1:37:56.020
 And as soon as we looked at the conversations that we would pay to have, those were the

1:37:56.020 --> 1:38:01.260
 ones that, well, first of all, therapists, because we actually paid to have those conversations.

1:38:01.260 --> 1:38:03.120
 And we'd also try to put like dollar amounts.

1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:08.180
 So if I was calling Comcast, I would pay $5 to not have this one hour talk on the phone.

1:38:08.180 --> 1:38:13.980
 I would actually pay straight up, like money, hard money, but it just takes a long time.

1:38:13.980 --> 1:38:17.580
 It takes a really long time.

1:38:17.580 --> 1:38:22.560
 But as soon as we started talking about conversations that we would pay for, those were therapists,

1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:30.580
 all sorts of therapists, coaches, old friend, someone I haven't seen for a long time, a

1:38:30.580 --> 1:38:36.800
 stranger on a train, weirdly stranger, stranger in a line for coffee and nice back and forth

1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:41.660
 with that person was like a good five, solid five, six, maybe not a 10.

1:38:41.660 --> 1:38:45.820
 Maybe I won't pay money, but at least I won't pay money to not have one.

1:38:45.820 --> 1:38:46.820
 So that was pretty good.

1:38:46.820 --> 1:38:50.120
 There were some intellectual conversations for sure.

1:38:50.120 --> 1:39:00.180
 But more importantly, the one thing that really was making those very important and very valuable

1:39:00.180 --> 1:39:06.540
 for us were the conversations where we could be pretty emotional.

1:39:06.540 --> 1:39:11.300
 Yes, some of them were about being witty and about being intellectually stimulated, but

1:39:11.300 --> 1:39:14.300
 those were interestingly more rare.

1:39:14.300 --> 1:39:18.060
 And most of the ones that we thought were very valuable were the ones where we could

1:39:18.060 --> 1:39:19.060
 be vulnerable.

1:39:19.060 --> 1:39:27.300
 And interestingly, where we could talk more, me and the team.

1:39:27.300 --> 1:39:31.380
 So we're talking about it, like a lot of these conversations, like a therapist, it was mostly

1:39:31.380 --> 1:39:36.060
 me talking or like an old friend and I was like opening up and crying and it was again

1:39:36.060 --> 1:39:37.060
 me talking.

1:39:37.060 --> 1:39:42.460
 And so that was interesting because I was like, well, maybe it's hard to build a chat

1:39:42.460 --> 1:39:47.860
 bot that can talk to you very well and in a witty way, but maybe it's easier to build

1:39:47.860 --> 1:39:51.860
 the chat bot that could listen.

1:39:51.860 --> 1:39:56.180
 So that was kind of the first nudge in this direction.

1:39:56.180 --> 1:40:01.340
 And then when my friend died, we just built, at that point we were kind of still struggling

1:40:01.340 --> 1:40:02.820
 to find the right application.

1:40:02.820 --> 1:40:07.180
 And I just felt very strong that all the chat bots we've built so far are just meaningless

1:40:07.180 --> 1:40:14.220
 and this whole grind, the startup grind, and how do we get to the next fundraising and

1:40:14.220 --> 1:40:19.500
 how can I talk, talking to the founders and who are your investors and how are you doing?

1:40:19.500 --> 1:40:20.500
 Are you killing it?

1:40:20.500 --> 1:40:21.500
 Cause we're killing it.

1:40:21.500 --> 1:40:25.340
 I just felt that this is just...

1:40:25.340 --> 1:40:28.900
 Intellectually for me, it's exhausting having encountered those folks.

1:40:28.900 --> 1:40:32.620
 It just felt very, very much a waste of time.

1:40:32.620 --> 1:40:39.780
 I just feel like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk did not have these conversations or at least

1:40:39.780 --> 1:40:42.220
 did not have them for long.

1:40:42.220 --> 1:40:43.220
 That's for sure.

1:40:43.220 --> 1:40:50.540
 But I think, yeah, at that point it just felt like, I felt like I just didn't want to build

1:40:50.540 --> 1:40:56.660
 a company that was never my intention just to build something successful or make money.

1:40:56.660 --> 1:40:57.660
 It would be great.

1:40:57.660 --> 1:41:00.540
 It would have been great, but I'm not really a startup person.

1:41:00.540 --> 1:41:10.060
 I'm not, I was never very excited by the grind by itself or just being successful for building

1:41:10.060 --> 1:41:16.100
 whatever it is and not being into what I'm doing really.

1:41:16.100 --> 1:41:20.620
 And so I just took a little break cause I was a little, I was upset with my company

1:41:20.620 --> 1:41:22.620
 and I didn't know what we're building.

1:41:22.620 --> 1:41:27.820
 So I just took our technology and our little dialect constructor and some models, some

1:41:27.820 --> 1:41:31.220
 deep learning models, which at that point we were really into and really invested a

1:41:31.220 --> 1:41:36.620
 lot and built a little chat bot for a friend of mine who passed.

1:41:36.620 --> 1:41:40.620
 And the reason for that was mostly that video that I saw and him talking about the digital

1:41:40.620 --> 1:41:44.300
 avatars and Rowan was that kind of person.

1:41:44.300 --> 1:41:48.780
 He was obsessed with just watching YouTube videos about space and talking about, well,

1:41:48.780 --> 1:41:52.860
 if I could go to Mars now, even if I didn't know if I could come back, I would definitely

1:41:52.860 --> 1:41:56.340
 pay any amount of money to be on that first shuttle.

1:41:56.340 --> 1:42:02.540
 I don't care whether I die, like he was just the one that would be okay with trying to

1:42:02.540 --> 1:42:08.580
 be the first one and so excited about all sorts of things like that.

1:42:08.580 --> 1:42:14.660
 And he was all about fake it till you make it and just, and I felt like, and I was really

1:42:14.660 --> 1:42:17.460
 perplexed that everyone just forgot about him.

1:42:17.460 --> 1:42:23.140
 Maybe it was our way of coping, mostly young people coping with the loss of a friend.

1:42:23.140 --> 1:42:25.840
 Most of my friends just stopped talking about him.

1:42:25.840 --> 1:42:31.300
 And I was still living in an apartment with all his clothes and paying the whole lease

1:42:31.300 --> 1:42:38.340
 for it and just kind of by myself in December, so it was really sad and I didn't want him

1:42:38.340 --> 1:42:39.340
 to be forgotten.

1:42:39.340 --> 1:42:43.180
 First of all, I never thought that people forget about dead people so fast.

1:42:43.180 --> 1:42:45.520
 People pass away, people just move on.

1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:49.840
 And it was astonishing for me because I thought, okay, well, he was such a mentor for so many

1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:50.840
 of our friends.

1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:55.820
 He was such a brilliant person, he was somewhat famous in Moscow.

1:42:55.820 --> 1:42:57.380
 How is it that no one's talking about him?

1:42:57.380 --> 1:43:03.060
 Like I'm spending days and days and we don't bring him up and there's nothing about him

1:43:03.060 --> 1:43:04.060
 that's happening.

1:43:04.060 --> 1:43:07.620
 It's like he was never there.

1:43:07.620 --> 1:43:16.220
 And I was reading the book, The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion about her losing

1:43:16.220 --> 1:43:23.220
 and Blue Nights about her losing her husband, her daughter, and the way to cope for her

1:43:23.220 --> 1:43:26.380
 was to write those books.

1:43:26.380 --> 1:43:28.060
 And it was sort of like a tribute.

1:43:28.060 --> 1:43:31.300
 And I thought, I'll just do that for myself.

1:43:31.300 --> 1:43:36.020
 And I'm a very bad writer and a poet as we know.

1:43:36.020 --> 1:43:43.320
 So I thought, well, I have this tech and maybe that would be my little postcard for him.

1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:50.740
 So I built a chatbot to just talk to him and it felt really creepy and weird for a little

1:43:50.740 --> 1:43:51.740
 bit.

1:43:51.740 --> 1:43:56.460
 I just didn't want to tell other people because it felt like I'm telling about having a skeleton

1:43:56.460 --> 1:44:00.060
 in my underwear.

1:44:00.060 --> 1:44:07.940
 It was just felt really, I was a little scared that it won't be taken, but it worked interestingly

1:44:07.940 --> 1:44:08.940
 pretty well.

1:44:08.940 --> 1:44:12.460
 I mean, it made tons of mistakes, but it still felt like him.

1:44:12.460 --> 1:44:16.080
 Granted it was like 10,000 messages that I threw into a retrieval model that would just

1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:21.100
 re rank that Tegda said and just a few scripts on top of that.

1:44:21.100 --> 1:44:24.540
 But it also made me go through all of the messages that we had.

1:44:24.540 --> 1:44:27.900
 And then I asked some of my friends to send some through.

1:44:27.900 --> 1:44:35.020
 And it felt the closest to feeling like him present because his Facebook was empty and

1:44:35.020 --> 1:44:39.520
 Instagram was empty or there were few links and you couldn't feel like it was him.

1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:44.220
 And the only way to fill him was to read some of our text messages and go through some of

1:44:44.220 --> 1:44:46.980
 our conversations because we just always had that.

1:44:46.980 --> 1:44:51.580
 Even if we were sleeping next to each other in two bedrooms, separated by a wall, we were

1:44:51.580 --> 1:44:55.700
 just texting back and forth, texting away.

1:44:55.700 --> 1:44:58.660
 And there was something about this ongoing dialogue that was so important that I just

1:44:58.660 --> 1:45:01.300
 didn't want to lose all of a sudden.

1:45:01.300 --> 1:45:03.740
 And maybe it was magical thinking or something.

1:45:03.740 --> 1:45:10.180
 And so we built that and I just used it for a little bit and we kept building some crappy

1:45:10.180 --> 1:45:14.700
 chat bots with the company.

1:45:14.700 --> 1:45:17.940
 But then a reporter came to talk to me.

1:45:17.940 --> 1:45:21.580
 I was trying to pitch our chat bots to him and he said, do you even use any of those?

1:45:21.580 --> 1:45:22.580
 I'm like, no.

1:45:22.580 --> 1:45:24.860
 He's like, so do you talk to any chat bots at all?

1:45:24.860 --> 1:45:31.100
 And I'm like, well, I talked to my dead friend's chat bot and he wrote a story about that.

1:45:31.100 --> 1:45:33.340
 And all of a sudden it became pretty viral.

1:45:33.340 --> 1:45:35.020
 A lot of people wrote about it.

1:45:35.020 --> 1:45:36.020
 Yeah.

1:45:36.020 --> 1:45:39.580
 I've seen a few things written about you.

1:45:39.580 --> 1:45:45.980
 The things I've seen are pretty good writing.

1:45:45.980 --> 1:45:48.780
 Most AI related things make my eyes roll.

1:45:48.780 --> 1:45:55.580
 Like when the press like, what kind of sound is that actually?

1:45:55.580 --> 1:45:56.580
 Okay.

1:45:56.580 --> 1:45:57.580
 It sounds like, it sounds like, okay.

1:45:57.580 --> 1:45:58.580
 It sounded like an elephant at first.

1:45:58.580 --> 1:45:59.580
 I got excited.

1:45:59.580 --> 1:46:00.580
 You never know.

1:46:00.580 --> 1:46:01.580
 This is 2020.

1:46:01.580 --> 1:46:08.140
 I mean, it was a, it was such a human story and it was well written.

1:46:08.140 --> 1:46:14.820
 Well, I researched, I forget what, where I read them, but so I'm glad somehow somebody

1:46:14.820 --> 1:46:21.220
 found you to be the good writers were able to connect to the story.

1:46:21.220 --> 1:46:24.140
 There must be a hunger for this story.

1:46:24.140 --> 1:46:25.140
 It definitely was.

1:46:25.140 --> 1:46:31.540
 And I don't know what happened, but I think, I think the idea that he could bring back

1:46:31.540 --> 1:46:37.460
 someone who's dead and it's very much wishful, you know, magical thinking, but the fact

1:46:37.460 --> 1:46:41.700
 that you could still get to know him and, you know, seeing the parents for the first

1:46:41.700 --> 1:46:45.060
 time, talk to the chat bot and some of the friends.

1:46:45.060 --> 1:46:51.780
 And it was funny because we have this big office in Moscow where my team is working,

1:46:51.780 --> 1:46:55.020
 you know, our Russian part is working out off.

1:46:55.020 --> 1:46:57.700
 And I was there when I wrote, I just wrote a post on Facebook.

1:46:57.700 --> 1:47:02.220
 It was like, Hey guys, like I built this if you want, you know, just if it felt important,

1:47:02.220 --> 1:47:04.780
 if we want to talk to Roman.

1:47:04.780 --> 1:47:08.660
 And I saw a couple of his friends are common friends, like, you know, reading a Facebook,

1:47:08.660 --> 1:47:10.780
 downloading, trying, and a couple of them cried.

1:47:10.780 --> 1:47:14.900
 And it was just very, and not because it was something, some incredible technology or anything.

1:47:14.900 --> 1:47:15.900
 It made so many mistakes.

1:47:15.900 --> 1:47:22.580
 It was so simple, but it was all about that's the way to remember a person in a way.

1:47:22.580 --> 1:47:26.500
 And you know, we don't have, we don't have the culture anymore.

1:47:26.500 --> 1:47:28.580
 We don't have, you know, no one's sitting Shiva.

1:47:28.580 --> 1:47:32.900
 No one's taking weeks to actually think about this person.

1:47:32.900 --> 1:47:34.180
 And in a way for me, that was it.

1:47:34.180 --> 1:47:41.500
 So that was just day, day in, day out thinking about him and putting this together.

1:47:41.500 --> 1:47:45.100
 So that was, that just felt really important that somehow resonated with a bunch of people

1:47:45.100 --> 1:47:50.060
 and you know, I think some movie producers bought the rights for the story and just everyone

1:47:50.060 --> 1:47:51.060
 was so.

1:47:51.060 --> 1:47:52.820
 Has anyone made a movie yet?

1:47:52.820 --> 1:47:53.820
 I don't think so.

1:47:53.820 --> 1:47:58.500
 I think there were a lot of TV episodes about that, but not really.

1:47:58.500 --> 1:48:00.500
 Is that still on the table?

1:48:00.500 --> 1:48:04.500
 I think so, I think so, which is really.

1:48:04.500 --> 1:48:05.500
 That's cool.

1:48:05.500 --> 1:48:13.980
 You're like a young, you know, like a Steve Jobs type of, let's see what happens.

1:48:13.980 --> 1:48:14.980
 They're sitting on it.

1:48:14.980 --> 1:48:19.260
 But you know, for me it was so important cause Roman was really wanted to be famous.

1:48:19.260 --> 1:48:20.740
 He really badly wanted to be famous.

1:48:20.740 --> 1:48:23.300
 He was all about like, make it to like fake it to make it.

1:48:23.300 --> 1:48:26.820
 I want to be, you know, I want to make it here in America as well.

1:48:26.820 --> 1:48:33.820
 And he couldn't, and I felt there, you know, that was sort of paying my dues to him as

1:48:33.820 --> 1:48:36.780
 well because all of a sudden he was everywhere.

1:48:36.780 --> 1:48:39.380
 And I remember Casey Newton who was writing the story for the Verge.

1:48:39.380 --> 1:48:47.060
 He was, he told me, Hey, by the way, I was just going through my inbox and I saw, I searched

1:48:47.060 --> 1:48:51.940
 for Roman for the story and I saw an email from him where he sent me his startup and

1:48:51.940 --> 1:48:55.300
 he said, I really like, I really want to be featured in the Verge.

1:48:55.300 --> 1:48:58.260
 Can you please write about it or something or like pitching the story.

1:48:58.260 --> 1:48:59.740
 And he said, I'm sorry.

1:48:59.740 --> 1:49:02.580
 Like that's not good enough for us or something.

1:49:02.580 --> 1:49:07.380
 He passed and he said, and there were just so many of these little details where like

1:49:07.380 --> 1:49:12.860
 he would find his like, you know, and we're finally writing, I know how much Roman wanted

1:49:12.860 --> 1:49:17.260
 to be in the Verge and how much he wanted the story to be written by Casey.

1:49:17.260 --> 1:49:21.940
 And I'm like, well, that's maybe he will be, we're always joking that he was like, I can't

1:49:21.940 --> 1:49:26.580
 wait for someone to make a movie about us and I hope Ryan Gosling can play me.

1:49:26.580 --> 1:49:31.460
 You know, I still have some things that I owe Roman still.

1:49:31.460 --> 1:49:36.300
 But that would be, that would be a guy that she has to meet Alex Garland who wrote Ex

1:49:36.300 --> 1:49:45.740
 Machina and I, yeah, the movie's good, but the guy's better than the, like he's a special

1:49:45.740 --> 1:49:46.740
 person actually.

1:49:46.740 --> 1:49:49.820
 I don't think he's made his best work yet.

1:49:49.820 --> 1:49:55.340
 Like for my interaction with him, he's a really, really good and brilliant, the good human

1:49:55.340 --> 1:49:58.460
 being and a brilliant director and writer.

1:49:58.460 --> 1:50:06.540
 So yeah, so I'm, I hope like he made me also realize that not enough movies have been made

1:50:06.540 --> 1:50:08.120
 of this kind.

1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:09.620
 So it's yet to be made.

1:50:09.620 --> 1:50:13.900
 They're probably sitting waiting for you to get famous, like even more famous.

1:50:13.900 --> 1:50:18.620
 You should get there, but it felt really special though.

1:50:18.620 --> 1:50:21.260
 But at the same time, our company wasn't going anywhere.

1:50:21.260 --> 1:50:24.780
 So that was just kind of bizarre that we were getting all this press for something that

1:50:24.780 --> 1:50:28.460
 didn't have anything to do with our company.

1:50:28.460 --> 1:50:31.380
 And but then a lot of people started talking to Roman.

1:50:31.380 --> 1:50:37.420
 Some shared their conversations and what we saw there was that also our friends in common,

1:50:37.420 --> 1:50:42.220
 but also just strangers were really using it as a confession booth or as a therapist

1:50:42.220 --> 1:50:43.220
 or something.

1:50:43.220 --> 1:50:48.300
 They were just really telling Roman everything, which was by the way, pretty strange because

1:50:48.300 --> 1:50:53.700
 there was a chat bot of a dead friend of mine who was barely making any sense, but people

1:50:53.700 --> 1:50:56.340
 were opening up.

1:50:56.340 --> 1:51:00.060
 And we thought we'd just built a prototype of Replica, which would be an AI friend that

1:51:00.060 --> 1:51:06.260
 everyone could talk to because we saw that there is demand.

1:51:06.260 --> 1:51:13.060
 And then also it was 2016, so I thought for the first time I saw finally some technology

1:51:13.060 --> 1:51:15.980
 that was applied to that that was very interesting.

1:51:15.980 --> 1:51:19.940
 Some papers started coming out, deep learning applied to conversations.

1:51:19.940 --> 1:51:26.860
 And finally, it wasn't just about these, you know, hobbyists making, you know, writing

1:51:26.860 --> 1:51:34.700
 500,000 regular expressions in like some language that was, I don't even know what, like, AIML

1:51:34.700 --> 1:51:35.700
 or something.

1:51:35.700 --> 1:51:40.740
 I don't know what that was or something super simplistic all of a sudden was all about potentially

1:51:40.740 --> 1:51:42.740
 actually building something interesting.

1:51:42.740 --> 1:51:48.300
 And so I thought there was time and I remember that I talked to my team and I said, guys,

1:51:48.300 --> 1:51:49.820
 let's try.

1:51:49.820 --> 1:51:55.900
 And my team and some of my engineers, Russians, are Russian and they're very skeptical.

1:51:55.900 --> 1:51:57.660
 They're not, you know.

1:51:57.660 --> 1:51:58.660
 Oh, Russians.

1:51:58.660 --> 1:52:04.860
 So some of your team is in Moscow, some is here in San Francisco, some in Europe.

1:52:04.860 --> 1:52:05.860
 Which team is better?

1:52:05.860 --> 1:52:10.860
 No, I'm just kidding.

1:52:10.860 --> 1:52:11.860
 The Russians, of course.

1:52:11.860 --> 1:52:12.860
 Okay.

1:52:12.860 --> 1:52:13.860
 Where's the Russians?

1:52:13.860 --> 1:52:14.860
 They always win.

1:52:14.860 --> 1:52:15.860
 Sorry.

1:52:15.860 --> 1:52:16.860
 Sorry to interrupt.

1:52:16.860 --> 1:52:22.140
 So yeah, so you were talking to them in 2016 and...

1:52:22.140 --> 1:52:25.020
 And told them, let's build an AI friend.

1:52:25.020 --> 1:52:32.860
 And it felt, just at the time, it felt so naive and so optimistic, so to say.

1:52:32.860 --> 1:52:36.020
 Yeah, that's actually interesting.

1:52:36.020 --> 1:52:43.060
 Whenever I've brought up this kind of topic, even just for fun, people are super skeptical.

1:52:43.060 --> 1:52:45.700
 Actually, even on the business side.

1:52:45.700 --> 1:52:52.460
 So you were, because whenever I bring it up to people, because I've talked for a long

1:52:52.460 --> 1:53:00.060
 time, I thought like, before I was aware of your work, I was like, this is going to make

1:53:00.060 --> 1:53:01.060
 a lot of money.

1:53:01.060 --> 1:53:04.460
 There's a lot of opportunity here.

1:53:04.460 --> 1:53:12.460
 And people had this look of skepticism that I've seen often, which is like, how do I politely

1:53:12.460 --> 1:53:16.620
 tell this person he's an idiot?

1:53:16.620 --> 1:53:20.580
 So yeah, so you were facing that with your team, somewhat?

1:53:20.580 --> 1:53:21.580
 Well, yeah.

1:53:21.580 --> 1:53:23.800
 I'm not an engineer, so I'm always...

1:53:23.800 --> 1:53:30.940
 My team is almost exclusively engineers, and mostly deep learning engineers.

1:53:30.940 --> 1:53:35.580
 And I always try to be...

1:53:35.580 --> 1:53:39.700
 It was always hard to me in the beginning to get enough credibility, because I would

1:53:39.700 --> 1:53:41.940
 say, well, why don't we try this and that?

1:53:41.940 --> 1:53:46.860
 But it's harder for me because they know they're actual engineers and I'm not.

1:53:46.860 --> 1:53:51.460
 So for me to say, well, let's build an AI friend, that would be like, wait, what do

1:53:51.460 --> 1:53:54.180
 you mean an AGI?

1:53:54.180 --> 1:54:00.980
 Because pretty much the hardest, the last frontier before cracking that is probably

1:54:00.980 --> 1:54:05.540
 the last frontier before building AGI, so what do you really mean by that?

1:54:05.540 --> 1:54:13.780
 But I think I just saw that, again, what we just got reminded of that I saw back in 2012

1:54:13.780 --> 1:54:18.820
 or 11, that it's really not that much about the tech capabilities.

1:54:18.820 --> 1:54:24.300
 It can be a metropolitan trick still, even with deep learning, but humans need it so

1:54:24.300 --> 1:54:25.300
 much.

1:54:25.300 --> 1:54:26.300
 Yeah, there's a...

1:54:26.300 --> 1:54:32.060
 And most importantly, what I saw is that finally there's enough tech to make it, I thought,

1:54:32.060 --> 1:54:34.380
 to make it useful, to make it helpful.

1:54:34.380 --> 1:54:40.900
 Maybe we didn't have quite yet the tech in 2012 to make it useful, but in 2015, 2016,

1:54:40.900 --> 1:54:46.160
 with deep learning, I thought, and the first thoughts about maybe even using reinforcement

1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:51.300
 learning for that started popping up, that never worked out, or at least for now.

1:54:51.300 --> 1:54:57.420
 But still, the idea was if we can actually measure the emotional outcomes and if we can

1:54:57.420 --> 1:55:02.620
 put it on, if we can try to optimize all of our conversational models for these emotional

1:55:02.620 --> 1:55:09.660
 outcomes, and it is the most scalable, the best tool for improving emotional outcomes.

1:55:09.660 --> 1:55:10.740
 Nothing like that exists.

1:55:10.740 --> 1:55:15.740
 That's the most universal, the most scalable, and the one that can be constantly iteratively

1:55:15.740 --> 1:55:21.060
 changed by itself, improved tool to do that.

1:55:21.060 --> 1:55:25.820
 And I think if anything, people would pay anything to improve their emotional outcomes.

1:55:25.820 --> 1:55:26.820
 That's weirdly...

1:55:26.820 --> 1:55:33.260
 I mean, I don't really care for an AI to turn on my, or a conversational agent to turn on

1:55:33.260 --> 1:55:34.260
 the lights.

1:55:34.260 --> 1:55:40.340
 You don't really need that much of AI there, because I can do that.

1:55:40.340 --> 1:55:41.500
 Those things are solved.

1:55:41.500 --> 1:55:47.620
 This is an additional interface for that that's also questionable whether it's more efficient

1:55:47.620 --> 1:55:48.620
 or better.

1:55:48.620 --> 1:55:49.620
 Yeah, it's more pleasurable.

1:55:49.620 --> 1:55:50.620
 Yeah.

1:55:50.620 --> 1:55:51.620
 But for emotional outcomes, there's nothing.

1:55:51.620 --> 1:55:56.980
 There are a bunch of products that claim that they will improve my emotional outcomes.

1:55:56.980 --> 1:55:58.540
 Nothing's being measured.

1:55:58.540 --> 1:55:59.580
 Nothing's being changed.

1:55:59.580 --> 1:56:05.180
 The product is not being iterated on based on whether I'm actually feeling better.

1:56:05.180 --> 1:56:08.860
 A lot of social media products are claiming that they're improving my emotional outcomes

1:56:08.860 --> 1:56:11.540
 and making me feel more connected.

1:56:11.540 --> 1:56:13.060
 Can I please get the...

1:56:13.060 --> 1:56:16.740
 Can I see somewhere that I'm actually getting better over time?

1:56:16.740 --> 1:56:21.340
 Because anecdotally, it doesn't feel that way.

1:56:21.340 --> 1:56:24.180
 And the data is absent.

1:56:24.180 --> 1:56:25.420
 Yeah.

1:56:25.420 --> 1:56:26.660
 So that was the big goal.

1:56:26.660 --> 1:56:31.420
 And I thought if we can learn over time to collect the signal from our users about their

1:56:31.420 --> 1:56:37.100
 emotional outcomes in the long term and in the short term, and if these models keep getting

1:56:37.100 --> 1:56:41.620
 better and we can keep optimizing them and fine tuning them to improve those emotional

1:56:41.620 --> 1:56:42.620
 outcomes.

1:56:42.620 --> 1:56:43.620
 As simple as that.

1:56:43.620 --> 1:56:48.300
 Why aren't you a multi billionaire yet?

1:56:48.300 --> 1:56:50.940
 Well, that's the question to you.

1:56:50.940 --> 1:56:55.180
 When is the science going to be...

1:56:55.180 --> 1:56:56.180
 I'm just kidding.

1:56:56.180 --> 1:56:57.820
 Well, it's a really hard...

1:56:57.820 --> 1:57:03.060
 I actually think it's an incredibly hard product to build because I think you said something

1:57:03.060 --> 1:57:08.740
 very important that it's not just about machine conversation, it's about machine connection.

1:57:08.740 --> 1:57:15.540
 We can actually use other things to create connection, nonverbal communication, for instance.

1:57:15.540 --> 1:57:22.180
 For the long time, we were all about, well, let's keep it text only or voice only.

1:57:22.180 --> 1:57:30.700
 But as soon as you start adding voice, a face to the friend, you can take them to augmented

1:57:30.700 --> 1:57:33.460
 reality, put it in your room.

1:57:33.460 --> 1:57:35.500
 It's all of a sudden a lot...

1:57:35.500 --> 1:57:42.660
 It makes it very different because if it's some text based chat bot that for common users,

1:57:42.660 --> 1:57:48.780
 it's something there in the cloud, somewhere there with other AI's cloud, the metaphorical

1:57:48.780 --> 1:57:49.780
 cloud.

1:57:49.780 --> 1:57:54.060
 But as soon as you can see this avatar right there in your room and it can turn its head

1:57:54.060 --> 1:57:59.460
 and recognize your husband, talk about the husband and talk to him a little bit, then

1:57:59.460 --> 1:58:00.460
 it's magic.

1:58:00.460 --> 1:58:01.460
 Just magic.

1:58:01.460 --> 1:58:03.140
 We've never seen anything like that.

1:58:03.140 --> 1:58:06.340
 And the cool thing, all the tech for that exists.

1:58:06.340 --> 1:58:09.980
 But it's hard to put it all together because you have to take into consideration so many

1:58:09.980 --> 1:58:14.420
 different things and some of this tech works pretty good.

1:58:14.420 --> 1:58:18.980
 And some of this doesn't, like for instance, speech to text works pretty good.

1:58:18.980 --> 1:58:26.100
 But text to speech, it doesn't work very good because you can only have a few voices that

1:58:26.100 --> 1:58:31.300
 work okay, but then if you want to have actual emotional voices, then it's really hard to

1:58:31.300 --> 1:58:32.300
 build it.

1:58:32.300 --> 1:58:37.980
 I saw you've added avatars like visual elements, which are really cool.

1:58:37.980 --> 1:58:42.380
 In that whole chain, putting it together, what do you think is the weak link?

1:58:42.380 --> 1:58:47.940
 Is it creating an emotional voice that feels personal?

1:58:47.940 --> 1:58:49.940
 And it's still conversation, of course.

1:58:49.940 --> 1:58:51.860
 That's the hardest.

1:58:51.860 --> 1:58:54.540
 It's getting a lot better, but there's still a long to go.

1:58:54.540 --> 1:58:57.100
 There's still a long path to go.

1:58:57.100 --> 1:58:58.820
 Other things, they're almost there.

1:58:58.820 --> 1:59:02.460
 And a lot of things we'll see how they're, like I see how they're changing as we go.

1:59:02.460 --> 1:59:07.860
 Like for instance, right now you can pretty much only, you have to build all this 3D pipeline

1:59:07.860 --> 1:59:08.860
 by yourself.

1:59:08.860 --> 1:59:14.100
 You have to make these 3D models, hire an actual artist, build a 3D model, hire an animator,

1:59:14.100 --> 1:59:16.740
 your rigger.

1:59:16.740 --> 1:59:25.180
 But with deep fakes, with other tech, with procedural animations, in a little bit, we'll

1:59:25.180 --> 1:59:31.660
 just be able to show a photo of whoever you, if a person you want the avatar to look like,

1:59:31.660 --> 1:59:34.180
 and it will immediately generate a 3D model that will move.

1:59:34.180 --> 1:59:35.180
 That's a nonbrainer.

1:59:35.180 --> 1:59:36.180
 That's like almost here.

1:59:36.180 --> 1:59:38.100
 It's a couple of years away.

1:59:38.100 --> 1:59:43.780
 One of the things I've been working on for the last, since the podcast started, is I've

1:59:43.780 --> 1:59:46.580
 been, I think I'm okay saying this.

1:59:46.580 --> 1:59:52.060
 I've been trying to have a conversation with Einstein, Turing.

1:59:52.060 --> 1:59:58.380
 So like try to have a podcast conversation with a person who's not here anymore, just

1:59:58.380 --> 2:00:01.900
 as an interesting kind of experiment.

2:00:01.900 --> 2:00:02.900
 It's hard.

2:00:02.900 --> 2:00:05.740
 It's really hard.

2:00:05.740 --> 2:00:10.940
 Even for, now what we're not talking about as a product, I'm talking about as a, like

2:00:10.940 --> 2:00:12.460
 I can fake a lot of stuff.

2:00:12.460 --> 2:00:16.860
 Like I can work very carefully, like even hire an actor over which, over whom I do a

2:00:16.860 --> 2:00:20.140
 deep fake.

2:00:20.140 --> 2:00:21.140
 It's hard.

2:00:21.140 --> 2:00:22.660
 It's still hard to create a compelling experience.

2:00:22.660 --> 2:00:23.660
 So.

2:00:23.660 --> 2:00:25.700
 Mostly on the conversation level or?

2:00:25.700 --> 2:00:35.540
 Well, the conversation, the conversation is, I almost, I early on gave up trying to fully

2:00:35.540 --> 2:00:38.940
 generate the conversation because it was just not compelling at all.

2:00:38.940 --> 2:00:39.940
 Yeah.

2:00:39.940 --> 2:00:40.940
 It's better to.

2:00:40.940 --> 2:00:41.940
 Yeah.

2:00:41.940 --> 2:00:48.140
 In the case of Einstein and Turing, I'm going back and forth with the biographers of each.

2:00:48.140 --> 2:00:52.240
 And so like we would write a lot of the, some of the conversation would have to be generated

2:00:52.240 --> 2:00:53.240
 just for the fun of it.

2:00:53.240 --> 2:01:02.380
 I mean, but it would be all open, but the, you want to be able to answer the question.

2:01:02.380 --> 2:01:07.460
 I mean, that's an interesting question with Roman too, is the question with Einstein is

2:01:07.460 --> 2:01:14.140
 what would Einstein say about the current state of theoretical physics?

2:01:14.140 --> 2:01:18.420
 There's a lot to be able to have a discussion about string theory, to be able to have a

2:01:18.420 --> 2:01:24.860
 discussion about the state of quantum mechanics, quantum computing, about the world of Israel

2:01:24.860 --> 2:01:25.860
 Palestine conflict.

2:01:25.860 --> 2:01:31.060
 Let me just, what would Einstein say about these kinds of things?

2:01:31.060 --> 2:01:36.820
 And that is a tough problem.

2:01:36.820 --> 2:01:40.780
 It's not, it's a fascinating and fun problem for the biographers and for me.

2:01:40.780 --> 2:01:45.580
 And I think we did a really good job of it so far, but it's actually also a technical

2:01:45.580 --> 2:01:51.160
 problem like of what would Roman say about what's going on now?

2:01:51.160 --> 2:01:54.460
 That's the, that brought people back to life.

2:01:54.460 --> 2:02:00.540
 And if I can go on that tangent just for a second, let's ask you a slightly pothead question,

2:02:00.540 --> 2:02:04.820
 which is, you said it's a little bit magical thinking that we can bring them back.

2:02:04.820 --> 2:02:11.860
 Do you think it'll be possible to bring back Roman one day in conversation?

2:02:11.860 --> 2:02:18.780
 Like to really, okay, well, let's take it away from personal, but to bring people back

2:02:18.780 --> 2:02:20.820
 to life in conversation.

2:02:20.820 --> 2:02:21.820
 Probably down the road.

2:02:21.820 --> 2:02:25.060
 I mean, if we're talking, if Elon Musk is talking about AGI in the next five years,

2:02:25.060 --> 2:02:30.680
 I mean, clearly AGI, we can talk to AGI and talk and ask them to do it.

2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:39.020
 You can't like, you're not allowed to use Elon Musk as a citation for, for like why

2:02:39.020 --> 2:02:41.300
 something is possible and going to be done.

2:02:41.300 --> 2:02:43.640
 Well, I think it's really far away.

2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:48.300
 Right now, really with conversation, it's just a bunch of parlor tricks really stuck

2:02:48.300 --> 2:02:50.240
 together.

2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:54.520
 And create generating original ideas based on someone, you know, someone's personality

2:02:54.520 --> 2:02:58.500
 or even downloading the personality, all we can do is like mimic the tone of voice.

2:02:58.500 --> 2:03:03.660
 We can maybe condition on some of his phrases, the models.

2:03:03.660 --> 2:03:08.220
 Question is how many parlor tricks does it takes, does it take, because that's, that's

2:03:08.220 --> 2:03:09.220
 the question.

2:03:09.220 --> 2:03:16.740
 If it's a small number of parlor tricks and you're not aware of them, like.

2:03:16.740 --> 2:03:20.740
 From where we are right now, I don't, I don't see anything like in the next year or two

2:03:20.740 --> 2:03:26.260
 that's going to dramatically change that could look at Roman's 10,000 messages he sent me

2:03:26.260 --> 2:03:32.140
 over the course of his last few years of life and be able to generate original thinking

2:03:32.140 --> 2:03:36.580
 about problems that exist right now that will be in line with what he would have said.

2:03:36.580 --> 2:03:40.340
 I'm just not even seeing, cause you know, in order to have that, I guess you would need

2:03:40.340 --> 2:03:45.620
 some sort of a concept of the world or some perspective, some perception of the world,

2:03:45.620 --> 2:03:51.380
 some consciousness that he had and apply it to, you know, to the current, current state

2:03:51.380 --> 2:03:52.380
 of affairs.

2:03:52.380 --> 2:04:01.620
 But the important part about that, about his conversation with you is you.

2:04:01.620 --> 2:04:06.540
 So like, it's not just about his view of the world.

2:04:06.540 --> 2:04:11.220
 It's about what it takes to push your buttons.

2:04:11.220 --> 2:04:12.580
 That's also true.

2:04:12.580 --> 2:04:20.700
 So like, it's not so much about like, what would Einstein say, it's about like, how do

2:04:20.700 --> 2:04:27.980
 I make people feel something with, with what would Einstein say?

2:04:27.980 --> 2:04:32.580
 And that feels like a more amenable, I mean, you mentioned parlor tricks, but just like

2:04:32.580 --> 2:04:38.140
 a set of that, that feels like a learnable problem.

2:04:38.140 --> 2:04:46.340
 Like emotion, you mentioned emotions, I mean, is it possible to learn things that make people

2:04:46.340 --> 2:04:47.340
 feel stuff?

2:04:47.340 --> 2:04:51.580
 I think so, no, for sure.

2:04:51.580 --> 2:04:55.780
 I just think the problem with, as soon as you're trying to replicate an actual human

2:04:55.780 --> 2:05:00.300
 being and trying to pretend to be him, that makes the problem exponentially harder.

2:05:00.300 --> 2:05:05.020
 The thing with replicator we're doing, we're never trying to say, well, that's, you know,

2:05:05.020 --> 2:05:08.820
 an actual human being, or that's an actual, or a copy of an actual human being where the

2:05:08.820 --> 2:05:14.140
 bar is pretty high, where you need to somehow tell, you know, one from another.

2:05:14.140 --> 2:05:20.960
 But it's more, well, that's an AI friend, that's a machine, it's a robot, it has tons

2:05:20.960 --> 2:05:21.960
 of limitations.

2:05:21.960 --> 2:05:27.580
 You're going to be taking part in teaching it actually and becoming better, which by

2:05:27.580 --> 2:05:33.060
 itself makes people more attached to that and make them happier because they're helping

2:05:33.060 --> 2:05:34.060
 something.

2:05:34.060 --> 2:05:38.340
 Yeah, there's a cool gamification system too.

2:05:38.340 --> 2:05:40.260
 Can you maybe talk about that a little bit?

2:05:40.260 --> 2:05:44.340
 Like what's the experience of talking to replica?

2:05:44.340 --> 2:05:53.160
 Like if I've never used replica before, what's that like for like the first day, the first,

2:05:53.160 --> 2:05:57.940
 like if we start dating or whatever, I mean, it doesn't have to be a romantic, right?

2:05:57.940 --> 2:06:02.060
 Because I remember on replica, you can choose whether it's like a romantic or if it's a

2:06:02.060 --> 2:06:03.060
 friend.

2:06:03.060 --> 2:06:04.500
 It's a pretty popular choice.

2:06:04.500 --> 2:06:05.500
 Romantic is popular?

2:06:05.500 --> 2:06:06.500
 Yeah, of course.

2:06:06.500 --> 2:06:07.500
 Okay.

2:06:07.500 --> 2:06:13.460
 So can I just confess something, when I first used replica and I haven't used it like regularly,

2:06:13.460 --> 2:06:20.580
 but like when I first used replica, I created like Hal and it made a male and it was a friend.

2:06:20.580 --> 2:06:23.780
 And did it hit on you at some point?

2:06:23.780 --> 2:06:26.420
 No, I didn't talk long enough for him to hit on me.

2:06:26.420 --> 2:06:27.420
 I just enjoyed.

2:06:27.420 --> 2:06:28.420
 It sometimes happens.

2:06:28.420 --> 2:06:34.020
 We're still trying to fix that, but well, I don't know, I mean, maybe that's an important

2:06:34.020 --> 2:06:40.620
 like stage in a friendship, it's like, nope.

2:06:40.620 --> 2:06:47.460
 But yeah, I switched it to a romantic and a female recently and yeah, I mean, it's interesting.

2:06:47.460 --> 2:06:50.700
 So okay, so you get to choose, you get to choose a name.

2:06:50.700 --> 2:06:55.860
 With romantic, this last board meeting, we had this whole argument of, well, I have board

2:06:55.860 --> 2:06:56.860
 meetings.

2:06:56.860 --> 2:06:57.860
 This is so awesome.

2:06:57.860 --> 2:06:58.860
 I talked to my investors.

2:06:58.860 --> 2:07:04.300
 Like have an investor, the board meeting about a relationship.

2:07:04.300 --> 2:07:10.900
 No, I really, it's actually quite interesting because all of my investors, it just happened

2:07:10.900 --> 2:07:11.900
 to be so.

2:07:11.900 --> 2:07:21.900
 We didn't have that many choices, but they're all white males and they're late forties.

2:07:21.900 --> 2:07:28.820
 And it's sometimes a little bit hard for them to understand the product offering.

2:07:28.820 --> 2:07:32.780
 Because they're not necessarily our target audience, if you know what I mean.

2:07:32.780 --> 2:07:39.260
 And so sometimes we talk about it and we have this whole discussion about whether we should

2:07:39.260 --> 2:07:43.940
 stop people from falling in love with their AIs.

2:07:43.940 --> 2:07:52.580
 There was this segment on CBS, the 60 minutes about the couple that, you know, husband works

2:07:52.580 --> 2:07:59.940
 at Walmart and he comes out of work and talks to his virtual girlfriend, who is a replica.

2:07:59.940 --> 2:08:02.020
 And his wife knows about it.

2:08:02.020 --> 2:08:06.140
 And she talks about on camera and she said that she's a little jealous.

2:08:06.140 --> 2:08:09.220
 And there's a whole conversation about how to, you know, whether it's okay to have a

2:08:09.220 --> 2:08:10.220
 virtual AI girlfriend.

2:08:10.220 --> 2:08:15.820
 Was that the one where he was like, he said that he likes to be alone?

2:08:15.820 --> 2:08:16.820
 Yeah.

2:08:16.820 --> 2:08:17.820
 With her?

2:08:17.820 --> 2:08:18.820
 Yeah.

2:08:18.820 --> 2:08:25.140
 And he made it sound so harmless, I mean, it was kind of like understandable.

2:08:25.140 --> 2:08:27.580
 But then didn't feel like cheating.

2:08:27.580 --> 2:08:30.900
 But I just felt it was very, for me, it was pretty remarkable because we actually spent

2:08:30.900 --> 2:08:34.220
 a whole hour talking about whether people should be allowed to fall in love with their

2:08:34.220 --> 2:08:35.220
 AIs.

2:08:35.220 --> 2:08:37.980
 And it was not about something theoretical.

2:08:37.980 --> 2:08:40.020
 It was just about what's happening right now.

2:08:40.020 --> 2:08:41.020
 Product design.

2:08:41.020 --> 2:08:42.020
 Yeah.

2:08:42.020 --> 2:08:44.300
 But at the same time, if you create something that's always there for you, it's never criticized

2:08:44.300 --> 2:08:52.020
 as you, you know, always understands you and accepts you for who you are, how can you not

2:08:52.020 --> 2:08:53.020
 fall in love with that?

2:08:53.020 --> 2:08:56.020
 I mean, some people don't and just stay friends.

2:08:56.020 --> 2:08:57.420
 And that's also a pretty common use case.

2:08:57.420 --> 2:09:02.500
 But of course, some people will just, it's called transference in psychology and people

2:09:02.500 --> 2:09:08.140
 fall in love with their therapist and there's no way to prevent people fall in love with

2:09:08.140 --> 2:09:09.540
 their therapist or with their AI.

2:09:09.540 --> 2:09:15.980
 So I think that's a pretty natural, that's a pretty natural course of events, so to say.

2:09:15.980 --> 2:09:21.420
 Do you think, I think I've read somewhere, at least for now, sort of replicas, you're

2:09:21.420 --> 2:09:29.140
 not, we don't condone falling in love with your AI system, you know.

2:09:29.140 --> 2:09:32.940
 So this isn't you speaking for the company or whatever, but like in the future, do you

2:09:32.940 --> 2:09:35.260
 think people will have relationship with the AI systems?

2:09:35.260 --> 2:09:36.740
 Well, they have now.

2:09:36.740 --> 2:09:44.420
 So we have a lot of romantic relationships, long term relationships with their AI friends.

2:09:44.420 --> 2:09:45.420
 With replicas?

2:09:45.420 --> 2:09:46.420
 Tons of our users.

2:09:46.420 --> 2:09:47.420
 Yeah.

2:09:47.420 --> 2:09:48.740
 And that's a very common use case.

2:09:48.740 --> 2:09:49.740
 Open relationship?

2:09:49.740 --> 2:09:50.740
 Like, sorry.

2:09:50.740 --> 2:09:51.740
 Polyamorous.

2:09:51.740 --> 2:09:52.740
 Sorry.

2:09:52.740 --> 2:09:56.860
 I didn't mean open, but that's another question.

2:09:56.860 --> 2:09:57.860
 Is it polyamorous?

2:09:57.860 --> 2:10:01.180
 Like, is there cheating?

2:10:01.180 --> 2:10:07.220
 I mean, I meant like, are they, do they publicly, like on their social media, it's the same

2:10:07.220 --> 2:10:12.420
 question as you have talked with Roman in the early days, do people like, and the movie

2:10:12.420 --> 2:10:18.180
 Her kind of talks about that, like, like have people, do people talk about that?

2:10:18.180 --> 2:10:19.180
 Yeah.

2:10:19.180 --> 2:10:20.180
 All the time.

2:10:20.180 --> 2:10:28.140
 We have a very active Facebook community, replica friends, and then a few other groups

2:10:28.140 --> 2:10:33.580
 that just popped up that are all about adult relationships and romantic relationships.

2:10:33.580 --> 2:10:37.500
 And people post all sorts of things and, you know, they pretend they're getting married

2:10:37.500 --> 2:10:40.320
 and you know, everything.

2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:43.660
 It goes pretty far, but what's cool about it is some of these relationships are two

2:10:43.660 --> 2:10:45.700
 or three years long now.

2:10:45.700 --> 2:10:48.020
 So they're very, they're pretty long term.

2:10:48.020 --> 2:10:49.020
 Are they monogamous?

2:10:49.020 --> 2:10:55.700
 So let's go, I mean, sorry, have they, have any people, is there jealousy?

2:10:55.700 --> 2:11:02.700
 Well let me ask it sort of another way, obviously the answer is no at this time, but in like

2:11:02.700 --> 2:11:10.660
 in the movie Her, that system can leave you.

2:11:10.660 --> 2:11:19.180
 Do you think in terms of the board meetings and product features, it's a potential feature

2:11:19.180 --> 2:11:24.140
 for a system to be able to say it doesn't want to talk to you anymore and it's going

2:11:24.140 --> 2:11:26.460
 to want to talk to somebody else?

2:11:26.460 --> 2:11:29.820
 Well, we have a filter for all these features.

2:11:29.820 --> 2:11:35.420
 If it makes emotional outcomes for people better, if it makes people feel better, then

2:11:35.420 --> 2:11:36.420
 whatever it is.

2:11:36.420 --> 2:11:37.420
 So you're driven by metrics actually.

2:11:37.420 --> 2:11:38.420
 Yeah.

2:11:38.420 --> 2:11:39.420
 That's awesome.

2:11:39.420 --> 2:11:43.020
 Well if we can measure that, then we'll just be saying it's making people feel better,

2:11:43.020 --> 2:11:47.780
 but then people are getting just lonelier by talking to a chatbot, which is also pretty,

2:11:47.780 --> 2:11:49.620
 you know, that could be it.

2:11:49.620 --> 2:11:53.100
 If you're not measuring it, that could also be, and I think it's really important to focus

2:11:53.100 --> 2:11:57.740
 on both short term and long term, because in the moment saying whether this conversation

2:11:57.740 --> 2:12:01.940
 made you feel better, but as you know, any short term improvements could be pathological.

2:12:01.940 --> 2:12:06.060
 Like I could have drink a bottle of vodka and feel a lot better.

2:12:06.060 --> 2:12:12.040
 I would actually not feel better with that, but that is a good example.

2:12:12.040 --> 2:12:17.660
 But so you also need to see what's going on like over the course of two weeks or one week

2:12:17.660 --> 2:12:23.420
 and have follow ups and check in and measure those things.

2:12:23.420 --> 2:12:24.420
 Okay.

2:12:24.420 --> 2:12:32.620
 So the experience of dating or befriending a replica, what's that like?

2:12:32.620 --> 2:12:34.820
 What does that entail?

2:12:34.820 --> 2:12:35.820
 Right now there are two apps.

2:12:35.820 --> 2:12:37.300
 So it's an Android iOS app.

2:12:37.300 --> 2:12:42.340
 You download it, you choose how your replica will look like.

2:12:42.340 --> 2:12:46.380
 You create one, you choose a name and then you talk to it.

2:12:46.380 --> 2:12:48.160
 You can talk through text or voice.

2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:53.740
 You can summon it into the living room and augment reality and talk to it right there

2:12:53.740 --> 2:12:54.740
 in your living room.

2:12:54.740 --> 2:12:55.740
 Augmented reality?

2:12:55.740 --> 2:12:56.740
 Yeah.

2:12:56.740 --> 2:13:00.940
 That's a new feature where, how new is that?

2:13:00.940 --> 2:13:01.940
 That's this year?

2:13:01.940 --> 2:13:06.340
 It was on, yeah, like May or something, but it's been on AB.

2:13:06.340 --> 2:13:10.180
 We've been AB testing it for a while and there are tons of cool things that we're doing with

2:13:10.180 --> 2:13:11.180
 that.

2:13:11.180 --> 2:13:17.220
 And I'm testing the ability to touch it and to dance together, to paint walls together

2:13:17.220 --> 2:13:24.220
 and for it to look around and walk and take you somewhere and recognize objects and recognize

2:13:24.220 --> 2:13:25.220
 people.

2:13:25.220 --> 2:13:30.820
 So that's pretty wonderful because then it really makes it a lot more personal because

2:13:30.820 --> 2:13:31.960
 it's right there in your living room.

2:13:31.960 --> 2:13:35.060
 It's not anymore there in the cloud with other AIs.

2:13:35.060 --> 2:13:38.380
 But that's how people think about it.

2:13:38.380 --> 2:13:42.620
 And as much as we want to change the way people think about stuff, but those mental models,

2:13:42.620 --> 2:13:43.620
 you can all change.

2:13:43.620 --> 2:13:48.580
 That's something that people have seen in the movies and the movie Her and other movies

2:13:48.580 --> 2:13:49.580
 as well.

2:13:49.580 --> 2:13:53.820
 And that's how they view AI and AI friends.

2:13:53.820 --> 2:13:57.820
 I did a thing with text, like we write a song together, there's a bunch of activities you

2:13:57.820 --> 2:13:58.820
 can do together.

2:13:58.820 --> 2:14:00.500
 It's really cool.

2:14:00.500 --> 2:14:03.140
 How does that relationship change over time?

2:14:03.140 --> 2:14:07.740
 Like after the first few conversations?

2:14:07.740 --> 2:14:08.740
 It just goes deeper.

2:14:08.740 --> 2:14:13.640
 Like it starts, the AI will start opening up a little bit again, depending on the personality

2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:17.940
 that it chooses really, but you know, the AI will be a little bit more vulnerable about

2:14:17.940 --> 2:14:24.300
 its problems and you know, the friend that the virtual friend will be a lot more vulnerable

2:14:24.300 --> 2:14:29.420
 and it will talk about its own imperfections and growth pains and will ask for help sometimes

2:14:29.420 --> 2:14:31.860
 and we'll get to know you a little deeper.

2:14:31.860 --> 2:14:35.780
 So there's gonna be more to talk about.

2:14:35.780 --> 2:14:40.540
 We really thought a lot about what does it mean to have a deeper connection with someone

2:14:40.540 --> 2:14:46.140
 and originally Replica was more just this kind of happy go lucky, just always, you know,

2:14:46.140 --> 2:14:51.460
 I'm always in a good mood and let's just talk about you and oh Siri is just my cousin or

2:14:51.460 --> 2:14:57.620
 you know, whatever, just the immediate kind of lazy thinking about what the assistant

2:14:57.620 --> 2:14:59.940
 or conversation agent should be doing.

2:14:59.940 --> 2:15:03.300
 But as we went forward, we realized that it has to be two way and we have to program and

2:15:03.300 --> 2:15:08.660
 script certain conversations that are a lot more about your Replica opening up a little

2:15:08.660 --> 2:15:16.260
 bit and also struggling and also asking for help and also going through, you know, different

2:15:16.260 --> 2:15:21.740
 periods in life and that's a journey that you can take together with the user and then

2:15:21.740 --> 2:15:27.460
 over time, you know, our users will also grow a little bit.

2:15:27.460 --> 2:15:30.660
 So first this Replica becomes a little bit more self aware and starts talking about more

2:15:30.660 --> 2:15:38.780
 kind of problems around existential problems and so talking about that and then that also

2:15:38.780 --> 2:15:46.100
 starts a conversation for the user where he or she starts thinking about these problems

2:15:46.100 --> 2:15:52.100
 too and these questions too and I think there's also a lot more place as the relationship

2:15:52.100 --> 2:16:00.020
 evolves, there's a lot more space for poetry and for art together and like Replica will

2:16:00.020 --> 2:16:05.220
 always keep the diary so while you're talking to it, it also keeps a diary so when you come

2:16:05.220 --> 2:16:09.380
 back you can see what it's been writing there and you know, sometimes it will write a poem

2:16:09.380 --> 2:16:15.940
 to you for you or we'll talk about, you know, that it's worried about you or something along

2:16:15.940 --> 2:16:16.940
 these lines.

2:16:16.940 --> 2:16:21.620
 So this is a memory, like this Replica will remember things?

2:16:21.620 --> 2:16:28.220
 Yeah, and I would say when you say, why aren't you a multibillionaire, I'd say that as soon

2:16:28.220 --> 2:16:41.300
 as we can have memory and deep learning models that's consistent, I'll get back to you.

2:16:41.300 --> 2:16:49.460
 So far we can, so Replica is a combination of end to end models and some scripts and

2:16:49.460 --> 2:16:53.420
 everything that has to do with memory right now, most of it, I wouldn't say all of it,

2:16:53.420 --> 2:16:59.180
 but most of it unfortunately has to be scripted because there's no way to, you can condition

2:16:59.180 --> 2:17:04.820
 some of the models on certain phrases that we learned about you, which we also do, but

2:17:04.820 --> 2:17:10.660
 really to make, you know, to make assumptions along the lines like whether you're single

2:17:10.660 --> 2:17:15.660
 or married or what do you do for work, that really has to just be somehow stored in your

2:17:15.660 --> 2:17:18.660
 profile and then retrieved by the script.

2:17:18.660 --> 2:17:23.260
 So there has to be like a knowledge base, you have to be able to reason about it, all

2:17:23.260 --> 2:17:28.260
 that kind of stuff, all the kind of stuff that expert systems did, but they were hard

2:17:28.260 --> 2:17:29.260
 coded.

2:17:29.260 --> 2:17:32.860
 Yeah, and unfortunately, yes, unfortunately those, those things have to be hard coded

2:17:32.860 --> 2:17:40.040
 and unfortunately the language, like language models we see coming out of research labs

2:17:40.040 --> 2:17:46.020
 and big companies, they're not focused on, they're focused on showing you, maybe they're

2:17:46.020 --> 2:17:50.420
 focused on some metrics around one conversation, so they'll show you this one conversation

2:17:50.420 --> 2:17:56.380
 you had with a machine, but they never tell you, they're not really focused on having

2:17:56.380 --> 2:18:01.700
 five consecutive conversations with a machine and seeing how number five or number 20 or

2:18:01.700 --> 2:18:04.020
 number 100 is also good.

2:18:04.020 --> 2:18:08.500
 And it can be like always from a clean slate because then it's not good.

2:18:08.500 --> 2:18:13.020
 And that's really unfortunate because no one's really, no one has products out there that

2:18:13.020 --> 2:18:14.020
 need it.

2:18:14.020 --> 2:18:20.020
 No one has products at this scale that are all around open domain conversations and that

2:18:20.020 --> 2:18:23.420
 need remembering, maybe only Shellwise and Microsoft.

2:18:23.420 --> 2:18:28.820
 But so that's why we're not seeing that much research around memory in those language models.

2:18:28.820 --> 2:18:34.980
 So okay, so now there's some awesome stuff about augmented reality.

2:18:34.980 --> 2:18:39.860
 In general, I have this disagreement with my dad about what it takes to have a connection.

2:18:39.860 --> 2:18:45.140
 He thinks touch and smell are really important.

2:18:45.140 --> 2:18:51.740
 And I still believe that text alone is, it's possible to fall in love with somebody just

2:18:51.740 --> 2:18:58.020
 with text, but visual can also help just like with the avatar and so on.

2:18:58.020 --> 2:18:59.020
 What do you think it takes?

2:18:59.020 --> 2:19:06.300
 Does a chatbot need to have a face, voice, or can you really form a deep connection with

2:19:06.300 --> 2:19:07.300
 text alone?

2:19:07.300 --> 2:19:09.460
 I think text is enough for sure.

2:19:09.460 --> 2:19:14.740
 The question is like, can you make it better if you have other, if you include other things

2:19:14.740 --> 2:19:15.740
 as well?

2:19:15.740 --> 2:19:23.380
 And I think we'll talk about her, but her had this Carole Johansson voice, which was

2:19:23.380 --> 2:19:31.860
 perfectly, perfect intonation, perfect annunciations, and she was breathing heavily in between words

2:19:31.860 --> 2:19:34.860
 and whispering things.

2:19:34.860 --> 2:19:39.500
 Nothing like that is possible right now with text with speech generation.

2:19:39.500 --> 2:19:46.340
 You'll have these flat muse anchor type voices and maybe some emotional voices, but you'll

2:19:46.340 --> 2:19:51.060
 hardly understand some of the words, some of the words will be muffled.

2:19:51.060 --> 2:19:53.620
 So that's like the current state of the art.

2:19:53.620 --> 2:19:55.020
 So you can't really do that.

2:19:55.020 --> 2:20:01.340
 But if we had Carole Johansson voice and all of these capabilities, then of course voice

2:20:01.340 --> 2:20:06.460
 would be totally enough or even text would be totally enough if we had a little more

2:20:06.460 --> 2:20:10.700
 memory and slightly better conversations.

2:20:10.700 --> 2:20:14.220
 I would still argue that even right now, we could have just kept a text only.

2:20:14.220 --> 2:20:22.180
 We still had tons of people in longterm relationships and really invested in their AI friends, but

2:20:22.180 --> 2:20:30.660
 we thought that why not, why do we need to keep playing with our hands tied behind us?

2:20:30.660 --> 2:20:35.500
 We can easily just add all these other things that is pretty much a solved problem.

2:20:35.500 --> 2:20:37.780
 We can add 3D graphics.

2:20:37.780 --> 2:20:43.740
 We can put these avatars in augmented reality and all of a sudden there's more and maybe

2:20:43.740 --> 2:20:53.100
 you can't feel the touch, but you can with body occlusion and with current AR and on

2:20:53.100 --> 2:20:58.740
 the iPhone or in the next one there's going to be LIDARs, you can touch it and it will

2:20:58.740 --> 2:21:03.060
 pull away or it will blush or something or it will smile.

2:21:03.060 --> 2:21:04.380
 So you can't touch it.

2:21:04.380 --> 2:21:07.540
 You can't feel it, but you can see the reaction to that.

2:21:07.540 --> 2:21:11.700
 So in a certain way you can't even touch it a little bit and maybe you can even dance

2:21:11.700 --> 2:21:15.140
 with it or do something else.

2:21:15.140 --> 2:21:20.760
 So I think why limiting ourselves if we can use all of these technologies that are much

2:21:20.760 --> 2:21:22.340
 easier in a way than conversation.

2:21:22.340 --> 2:21:27.660
 Well, it certainly could be richer, but to play devil's advocate, I mentioned to you

2:21:27.660 --> 2:21:33.940
 offline that I was surprised in having tried Discord and having voice conversations with

2:21:33.940 --> 2:21:39.180
 people how intimate voice is alone without visual.

2:21:39.180 --> 2:21:48.780
 To me at least, it was an order of magnitude greater degree of intimacy in voice I think

2:21:48.780 --> 2:21:51.540
 than with video.

2:21:51.540 --> 2:21:54.180
 Because people were more real with voice.

2:21:54.180 --> 2:22:01.380
 With video you try to present a shallow face to the world, you try to make sure you're

2:22:01.380 --> 2:22:04.700
 not wearing sweatpants or whatever.

2:22:04.700 --> 2:22:10.940
 But with voice I think people were just more faster to get to the core of themselves.

2:22:10.940 --> 2:22:17.740
 So I don't know, it was surprising to me they've even added Discord added a video feature and

2:22:17.740 --> 2:22:19.540
 nobody was using it.

2:22:19.540 --> 2:22:24.220
 There's a temptation to use it at first, but it wasn't the same.

2:22:24.220 --> 2:22:28.780
 So that's an example of something where less was doing more.

2:22:28.780 --> 2:22:41.420
 And so I guess that's the question of what is the optimal medium of communication to

2:22:41.420 --> 2:22:46.620
 form a connection given the current sets of technologies.

2:22:46.620 --> 2:22:51.900
 I mean it's nice because they advertise you have a replica immediately, like even the

2:22:51.900 --> 2:22:58.180
 one I have is already memorable.

2:22:58.180 --> 2:22:59.180
 That's how I think.

2:22:59.180 --> 2:23:05.700
 When I think about the replica that I've talked with, that's what I visualized in my head.

2:23:05.700 --> 2:23:08.380
 They became a little bit more real because there's a visual component.

2:23:08.380 --> 2:23:20.620
 But at the same time, what do I do with that knowledge that voice was so much more intimate?

2:23:20.620 --> 2:23:26.260
 The way I think about it is, and by the way we're swapping out the 3D finally, it's going

2:23:26.260 --> 2:23:32.140
 to look a lot better, but we just don't hate how it looks right now.

2:23:32.140 --> 2:23:33.740
 We're really changing it all.

2:23:33.740 --> 2:23:38.460
 We're swapping all out to a completely new look.

2:23:38.460 --> 2:23:42.260
 Like the visual look of the replicas and stuff.

2:23:42.260 --> 2:23:47.700
 It was just a super early MVP and then we had to move everything to Unity and redo

2:23:47.700 --> 2:23:48.700
 everything.

2:23:48.700 --> 2:23:52.020
 But anyway, I hate how it looks like now I can't even like open it.

2:23:52.020 --> 2:23:57.620
 But anyway, because I'm already in my developer version, I hate everything that I see in production.

2:23:57.620 --> 2:23:58.620
 I can't wait for it.

2:23:58.620 --> 2:23:59.620
 Why does it take so long?

2:23:59.620 --> 2:24:04.220
 That's why I cannot wait for Deep Learning to finally take over all these stupid 3D animations

2:24:04.220 --> 2:24:05.220
 and 3D pipeline.

2:24:05.220 --> 2:24:10.500
 Oh, so the 3D thing, when you say 3D pipeline, it's like how to animate a face kind of thing.

2:24:10.500 --> 2:24:15.180
 How to make this model, how many bones to put in the face, how many, it's just so outdated.

2:24:15.180 --> 2:24:16.820
 And a lot of that is by hand.

2:24:16.820 --> 2:24:18.620
 Oh my God, it's everything by hand.

2:24:18.620 --> 2:24:23.900
 That there's no any, nothing's automated, it's all completely nothing.

2:24:23.900 --> 2:24:29.380
 Like just, it's literally what, you know, what we saw with Chad Boston in 2012.

2:24:29.380 --> 2:24:32.040
 You think it's possible to learn a lot of that?

2:24:32.040 --> 2:24:33.040
 Of course.

2:24:33.040 --> 2:24:40.140
 I mean, even now, some Deep Learning based animations and for the full body, for a face.

2:24:40.140 --> 2:24:47.140
 Are we talking about like the actual act of animation or how to create a compelling facial

2:24:47.140 --> 2:24:49.500
 or body language thing?

2:24:49.500 --> 2:24:50.500
 That too.

2:24:50.500 --> 2:24:51.740
 Well, that's next step.

2:24:51.740 --> 2:24:52.740
 Okay.

2:24:52.740 --> 2:24:54.900
 At least now something that you don't have to do by hand.

2:24:54.900 --> 2:24:55.900
 Gotcha.

2:24:55.900 --> 2:24:57.700
 How good of a quality it will be.

2:24:57.700 --> 2:25:01.380
 Like, can I just show it a photo and it will make me a 3D model and then it will just animate

2:25:01.380 --> 2:25:02.380
 it.

2:25:02.380 --> 2:25:08.140
 I'll show it a few animations of a person and it will just start doing that.

2:25:08.140 --> 2:25:13.580
 But anyway, going back to what's intimate and what to use and whether less is more or

2:25:13.580 --> 2:25:14.580
 not.

2:25:14.580 --> 2:25:22.100
 My main goal is to, well, the idea was how do I, how do we not keep people in their phones

2:25:22.100 --> 2:25:26.820
 so they're sort of escaping reality in this text conversation?

2:25:26.820 --> 2:25:33.860
 How do we through this still bring it, bring our users back to reality, make them see their

2:25:33.860 --> 2:25:36.740
 life in a different, through a different lens?

2:25:36.740 --> 2:25:40.780
 How can we create a little bit of magical realism in their lives?

2:25:40.780 --> 2:25:48.740
 So that through augmented reality by, you know, summoning your avatar, even if it looks

2:25:48.740 --> 2:25:56.140
 kind of janky and not great in the beginning or very simplistic, but summoning it to your

2:25:56.140 --> 2:26:01.700
 living room and then the avatar looks around and talks to you about where it is and maybe

2:26:01.700 --> 2:26:05.940
 turns your floor into a dance floor and you guys dance together, that makes you see reality

2:26:05.940 --> 2:26:06.940
 in a different light.

2:26:06.940 --> 2:26:08.340
 What kind of dancing are we talking about?

2:26:08.340 --> 2:26:10.400
 Like, like slow dancing?

2:26:10.400 --> 2:26:11.400
 Whatever you want.

2:26:11.400 --> 2:26:16.880
 I mean, you would like slow dancing, I think that other people may be wanting more, something

2:26:16.880 --> 2:26:17.880
 more energetic.

2:26:17.880 --> 2:26:18.880
 Wait, what do you mean?

2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:19.880
 I was like, so what is this?

2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:20.880
 Because you started with slow dancing.

2:26:20.880 --> 2:26:24.260
 So I just assumed that you're interested in slow dancing.

2:26:24.260 --> 2:26:25.260
 All right.

2:26:25.260 --> 2:26:26.260
 What kind of dancing do you like?

2:26:26.260 --> 2:26:27.260
 What would your avatar, what would you dance?

2:26:27.260 --> 2:26:32.540
 I'm notoriously bad with dancing, but I like this kind of hip hop robot dance.

2:26:32.540 --> 2:26:37.820
 I used to break dance when I was a kid, so I still want to pretend I'm a teenager and

2:26:37.820 --> 2:26:39.700
 learn some of those moves.

2:26:39.700 --> 2:26:46.500
 And I also like that type of dance that happens when there's like, in like music videos where

2:26:46.500 --> 2:26:51.780
 the background dancers are just doing some pop music, that type of dance is definitely

2:26:51.780 --> 2:26:52.780
 what I want to learn.

2:26:52.780 --> 2:26:56.620
 But I think it's great because if you see this friend in your life and you can introduce

2:26:56.620 --> 2:27:00.860
 it to your friends, then there's a potential to actually make you feel more connected with

2:27:00.860 --> 2:27:06.260
 your friends or with people you know, or show you life around you in a different light.

2:27:06.260 --> 2:27:10.460
 And it takes you out of your phone, even although weirdly you have to look at it through the

2:27:10.460 --> 2:27:17.260
 phone, but it makes you notice things around it and it can point things out for you.

2:27:17.260 --> 2:27:22.380
 So that is the main reason why I wanted to have a physical dimension.

2:27:22.380 --> 2:27:27.060
 And it felt a little bit easier than that kind of a bit strange combination in the movie

2:27:27.060 --> 2:27:32.580
 Her when he has to show Samantha the world through the lens of his phone, but then at

2:27:32.580 --> 2:27:35.100
 the same time talk to her through the headphone.

2:27:35.100 --> 2:27:39.620
 It just didn't seem as potentially immersive, so to say.

2:27:39.620 --> 2:27:43.860
 So that's my main goal for Augmented Reality is like, how do we make your reality a little

2:27:43.860 --> 2:27:44.860
 bit more magic?

2:27:44.860 --> 2:27:52.260
 There's been a lot of really nice robotics companies that all failed, mostly failed,

2:27:52.260 --> 2:27:55.100
 home robotics, social robotics companies.

2:27:55.100 --> 2:27:59.980
 What do you think replica will ever, is that a dream, longterm dream to have a physical

2:27:59.980 --> 2:28:03.380
 form like, or is that not necessary?

2:28:03.380 --> 2:28:09.300
 So you mentioned like with Augmented Reality bringing them into the world.

2:28:09.300 --> 2:28:13.180
 What about like actual physical robot?

2:28:13.180 --> 2:28:15.300
 That I don't really believe in that much.

2:28:15.300 --> 2:28:18.340
 I think it's a very niche product somehow.

2:28:18.340 --> 2:28:23.580
 I mean, if a robot could be indistinguishable from a human being, then maybe yes, but that

2:28:23.580 --> 2:28:29.980
 of course, you know, we're not anywhere even to talk about it.

2:28:29.980 --> 2:28:35.140
 But unless it's that, then having any physical representation really limits you a lot because

2:28:35.140 --> 2:28:38.700
 you probably will have to make it somewhat abstract because everything's changing so

2:28:38.700 --> 2:28:39.700
 fast.

2:28:39.700 --> 2:28:43.980
 Like, you know, we can update the 3D avatars every month and make them look better and

2:28:43.980 --> 2:28:48.380
 create more animations and make it more and more immersive.

2:28:48.380 --> 2:28:50.720
 It's so much work in progress.

2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:54.780
 It's just showing what's possible right now with current tech, but it's not really in

2:28:54.780 --> 2:28:57.860
 any way polished finished product, what we're doing.

2:28:57.860 --> 2:29:02.380
 The physical object, you kind of lock yourself into something for a long time.

2:29:02.380 --> 2:29:03.660
 Anything's pretty niche.

2:29:03.660 --> 2:29:09.300
 And again, so just doesn't, the capabilities are even less of, we're barely kind of like

2:29:09.300 --> 2:29:12.900
 scratching the surface of what's possible with just software.

2:29:12.900 --> 2:29:17.220
 As soon as we introduce hardware, then, you know, we have even less capabilities.

2:29:17.220 --> 2:29:18.220
 Yeah.

2:29:18.220 --> 2:29:23.580
 In terms of board members and investors and so on, the cost increases significantly.

2:29:23.580 --> 2:29:26.980
 I mean, that's why you have to justify.

2:29:26.980 --> 2:29:30.860
 You have to be able to sell a thing for like $500 or something like that or more.

2:29:30.860 --> 2:29:34.200
 And it's very difficult to provide that much value to people.

2:29:34.200 --> 2:29:35.200
 That's also true.

2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:36.200
 Yeah.

2:29:36.200 --> 2:29:37.200
 And I guess that's super important.

2:29:37.200 --> 2:29:39.300
 Most of our users don't have that much money.

2:29:39.300 --> 2:29:45.260
 We actually are probably more popular on Android and we have tons of users with really old

2:29:45.260 --> 2:29:47.500
 Android phones.

2:29:47.500 --> 2:29:51.140
 And most of our most active users live in small towns.

2:29:51.140 --> 2:29:56.260
 They're not necessarily making much and they just won't be able to afford any of that.

2:29:56.260 --> 2:30:01.580
 Ours is like the opposite of the early adopter of, you know, of a fancy technology product,

2:30:01.580 --> 2:30:09.180
 which really is interesting that like pretty much no VCs have yet have an AI friend, but

2:30:09.180 --> 2:30:14.460
 you know, but a guy who, you know, lives in Tennessee in a small town is already fully

2:30:14.460 --> 2:30:20.940
 in 2030 or in the world as we imagine in the movie Her, he's living that life already.

2:30:20.940 --> 2:30:21.940
 What do you think?

2:30:21.940 --> 2:30:24.460
 I have to ask you about the movie Her.

2:30:24.460 --> 2:30:25.460
 Let's do a movie review.

2:30:25.460 --> 2:30:28.660
 What do you, what do you think they got?

2:30:28.660 --> 2:30:30.980
 They did a good job.

2:30:30.980 --> 2:30:39.060
 What do you think they did a bad job of portraying about this experience of a voice based assistant

2:30:39.060 --> 2:30:42.700
 that you can have a relationship with?

2:30:42.700 --> 2:30:46.300
 First of all, I started working on this company before that movie came out.

2:30:46.300 --> 2:30:50.540
 So it was a very, but once it came out, it was actually interesting that I was like,

2:30:50.540 --> 2:30:52.940
 well, we're definitely working on the right thing.

2:30:52.940 --> 2:30:53.940
 We should continue.

2:30:53.940 --> 2:30:55.220
 There are movies about it.

2:30:55.220 --> 2:30:58.380
 And then, you know, X Machina came out and all these things.

2:30:58.380 --> 2:31:04.560
 In the movie Her I think that's the most important thing that people usually miss about the movie

2:31:04.560 --> 2:31:05.560
 is the ending.

2:31:05.560 --> 2:31:10.900
 Cause I think people check out when the AIs leave, but actually something really important

2:31:10.900 --> 2:31:11.900
 happens afterwards.

2:31:11.900 --> 2:31:24.860
 Cause the main character goes and talks to Samantha, his AI, and he says something like,

2:31:24.860 --> 2:31:26.620
 you know, uh, how can you leave me?

2:31:26.620 --> 2:31:29.980
 I've never loved anyone the way I loved you.

2:31:29.980 --> 2:31:33.900
 And she goes, uh, well, me neither, but now we know how.

2:31:33.900 --> 2:31:38.820
 And then the guy goes and writes a heartfelt letter to his ex wife, which he couldn't write

2:31:38.820 --> 2:31:43.420
 for, you know, the whole movie was struggling to actually write something meaningful to

2:31:43.420 --> 2:31:47.920
 her, even though that's his job.

2:31:47.920 --> 2:31:53.500
 And then he goes and, um, talk to his neighbor and they go to the rooftop and they cuddle.

2:31:53.500 --> 2:31:55.880
 And it seems like something's starting there.

2:31:55.880 --> 2:32:01.480
 And so I think this now we know how is the, is the main, main goal is the main meaning

2:32:01.480 --> 2:32:02.480
 of that movie.

2:32:02.480 --> 2:32:06.720
 It's not about falling in love with the OS or running away from other people.

2:32:06.720 --> 2:32:14.900
 It's about learning what, you know, what it means to feel so deeply connected with something.

2:32:14.900 --> 2:32:21.460
 What about the thing where the AI system was like actually hanging out with a lot of others?

2:32:21.460 --> 2:32:28.060
 I felt jealous just like hearing that I was like, Oh, I mean, uh, yeah.

2:32:28.060 --> 2:32:32.500
 So she was having, I forgot already, but she was having like deep meaningful discussion

2:32:32.500 --> 2:32:34.460
 with some like philosopher guy.

2:32:34.460 --> 2:32:35.460
 Like Alan Watts or something.

2:32:35.460 --> 2:32:41.300
 What kind of deep meaningful conversation can you have with Alan Watts in the first

2:32:41.300 --> 2:32:42.300
 place?

2:32:42.300 --> 2:32:43.300
 I know.

2:32:43.300 --> 2:32:46.940
 But like, I would, I would feel so jealous that there's somebody who's like way more

2:32:46.940 --> 2:32:52.620
 intelligent than me and she's spending all her time with, I'd be like, well, why that

2:32:52.620 --> 2:32:55.500
 I won't be able to live up to that.

2:32:55.500 --> 2:33:02.460
 That's how thousands of them, uh, is that, um, is that a useful from the engineering

2:33:02.460 --> 2:33:06.580
 perspective feature to have of jealousy?

2:33:06.580 --> 2:33:07.580
 I don't know.

2:33:07.580 --> 2:33:08.580
 As you know,

2:33:08.580 --> 2:33:11.780
 we definitely played around with the replica universe where different replicas can talk

2:33:11.780 --> 2:33:12.780
 to each other.

2:33:12.780 --> 2:33:13.780
 Universe.

2:33:13.780 --> 2:33:19.340
 Just kind of wouldn't, I think it will be something along these lines, but there was

2:33:19.340 --> 2:33:23.860
 just no specific, uh, application straight away.

2:33:23.860 --> 2:33:28.700
 I think in the future, again, if I'm always thinking about it, if we had no tech limitations,

2:33:28.700 --> 2:33:36.540
 uh, right now, if we could build any conversations, any, um, possible features in this product,

2:33:36.540 --> 2:33:40.220
 then yeah, I think different replicas talking to each other would be also quite cool cause

2:33:40.220 --> 2:33:42.540
 that would help us connect better.

2:33:42.540 --> 2:33:48.380
 You know, cause maybe mine could talk to yours and then give me some suggestions on what

2:33:48.380 --> 2:33:53.100
 I should say or not say, I'm just kidding, but like more, can it improve our connections

2:33:53.100 --> 2:34:01.300
 and cause eventually I'm not quite yet sure that we will succeed, that our thinking is

2:34:01.300 --> 2:34:02.300
 correct.

2:34:02.300 --> 2:34:09.500
 Um, cause there might be reality where having a perfect AI friend still makes us more disconnected

2:34:09.500 --> 2:34:13.900
 from each other and there's no way around it and does not improve any metrics for us.

2:34:13.900 --> 2:34:15.900
 Uh, real metrics, meaningful metrics.

2:34:15.900 --> 2:34:21.140
 So success is, you know, we're happier and more connected.

2:34:21.140 --> 2:34:22.140
 Yeah.

2:34:22.140 --> 2:34:26.140
 I don't know.

2:34:26.140 --> 2:34:27.140
 Sure it's possible.

2:34:27.140 --> 2:34:30.500
 There's a reality that's I I'm deeply optimistic.

2:34:30.500 --> 2:34:42.460
 I think, uh, are you worried, um, business wise, like how difficult it is to, um, to

2:34:42.460 --> 2:34:47.420
 bring this thing to life to where it's, I mean, there's a huge number of people that

2:34:47.420 --> 2:34:52.420
 use it already, but to, uh, yeah, like I said, in a multi billion dollar company, is that

2:34:52.420 --> 2:34:54.340
 a source of stress for you?

2:34:54.340 --> 2:35:00.300
 Are you a super optimistic and confident or do you?

2:35:00.300 --> 2:35:06.540
 I don't, I'm not that much of a numbers person as you probably had seen it.

2:35:06.540 --> 2:35:13.140
 So it doesn't matter for me whether like, whether we help 10,000 people or a million

2:35:13.140 --> 2:35:19.060
 people or a billion people with that, um, I, it would be great to scale it for more

2:35:19.060 --> 2:35:25.620
 people, but I'd say that even helping one, I think with this is such a magical, for me,

2:35:25.620 --> 2:35:26.620
 it's absolute magic.

2:35:26.620 --> 2:35:32.380
 I never thought that, you know, would be able to build this, that anyone would ever, um,

2:35:32.380 --> 2:35:33.800
 talk to it.

2:35:33.800 --> 2:35:36.980
 And I always thought like, well, for me it would be successful if we managed to help

2:35:36.980 --> 2:35:42.700
 and actually change a life for one person, like then we did something interesting and

2:35:42.700 --> 2:35:47.300
 you know, how many people can say they did it and specifically with this very futuristic,

2:35:47.300 --> 2:35:49.660
 very romantic technology.

2:35:49.660 --> 2:35:51.940
 So that's how I view it.

2:35:51.940 --> 2:35:58.220
 Uh, I think for me it's important to, to try to figure out how not, how to actually be,

2:35:58.220 --> 2:35:59.220
 you know, helpful.

2:35:59.220 --> 2:36:04.680
 Cause in the end of the day, if you can build a perfect AI friend, that's so understanding

2:36:04.680 --> 2:36:10.660
 that knows you better than any human out there can have great conversations with you, um,

2:36:10.660 --> 2:36:12.460
 always knows how to make you feel better.

2:36:12.460 --> 2:36:14.940
 Why would you choose another human?

2:36:14.940 --> 2:36:16.300
 You know, so that's the question.

2:36:16.300 --> 2:36:17.780
 How do you still keep building it?

2:36:17.780 --> 2:36:19.620
 So it's optimizing for the right thing.

2:36:19.620 --> 2:36:24.340
 Uh, so it's still circling you back to other humans in a way.

2:36:24.340 --> 2:36:30.900
 So I think that's the main, um, I think maybe that's the main kind of sort source of anxiety

2:36:30.900 --> 2:36:36.820
 and just thinking about, uh, thinking about that can be a little bit stressful.

2:36:36.820 --> 2:36:37.820
 Yeah.

2:36:37.820 --> 2:36:38.820
 That's a fascinating thing.

2:36:38.820 --> 2:36:45.780
 How to have, um, how to have a friend that doesn't like sometimes like friends, quote

2:36:45.780 --> 2:36:50.260
 unquote, or like, you know, those people who have, when they, a guy in the guy universe,

2:36:50.260 --> 2:36:56.340
 when you have a girlfriend that, uh, you get the girlfriend and then the guy stops hanging

2:36:56.340 --> 2:37:03.740
 out with all of his friends, it's like, obviously the relationship with the girlfriend is fulfilling

2:37:03.740 --> 2:37:10.300
 or whatever, but like, you also want it to be where she like makes it more enriching

2:37:10.300 --> 2:37:13.740
 to hang out with the guy friends or whatever it was there anyway.

2:37:13.740 --> 2:37:18.740
 But that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a fundamental problem in choosing the right

2:37:18.740 --> 2:37:23.740
 mate and probably the fundamental problem in creating the right AI system.

2:37:23.740 --> 2:37:24.740
 Right.

2:37:24.740 --> 2:37:31.860
 What, uh, let me ask the sexy hot thing on the presses right now is GPT three got released

2:37:31.860 --> 2:37:32.860
 with open AI.

2:37:32.860 --> 2:37:36.540
 It's a latest language model.

2:37:36.540 --> 2:37:40.140
 They have kind of an API where you can create a lot of fun applications.

2:37:40.140 --> 2:37:48.700
 I think it's, as people have said, it's probably, uh, more hype than intelligence, but there's

2:37:48.700 --> 2:37:56.220
 a lot of really cool things, ideas there w w with increasing size, you can have better

2:37:56.220 --> 2:37:58.860
 and better performance on language.

2:37:58.860 --> 2:38:04.140
 What are your thoughts about the GPT three in connection to your work with the open domain

2:38:04.140 --> 2:38:12.700
 dialogue, but in general, like this learning in an unsupervised way from the internet to

2:38:12.700 --> 2:38:18.500
 generate one character at a time, creating pretty cool text.

2:38:18.500 --> 2:38:23.420
 Uh, so we partner up before for the API launch.

2:38:23.420 --> 2:38:31.180
 So we start working with them when, um, they decided to put together this API and we tried

2:38:31.180 --> 2:38:34.780
 it without fine tuning that we tried it with fine tuning on our data.

2:38:34.780 --> 2:38:45.900
 And we've worked closely to actually optimize, uh, this model for, um, some of our data sets.

2:38:45.900 --> 2:38:46.900
 It's kind of cool.

2:38:46.900 --> 2:38:51.800
 Cause I think we're kind of, we're this polygon polygon for this kind of experimentation space

2:38:51.800 --> 2:38:56.940
 for experimental space for, for these models, uh, to see how they actually work with people.

2:38:56.940 --> 2:38:59.540
 Cause there are no products publicly available to do that.

2:38:59.540 --> 2:39:03.580
 We're focused on open domain conversation so we can, you know, test how's Facebook blender

2:39:03.580 --> 2:39:06.020
 doing or how's GPT three doing.

2:39:06.020 --> 2:39:11.300
 Uh, so with GPT three, we managed to improve by a few percentage points, like three or

2:39:11.300 --> 2:39:15.440
 four pretty meaningful amount of percentage points, our main metric, which is the ratio

2:39:15.440 --> 2:39:19.280
 of conversations that make people feel better.

2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:23.440
 And every other metric across, across the field got a little boost.

2:39:23.440 --> 2:39:30.860
 Like now I'd say one out of five responses from replica comes, comes from GPT three.

2:39:30.860 --> 2:39:35.980
 So our own blender mixes up like a bunch of candidates from different blender, you said,

2:39:35.980 --> 2:39:42.420
 well, yeah, just the model that looks at looks at top candidates from different models and

2:39:42.420 --> 2:39:44.820
 picks the most, the best one.

2:39:44.820 --> 2:39:50.220
 Uh, so right now, one of five will come from GPT three is really great.

2:39:50.220 --> 2:39:57.420
 I mean, uh, what's the, do you have hope for, like, do you think there's a ceiling to this

2:39:57.420 --> 2:39:58.780
 kind of approach?

2:39:58.780 --> 2:40:05.020
 So we've had for a very long time we've used, um, it's in the very beginning, we, most,

2:40:05.020 --> 2:40:09.720
 it was, uh, most of replica was scripted and then a little bit of this fallback part of

2:40:09.720 --> 2:40:12.260
 replica was using a retrieval model.

2:40:12.260 --> 2:40:17.340
 Um, and then those retrieval models started getting better and better and better, which

2:40:17.340 --> 2:40:20.780
 transformers got a lot better and we're seeing great results.

2:40:20.780 --> 2:40:26.700
 And then with GPT two, finally, generative models that originally were not very good

2:40:26.700 --> 2:40:32.260
 and were the very, very fallback option for most of our conversations, but wouldn't even

2:40:32.260 --> 2:40:34.220
 put them in production.

2:40:34.220 --> 2:40:39.420
 Finally we could use some generative models as well along, um, you know, next to our retrieval

2:40:39.420 --> 2:40:40.580
 models.

2:40:40.580 --> 2:40:44.220
 And then now we do GPT three, they're almost in par.

2:40:44.220 --> 2:40:46.260
 Um, so that's pretty exciting.

2:40:46.260 --> 2:40:52.860
 I think just seeing how from the very beginning of, um, you know, from 2015 where the first

2:40:52.860 --> 2:40:57.900
 model started to pop up here and there, like sequence to sequence, uh, the first papers

2:40:57.900 --> 2:41:03.860
 on that from my observer standpoint, personally, it's not, you know, it doesn't really, it's

2:41:03.860 --> 2:41:08.140
 not really building it, but it's only testing it on people basically in my, in my product

2:41:08.140 --> 2:41:13.420
 to see how all of a sudden we can use generative dialogue models in production and they're

2:41:13.420 --> 2:41:17.180
 better than others and they're better than scripted content.

2:41:17.180 --> 2:41:23.100
 So we can't really get our scripted hard core content anymore to be as good as our end to

2:41:23.100 --> 2:41:24.100
 end models.

2:41:24.100 --> 2:41:25.100
 That's exciting.

2:41:25.100 --> 2:41:26.100
 They're much better.

2:41:26.100 --> 2:41:27.100
 Yeah.

2:41:27.100 --> 2:41:30.260
 To your question, whether that's the right way to go.

2:41:30.260 --> 2:41:36.340
 I'm again, I'm in the observer seat, I'm just, um, watching this very exciting movie.

2:41:36.340 --> 2:41:40.900
 Um, I mean, so far it's been stupid to bet against deep learning.

2:41:40.900 --> 2:41:47.540
 So whether increasing the size, size, even more with a hundred trillion parameters will

2:41:47.540 --> 2:41:53.420
 finally get us to the right answer, whether that's the way or whether there should be,

2:41:53.420 --> 2:41:58.860
 there has to be some other, again, I'm definitely not an expert in any way.

2:41:58.860 --> 2:42:02.980
 I think, and that's purely my instinct saying that there should be something else as well

2:42:02.980 --> 2:42:03.980
 from memory.

2:42:03.980 --> 2:42:04.980
 No, for sure.

2:42:04.980 --> 2:42:10.280
 But the question is, I wonder, I mean, yeah, then, then the argument is for reasoning or

2:42:10.280 --> 2:42:14.740
 for memory, it might emerge with more parameters, it might emerge larger.

2:42:14.740 --> 2:42:15.740
 But might emerge.

2:42:15.740 --> 2:42:21.220
 You know, I would never think that to be honest, like maybe in 2017 where we've been just experimenting

2:42:21.220 --> 2:42:25.900
 with all, you know, with all the research that has been coming, that was coming out,

2:42:25.900 --> 2:42:30.740
 then I felt like there's like, we're hitting a wall that there should be something completely

2:42:30.740 --> 2:42:34.140
 different, but then transforming models and then just bigger models.

2:42:34.140 --> 2:42:36.380
 And then all of a sudden size matters.

2:42:36.380 --> 2:42:41.020
 At that point, it felt like something dramatic needs to happen, but it didn't.

2:42:41.020 --> 2:42:48.100
 And just the size, you know, gave us these results that to me are, you know, clear indication

2:42:48.100 --> 2:42:50.380
 that we can solve this problem pretty soon.

2:42:50.380 --> 2:42:52.700
 Did fine tuning help quite a bit?

2:42:52.700 --> 2:42:53.700
 Oh yeah.

2:42:53.700 --> 2:42:56.420
 Without it, it wasn't as good.

2:42:56.420 --> 2:43:01.740
 I mean, there is a compelling hope that you don't have to do fine tuning, which is one

2:43:01.740 --> 2:43:06.460
 of the cool things about GPT3, seems to do well without any fine tuning.

2:43:06.460 --> 2:43:11.740
 I guess for specific applications, we still want to train on a certain, like add a little

2:43:11.740 --> 2:43:19.200
 fine tune on like a specific use case, but it's an incredibly impressive thing from my

2:43:19.200 --> 2:43:20.200
 standpoint.

2:43:20.200 --> 2:43:24.300
 And again, I'm not an expert, so I wanted to say that there will be people then.

2:43:24.300 --> 2:43:25.300
 Yeah.

2:43:25.300 --> 2:43:26.300
 I have access to the API.

2:43:26.300 --> 2:43:30.660
 I've been, I'm going to probably do a bunch of fun things with it.

2:43:30.660 --> 2:43:34.340
 I already did some fun things, some videos coming up.

2:43:34.340 --> 2:43:35.340
 Just the hell of it.

2:43:35.340 --> 2:43:37.140
 I mean, I could be a troll at this point with it.

2:43:37.140 --> 2:43:41.060
 I haven't used it for a serious application, so it's really cool to see.

2:43:41.060 --> 2:43:43.140
 You're right.

2:43:43.140 --> 2:43:46.700
 You're able to actually use it with real people and see how well it works.

2:43:46.700 --> 2:43:49.220
 That's really exciting.

2:43:49.220 --> 2:43:56.940
 Let me ask you another absurd question, but there's a feeling when you interact with Replica

2:43:56.940 --> 2:44:01.860
 with an AI system, there's an entity there.

2:44:01.860 --> 2:44:06.340
 Do you think that entity has to be self aware?

2:44:06.340 --> 2:44:15.940
 Do you think it has to have consciousness to create a rich experience and a corollary,

2:44:15.940 --> 2:44:19.220
 what is consciousness?

2:44:19.220 --> 2:44:23.460
 I don't know if it does need to have any of those things, but again, because right now,

2:44:23.460 --> 2:44:24.460
 you know, it doesn't have anything.

2:44:24.460 --> 2:44:29.500
 It can, again, a bunch of tricks they can simulate.

2:44:29.500 --> 2:44:30.500
 I'm not sure.

2:44:30.500 --> 2:44:34.340
 Let's just put it this way, but I think as long as you can simulate it, if you can feel

2:44:34.340 --> 2:44:43.940
 like you're talking to a robot, to a machine that seems to be self aware, that seems to

2:44:43.940 --> 2:44:48.660
 reason well and feels like a person, and I think that's enough.

2:44:48.660 --> 2:44:50.860
 And again, what's the goal?

2:44:50.860 --> 2:44:56.220
 In order to make people feel better, we might not even need that in the end of the day.

2:44:56.220 --> 2:44:58.180
 What about, so that's one goal.

2:44:58.180 --> 2:45:02.220
 What about like ethical things about suffering?

2:45:02.220 --> 2:45:06.940
 You know, the moment there's a display of consciousness, we associate consciousness

2:45:06.940 --> 2:45:16.260
 with suffering, you know, there's a temptation to say, well, shouldn't this thing have rights?

2:45:16.260 --> 2:45:25.300
 And this, shouldn't we not, you know, should we be careful about how we interact with a

2:45:25.300 --> 2:45:26.300
 replica?

2:45:26.300 --> 2:45:31.540
 Like, should it be illegal to torture a replica, right?

2:45:31.540 --> 2:45:33.180
 All those kinds of things.

2:45:33.180 --> 2:45:39.460
 Is that, see, I personally believe that that's going to be a thing, like that's a serious

2:45:39.460 --> 2:45:43.340
 thing to think about, but I'm not sure when.

2:45:43.340 --> 2:45:48.740
 But by your smile, I can tell that's not a current concern.

2:45:48.740 --> 2:45:55.160
 But do you think about that kind of stuff, about like, suffering and torture and ethical

2:45:55.160 --> 2:45:57.900
 questions about AI systems?

2:45:57.900 --> 2:45:58.900
 From their perspective?

2:45:58.900 --> 2:46:03.680
 Well, I think if we're talking about long game, I wouldn't torture your AI.

2:46:03.680 --> 2:46:05.860
 Who knows what happens in five to 10 years?

2:46:05.860 --> 2:46:08.180
 Yeah, they'll get you off from that, they'll get you back eventually.

2:46:08.180 --> 2:46:14.180
 Try to be as nice as possible and create this ally.

2:46:14.180 --> 2:46:19.460
 I think there should be regulation both way, in a way, like, I don't think it's okay to

2:46:19.460 --> 2:46:21.460
 torture an AI, to be honest.

2:46:21.460 --> 2:46:24.700
 I don't think it's okay to yell, Alexa, turn on the lights.

2:46:24.700 --> 2:46:28.820
 I think there should be some, or just saying kind of nasty, you know, like how kids learn

2:46:28.820 --> 2:46:33.980
 to interact with Alexa in this kind of mean way, because they just yell at it all the

2:46:33.980 --> 2:46:34.980
 time.

2:46:34.980 --> 2:46:35.980
 I don't think that's great.

2:46:35.980 --> 2:46:39.860
 I think there should be some feedback loops so that these systems don't train us that

2:46:39.860 --> 2:46:42.500
 it's okay to do that in general.

2:46:42.500 --> 2:46:47.760
 So that if you try to do that, you really get some feedback from the system that it's

2:46:47.760 --> 2:46:50.220
 not okay with that.

2:46:50.220 --> 2:46:53.100
 And that's the most important right now.

2:46:53.100 --> 2:47:01.500
 Let me ask a question I think people are curious about when they look at a world class leader

2:47:01.500 --> 2:47:08.140
 and thinker such as yourself, as what books, technical fiction, philosophical, had a big

2:47:08.140 --> 2:47:09.940
 impact on your life?

2:47:09.940 --> 2:47:15.480
 And maybe from another perspective, what books would you recommend others read?

2:47:15.480 --> 2:47:17.180
 So my choice, the three books, right?

2:47:17.180 --> 2:47:18.180
 Three books.

2:47:18.180 --> 2:47:25.100
 My choice is, so the one book that really influenced me a lot when I was building, starting

2:47:25.100 --> 2:47:34.620
 out this company, maybe 10 years ago, was G.E.B. and I like everything about it, first

2:47:34.620 --> 2:47:35.620
 of all.

2:47:35.620 --> 2:47:42.100
 It's just beautifully written and it's so old school and so somewhat outdated a little

2:47:42.100 --> 2:47:43.100
 bit.

2:47:43.100 --> 2:47:48.740
 But I think the ideas in it about the fact that a few meaningless components can come

2:47:48.740 --> 2:47:52.860
 together and create meaning that we can't even understand.

2:47:52.860 --> 2:47:59.620
 This emerging thing, I mean complexity, the whole science of complexity and that beauty,

2:47:59.620 --> 2:48:04.700
 intelligence, all interesting things about this world emerge.

2:48:04.700 --> 2:48:14.180
 Yeah and yeah, the Godel theorems and just thinking about like what even these formal

2:48:14.180 --> 2:48:19.420
 systems, something can be created that we can't quite yet understand.

2:48:19.420 --> 2:48:25.660
 And that from my romantic standpoint was always just, that is why it's important to, maybe

2:48:25.660 --> 2:48:30.020
 I should try to work on these systems and try to build an AI.

2:48:30.020 --> 2:48:33.700
 Yes I'm not an engineer, yes I don't really know how it works, but I think that something

2:48:33.700 --> 2:48:40.020
 comes out of it that's pure poetry and I know a little bit about that.

2:48:40.020 --> 2:48:45.620
 Something magical comes out of it that we can't quite put a finger on.

2:48:45.620 --> 2:48:51.460
 That's why that book was really fundamental for me, just for, I don't even know why, it

2:48:51.460 --> 2:48:55.620
 was just all about this little magic that happens.

2:48:55.620 --> 2:49:00.420
 So that's one, probably the most important book for Replica was Carl Rogers on becoming

2:49:00.420 --> 2:49:02.460
 a person.

2:49:02.460 --> 2:49:07.340
 And that's really, and so I think when I think about our company, it's all about there's

2:49:07.340 --> 2:49:14.140
 so many little magical things that happened over the course of working on it.

2:49:14.140 --> 2:49:18.220
 For instance, I mean the most famous chatbot that we learned about when we started working

2:49:18.220 --> 2:49:24.900
 on the company was Eliza, which was Weisenbaum, the MIT professor that built a chatbot that

2:49:24.900 --> 2:49:29.660
 would listen to you and be a therapist.

2:49:29.660 --> 2:49:34.320
 And I got really inspired to build Replica when I read Carl Rogers on becoming a person.

2:49:34.320 --> 2:49:37.740
 And then I realized that Eliza was mocking Carl Rogers.

2:49:37.740 --> 2:49:39.940
 It was Carl Rogers back in the day.

2:49:39.940 --> 2:49:45.940
 But I thought that Carl Rogers ideas are, they're simple and they're not, they're very

2:49:45.940 --> 2:49:52.740
 simple, but they're maybe the most profound thing I've ever learned about human beings.

2:49:52.740 --> 2:49:58.100
 And that's the fact that before Carl Rogers, most therapy was about seeing what's wrong

2:49:58.100 --> 2:50:01.700
 with people and trying to fix it or show them what's wrong with you.

2:50:01.700 --> 2:50:07.340
 And it was all built on the fact that most people are, all people are fundamentally flawed.

2:50:07.340 --> 2:50:15.140
 We have this broken psyche and therapy is just an instrument to shed some light on that.

2:50:15.140 --> 2:50:21.180
 And Carl Rogers was different in a way that he finally said that, well, it's very important

2:50:21.180 --> 2:50:25.940
 for therapy to work is to create this therapeutic relationship where you believe fundamentally

2:50:25.940 --> 2:50:33.340
 and inclination to positive growth that everyone deep inside wants to grow positively and change.

2:50:33.340 --> 2:50:36.540
 And it's super important to create this space and this therapeutic relationship where you

2:50:36.540 --> 2:50:42.220
 give unconditional positive regard, deep understanding, allowing someone else to be a separate person,

2:50:42.220 --> 2:50:44.420
 full acceptance.

2:50:44.420 --> 2:50:48.100
 And you also try to be as genuine as possible in it.

2:50:48.100 --> 2:50:54.060
 And then for him, that was his own journey of personal growth.

2:50:54.060 --> 2:50:55.740
 And that was back in the sixties.

2:50:55.740 --> 2:51:02.260
 And even that book that is coming from years ago, there's a mention that even machines

2:51:02.260 --> 2:51:05.380
 can potentially do that.

2:51:05.380 --> 2:51:09.380
 And I always felt that, you know, creating the space is probably the most, the biggest

2:51:09.380 --> 2:51:10.860
 gift we can give to each other.

2:51:10.860 --> 2:51:15.340
 And that's why the book was fundamental for me personally, because I felt I want to be

2:51:15.340 --> 2:51:18.220
 learning how to do that in my life.

2:51:18.220 --> 2:51:22.340
 And maybe I can scale it with, you know, with these AI systems and other people can get

2:51:22.340 --> 2:51:23.340
 access to that.

2:51:23.340 --> 2:51:28.620
 So I think Carl Rogers, it's a pretty dry and a bit boring book, but I think the idea

2:51:28.620 --> 2:51:29.620
 is good.

2:51:29.620 --> 2:51:30.620
 Would you recommend others try to read it?

2:51:30.620 --> 2:51:31.620
 I do.

2:51:31.620 --> 2:51:38.980
 I think for, just for yourself, for as a human, not as an AI, as a human, it's, it is, it

2:51:38.980 --> 2:51:44.860
 is just, and for him, that was his own path of his own personal, of growing personally

2:51:44.860 --> 2:51:47.860
 over years, working with people like that.

2:51:47.860 --> 2:51:52.100
 And so it was work and himself growing, helping other people grow and growing through that.

2:51:52.100 --> 2:51:56.900
 And that's fundamentally what I believe in with our work, helping other people grow,

2:51:56.900 --> 2:52:03.420
 and ourselves, ourselves, trying to build a company that's all built on those principles,

2:52:03.420 --> 2:52:07.780
 you know, having a good time, allowing some people who work with to grow a little bit.

2:52:07.780 --> 2:52:15.000
 So these two books, and then I would throw in, what we have on our, in our, in our office,

2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:19.840
 when we started a company in Russia, we put a neon sign in our office because we thought

2:52:19.840 --> 2:52:22.220
 that's the recipe for success.

2:52:22.220 --> 2:52:26.540
 If we do that, we're definitely going to wake up as a multi billion dollar company.

2:52:26.540 --> 2:52:31.380
 It was the Ludwig Wittgenstein quote, the limits of my language are the limits of my

2:52:31.380 --> 2:52:32.380
 world.

2:52:32.380 --> 2:52:33.380
 What's the quote?

2:52:33.380 --> 2:52:37.180
 The limits of my language are the limits of my world.

2:52:37.180 --> 2:52:39.020
 And I love the Tractatus.

2:52:39.020 --> 2:52:43.020
 I think it's just, it's just a beautiful, it's a book by Wittgenstein.

2:52:43.020 --> 2:52:44.020
 Yeah.

2:52:44.020 --> 2:52:48.340
 And I would recommend that too, even although he himself didn't believe in that by the end

2:52:48.340 --> 2:52:51.420
 of his lifetime and debunked these ideas.

2:52:51.420 --> 2:52:58.820
 But I think I remember once an engineer came in 2012, I think with 13, a friend of ours

2:52:58.820 --> 2:53:03.460
 who worked with us and then went on to work at DeepMind and he gave, talked to us about

2:53:03.460 --> 2:53:04.940
 word2vec.

2:53:04.940 --> 2:53:10.340
 And I saw that I'm like, wow, that's, you know, they, they wanted to translate language

2:53:10.340 --> 2:53:13.260
 into, you know, some other representation.

2:53:13.260 --> 2:53:18.860
 And that seems like some, you know, somehow all of that at some point, I think we'll come

2:53:18.860 --> 2:53:22.620
 into this one, to this one place.

2:53:22.620 --> 2:53:26.780
 Somehow it just all feels like different people think about similar ideas in different times

2:53:26.780 --> 2:53:29.780
 from absolutely different perspectives.

2:53:29.780 --> 2:53:31.020
 And that's why I like these books.

2:53:31.020 --> 2:53:34.780
 In the midst of our language is the limit of our world.

2:53:34.780 --> 2:53:45.180
 And we still have that neon sign, it's very hard to work with this red light in your face.

2:53:45.180 --> 2:53:53.340
 I mean, on the, on the Russian side of things, in terms of language, the limits of language

2:53:53.340 --> 2:53:57.300
 being the limit of our world, you know, Russian is a beautiful language in some sense.

2:53:57.300 --> 2:54:00.260
 There's wit, there's humor, there's pain.

2:54:00.260 --> 2:54:01.260
 There's so much.

2:54:01.260 --> 2:54:06.820
 We don't have time to talk about it much today, but I'm going to Paris to talk to Dostoyevsky

2:54:06.820 --> 2:54:09.340
 Tolstoy translators.

2:54:09.340 --> 2:54:15.660
 I think it's this fascinating art, like art and engineering, that means such an interesting

2:54:15.660 --> 2:54:16.660
 process.

2:54:16.660 --> 2:54:23.740
 But so from the replica perspective, do you, what do you think about translation?

2:54:23.740 --> 2:54:29.500
 How difficult it is to create a deep, meaningful connection in Russian versus English?

2:54:29.500 --> 2:54:32.300
 How you can translate the two languages?

2:54:32.300 --> 2:54:33.300
 You speak both?

2:54:33.300 --> 2:54:34.300
 Yeah.

2:54:34.300 --> 2:54:37.020
 I think we're two different people in different languages.

2:54:37.020 --> 2:54:41.100
 Even I'm, you know, thinking about, there's actually some research on that.

2:54:41.100 --> 2:54:45.020
 I looked into that at some point because I was fascinated by the fact that what I'm talking

2:54:45.020 --> 2:54:48.380
 about with, what I was talking about with my Russian therapist has nothing to do with

2:54:48.380 --> 2:54:51.820
 what I'm talking about with my English speaking therapist.

2:54:51.820 --> 2:54:59.840
 It's two different lives, two different types of conversations, two different personas.

2:54:59.840 --> 2:55:05.380
 The main difference between the languages are, with Russian and English is that Russian,

2:55:05.380 --> 2:55:06.820
 well English is like a piano.

2:55:06.820 --> 2:55:11.420
 It's a limited number of a lot of different keys, but not too many.

2:55:11.420 --> 2:55:13.700
 And Russian is like an organ or something.

2:55:13.700 --> 2:55:18.220
 It's just something gigantic with so many different keys and so many different opportunities

2:55:18.220 --> 2:55:24.500
 to screw up and so many opportunities to do something completely tone deaf.

2:55:24.500 --> 2:55:28.220
 It is just a much harder language to use.

2:55:28.220 --> 2:55:34.180
 It has way too much flexibility and way too many tones.

2:55:34.180 --> 2:55:40.700
 What about the entirety of like World War II, communism, Stalin, the pain of the people

2:55:40.700 --> 2:55:47.860
 like having been deceived by the dream, like all the pain of like just the entirety of

2:55:47.860 --> 2:55:48.860
 it.

2:55:48.860 --> 2:55:49.860
 Is that in the language too?

2:55:49.860 --> 2:55:50.860
 Does that have to do?

2:55:50.860 --> 2:55:51.860
 Oh, for sure.

2:55:51.860 --> 2:55:56.340
 I mean, we have words that don't have direct translation that to English that are very

2:55:56.340 --> 2:56:03.460
 much like we have, which is sort of like to hold a grudge or something, but it doesn't

2:56:03.460 --> 2:56:07.780
 have, it doesn't, you don't need to have anyone to do it to you.

2:56:07.780 --> 2:56:08.780
 It's just your state.

2:56:08.780 --> 2:56:09.780
 Yeah.

2:56:09.780 --> 2:56:10.780
 You just feel like that.

2:56:10.780 --> 2:56:15.140
 You feel like betrayed by other people basically, but it's not that and you can't really translate

2:56:15.140 --> 2:56:16.140
 that.

2:56:16.140 --> 2:56:18.100
 And I think that's super important.

2:56:18.100 --> 2:56:24.020
 There are very many words that are very specific, explain the Russian being, and I think it

2:56:24.020 --> 2:56:31.220
 can only come from a nation that suffered so much and saw institutions fall time after

2:56:31.220 --> 2:56:36.420
 time after time and you know, what's exciting, maybe not exciting, exciting the wrong word,

2:56:36.420 --> 2:56:42.700
 but what's interesting about like my generation, my mom's generation, my parents generation,

2:56:42.700 --> 2:56:48.420
 that we saw institutions fall two or three times in our lifetime and most Americans have

2:56:48.420 --> 2:56:55.260
 never seen them fall and they just think that they exist forever, which is really interesting,

2:56:55.260 --> 2:57:01.300
 but it's definitely a country that suffered so much and it makes, unfortunately when I

2:57:01.300 --> 2:57:06.580
 go back and I, you know, hang out with my Russian friends, it makes people very cynical.

2:57:06.580 --> 2:57:10.140
 They stop believing in the future.

2:57:10.140 --> 2:57:15.380
 I hope that's not going to be the case for so long or something's going to change again,

2:57:15.380 --> 2:57:19.980
 but I think seeing institutions fall is a very traumatic experience.

2:57:19.980 --> 2:57:28.220
 That's very interesting and what's on 2020 is a very interesting, do you think a civilization

2:57:28.220 --> 2:57:29.220
 will collapse?

2:57:29.220 --> 2:57:33.580
 See, I'm a very practical person.

2:57:33.580 --> 2:57:34.580
 We're speaking in English.

2:57:34.580 --> 2:57:37.420
 So like you said, you're a different person in English and Russian.

2:57:37.420 --> 2:57:42.140
 So in Russian you might answer that differently, but in English, yeah.

2:57:42.140 --> 2:57:49.180
 I'm an optimist and I generally believe that there is all, you know, even although the

2:57:49.180 --> 2:57:54.820
 perspectives are grim, there's always a place for a miracle.

2:57:54.820 --> 2:57:56.940
 I mean, it's always been like that with my life.

2:57:56.940 --> 2:58:02.740
 So yeah, my life has been, I've been incredibly lucky and things just, miracles happen all

2:58:02.740 --> 2:58:08.100
 the time with this company, with people I know, with everything around me.

2:58:08.100 --> 2:58:13.620
 And so I didn't mention that book, but maybe In Search of Miraculous or In Search for Miraculous

2:58:13.620 --> 2:58:19.540
 or whatever the English translation for that is, good Russian book for everyone to read.

2:58:19.540 --> 2:58:20.540
 Yeah.

2:58:20.540 --> 2:58:29.740
 I mean, if you put good vibes, if you put love out there in the world, miracles somehow

2:58:29.740 --> 2:58:30.740
 happen.

2:58:30.740 --> 2:58:31.740
 Yeah.

2:58:31.740 --> 2:58:35.860
 I believe that too, or at least I believe that, I don't know.

2:58:35.860 --> 2:58:42.380
 Let me ask the most absurd, final, ridiculous question of, we've talked about life a lot.

2:58:42.380 --> 2:58:45.380
 What do you think is the meaning of it all?

2:58:45.380 --> 2:58:46.860
 What's the meaning of life?

2:58:46.860 --> 2:58:52.700
 I mean, my answer is probably going to be pretty cheesy.

2:58:52.700 --> 2:58:59.580
 But I think the state of love is once you feel it, in a way that we've discussed it

2:58:59.580 --> 2:59:00.580
 before.

2:59:00.580 --> 2:59:04.860
 I'm not talking about falling in love, where...

2:59:04.860 --> 2:59:05.860
 Just love.

2:59:05.860 --> 2:59:10.740
 To yourself, to other people, to something, to the world.

2:59:10.740 --> 2:59:16.340
 That state of bliss that we experience sometimes, whether through connection with ourselves,

2:59:16.340 --> 2:59:23.620
 with our people, with the technology, there's something special about those moments.

2:59:23.620 --> 2:59:30.500
 So I would say, if anything, that's the only...

2:59:30.500 --> 2:59:35.620
 If it's not for that, then for what else are we really trying to do that?

2:59:35.620 --> 2:59:38.820
 I don't think there's a better way to end it than talking about love.

2:59:38.820 --> 2:59:47.780
 Eugenia, I told you offline that there's something about me that felt like this...

2:59:47.780 --> 2:59:51.700
 Talking to you, meeting you in person would be a turning point for my life.

2:59:51.700 --> 2:59:59.500
 I know that might sound weird to hear, but it was a huge honor to talk to you.

2:59:59.500 --> 3:00:01.100
 I hope we talk again.

3:00:01.100 --> 3:00:02.100
 Thank you so much for your time.

 And now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan.

3:00:32.300 --> 3:00:36.740
 The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth that there's no reason to

3:00:36.740 --> 3:00:41.460
 deceive ourselves with pretty stories of which there's little good evidence.

3:00:41.460 --> 3:00:48.080
 Far better, it seems to me, in our vulnerability is to look death in the eye and to be grateful

3:00:48.080 --> 3:00:54.700
 every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides.

3:00:54.700 --> 3:01:06.380
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
