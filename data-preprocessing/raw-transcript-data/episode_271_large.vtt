WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.720
 We think that self assembly,

00:01.720 --> 00:04.760
 this modular reconfigurable algorithm

00:04.760 --> 00:07.520
 for constructing space structures in orbit

00:07.520 --> 00:10.760
 is gonna give us this promise of space architecture

00:10.760 --> 00:12.320
 that's actually worth living in.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.500
 You see, you do believe we might one day

00:14.500 --> 00:17.920
 become intergalactic civilization.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.060
 I have a hope, yeah.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.240
 The following is a conversation with Ariel Ekblah,

00:24.240 --> 00:27.400
 Director of MIT Space Exploration Initiative.

00:27.400 --> 00:30.120
 She's especially interested in autonomously

00:30.120 --> 00:32.700
 self assembling space architectures.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.880
 Basically, giant space structures

00:35.880 --> 00:37.720
 that can sustain human life

00:37.720 --> 00:40.440
 and that assemble themselves out in space

00:40.440 --> 00:45.440
 and then orbit Earth, Moon, Mars, and other planets.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.280
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.240
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:50.240 --> 00:51.480
 in the description.

00:51.480 --> 00:55.420
 And now, dear friends, here's Ariel Ekblah.

00:55.420 --> 00:59.540
 When did you first fall in love with space exploration

00:59.540 --> 01:01.260
 and space in general?

01:01.260 --> 01:04.100
 My parents are both ex Air Force.

01:04.100 --> 01:05.860
 So my dad's an A10 fighter pilot

01:05.860 --> 01:09.660
 and my mom trained and had qualified to be a fighter pilot,

01:09.660 --> 01:11.000
 but it was early enough

01:11.000 --> 01:13.380
 that women were not allowed in combat at that time.

01:13.380 --> 01:16.380
 And so I grew up with these two pilots

01:16.380 --> 01:18.620
 and although they themselves did not become astronauts,

01:18.620 --> 01:20.960
 there's a really rich legacy of Air Force pilots

01:20.960 --> 01:24.260
 becoming astronauts and this loomed large in my childhood.

01:24.260 --> 01:26.780
 What does it mean to be courageous, to be an explorer,

01:26.780 --> 01:31.680
 to be at the vanguard of something hard and challenging?

01:31.680 --> 01:32.900
 And to couple with that,

01:32.900 --> 01:35.060
 my dad was a huge fan of science fiction.

01:35.060 --> 01:39.580
 And so I, as a kid, read Heinlein and Isaac Asimov,

01:39.580 --> 01:41.220
 all these different classics of science fiction

01:41.220 --> 01:42.500
 that he had introduced me to.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.900
 And that just started a love affair with space exploration

01:45.900 --> 01:47.820
 and really thinking about

01:47.820 --> 01:50.740
 civilization scale space exploration.

01:50.740 --> 01:55.740
 So did they themselves dream about going to the stars

01:57.720 --> 02:01.020
 as opposed to flying here in Earth's atmosphere,

02:01.020 --> 02:02.000
 just looking up?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.100
 Yeah, my dad always said he was absolutely convinced

02:04.100 --> 02:06.300
 because he was a child of the Apollo years

02:06.300 --> 02:08.580
 that he would get to go in his lifetime,

02:08.580 --> 02:09.980
 really thought it was gonna happen.

02:09.980 --> 02:12.760
 And so it was a challenge and sad for many people

02:12.760 --> 02:15.220
 when to their view on the outside,

02:15.220 --> 02:17.940
 space exploration slowed down for a period of time.

02:17.940 --> 02:19.700
 In reality, we were just catching up.

02:19.700 --> 02:23.140
 I think we leapt so far ahead with Apollo,

02:23.140 --> 02:25.260
 more than the rest of society was ready for.

02:25.260 --> 02:27.620
 And now we're coming back to this moment

02:27.620 --> 02:29.980
 for space exploration where we actually have an economy

02:29.980 --> 02:32.780
 and we have the other accoutrement that society needs

02:32.780 --> 02:34.980
 to be able to make space exploration more real.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.340
 And my dad's thrilled because finally,

02:37.340 --> 02:39.980
 not nearly, I hope not anywhere near the end of his life,

02:39.980 --> 02:40.920
 but as he's an older man,

02:40.920 --> 02:44.480
 he now can see still within his lifetime,

02:44.480 --> 02:45.540
 people really getting a chance

02:45.540 --> 02:47.900
 to build a sustainable lunar settlement on the moon

02:47.900 --> 02:49.180
 or maybe even go to Mars.

02:49.180 --> 02:52.120
 So settlement, civilizations and other planets,

02:52.120 --> 02:55.580
 that's the cool thing to dream about in the future.

02:55.580 --> 02:56.820
 It certainly is.

02:56.820 --> 03:00.580
 What was the favorite sci fi authors when you were growing up?

03:00.580 --> 03:02.560
 PabÃ© Eszeg Asimov Foundation Trilogy.

03:02.560 --> 03:05.220
 This is an amazing story of Harry Seldon,

03:05.220 --> 03:09.180
 this foundation that he forms at different ends of the,

03:09.180 --> 03:10.860
 well, according to the story,

03:10.860 --> 03:12.420
 different ends of the universe

03:12.420 --> 03:16.820
 and has this interesting focus on society.

03:16.820 --> 03:19.220
 So it's not just space exploration

03:19.220 --> 03:21.500
 for the sake of space exploration or novel technology,

03:21.500 --> 03:23.940
 which is a lot of what I work on day to day at MIT,

03:23.940 --> 03:26.940
 but how do you structure a society

03:27.960 --> 03:31.540
 across those vast expanses of distance and time?

03:31.540 --> 03:33.640
 And so I'd say absolutely a favorite.

03:33.640 --> 03:38.060
 Now though, my favorite is Neal Stephenson and Seveneves.

03:38.060 --> 03:40.620
 It's a book that inspired my own PhD research

03:40.620 --> 03:43.100
 and some ongoing work that we're doing with NASA now

03:43.100 --> 03:46.660
 for the future of swarm robotics for spacecraft.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.700
 We were saying offline about Neal Stephenson

03:49.700 --> 03:51.580
 because I just recently had a conversation with him.

03:51.580 --> 03:54.660
 And I said that not until I was doing the research for him

03:54.660 --> 03:59.660
 that I realized he also had a role to play in Blue Origin.

03:59.860 --> 04:02.760
 So it's like sci fi actually having a role to play

04:02.760 --> 04:06.080
 in the design, engineering,

04:06.080 --> 04:07.640
 just the implementation of ideas

04:07.640 --> 04:10.860
 that kind of percolate up from the sci fi world

04:10.860 --> 04:11.980
 and actually become reality.

04:11.980 --> 04:14.540
 It's kind of a fascinating figure in that way.

04:14.540 --> 04:16.900
 So do you also think about him

04:16.900 --> 04:19.660
 beyond just his work in science fiction,

04:19.660 --> 04:22.900
 but his role in coming up with wild, crazy ideas

04:22.900 --> 04:24.220
 that actually become reality?

04:24.220 --> 04:26.860
 Yes, I think it's a great example of this cycle

04:26.860 --> 04:29.980
 between authors and scientists and engineers

04:29.980 --> 04:32.100
 that we can be inspired in one generation

04:32.100 --> 04:33.900
 by what authors dream up.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.740
 We build it, we make it a reality.

04:35.740 --> 04:37.420
 And then that inspires another generation

04:37.420 --> 04:40.540
 of really wild and crazy thought for science fiction.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.240
 I think Neal Stephenson does a beautiful job

04:42.240 --> 04:44.740
 of being what we'd call a hard science fiction author.

04:44.740 --> 04:46.500
 So it's really grounded in a lot of science,

04:46.500 --> 04:47.940
 which makes it very compelling for me

04:47.940 --> 04:50.140
 as a scientist and engineer to read

04:50.140 --> 04:53.260
 and then be challenged to make that vision a reality.

04:53.260 --> 04:56.100
 The other community that Neal's involved with

04:56.100 --> 04:57.620
 and some of my other mentors are involved with

04:57.620 --> 05:00.260
 that we are thinking about more and more in the work

05:00.260 --> 05:03.940
 that we do at MIT is the Long Now Foundation.

05:03.940 --> 05:08.860
 And this focus on what does society need to take

05:08.860 --> 05:11.460
 in terms of steps at this juncture,

05:11.460 --> 05:14.500
 this particular inflection point in human history

05:14.500 --> 05:16.140
 to make sure that we're setting ourselves up

05:16.140 --> 05:18.780
 for a long and prosperous horizon,

05:18.780 --> 05:20.440
 for humanity's horizons.

05:20.440 --> 05:21.340
 There's a lot of examples

05:21.340 --> 05:23.860
 of what the Long Now Foundation does and thinks about.

05:23.860 --> 05:25.500
 But when I think about this in my own work,

05:25.500 --> 05:30.140
 it's what does it take to scale humanity's presence

05:30.140 --> 05:31.740
 in orbit?

05:31.740 --> 05:34.200
 We are seeing some additional investment

05:34.200 --> 05:36.300
 in commercial space habitats.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.660
 So it'll no longer be just NASA

05:37.660 --> 05:39.420
 running the International Space Station,

05:39.420 --> 05:42.860
 but to really democratize access to space,

05:42.860 --> 05:44.780
 like Bezos wants to have millions of people living

05:44.780 --> 05:46.020
 and working in space,

05:46.020 --> 05:49.460
 you need architecture that's bigger and grander

05:49.460 --> 05:50.940
 and can actually scale.

05:50.940 --> 05:52.100
 That means you need to be thinking about

05:52.100 --> 05:55.120
 how can you construct things for long time horizons

05:55.120 --> 05:56.740
 that are really sustainable in orbit

05:56.740 --> 05:59.460
 or on a surface of a celestial body

05:59.460 --> 06:02.180
 that are bigger than the biggest rocket payload fairing

06:02.180 --> 06:03.460
 that we currently have available.

06:03.460 --> 06:05.420
 And that what led me to self assembly

06:05.420 --> 06:08.300
 and other models of in space construction.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.580
 Okay, every time you speak,

06:10.580 --> 06:12.540
 I get like a million tangent ideas.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.380
 You can cut me off.

06:13.380 --> 06:15.220
 No, no, no, no, no, no, please keep talking.

06:15.220 --> 06:16.140
 This is amazing.

06:16.140 --> 06:19.100
 I just, there's like a million of ideas.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.820
 So one sort of on the dark side, let me ask,

06:21.820 --> 06:25.060
 do you think about the threats to human civilization

06:25.060 --> 06:28.940
 that kind of motivate the scaling of the expansion

06:28.940 --> 06:31.740
 of humans in space and on other planets?

06:31.740 --> 06:32.900
 What are you worried about?

06:32.900 --> 06:35.660
 Nuclear war, pandemics,

06:35.660 --> 06:39.700
 super intelligent, artificial intelligence systems,

06:40.820 --> 06:44.100
 more not existential crises,

06:44.100 --> 06:46.360
 but ones that have significant,

06:46.360 --> 06:48.760
 potentially significant detrimental effects on society,

06:48.760 --> 06:51.020
 like climate change, those kinds of things.

06:51.020 --> 06:52.780
 And then there's of course the fun S story

06:52.780 --> 06:55.420
 coming out from the darkness and hitting all earth.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.060
 There's been a few movies on that.

06:57.060 --> 06:59.420
 Anyway, is there something that you think about

07:00.300 --> 07:02.280
 that threatens us in this century?

07:03.140 --> 07:04.520
 I mean, as an ex military family,

07:04.520 --> 07:06.420
 we used to talk about all of this.

07:06.420 --> 07:08.740
 We would say that luck favors the prepared.

07:08.740 --> 07:13.300
 And so growing up, we had a plan, actually a family plan

07:13.300 --> 07:14.460
 for what we would do in a pandemic.

07:14.460 --> 07:15.540
 Didn't think we were gonna have to put that

07:15.540 --> 07:17.500
 and plan into place and here we are.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.780
 We do, certainly among my own family and my friends

07:20.780 --> 07:21.820
 and then our work at MIT,

07:21.820 --> 07:24.900
 we do think about existential threats and risks to humanity

07:24.900 --> 07:27.260
 and what role does space exploration

07:27.260 --> 07:29.180
 and getting humans off world have to play

07:29.180 --> 07:32.100
 in a resilient future for humanity.

07:32.100 --> 07:35.420
 But what I actually find more compelling recently

07:35.420 --> 07:40.420
 is instead of thinking about a need to ever abandon earth

07:40.540 --> 07:42.980
 through a path of space exploration or space foraging

07:42.980 --> 07:44.900
 is to see how we can use space technology

07:44.900 --> 07:47.260
 to keep earth livable.

07:47.260 --> 07:50.020
 The obvious direct ways of doing this would be,

07:50.020 --> 07:52.300
 satellite technology that's helping us learn more

07:52.300 --> 07:56.260
 about climate change or emitters or CO2.

07:56.260 --> 07:58.160
 But there's also a future for geo engineering

07:58.160 --> 07:59.580
 that might be space based.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.040
 A lot of questions that would have to be answered

08:01.040 --> 08:04.940
 around that, but these are examples of pivoting our focus

08:04.940 --> 08:06.940
 away from maybe the Hollywood vision of,

08:06.940 --> 08:08.200
 oh, an asteroid's gonna come,

08:08.200 --> 08:09.380
 we're all gonna have to escape earth

08:09.380 --> 08:14.380
 to let's use our considerable technology prowess

08:14.420 --> 08:16.420
 and use space technology to save earth

08:16.420 --> 08:18.180
 and be very much focused on how we can have

08:18.180 --> 08:20.780
 a worthwhile life for earth citizens.

08:20.780 --> 08:24.020
 Even if some of us wanna go out and further venturing.

08:24.020 --> 08:28.060
 Right, just the desire to explore the mysterious, yes.

08:28.060 --> 08:31.500
 But also it does seem that by placing us

08:31.500 --> 08:33.860
 in harsh conditions, the harsh conditions of space,

08:33.860 --> 08:35.700
 the harsh conditions of planets,

08:35.700 --> 08:38.020
 and the biology, the chemistry, the engineering,

08:38.020 --> 08:41.540
 the robotics, the materials, all of that,

08:41.540 --> 08:43.940
 that's just a nice way to come up with cool new things.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.140
 Great forcing function, yeah.

08:45.140 --> 08:48.500
 Yeah, exactly, it's a forcing function like survival.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.960
 You don't get this right, you die.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.420
 So, and that you can bring back to earth

08:53.420 --> 08:57.920
 and it will improve, like figuring out food in space

08:57.920 --> 09:01.860
 will make you figure out how to eat,

09:01.860 --> 09:04.140
 live healthier lives here on earth.

09:04.140 --> 09:05.900
 So true, I mean, some of the technologies

09:05.900 --> 09:08.700
 that we're directly looking at right now

09:08.700 --> 09:12.080
 for space habitats, it's hard to keep humans alive

09:12.080 --> 09:15.620
 in this really fragile little pocket against the vacuum

09:15.620 --> 09:19.060
 and all of the dangers that the space environment presents.

09:19.060 --> 09:20.900
 Some of the technologies we are gonna have to figure out

09:20.900 --> 09:24.700
 is energy efficient cooling and air conditioning,

09:24.700 --> 09:28.900
 air filtration, scrubbing CO2 from the air,

09:28.900 --> 09:33.900
 being able to have habitats that are themselves resilient

09:34.220 --> 09:36.340
 to extremes of space weather and radiation.

09:36.340 --> 09:39.340
 And some of these are direct translational opportunities

09:39.340 --> 09:41.740
 for areas turned by natural disasters.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.740
 People in California a decade ago would never have had

09:43.740 --> 09:45.860
 to think about having an airtight house.

09:45.860 --> 09:48.800
 But now with wildfires, maybe you do want something close

09:48.800 --> 09:51.520
 to an airtight house, how do you manage that?

09:51.520 --> 09:52.760
 There's a lot of technologies

09:52.760 --> 09:55.060
 from the space habitation world

09:55.060 --> 09:57.020
 that we are hoping we can actually bring back down

09:57.020 --> 09:58.660
 to benefit life on earth as well

09:58.660 --> 10:01.220
 in these extreme environment contexts.

10:01.220 --> 10:05.860
 Okay, so you mentioned to go back to swarm.

10:05.860 --> 10:06.700
 Yeah.

10:06.700 --> 10:09.120
 So that was interesting to you,

10:09.120 --> 10:10.380
 first of all, in your own work,

10:10.380 --> 10:12.620
 but also I believe you said something

10:12.620 --> 10:14.900
 that was inspiring from Niel Stevenson as well.

10:14.900 --> 10:19.420
 So when you say swarm, are you thinking about

10:19.420 --> 10:24.300
 architectures or are you thinking about

10:24.300 --> 10:26.040
 artificial intelligence like robotics

10:26.040 --> 10:28.380
 or are those kind of intermixed?

10:28.380 --> 10:30.180
 I think the future that we're seeing

10:30.180 --> 10:31.780
 is that they're going to be intermixed,

10:31.780 --> 10:33.160
 which is really exciting.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.220
 So the future of space habitats

10:35.220 --> 10:38.580
 are one of intelligent structures,

10:38.580 --> 10:39.960
 maybe not all the way to Hal

10:39.960 --> 10:43.220
 and the 2001 Space Odyssey reference that scares people

10:43.220 --> 10:45.820
 about the habitat having a mind of its own.

10:45.820 --> 10:47.820
 But certainly we're building systems now

10:47.820 --> 10:51.800
 where the habitat has sensing technology

10:51.800 --> 10:56.380
 that allows it to communicate its basic functions,

10:56.380 --> 10:58.340
 maintaining life support for the astronauts,

10:58.340 --> 11:01.500
 but could also communicate in symbiosis

11:01.500 --> 11:03.220
 with these swarm robots

11:03.220 --> 11:05.700
 that would be on the outside of the spacecraft,

11:05.700 --> 11:08.140
 whether it's in a microgravity orbiting environment

11:08.140 --> 11:09.220
 or on the surface.

11:09.220 --> 11:10.460
 And these little robots,

11:10.460 --> 11:13.320
 they crawl just a la Niel Stevenson in seven eves,

11:13.320 --> 11:15.460
 they crawl along the outside of the spacecraft

11:15.460 --> 11:18.180
 looking for micrometeorite punctures

11:18.180 --> 11:21.620
 or gas leaks or other faults and defects.

11:21.620 --> 11:24.020
 And right now we're just working on the diagnosis.

11:24.020 --> 11:27.260
 So can the swarm with its collective intelligence

11:27.260 --> 11:30.220
 act in symbiosis with the spacecraft and detect things?

11:30.220 --> 11:31.280
 But in the future we'd also love

11:31.280 --> 11:34.100
 for these little micro robots to repair in situ

11:34.100 --> 11:37.620
 and really be like ants living in a tree

11:37.620 --> 11:39.460
 altogether connected to the spacecraft.

11:39.460 --> 11:44.260
 Do you envision the system to be fully distributed

11:44.260 --> 11:45.820
 and just like an ant colony,

11:45.820 --> 11:50.640
 if one of them is damaged or whatever,

11:51.900 --> 11:53.520
 loses control and all those kinds of things

11:53.520 --> 11:57.340
 that doesn't affect the performance of the complete system

11:57.340 --> 11:58.960
 or doesn't need to be centralized?

11:58.960 --> 12:01.140
 This is more like almost like a technical question.

12:01.140 --> 12:01.980
 Do you think we can?

12:01.980 --> 12:03.020
 Good architecture question.

12:03.020 --> 12:05.860
 Right, from the ground up,

12:05.860 --> 12:08.820
 it's so scary to go fully distributed.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.140
 Yes.

12:10.140 --> 12:12.700
 But it's also exceptionally powerful, right?

12:12.700 --> 12:15.860
 Robust, resilient to the harsh conditions of space.

12:15.860 --> 12:20.860
 What do you, if you look into the next 10, 20, 100 years,

12:22.300 --> 12:23.460
 starting from scratch,

12:23.460 --> 12:24.620
 do you think we should be doing

12:24.620 --> 12:27.180
 architecture wise distributed systems?

12:28.040 --> 12:31.300
 For space, yes, because it gives you this redundancy

12:31.300 --> 12:33.380
 and safety profile that's really critical.

12:33.380 --> 12:35.140
 So whether it's small swarm robots

12:35.140 --> 12:37.300
 where it doesn't matter if you lose a few of them,

12:37.300 --> 12:43.820
 to habitats that instead of having a central monolithic habitat,

12:43.820 --> 12:45.780
 you might actually be able to have

12:45.780 --> 12:49.060
 a decentralized node of a space station

12:49.060 --> 12:50.980
 so that you can kind of right out of Star Wars,

12:50.980 --> 12:53.300
 you can shut a blast door if there's a fire

12:53.300 --> 12:55.060
 or if there's a conflict in a certain area

12:55.060 --> 12:57.180
 and you can move the humans and the crew

12:57.180 --> 12:59.820
 into another decentralized node of the spacecraft.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.980
 There's another idea out of Neal Stephenson's Seven Eves

13:01.980 --> 13:03.820
 actually where these arclets,

13:03.820 --> 13:06.180
 which were decentralized spacecraft that could form

13:06.180 --> 13:09.980
 and dock little temporary space stations with each other

13:09.980 --> 13:12.140
 and then separate and go off on their way

13:12.140 --> 13:15.900
 and have a decentralized approach to living in space.

13:15.900 --> 13:19.100
 So the self assembly component of that too,

13:19.100 --> 13:21.780
 so this is your PhD work and beyond,

13:21.780 --> 13:25.420
 you explored autonomously self assembling space architecture

13:25.420 --> 13:28.220
 for future space, tourists, habitats,

13:28.220 --> 13:31.420
 and space stations in orbit around Earth, Moon, and Mars.

13:31.420 --> 13:34.660
 There's few things I personally find sexier

13:34.660 --> 13:39.660
 than autonomously self assembling space architecture.

13:40.980 --> 13:42.740
 In general, it doesn't even need to be space.

13:42.740 --> 13:46.100
 The idea of self assembling architectures

13:46.100 --> 13:48.420
 is really interesting, like building a bridge

13:48.420 --> 13:51.580
 or something like that through self assembling materials.

13:51.580 --> 13:56.580
 It feels like an incredibly efficient way to do it

13:57.340 --> 13:59.860
 because optimization is built in.

13:59.860 --> 14:03.180
 So you can build the most optimal structures

14:03.180 --> 14:08.180
 given dynamic, uncertain, changing conditions.

14:09.060 --> 14:11.340
 So maybe can you talk about your PhD work,

14:11.340 --> 14:16.340
 about this work, about Tesserae, what is it in general?

14:17.380 --> 14:19.420
 Any cool stuff, because this is super cool.

14:19.420 --> 14:21.100
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.700
 So Tesserae is my PhD research.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.820
 It's this idea that we could take tiles

14:26.820 --> 14:30.020
 that construct a large structure like a bucky ball.

14:30.020 --> 14:31.860
 Yeah, this is exactly what we're looking at here,

14:31.860 --> 14:34.700
 which is the tiles that are packed flat in a rocket.

14:34.700 --> 14:38.380
 They're released to float in microgravity.

14:38.380 --> 14:41.220
 Magnets, pretty powerful, electropermanent magnets

14:41.220 --> 14:44.460
 on their edges draw them together for autonomous docking.

14:44.460 --> 14:46.100
 So there's no human in the loop here,

14:46.100 --> 14:48.180
 and there's no central agent coordinating

14:48.180 --> 14:50.740
 saying tile one, go to tile two.

14:50.740 --> 14:52.500
 It's completely decentralized system.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.820
 They find each other on their own.

14:54.820 --> 14:56.060
 What we don't show in this video

14:56.060 --> 14:58.220
 is what happens if there's an error, right?

14:58.220 --> 15:00.140
 So what happens if they bond incorrectly?

15:00.140 --> 15:02.620
 The tiles have sensing, so proximity sensing,

15:02.620 --> 15:04.780
 magnetometer, other sensors that allow them

15:04.780 --> 15:07.900
 to detect a good bond versus a bad bond

15:07.900 --> 15:10.020
 and pulse off and self correct,

15:10.020 --> 15:12.700
 which anybody who works in the field of self assembly

15:12.700 --> 15:15.780
 will tell you that error detection and correction,

15:15.780 --> 15:19.020
 just like error detection in a DNA sequence

15:19.020 --> 15:21.900
 or protein folding is really important part of the system

15:21.900 --> 15:23.140
 for that robustness.

15:23.140 --> 15:26.380
 And so we've done a lot of work to engineer that ability

15:26.380 --> 15:29.300
 for the tiles to be self determining.

15:29.300 --> 15:30.820
 They know whether they're forming the structure

15:30.820 --> 15:32.180
 that they're supposed to form or not.

15:32.180 --> 15:34.340
 They know if they're in a toxic relationship

15:34.340 --> 15:35.780
 and they need to get out.

15:35.780 --> 15:38.700
 Right, right, if they need to separate, exactly, yeah.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.500
 All right, this is like so amazing.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.980
 And for people who are just listening to this,

15:41.980 --> 15:45.180
 yeah, there's, I mean, how large are these tiles?

15:45.180 --> 15:47.780
 So the size that we use in the lab,

15:47.780 --> 15:49.140
 they can really be any size

15:49.140 --> 15:51.020
 because we can scale them down to do testing

15:51.020 --> 15:51.860
 in microgravity.

15:51.860 --> 15:55.020
 So we sent tiles that were about three inches wide

15:55.020 --> 15:57.100
 to the International Space Station a couple years ago

15:57.100 --> 16:00.100
 to test the code, test the state machine,

16:00.100 --> 16:02.260
 test the algorithm of self assembly.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.500
 But now we're actually building

16:03.500 --> 16:05.660
 our first ever human scale tiles.

16:05.660 --> 16:06.860
 They're me human size.

16:06.860 --> 16:09.660
 So a little smaller than maybe your average human,

16:09.660 --> 16:13.980
 but they're 2.5 feet on edge length.

16:13.980 --> 16:16.700
 The larger scale that we would love to build in the future

16:16.700 --> 16:18.700
 would actually be tiles that are big enough

16:18.700 --> 16:21.900
 to form a bucky ball, big open spherical volume,

16:21.900 --> 16:23.580
 spherical approximation volume,

16:23.580 --> 16:25.660
 that'd be about 10 meters in diameter.

16:25.660 --> 16:29.100
 So 30 feet, which is much bigger and grander

16:29.100 --> 16:32.540
 in terms of open space than any current module on the ISS.

16:32.540 --> 16:35.140
 And one of the goals of this project was to say,

16:35.140 --> 16:38.780
 what's the purpose of next generation space architecture?

16:38.780 --> 16:41.660
 Should it be something that really inspires

16:41.660 --> 16:44.780
 and delights people when you float into that space?

16:44.780 --> 16:46.700
 Can you get goosebumps in the way that you do

16:46.700 --> 16:48.740
 when you walk into a really stunning piece

16:48.740 --> 16:50.180
 of architecture on earth?

16:50.180 --> 16:52.260
 And so we think that self assembly,

16:52.260 --> 16:55.300
 this modular reconfigurable algorithm

16:55.300 --> 16:58.060
 for constructing space structures in orbit

16:58.060 --> 17:01.300
 is gonna give us this promise of space architecture

17:01.300 --> 17:03.460
 that's actually worth living in.

17:03.460 --> 17:05.340
 Living in, oh, I thought you also meant

17:05.340 --> 17:07.340
 from like outside artistic perspective,

17:07.340 --> 17:09.660
 when you see the whole thing is just.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.460
 With the aesthetics of it, absolutely.

17:11.460 --> 17:14.460
 You know, when you like go like into Vegas,

17:14.460 --> 17:16.460
 whenever you go into a city

17:16.460 --> 17:19.340
 and it like over the hill appears in front of you.

17:19.340 --> 17:23.380
 And I mean, there's something majestic about seeing like,

17:23.380 --> 17:25.300
 wow, humans created that.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.820
 It gives you like hope about like,

17:26.820 --> 17:28.780
 if these a bunch of ants were able to figure out

17:28.780 --> 17:31.420
 how to build skyscrapers that light up.

17:31.420 --> 17:33.980
 And in general, the design of these tiles

17:33.980 --> 17:36.460
 in the way you envision it are pretty scalable.

17:36.460 --> 17:38.460
 Yes, and they're inspired by exactly

17:38.460 --> 17:39.540
 what you mentioned a moment ago,

17:39.540 --> 17:42.980
 which is we have these patterns of self assembly on earth.

17:42.980 --> 17:45.020
 And there's a lot of fantastic MIT research

17:45.020 --> 17:46.500
 that we're building this concept on.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.380
 So like Daniela Ruse at CSAIL and Pebbles,

17:49.380 --> 17:53.860
 taking the power of magnets to create units

17:53.860 --> 17:56.180
 that are themselves interchangeable,

17:56.180 --> 17:58.620
 this notion of programmable matter.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.580
 And so we're interested in going really big with it

18:01.580 --> 18:05.340
 to build big scale space structures with programmable tiles.

18:05.340 --> 18:07.340
 But there's also a really fascinating,

18:07.340 --> 18:08.940
 you know, end of that on the other side of the spectrum,

18:08.940 --> 18:11.380
 which is how small can you go with matter

18:11.380 --> 18:13.780
 that's programmable and stacks and builds itself

18:13.780 --> 18:16.860
 and creates a bridge or something in the future.

18:16.860 --> 18:19.540
 What do you envision the thing would look like?

18:19.540 --> 18:22.300
 Like when you imagine a thing far into the future

18:22.300 --> 18:25.900
 where there's, so we're not even thinking about

18:25.900 --> 18:28.980
 like small space, well, let's not call them small,

18:28.980 --> 18:30.780
 but our currently sized space stations,

18:30.780 --> 18:34.260
 but like something gigantic, what do you envision?

18:34.260 --> 18:36.620
 Is this something with symmetry

18:36.620 --> 18:38.860
 or is this something we can't even come up with yet?

18:38.860 --> 18:42.900
 Is there beautiful structures that you imagine in your mind?

18:42.900 --> 18:45.740
 I've got three candidates that I would love to build.

18:45.740 --> 18:48.700
 If we're talking about monumental space architecture,

18:48.700 --> 18:51.740
 one is what does a space cathedral look like?

18:51.740 --> 18:52.860
 It can be a secular cathedral,

18:52.860 --> 18:54.460
 doesn't necessarily have to be about religion,

18:54.460 --> 18:57.980
 but that notion of long sight lines,

18:57.980 --> 19:01.260
 inspiring, stunning architecture when you go in.

19:01.260 --> 19:03.860
 And you can imagine floating instead of, you know,

19:03.860 --> 19:07.300
 being on the ground and only looking up in space,

19:07.300 --> 19:08.740
 you could be in a central node

19:08.740 --> 19:10.740
 and each direction you look at,

19:10.740 --> 19:14.100
 all the cardinal directions are spires going off

19:14.100 --> 19:15.420
 in a really large and long way.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.180
 So that's concept number one.

19:17.180 --> 19:19.980
 Number two would be something more organic

19:19.980 --> 19:21.780
 that's not just geometric.

19:21.780 --> 19:24.420
 So here, one of the ideas that we're working on at MIT

19:24.420 --> 19:27.580
 in my lab is to say, could you,

19:27.580 --> 19:29.260
 instead of the tesserae model, right,

19:29.260 --> 19:31.900
 which is self assembling a shell,

19:31.900 --> 19:34.980
 could you define a module that's a node,

19:34.980 --> 19:36.940
 a small node that someone can live in

19:36.940 --> 19:39.660
 and you self assemble a lot of those together,

19:39.660 --> 19:43.620
 they're called plesiohedrons like space filling solids

19:43.620 --> 19:45.580
 and you dock a bunch of them together

19:45.580 --> 19:49.820
 and you can create a really organic structure out of that.

19:49.820 --> 19:53.460
 So this is the same way that muscles accrete to appear,

19:53.460 --> 19:55.580
 you can have these nodes that dock together

19:55.580 --> 19:57.660
 and one shape that I would love to form out of this

19:57.660 --> 20:00.460
 is something like a nautilus, a seashell,

20:00.460 --> 20:03.500
 that beautiful, you know, fibonacci spiral sequence

20:03.500 --> 20:04.940
 that you get in that shape,

20:04.940 --> 20:06.180
 which I think would be a stunning

20:06.180 --> 20:10.300
 and fabulous aggregated space station.

20:10.300 --> 20:14.180
 You said so many cool words, plesiohedron.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.020
 Yeah, plesiohedron.

20:15.020 --> 20:18.220
 So that's a space filling.

20:18.220 --> 20:20.980
 Solid, the simplest thing to think of is like a cube.

20:20.980 --> 20:21.980
 Oh, cube. A cube, right?

20:21.980 --> 20:23.620
 So you can stack cubes together

20:23.620 --> 20:25.380
 and if you had an infinite number of cubes,

20:25.380 --> 20:27.140
 you'd fill all that space,

20:27.140 --> 20:28.900
 there's no gaps in between the cubes,

20:28.900 --> 20:31.340
 they stack and fill space.

20:31.340 --> 20:34.660
 Another plesiohedron is a truncated octahedron

20:34.660 --> 20:36.420
 and that's actually one of the candidate structures

20:36.420 --> 20:38.660
 that we think would be great for space stations.

20:38.660 --> 20:40.020
 What's the truncated part?

20:40.020 --> 20:41.820
 Ah, so you cut off,

20:41.820 --> 20:44.540
 an octahedron actually has little pointy areas,

20:44.540 --> 20:46.260
 you truncate certain sections of it

20:46.260 --> 20:50.020
 and you get surfaces that are on the structure

20:50.020 --> 20:52.820
 that are cubes and I think hexagons,

20:52.820 --> 20:55.540
 I have to remind myself exactly what the faces are.

20:55.540 --> 20:59.180
 But overall, a truncated octahedron can be bonded

20:59.180 --> 21:00.700
 to other truncated octahedrons

21:00.700 --> 21:03.500
 and just like a cube, it fills all the gaps

21:03.500 --> 21:04.820
 as you build it out.

21:04.820 --> 21:07.700
 So you can imagine two truncated octahedrons,

21:07.700 --> 21:09.180
 they come together at an airlock,

21:09.180 --> 21:12.260
 which is what we space people call doors in space

21:12.260 --> 21:14.180
 and you dock them on all sides

21:14.180 --> 21:18.060
 and you've basically created this decentralized network

21:18.060 --> 21:21.980
 of space nodes that make a big space station

21:21.980 --> 21:23.620
 and once you have enough of them

21:23.620 --> 21:25.460
 and you're growing with enough big units,

21:25.460 --> 21:28.020
 you can do it in any macro shape you want.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.300
 That's where the Nautilus comes in,

21:29.300 --> 21:32.940
 is could we design an organically inspired shape

21:32.940 --> 21:34.220
 for a space station?

21:34.220 --> 21:36.820
 Can I just say how awesome it is to hear you say,

21:36.820 --> 21:38.700
 we space people.

21:38.700 --> 21:41.220
 I know you meant people that are doing research

21:41.220 --> 21:43.820
 on space exploration, space technology,

21:43.820 --> 21:45.940
 but it also made me think of a future.

21:45.940 --> 21:50.580
 There's earth people and there's those space people.

21:50.580 --> 21:51.420
 And then there's the Mars people.

21:51.420 --> 21:52.380
 I'd love to unite those too.

21:52.380 --> 21:54.140
 Yeah, no, no, for sure, for sure.

21:54.140 --> 21:58.620
 But like, it's like New Yorkers and like Texans

21:58.620 --> 22:00.500
 or something like that.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.540
 Yeah, of course you live for a time in New York

22:03.540 --> 22:05.140
 and then you go up to Boston

22:05.140 --> 22:07.100
 but for a time you're the space people.

22:07.100 --> 22:09.300
 Oh, I know those space people.

22:09.300 --> 22:11.140
 They're kind of wild up there.

22:11.140 --> 22:12.500
 We'll see how that dynamic evolves.

22:12.500 --> 22:13.340
 Yeah, exactly.

22:13.340 --> 22:14.660
 There's that culture, culture forms.

22:14.660 --> 22:17.020
 And I would love to see what kind of culture,

22:17.020 --> 22:21.100
 once you have sort of more and more civilians.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.500
 I mean, there's a human,

22:22.500 --> 22:24.420
 I mean, I love psychology and sociology

22:24.420 --> 22:27.540
 and I'll maybe ask you about that too,

22:27.540 --> 22:29.580
 which is like the dynamic between humans.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.700
 You have to kind of start considering that

22:31.700 --> 22:34.660
 and you start spending more and more time up in space

22:34.660 --> 22:37.660
 and start sending civilians, start sending bigger

22:37.660 --> 22:39.140
 and bigger groups of people.

22:39.140 --> 22:42.900
 And then of course the beautiful and the ugly emerges

22:42.900 --> 22:47.380
 from the human nature that we haven't been able

22:47.380 --> 22:49.020
 to escape up to this point.

22:49.020 --> 22:53.060
 But when you say the plesiohedrons, these kinds of shapes,

22:53.060 --> 22:54.500
 are they multifunctional?

22:54.500 --> 22:56.700
 Like is the idea you'd be able to,

22:58.620 --> 23:02.220
 humans can occupy them safely in some of them

23:02.220 --> 23:04.820
 and some others have some other purposes?

23:04.820 --> 23:05.660
 Exactly.

23:05.660 --> 23:07.300
 One could be sleeping quarters.

23:07.300 --> 23:10.380
 One could be a greenhouse or an agricultural unit.

23:10.380 --> 23:13.740
 One could be a storage depot.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.660
 Essentially all of the different rooms

23:15.660 --> 23:17.860
 or functions that you might need in a space station

23:17.860 --> 23:19.940
 could be subdivided into these nodes

23:19.940 --> 23:22.220
 and then stacked together.

23:22.220 --> 23:24.460
 And one of the promises of both Tesseray,

23:24.460 --> 23:26.940
 my original PhD research, which is these shells,

23:26.940 --> 23:29.540
 and then this follow on node concept,

23:29.540 --> 23:32.100
 is that right now we build space stations

23:32.100 --> 23:33.780
 and once they're built, they're done.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.260
 You can't really change them profoundly.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.940
 But the benefit of a modular self assembling system

23:38.940 --> 23:40.940
 is you can disassemble it.

23:40.940 --> 23:42.780
 You can completely reconfigure it.

23:42.780 --> 23:45.140
 So if your mission changes or the number of people

23:45.140 --> 23:46.340
 in space that you wanna host,

23:46.340 --> 23:47.740
 if you have a space conference happening

23:47.740 --> 23:48.860
 like South by Southwest.

23:48.860 --> 23:50.100
 I was thinking space party,

23:50.100 --> 23:52.460
 but space conference is good too.

23:52.460 --> 23:55.660
 Then maybe all of a sudden you want to change out

23:55.660 --> 23:58.700
 what were window tiles yesterday, cupola tiles,

23:58.700 --> 24:00.460
 and make them into a birthing port

24:00.460 --> 24:02.540
 so that you can welcome five new spaceships

24:02.540 --> 24:04.260
 to come and join you in space.

24:04.260 --> 24:07.260
 That's what this promise of reconfigurable space architecture

24:07.260 --> 24:09.060
 might allow us to explore.

24:09.060 --> 24:10.660
 I've been hanging out with Grimes recently

24:10.660 --> 24:13.180
 and I just feel like she belongs up in space.

24:13.180 --> 24:15.460
 This is like designed for artists essentially.

24:15.460 --> 24:18.140
 Like imagine, I mean, this is what South by

24:18.140 --> 24:20.220
 keeps introducing me to is there's like

24:20.220 --> 24:23.420
 the weird and the beautiful people and like the artists.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.300
 And it feels like there's a lot of opportunities

24:26.300 --> 24:28.660
 for art and design.

24:28.660 --> 24:29.500
 100%.

24:29.500 --> 24:32.540
 It's like space is a combination of arts, design,

24:32.540 --> 24:34.100
 and great engineering.

24:36.820 --> 24:39.780
 It's safety critical with like the highest of stakes.

24:39.780 --> 24:41.740
 So don't, you can't mess it up.

24:41.740 --> 24:43.220
 And is this, is there, first of all,

24:43.220 --> 24:44.660
 you're talking about tiling.

24:44.660 --> 24:46.620
 So Neil Stephenson is obsessed about tile.

24:46.620 --> 24:48.780
 I don't know if it's related to any of this,

24:48.780 --> 24:50.620
 but he seems to be obsessed with like,

24:50.620 --> 24:51.660
 how do you tile a space?

24:51.660 --> 24:54.060
 That's like a mathematical, geometric notion.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.060
 Like the tessellation.

24:55.060 --> 24:59.540
 And it's, I mean, it's a beautiful idea for architecture

24:59.540 --> 25:03.380
 that you can self assemble these different shapes

25:03.380 --> 25:07.460
 and you can have probably some centralized guidance

25:07.460 --> 25:09.700
 of the kind of thing you want to build.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.020
 But they also kind of figure stuff out themselves

25:12.020 --> 25:13.540
 in terms of the low level details,

25:13.540 --> 25:15.980
 in terms of the figuring out when the,

25:15.980 --> 25:19.700
 when everything fits just right for the OCD people,

25:19.700 --> 25:23.060
 like what's that subreddit?

25:23.060 --> 25:25.660
 Pleasantly, it's like really fun.

25:25.660 --> 25:27.380
 Everything, they have like videos of everything

25:27.380 --> 25:29.580
 is just pleasant when everything just fits perfectly.

25:29.580 --> 25:30.420
 Very pleasing.

25:30.420 --> 25:32.540
 All the tolerances come together well, yeah.

25:32.540 --> 25:34.420
 So they figure that out on themselves

25:34.420 --> 25:36.340
 and the local robotics problem.

25:36.340 --> 25:39.340
 But by the way, what's the Pebbles Project?

25:39.340 --> 25:41.540
 The Pebbles Project are little cubes

25:41.540 --> 25:44.260
 that have EPMs in them, electropermanent magnets,

25:44.260 --> 25:46.140
 and they can self disassemble.

25:46.140 --> 25:47.100
 So they'll turn off.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.340
 And so you'll have this little structure

25:48.340 --> 25:51.660
 that all of a sudden can flip the little pebbles over

25:51.660 --> 25:54.540
 and essentially just disaggregate.

25:54.540 --> 25:56.620
 They have to make some pleasing sounds.

25:56.620 --> 25:57.460
 Yes, they do.

25:57.460 --> 26:01.380
 And that's gonna, so I'm supposed to talk to Danielle,

26:01.380 --> 26:02.900
 so I'll probably spend an hour

26:02.900 --> 26:04.980
 just discussing the sounds on the pebbles.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.540
 Okay, what were we talking about?

26:07.540 --> 26:10.940
 So that's, because you mentioned two, I think.

26:10.940 --> 26:12.060
 Right, my third one.

26:12.060 --> 26:13.220
 Yeah, is there a third one?

26:13.220 --> 26:14.580
 My third one is The Ringworld,

26:14.580 --> 26:17.300
 just because every science fiction book ever

26:17.300 --> 26:19.820
 that's worth anything has A Ringworld in it.

26:19.820 --> 26:21.860
 Is it like a donut?

26:21.860 --> 26:24.460
 A donut, yeah, it's a really big torus

26:24.460 --> 26:27.620
 that could encircle a planet

26:27.620 --> 26:29.580
 or encircle another celestial body,

26:29.580 --> 26:32.100
 maybe an asteroid or a small moon.

26:32.100 --> 26:36.060
 And the promise here is just the beauty

26:36.060 --> 26:39.900
 of being able to have that geometry in orbit

26:39.900 --> 26:43.140
 and all that surface area for solar panels and docking

26:43.140 --> 26:46.540
 and essentially just all of what that enables

26:46.540 --> 26:48.940
 to have a ring world at that scale in orbit.

26:48.940 --> 26:51.540
 By the way, for the viewers, we're looking at Figure 11.

26:51.540 --> 26:52.580
 What paper is this from?

26:52.580 --> 26:54.820
 This is a hexagonal tiling

26:54.820 --> 26:57.340
 of a torus generated in Mathematica

26:57.340 --> 27:01.060
 referencing code and approach from two citations.

27:01.060 --> 27:04.220
 So we're looking at a tiled donut, and I'm now hungry.

27:04.220 --> 27:06.940
 So this is the, is this from your thesis or no?

27:06.940 --> 27:08.740
 This is probably, I mean, this is in my thesis.

27:08.740 --> 27:10.580
 This looks like it was one of my earlier papers.

27:10.580 --> 27:13.260
 This was an approach to say, great,

27:13.260 --> 27:15.460
 we've come up with this tessellation approach

27:15.460 --> 27:18.120
 for a buckyball, and we picked the buckyball

27:18.120 --> 27:21.340
 because it is the most efficient surface area

27:21.340 --> 27:23.940
 to volume shape and what's expensive in space,

27:23.940 --> 27:26.340
 the surface area shipping up all that material.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.780
 So we wanted something that would maximize the volume.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.820
 But if we think about ring worlds and other shapes,

27:30.820 --> 27:34.060
 we wanted to look at how do you tile a torus?

27:34.060 --> 27:36.420
 And this is one example with hexagons

27:36.420 --> 27:39.120
 to be able to say, could we take this same tesserae approach

27:39.120 --> 27:42.180
 of self assembling tiles and create other geometries?

27:42.180 --> 27:43.540
 This is so freaking cool.

27:43.540 --> 27:44.360
 That's awesome.

27:44.360 --> 27:48.420
 So you mentioned microgravity, and I saw,

27:48.420 --> 27:50.180
 I believe that there's a picture

27:50.180 --> 27:52.020
 of you floating in microgravity.

27:52.020 --> 27:53.740
 When did you get to experience that?

27:53.740 --> 27:54.580
 What was that like?

27:54.580 --> 27:56.920
 Ah, so I've flown nine times

27:56.920 --> 27:59.980
 on the affectionately known as the Vomit Comet.

27:59.980 --> 28:02.500
 It's the parabolic flight, and essentially,

28:02.500 --> 28:04.300
 it does what you'd want a plane never to do.

28:04.300 --> 28:07.060
 It pitches really steeply upwards at 45 degrees.

28:07.060 --> 28:07.900
 Oh, that's a picture of you.

28:07.900 --> 28:09.540
 Yeah, yeah, that's tesserae.

28:09.540 --> 28:11.300
 That's super early in my PhD,

28:11.300 --> 28:12.800
 some of just the passive tiles

28:12.800 --> 28:14.260
 before we even put electronics in.

28:14.260 --> 28:17.100
 We were just testing the magnet polarity

28:17.100 --> 28:20.900
 and the, essentially, is it an energy favorable structure

28:20.900 --> 28:22.260
 to self assemble on its own?

28:22.260 --> 28:23.900
 So we tweaked a lot of things between.

28:23.900 --> 28:25.940
 Are we looking at a couple of them?

28:25.940 --> 28:27.260
 Yeah, you're looking at a bunch of them there.

28:27.260 --> 28:28.100
 Oh, oh, I see.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.260
 Almost 32 of them, yeah.

28:29.260 --> 28:30.100
 Cool.

28:30.100 --> 28:31.660
 They're clumping, they're clumping, yeah.

28:31.660 --> 28:33.140
 Can you comment on what's the difference

28:33.140 --> 28:35.900
 between microgravity and zero gravity?

28:35.900 --> 28:37.980
 Yes, so there is, is that an important difference?

28:37.980 --> 28:38.820
 It's an important difference.

28:38.820 --> 28:41.580
 There is no zero gravity.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.740
 There's no nothing, there's, in the universe,

28:43.740 --> 28:46.000
 there is no such thing as zero gravity.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.180
 So Newton's law of gravity tells us

28:48.180 --> 28:50.280
 that there's always gravity attraction

28:50.280 --> 28:51.300
 between any two objects.

28:51.300 --> 28:54.240
 So zero G is a shorthand that some of us fall into using,

28:54.240 --> 28:56.420
 where it's a little easier to communicate to the public.

28:56.420 --> 28:59.420
 The accurate term is microgravity,

28:59.420 --> 29:02.040
 where you are essentially floating, you're weightless,

29:02.040 --> 29:04.220
 but generally in free fall.

29:04.220 --> 29:06.580
 So on the parabolic flights, the vomit comet,

29:06.580 --> 29:09.260
 you're in free fall at the end of the parabola.

29:09.260 --> 29:12.380
 And in orbit around the Earth when you're floating,

29:12.380 --> 29:14.340
 you're also in free fall.

29:14.340 --> 29:15.900
 So that's microgravity.

29:15.900 --> 29:17.660
 So affectionately called vomit comet,

29:17.660 --> 29:19.780
 I'm sure there's a reason why it's called affectionately.

29:19.780 --> 29:21.040
 So what's it like?

29:21.040 --> 29:23.560
 What's your first time?

29:23.560 --> 29:27.940
 So both philosophically, spiritually, and biologically,

29:27.940 --> 29:28.860
 what's it like?

29:28.860 --> 29:30.300
 It's profound.

29:30.300 --> 29:35.120
 It is unlike anything else you will experience on Earth

29:35.120 --> 29:38.660
 because it is this true feeling of weightlessness

29:38.660 --> 29:40.000
 with no drag.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.660
 So the closest experience you can think of

29:41.660 --> 29:43.020
 would be floating in a pool,

29:43.020 --> 29:44.860
 but you move slowly when you float in a pool

29:44.860 --> 29:46.540
 and your motion is restricted.

29:46.540 --> 29:49.940
 When you're floating, it's just you and your body flying,

29:49.940 --> 29:51.160
 like in a dream.

29:52.160 --> 29:54.260
 It takes the littlest amount of energy,

29:54.260 --> 29:56.440
 like a finger tap against the wall of the plane

29:56.440 --> 29:58.760
 to shoot all the way across the fuselage.

29:58.760 --> 30:01.100
 And you can move at full speed.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.680
 You can move your arms.

30:02.680 --> 30:03.520
 Exactly.

30:03.520 --> 30:04.340
 So your muscles work.

30:04.340 --> 30:05.180
 There's no resistance.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.800
 There's no resistance.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.940
 They actually tell you to make a memory

30:09.940 --> 30:11.440
 when you're on the plane

30:11.440 --> 30:13.900
 because it's such a fleeting experience for your body

30:13.900 --> 30:14.940
 that even a few days later,

30:14.940 --> 30:17.780
 you've already forgotten exactly what it felt like.

30:17.780 --> 30:20.140
 It's so foreign to the human experience.

30:20.140 --> 30:22.500
 They kind of suggest that you explicitly try

30:22.500 --> 30:24.380
 to really form this into a memory

30:24.380 --> 30:25.700
 and then you can do the replay.

30:25.700 --> 30:26.540
 Is that for training?

30:26.540 --> 30:27.700
 Cognitively freeze it.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.540
 Yeah.

30:28.540 --> 30:29.380
 Cognitively.

30:29.380 --> 30:30.200
 Yeah.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.040
 Save.

30:31.040 --> 30:31.880
 Right.

30:31.880 --> 30:34.980
 When we have Neuralink, we can replay that memory.

30:34.980 --> 30:38.200
 So in terms of how much stress it has on your body,

30:38.200 --> 30:41.180
 is it biologically stressful?

30:41.180 --> 30:43.580
 You do feel a 2G pullout, right?

30:43.580 --> 30:46.460
 So the cost of getting those micro G parabolas

30:46.460 --> 30:48.900
 is you then have a 2G pullout and that's hard.

30:48.900 --> 30:50.180
 You have to train for it.

30:50.180 --> 30:52.620
 If you move your neck too quickly in that 2G pullout,

30:52.620 --> 30:54.780
 you can strain muscles.

30:54.780 --> 30:56.800
 But I wouldn't say that it's actually

30:56.800 --> 31:00.180
 a profound tough thing on the body.

31:00.180 --> 31:02.940
 It's really just an incredibly novel experience.

31:02.940 --> 31:04.500
 And when you're in orbit

31:04.500 --> 31:06.620
 and you're not having to go through the ups and downs

31:06.620 --> 31:07.840
 of the parabolic plane,

31:07.840 --> 31:09.900
 there's a real grace and elegance.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.460
 And you see the astronauts learn to operate

31:12.460 --> 31:14.980
 in this completely new environment.

31:14.980 --> 31:16.380
 What are some interesting differences

31:16.380 --> 31:17.800
 between the parabolic plane

31:17.800 --> 31:20.180
 and when you're actually going up into orbit?

31:20.180 --> 31:22.900
 Is it that with orbit you can look out

31:22.900 --> 31:26.180
 and see that blue little planet of ours?

31:26.180 --> 31:28.800
 You can see the blue marble, the stunning overview effect,

31:28.800 --> 31:30.900
 which is something I hope to see one day.

31:31.940 --> 31:34.180
 What's also really different is if you're in orbit

31:34.180 --> 31:36.060
 for any significant period of time,

31:36.060 --> 31:38.180
 there's gonna be a lot more physiological changes

31:38.180 --> 31:41.500
 to your body than if you just did an afternoon flight

31:41.500 --> 31:42.860
 on the Vomit Comet.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.940
 Everything from your bones, your muscles,

31:44.940 --> 31:47.500
 your eyeballs change shape.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.020
 There's a lot of different things that happen

31:49.020 --> 31:51.120
 for long duration space flight.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.520
 And we still have to, as scientists,

31:52.520 --> 31:54.500
 we still have to solve a lot of these interesting challenges

31:54.500 --> 31:58.400
 to be able to keep humans thriving in microgravity

31:58.400 --> 32:00.140
 or deep duration space missions.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.580
 Deep duration space missions.

32:03.580 --> 32:05.080
 Okay, let's talk about this.

32:05.080 --> 32:08.220
 I was just gonna ask a bunch of dumb questions.

32:08.220 --> 32:11.660
 So approximately how long does it take to travel to Mars?

32:11.660 --> 32:12.620
 Asking for a friend.

32:12.620 --> 32:14.820
 Asking for a friend, as we all do.

32:14.820 --> 32:17.780
 About three years for a round trip.

32:17.780 --> 32:19.180
 And that's not that it actually takes that long.

32:19.180 --> 32:20.940
 Why the round trip, is that?

32:20.940 --> 32:23.780
 Well, you're just asking about the one way trip.

32:23.780 --> 32:25.020
 Got it, got it, got it.

32:25.020 --> 32:25.860
 It's okay, cool.

32:25.860 --> 32:29.460
 So for just like literally flying to Mars in a round,

32:29.460 --> 32:30.740
 it takes three years.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.540
 There's some interstitial time there

32:32.540 --> 32:35.460
 because you really can only go between Earth and Mars

32:35.460 --> 32:37.540
 at certain points in their orbits

32:37.540 --> 32:39.420
 where it's favorable to make that journey.

32:39.420 --> 32:40.860
 And so part of that three years

32:40.860 --> 32:42.900
 is you take the journey to Mars,

32:42.900 --> 32:45.000
 a few months, six to nine months.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.400
 You're there for a period of time

32:46.400 --> 32:49.860
 until the orbits find a favorable alignment again.

32:49.860 --> 32:51.900
 And then you come back another six to nine months.

32:51.900 --> 32:54.140
 So one way travel, six to nine months.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.420
 They hang out there on vacation and come back.

32:56.420 --> 32:57.260
 Forced vacation.

32:57.260 --> 32:58.080
 Forced vacation.

32:58.080 --> 32:58.920
 You come back.

32:58.920 --> 33:00.940
 Well, me who loves working all the time,

33:00.940 --> 33:03.260
 all vacation is forced vacation.

33:03.260 --> 33:04.660
 All right.

33:04.660 --> 33:07.780
 So okay, so that gives us a sense of duration.

33:07.780 --> 33:10.260
 And we can maybe also talk about longer

33:10.260 --> 33:13.580
 and longer and longer duration as well.

33:13.580 --> 33:18.580
 What are the hardest aspects of living in space

33:18.700 --> 33:23.320
 for many days, for let's say 100 days, 200 days?

33:23.320 --> 33:25.900
 Maybe there's a threshold when it gets really tough.

33:25.900 --> 33:29.780
 What are some stupid little things or big things

33:29.780 --> 33:32.340
 that are very difficult for human beings to go through?

33:32.340 --> 33:33.860
 It's one big thing and one little thing.

33:33.860 --> 33:35.460
 And there are these two classic problems

33:35.460 --> 33:37.260
 that we're trying to solve in the space industry.

33:37.260 --> 33:38.820
 One is radiation.

33:38.820 --> 33:40.940
 It's not as much of a problem for us right now

33:40.940 --> 33:42.280
 on the International Space Station

33:42.280 --> 33:44.100
 because we're still protected

33:44.100 --> 33:46.140
 by part of Earth's magnetosphere.

33:46.140 --> 33:47.980
 But as soon as you get farther out into space

33:47.980 --> 33:49.340
 and you don't have that protection

33:49.340 --> 33:52.700
 once you leave the Van Allen belt area of the Earth

33:52.700 --> 33:55.380
 and the cocoon around the Earth,

33:55.380 --> 33:57.940
 we have really serious concerns about radiation

33:57.940 --> 33:59.940
 and the effect on human health longterm.

33:59.940 --> 34:01.360
 That's the big one.

34:01.360 --> 34:02.960
 The small one, and I say it's small

34:02.960 --> 34:04.340
 because it seems mundane,

34:04.340 --> 34:06.020
 but it actually is really big in its own way,

34:06.020 --> 34:09.100
 is mental health and how to keep people happy and balanced.

34:09.100 --> 34:10.820
 And you were alluding to some of the psychological

34:10.820 --> 34:13.980
 challenges of having humans together on missions

34:13.980 --> 34:16.180
 and especially as we try to scale the number of humans

34:16.180 --> 34:18.180
 in orbit or in space.

34:18.180 --> 34:20.520
 So that's another big challenge is how to keep people happy

34:20.520 --> 34:22.860
 and balanced and cooperating.

34:24.140 --> 34:25.940
 That's not an issue on Earth at all.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.220
 At all.

34:27.220 --> 34:29.460
 Okay, so we'll talk about each of those

34:29.460 --> 34:31.140
 in a bit more detail,

34:31.140 --> 34:34.460
 but let me continue on the chain of dumb questions.

34:34.460 --> 34:35.700
 What about food?

34:35.700 --> 34:38.660
 What's a good source for food in space?

34:38.660 --> 34:42.700
 And what are some sort of standard go to meals, menus?

34:42.700 --> 34:46.060
 Right now your go to menu is gonna be mostly freeze dried.

34:46.060 --> 34:50.380
 Every so often NASA will arrange for a fun stunt

34:50.380 --> 34:51.900
 or fresh food to get up to station.

34:51.900 --> 34:54.540
 So they did bake DoubleTree cookies with Hilton

34:54.540 --> 34:55.800
 a couple of years ago, as I recall,

34:55.800 --> 34:57.820
 I think sometime before the pandemic.

34:57.820 --> 35:00.140
 But there's work actually in our lab at MIT,

35:00.140 --> 35:02.140
 Maggie Koblans, one of my staff researchers

35:02.140 --> 35:04.580
 is looking at the future of fermentation.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.120
 Everybody loves beer, right?

35:06.120 --> 35:08.700
 Beer and wine and kimchi and miso,

35:08.700 --> 35:11.880
 these foods that have just been really important

35:11.880 --> 35:15.100
 to human cultures for eons because we love the umami

35:15.100 --> 35:16.540
 and the better flavor in them.

35:16.540 --> 35:18.420
 But it turns out they also have a good shelf life

35:18.420 --> 35:19.740
 if done properly.

35:19.740 --> 35:22.460
 And they also have a additional health benefit

35:22.460 --> 35:25.660
 for the microbiome, for probiotics and prebiotics.

35:25.660 --> 35:28.180
 So we're trying to work with NASA and convince them

35:28.180 --> 35:30.980
 to be more open minded to fermented food

35:30.980 --> 35:33.120
 for long duration deep space missions.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.180
 That we think is one of the future elements

35:35.180 --> 35:38.580
 in addition to in situ growing your own food.

35:38.580 --> 35:41.420
 Okay, this is essential for the space party

35:41.420 --> 35:43.300
 is the space beer.

35:43.300 --> 35:45.780
 Yes, it's the fermented product, yes.

35:45.780 --> 35:46.740
 Okay, cool.

35:46.740 --> 35:49.700
 In terms of water, what's a good source of drinkable water?

35:49.700 --> 35:50.660
 Like where do you get water?

35:50.660 --> 35:52.900
 Do you have to always bring it on board with you?

35:52.900 --> 35:56.700
 And is there a compressed efficient way of storing it?

35:56.700 --> 35:58.860
 So to steal a line from Charlie Bolden,

35:58.860 --> 36:01.420
 who's the former administrator of NASA,

36:01.420 --> 36:04.640
 this morning's fresh water is yesterday's coffee.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.420
 So if you think about what that means,

36:06.420 --> 36:08.100
 you drank the coffee yesterday.

36:08.100 --> 36:10.780
 Right, as it travels, it goes fully through the body.

36:10.780 --> 36:13.100
 Fully through the body as the recycling system.

36:13.100 --> 36:15.420
 And then you drink what you peed out

36:15.420 --> 36:20.420
 as clarified, refined fresh water the next day.

36:20.420 --> 36:22.340
 That is one source of water.

36:22.340 --> 36:24.460
 Another source of water in the near neighborhood

36:24.460 --> 36:26.180
 of our solar system would be on the moon.

36:26.180 --> 36:29.100
 So water ice deposits, there's also water on Mars.

36:29.100 --> 36:31.740
 This is one of the big things that's bringing people

36:31.740 --> 36:34.260
 to want to develop infrastructure on the moon

36:34.260 --> 36:36.780
 is once you've gotten out of the gravity well of Earth,

36:36.780 --> 36:39.340
 if you can find water on the moon and refine it,

36:39.340 --> 36:40.900
 you can either make it into propellant

36:40.900 --> 36:43.180
 or drinkable water for humans.

36:43.180 --> 36:46.100
 And so that's really valuable as a potential gateway

36:46.100 --> 36:47.660
 out into the rest of the solar system

36:47.660 --> 36:48.860
 to be able to get propellant

36:48.860 --> 36:51.100
 without always having to ship it up from Earth.

36:52.300 --> 36:55.220
 So how much water is there on Mars?

36:55.220 --> 36:56.060
 That's a great question.

36:56.060 --> 36:56.900
 I do not know.

36:56.900 --> 36:57.740
 We don't know this yet, right?

36:57.740 --> 36:58.900
 I know there's water at the caps.

36:58.900 --> 37:03.340
 I suspect NASA from all of the satellite studies

37:03.340 --> 37:05.780
 that they've done at Mars have a decent idea

37:05.780 --> 37:07.620
 of what the water deposits look like,

37:07.620 --> 37:08.660
 but I don't know to what degree

37:08.660 --> 37:10.540
 they have characterized those.

37:10.540 --> 37:13.100
 I really hope there's life or traces

37:13.100 --> 37:15.780
 of previous life on Mars.

37:15.780 --> 37:17.660
 This is a special spot in my heart

37:17.660 --> 37:20.020
 because I got to work on SHERLOC,

37:20.020 --> 37:22.260
 which is the astrobiology experiment

37:22.260 --> 37:23.660
 that's on Mars right now,

37:23.660 --> 37:25.540
 searching for what they would say

37:25.540 --> 37:30.060
 in a very cautious way is signs of past habitability.

37:30.060 --> 37:32.260
 They wanna be careful not to get people overly excited

37:32.260 --> 37:34.180
 and say we're searching for signs of life.

37:34.180 --> 37:37.460
 They're searching to see if there would have been organics

37:37.460 --> 37:39.820
 on the surface of Mars or water in certain areas

37:39.820 --> 37:42.660
 that would have allowed for life to flourish.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.620
 And I really love this prospect.

37:44.620 --> 37:46.500
 I do think within our lifetimes

37:46.500 --> 37:49.420
 we'll get a better answer about finding life

37:49.420 --> 37:51.420
 in our solar system if it's there.

37:51.420 --> 37:54.980
 If not on Mars, maybe Europa, one of the icy worlds.

37:54.980 --> 37:58.300
 So you like astrobiology.

37:58.300 --> 37:59.140
 I do.

37:59.140 --> 38:02.620
 This is part of the, it's not just about human biology.

38:02.620 --> 38:05.740
 It's also other extraterrestrial alien biology.

38:05.740 --> 38:07.540
 Search for life in the universe.

38:07.540 --> 38:08.380
 Okay.

38:08.380 --> 38:09.580
 Does that scare you or excite you?

38:09.580 --> 38:11.220
 It excites me, profoundly excites me.

38:11.220 --> 38:13.580
 That there's other alien civilizations

38:13.580 --> 38:16.100
 potentially very different than our own?

38:16.100 --> 38:18.020
 I think there's gotta be some humility there.

38:18.020 --> 38:19.300
 And certainly from science fiction

38:19.300 --> 38:22.660
 we have plenty of reasons to fear that outcome as well.

38:22.660 --> 38:24.020
 But I do think as a scientist

38:24.020 --> 38:26.660
 it would be profoundly exciting if we were to find life

38:26.660 --> 38:29.540
 especially in the near neighborhood of our solar system.

38:29.540 --> 38:32.580
 Right now we would expect it to be most likely microbial life

38:32.580 --> 38:34.860
 but we have a real serious challenge in astrobiology

38:34.860 --> 38:37.860
 which is it may not even be carbon based life.

38:37.860 --> 38:39.180
 And all of our detectors,

38:39.180 --> 38:42.100
 we only know to look for DNA or RNA.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.820
 How would you even build a detector

38:43.820 --> 38:47.260
 to look for silicon based life

38:47.260 --> 38:49.140
 or different molecules than what we know

38:49.140 --> 38:51.380
 to be the fundamental molecules for life?

38:51.380 --> 38:53.380
 And then you mentioned offline Sarah Walker.

38:53.380 --> 38:56.380
 I mean she, her, the question that she's obsessed with

38:56.380 --> 38:58.300
 is even just defining life.

38:58.300 --> 38:59.460
 What is life?

38:59.460 --> 39:02.020
 To look outside the carbon base.

39:02.020 --> 39:04.380
 I mean to look outside of basically anything

39:04.380 --> 39:06.740
 we can even imagine chemically.

39:06.740 --> 39:08.300
 To look outside of any kind of notions

39:08.300 --> 39:10.260
 that we think of as biology.

39:10.260 --> 39:11.740
 Yeah, it's really weird.

39:11.740 --> 39:14.420
 So you now get into this land of like complexity

39:14.420 --> 39:19.420
 of a measuring of like how many assembly steps

39:20.540 --> 39:22.580
 it takes to build that thing.

39:22.580 --> 39:23.420
 Right.

39:23.420 --> 39:27.660
 And maybe dynamic movement or some maintenance

39:27.660 --> 39:29.700
 of some kind of membrane structures.

39:29.700 --> 39:33.500
 We don't even know like which properties life should have.

39:33.500 --> 39:34.340
 Right.

39:34.340 --> 39:36.220
 Whether it should be able to reproduce

39:36.220 --> 39:39.180
 and all those kinds of things or pass information,

39:39.180 --> 39:41.180
 genetic type of information.

39:41.180 --> 39:42.420
 We don't know.

39:42.420 --> 39:45.140
 And it's like, it's so humbling.

39:45.140 --> 39:47.660
 I mean I tend to believe that there could be

39:48.540 --> 39:51.060
 something like alien life here on Earth

39:51.060 --> 39:54.620
 and we're just too human, biology obsessed

39:54.620 --> 39:55.980
 to even recognize it.

39:55.980 --> 39:57.940
 The shadow biosphere, I remember you and Sarah

39:57.940 --> 39:58.940
 were talking about.

39:58.940 --> 40:02.220
 I mean that's like, speaking of beer,

40:02.220 --> 40:04.380
 I mean that's something I wanted to make sure

40:04.380 --> 40:07.240
 in all of science to shake ourselves out of like,

40:07.240 --> 40:10.140
 remind ourselves constantly how little we know.

40:10.140 --> 40:13.100
 Because it might be right in front of our nose.

40:13.100 --> 40:15.900
 Like I wouldn't be surprised if like trees

40:15.900 --> 40:18.860
 are like orders of magnitude more intelligent than humans.

40:18.860 --> 40:21.300
 They're just operating at a much slower scale

40:21.300 --> 40:23.820
 and they're like talking shit about us the whole time.

40:23.820 --> 40:26.580
 Like about silly humans that take everything seriously

40:26.580 --> 40:28.640
 and we start all kinds of nuclear wars

40:28.640 --> 40:31.900
 and we quarrel and we tweet about it and then,

40:31.900 --> 40:35.180
 but the trees are always there just watching us silly humans.

40:35.180 --> 40:37.020
 Like the Ents in Lord of the Rings.

40:37.020 --> 40:37.860
 Exactly.

40:37.860 --> 40:40.940
 So I mean, I don't know, I mean, obviously I'm joking

40:40.940 --> 40:43.220
 on that one, but there could be stuff like that.

40:44.140 --> 40:46.700
 Well, let me ask you the Drake equation,

40:46.700 --> 40:51.060
 the big question, how many, like obviously nobody knows,

40:51.060 --> 40:54.180
 but what's your gut, what's your hope as a scientist,

40:54.180 --> 40:57.140
 as a human, how many alien civilizations are out there?

40:58.540 --> 41:01.260
 As a ex physicist, I'm now much more

41:01.260 --> 41:03.500
 on the aerospace engineering side for space architecture,

41:03.500 --> 41:08.500
 but as an ex physicist, I hope it is prolific.

41:08.660 --> 41:10.660
 I think the challenge is if it's as prolific

41:10.660 --> 41:12.900
 as we would hope, if there are many, many, many

41:12.900 --> 41:16.940
 civilizations, then the question is, where are they?

41:16.940 --> 41:18.740
 Why haven't we heard from them?

41:18.740 --> 41:21.820
 And the Fermi paradox, is there some great filter

41:21.820 --> 41:25.540
 that life only gets to some level of sophistication

41:25.540 --> 41:29.220
 and then kills itself off through war or through famine

41:29.220 --> 41:30.860
 or through different challenges that filter

41:30.860 --> 41:33.820
 that society out of existence?

41:33.820 --> 41:35.140
 And it would be an interesting question to try

41:35.140 --> 41:38.100
 to understand if the universe was teeming with life,

41:38.100 --> 41:41.080
 why haven't we found it or heard from it yet,

41:41.080 --> 41:41.920
 to our knowledge?

41:41.920 --> 41:44.900
 Yeah, I personally believe that it's teeming with life,

41:44.900 --> 41:46.920
 and you're right, I think that's a really useful,

41:46.920 --> 41:49.460
 productive engineering scientific question

41:49.460 --> 41:53.540
 of what kind of great filter can just be destroying

41:53.540 --> 41:57.380
 all of that life or preventing it from just constantly

41:57.380 --> 42:01.540
 talking to us, silly descendants of apes.

42:01.540 --> 42:05.380
 That's a really nice question, like what are the ways

42:05.380 --> 42:07.720
 civilizations can destroy themselves?

42:09.020 --> 42:10.660
 There's too many, sadly.

42:10.660 --> 42:13.620
 Well, I don't think we've come up with most of them yet.

42:13.620 --> 42:15.580
 That's also probably true.

42:15.580 --> 42:18.920
 That's the thing, it's, I mean, and if you look

42:18.920 --> 42:21.860
 at nuclear war, some of it is physics,

42:21.860 --> 42:26.180
 but some of it is game theory, it's human nature,

42:26.180 --> 42:29.260
 it's how societies built themselves, how they interact,

42:29.260 --> 42:32.540
 how we create and resolve conflict,

42:32.540 --> 42:34.640
 and it gets back to the human question

42:34.640 --> 42:37.120
 on when you're doing long term space travel,

42:37.120 --> 42:40.320
 how do you maintain this dynamical system

42:40.320 --> 42:45.320
 of flawed, irrational humans such that it persists

42:46.580 --> 42:50.140
 throughout time, and not just maintain the biological body,

42:50.140 --> 42:52.660
 but get people from not murdering each other,

42:52.660 --> 42:56.700
 like like each other sufficiently to where you kinda

42:56.700 --> 43:01.700
 fit well, but I think if songs or poetry or books

43:01.900 --> 43:04.700
 taught me anything, if you like each other a little too much,

43:05.800 --> 43:07.860
 I mean, the problems arise, because then there's always

43:07.860 --> 43:10.180
 a third person who also likes, and then there's the drama,

43:10.180 --> 43:12.820
 it's like, I can't believe you did that last night,

43:12.820 --> 43:14.780
 whatever, so, and then there's beer.

43:14.780 --> 43:17.180
 Gets complicated quickly. Gets complicated quickly.

43:17.180 --> 43:20.220
 Okay, anyway, back to the dumb questions,

43:20.220 --> 43:22.900
 because you answered this, there's an interview

43:22.900 --> 43:24.500
 where you answer a bunch of cool little questions

43:24.500 --> 43:28.300
 from young students and so on, about like space.

43:29.540 --> 43:32.340
 One of them was playing music in space.

43:32.340 --> 43:33.220
 Yeah.

43:33.220 --> 43:37.060
 And you mentioned something about what kind of instruments

43:37.060 --> 43:39.460
 you could use to play music in space.

43:39.460 --> 43:43.120
 Could you mention about like the Spotify work in space,

43:43.120 --> 43:45.060
 and if I wanted to do a live performance,

43:45.060 --> 43:47.780
 what kind of instruments would I need?

43:47.780 --> 43:50.300
 Yeah, I mean, you referenced culture before,

43:50.300 --> 43:51.960
 and I think this is one of the most exciting things

43:51.960 --> 43:55.380
 that we have at our fingertips, which is to define

43:55.380 --> 43:57.780
 a new culture for space exploration.

43:57.780 --> 44:01.620
 We don't just have to import cultural artifacts from Earth

44:01.620 --> 44:03.460
 to make life worth living in space,

44:03.460 --> 44:05.140
 and this musical instrument that you referenced

44:05.140 --> 44:08.180
 was a design of an object that could only be performed

44:08.180 --> 44:09.460
 in microgravity.

44:09.460 --> 44:10.300
 Oh, cool.

44:10.300 --> 44:13.140
 So it doesn't sound the same way when it's,

44:13.140 --> 44:15.140
 it's a percussive instrument when it's rattled

44:15.140 --> 44:17.500
 or moved in a gravity environment, it is unique.

44:17.500 --> 44:18.340
 Can we look it up?

44:18.340 --> 44:19.500
 It's called the Telematron.

44:19.500 --> 44:20.340
 Yeah, it's created by.

44:20.340 --> 44:21.900
 Of course it's called the Telematron.

44:21.900 --> 44:22.720
 Telematron.

44:22.720 --> 44:23.560
 That is so awesome.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.780
 Created by Sands Fish and Nicole Boulier,

44:25.780 --> 44:28.540
 two amazing graduate students and staff researchers

44:28.540 --> 44:29.460
 on my team.

44:29.460 --> 44:30.300
 What does it look like?

44:30.300 --> 44:33.300
 It looks steampunk, actually.

44:33.300 --> 44:34.140
 That's awesome.

44:34.140 --> 44:35.100
 Yeah, it's a pretty cool design.

44:35.100 --> 44:37.300
 It looks like it's a geometric solid

44:37.300 --> 44:39.860
 that has these interesting artifacts on the inside,

44:39.860 --> 44:41.260
 and it has a lot of sensors, actually,

44:41.260 --> 44:42.220
 additionally on the inside,

44:42.220 --> 44:44.980
 like IMU's inertial measurement sensors

44:44.980 --> 44:47.780
 that allow it to detect when it's floating

44:47.780 --> 44:49.140
 and when it's not floating,

44:49.140 --> 44:52.500
 and provides this really kind of ethereal,

44:52.500 --> 44:53.580
 they later sonify it.

44:53.580 --> 44:56.220
 So they use electronic music to turn it into a symphony

44:56.220 --> 44:57.620
 or turn it into a piece.

44:57.620 --> 44:59.580
 And yeah, this is the object, the Telematron.

44:59.580 --> 45:01.380
 How does the human interact with it?

45:01.380 --> 45:02.220
 By tossing it.

45:02.220 --> 45:04.020
 So it's an interactive musical instrument.

45:04.020 --> 45:06.420
 It actually requires another partner.

45:06.420 --> 45:09.420
 So the idea was that it's something like a dance

45:09.420 --> 45:12.020
 or just like something like a choreography in space.

45:12.020 --> 45:12.860
 Got it.

45:12.860 --> 45:15.820
 Speaking of which, you also talked about sports,

45:15.820 --> 45:18.340
 and like ball sports, like playing soccer.

45:18.340 --> 45:20.220
 So you mentioned that,

45:20.220 --> 45:22.940
 so your muscles can move at full speed,

45:23.780 --> 45:26.460
 and then if you push off the wall lightly,

45:26.460 --> 45:28.660
 you fly across, zoom across.

45:28.660 --> 45:31.340
 So how does the physics of that work?

45:31.340 --> 45:34.420
 Can you still play soccer, for example, in space?

45:34.420 --> 45:37.220
 You can, but one of the most intuitive things

45:37.220 --> 45:39.140
 that we all learn as babies, right,

45:39.140 --> 45:40.620
 is whenever you throw something,

45:40.620 --> 45:41.940
 if I was gonna toss something to you,

45:41.940 --> 45:42.980
 I'd toss it up,

45:42.980 --> 45:44.660
 because I know that it has to compensate

45:44.660 --> 45:47.620
 for the fact that that Keplerian arc is gonna draw it down,

45:47.620 --> 45:50.860
 the equations of motion are gonna draw it down.

45:50.860 --> 45:51.900
 I would, in space,

45:51.900 --> 45:54.420
 I would just shoot something directly towards you,

45:54.420 --> 45:56.260
 so like straight in line of sight.

45:56.260 --> 45:57.380
 And so that would be very different

45:57.380 --> 45:58.580
 for any type of ball sport,

45:58.580 --> 46:00.420
 is to retrain your human mind

46:00.420 --> 46:03.380
 to have that as your intuitive arc of motion

46:03.380 --> 46:04.300
 or lack of arc.

46:04.300 --> 46:05.460
 From your experience,

46:05.460 --> 46:07.180
 from understanding how astronauts

46:07.180 --> 46:08.460
 get adjusted to this stuff,

46:08.460 --> 46:10.340
 how long does it take to adjust to the physics

46:10.340 --> 46:12.980
 of this world, this other world?

46:12.980 --> 46:15.420
 So even after one or two parabolic flights,

46:15.420 --> 46:18.620
 you can gain a certain facility

46:18.620 --> 46:20.660
 with moving in that environment.

46:20.660 --> 46:22.180
 I think most astronauts would say

46:22.180 --> 46:23.820
 maybe several days on station

46:23.820 --> 46:25.020
 or a week on station,

46:25.020 --> 46:26.740
 and their brain flips.

46:26.740 --> 46:28.940
 It's amazing the plasticity of the human brain

46:28.940 --> 46:31.140
 and how quickly they are able to adapt.

46:31.140 --> 46:32.060
 And so pretty quickly,

46:32.060 --> 46:36.100
 they become creatures of this new environment.

46:36.100 --> 46:36.940
 Okay, so that's cool.

46:36.940 --> 46:38.980
 It's creating a little bit of an experience.

46:38.980 --> 46:42.420
 What about if you go for more than 100 days

46:42.420 --> 46:46.100
 for one year, for two years, for three years?

46:46.100 --> 46:49.100
 What challenges start to emerge in that case?

46:49.100 --> 46:50.940
 So Scott Kelly wrote this amazing book

46:50.940 --> 46:52.580
 after he spent a year in space,

46:52.580 --> 46:53.460
 and he's a twin.

46:53.460 --> 46:54.780
 It's absolutely fantastic

46:54.780 --> 46:57.140
 that NASA got to do a twin study.

46:57.140 --> 46:58.540
 It's perfect.

46:58.540 --> 47:00.740
 So he wrote a lot about his experience

47:00.740 --> 47:02.980
 on the health side of what changed,

47:02.980 --> 47:06.900
 things like bone density, muscle atrophy,

47:06.900 --> 47:08.140
 eyesight changing

47:08.140 --> 47:10.060
 because the shape of your eyeball changes,

47:10.060 --> 47:11.180
 which changes your lens,

47:11.180 --> 47:12.900
 which changes how you see.

47:12.900 --> 47:14.620
 If we're then thinking about the challenges

47:14.620 --> 47:16.500
 between a year and three years,

47:16.500 --> 47:18.500
 especially if we're doing that three year trip to Mars

47:18.500 --> 47:20.340
 for your friend who asked earlier,

47:20.340 --> 47:23.940
 then you have to think about nutrition.

47:23.940 --> 47:25.620
 And so how are you keeping

47:25.620 --> 47:28.060
 all of these different needs for your body alive?

47:28.060 --> 47:30.620
 How are you protecting astronauts against radiation?

47:30.620 --> 47:33.100
 Either having some type of a shell on the spacecraft,

47:33.100 --> 47:35.540
 which is expensive because it's heavy.

47:35.540 --> 47:36.420
 If it's something like lead,

47:36.420 --> 47:37.980
 a really effective radiation shell,

47:37.980 --> 47:39.660
 it's gonna be a lot of mass.

47:39.660 --> 47:42.060
 Or is there a pill that could be taken

47:42.060 --> 47:46.500
 to try to make you less in danger

47:46.500 --> 47:49.300
 of some of the radiation effects?

47:49.300 --> 47:51.060
 A lot of this has not yet been answered,

47:51.060 --> 47:53.420
 but radiation is a really significant challenge

47:53.420 --> 47:55.540
 for that three year journey.

47:55.540 --> 47:57.460
 And what are the negative effects of radiation

47:57.460 --> 47:59.140
 on the human body out in space?

47:59.140 --> 48:03.300
 A higher likelihood to develop cancer at a younger age.

48:03.300 --> 48:05.260
 So you'd probably be able to get there and get back,

48:05.260 --> 48:08.100
 but you'd find yourself in the same way

48:08.100 --> 48:10.740
 of if you were exposed to significant radiation on Earth,

48:10.740 --> 48:13.460
 you'd find significant bad health effects as you age.

48:14.380 --> 48:16.980
 What do you think about like decades?

48:16.980 --> 48:19.100
 Do you think about decades?

48:19.100 --> 48:21.220
 Or is this like an entire?

48:21.220 --> 48:23.980
 I think about centuries for MySpace.

48:23.980 --> 48:25.820
 But yeah, for decades,

48:25.820 --> 48:28.340
 I think as soon as we get past the three year mark,

48:28.340 --> 48:29.580
 we'll absolutely want,

48:29.580 --> 48:31.100
 somewhere between three years and a decade,

48:31.100 --> 48:33.620
 we'll want artificial gravity.

48:33.620 --> 48:35.300
 And we know how to do that, actually.

48:35.300 --> 48:37.380
 The engineering questions still need to be tweaked

48:37.380 --> 48:38.460
 for how we'd really implement it,

48:38.460 --> 48:39.700
 but the science is there to know

48:39.700 --> 48:44.100
 how we would spin habitats in orbit and generate that force.

48:44.100 --> 48:46.380
 So even if the entire habitat's not spinning,

48:46.380 --> 48:49.060
 you at least have a treadmill part of the space station

48:49.060 --> 48:50.180
 that is spinning,

48:50.180 --> 48:52.340
 and you can spend some fraction of your day

48:52.340 --> 48:56.780
 in a near to 1G environment and keep your body healthy.

48:56.780 --> 48:58.420
 Wait, literally from just spinning?

48:58.420 --> 49:00.140
 From spinning, yes, centripetal force.

49:00.140 --> 49:01.500
 That's fascinating. So you generate this force.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.500
 If you've ever been in those carnival rides,

49:03.500 --> 49:06.060
 the gravitrons that spin you up around the side,

49:06.060 --> 49:07.300
 that's the concept.

49:07.300 --> 49:08.900
 And this is actually one of the reasons

49:08.900 --> 49:12.140
 why we are spinning out a new company

49:12.140 --> 49:13.860
 from my MIT lab. Spinning out, ha.

49:13.860 --> 49:14.700
 Spinning out, ha.

49:14.700 --> 49:18.020
 That was accidental, but well noted space pun.

49:18.020 --> 49:20.660
 It's like impossible to avoid. Dad jokes, all right.

49:20.660 --> 49:23.820
 But yeah, we're spinning out a new company

49:23.820 --> 49:27.820
 to look at next generation space architecture,

49:27.820 --> 49:30.540
 and how do we actually scale humanity's access to space?

49:30.540 --> 49:32.540
 And one of the areas that we wanna look at

49:32.540 --> 49:34.060
 is artificial gravity.

49:34.060 --> 49:34.940
 Is there a name yet?

49:34.940 --> 49:36.540
 Yep, there's a name. We are brand new.

49:36.540 --> 49:38.780
 We are just exiting stealth mode.

49:38.780 --> 49:40.940
 So your podcast listeners will literally be among

49:40.940 --> 49:42.540
 some of the first to hear about it.

49:42.540 --> 49:45.220
 It's called Aurelia Institute.

49:45.220 --> 49:48.260
 Aurelia is an old English word for chrysalis.

49:48.260 --> 49:51.940
 And the idea with this is that we, humanity collectively,

49:51.940 --> 49:55.620
 are at this next stage of our metamorphosis,

49:55.620 --> 49:58.660
 like a chrysalis, into a spacefaring species.

49:58.660 --> 50:00.860
 And so we felt that this was a good time,

50:00.860 --> 50:04.340
 a necessary time, to think about

50:04.340 --> 50:06.100
 next generation space architecture,

50:06.100 --> 50:08.100
 but also Starfleet Academy,

50:08.100 --> 50:10.180
 if you know that reference from Star Trek.

50:12.300 --> 50:17.220
 Yes, so let me ask a silly sounding, ridiculous sounding,

50:17.220 --> 50:19.900
 but probably extremely important question.

50:19.900 --> 50:23.220
 Sex and space, including intercourse, conception,

50:23.220 --> 50:27.820
 procreation, birth, like being a parent,

50:27.820 --> 50:29.180
 like raising the baby.

50:29.180 --> 50:33.420
 So basically from birth, well, from the before birth part,

50:33.420 --> 50:34.780
 like the birds and the bees and stuff,

50:34.780 --> 50:37.020
 and then the whole thing.

50:37.020 --> 50:38.500
 How complicated is that?

50:38.500 --> 50:41.020
 I remember looking at the, thank you.

50:43.300 --> 50:46.020
 I remember looking at this exact Wikipedia page actually,

50:46.020 --> 50:50.180
 and I remember being, the Wikipedia page is sex and space,

50:50.180 --> 50:52.660
 and fascinating how difficult of an engineering problem

50:52.660 --> 50:53.740
 the whole thing is.

50:53.740 --> 50:55.340
 Is that something you think about too,

50:55.340 --> 50:58.900
 how to have generations of humans?

50:58.900 --> 51:03.100
 Self, self replicating organizations.

51:03.100 --> 51:04.740
 Yeah, societies essentially.

51:04.740 --> 51:05.820
 I mean, I guess with micro,

51:05.820 --> 51:07.500
 like if you solve the gravity problem,

51:07.500 --> 51:09.020
 you solve a lot of these problems.

51:09.020 --> 51:09.980
 That's the hope, yeah.

51:09.980 --> 51:12.140
 It's like the central challenge of microgravity

51:12.140 --> 51:13.660
 to human reproduction.

51:13.660 --> 51:16.660
 But we do host a workshop every year at Beyond the Cradle,

51:16.660 --> 51:18.820
 which is the space event that we run at MIT.

51:18.820 --> 51:21.580
 And we always do one on pregnancy in space,

51:21.580 --> 51:24.420
 or motherhood, or raising children in space,

51:24.420 --> 51:26.740
 because there are huge questions.

51:26.740 --> 51:29.060
 There've been a few mammal studies

51:29.060 --> 51:31.060
 that have looked at reproduction in space,

51:31.060 --> 51:32.500
 but there are still really major questions

51:32.500 --> 51:33.820
 about how does it work?

51:33.820 --> 51:36.100
 How does the fetus evolve in microgravity

51:36.100 --> 51:37.460
 if you were pregnant in space?

51:37.460 --> 51:39.540
 And I think the near term answer is just gonna be,

51:39.540 --> 51:43.940
 we need to be able to give humans a 1G environment

51:43.940 --> 51:45.220
 for that phase of our development.

51:45.220 --> 51:49.220
 Yeah, so there's some studies on mice in microgravity.

51:49.220 --> 51:51.180
 And it's interesting, I think the mice,

51:51.180 --> 51:53.180
 like one of them, the mice weren't able to walk,

51:53.180 --> 51:55.380
 or their understanding of physics, I guess,

51:55.380 --> 51:56.580
 is off or something like that.

51:56.580 --> 51:59.940
 Yeah, the mental model when you're really young

51:59.940 --> 52:03.460
 and you're kind of getting your mental model of physics,

52:03.460 --> 52:07.020
 we do think that that would change kids abilities

52:07.020 --> 52:09.020
 to if they were born in microgravity,

52:09.020 --> 52:11.100
 their ability to have that intuition

52:11.100 --> 52:13.860
 around an Earth based 1G environment might be missing,

52:13.860 --> 52:15.340
 because a lot of that is really crystallized

52:15.340 --> 52:17.820
 in early development, early childhood development.

52:17.820 --> 52:20.060
 So that makes sense that they would see that in mice, yeah.

52:20.060 --> 52:27.180
 So what about life when we choose to park our vehicles

52:27.180 --> 52:30.500
 on another planet, on the moon, but let's go to Mars?

52:30.500 --> 52:35.660
 First of all, is that excite you, humans going to Mars,

52:35.660 --> 52:37.460
 like stepping foot on Mars?

52:37.460 --> 52:38.820
 And when do you think it'll happen?

52:38.820 --> 52:39.860
 It does excite me.

52:39.860 --> 52:42.420
 I think visionaries like Elon are working

52:42.420 --> 52:45.860
 to make that happen in terms of building the road to space.

52:45.860 --> 52:48.460
 We are really excited about building out

52:48.460 --> 52:51.420
 the human lived experience of space once you get there.

52:51.420 --> 52:53.180
 So how are you going to grow your food?

52:53.180 --> 52:55.220
 What is your habitat going to look like?

52:55.220 --> 52:56.620
 I think it's profoundly exciting,

52:56.620 --> 52:57.980
 but I do think that there's a little bit

52:57.980 --> 53:02.420
 of a misunderstanding of Mars anywhere in the near future

53:02.420 --> 53:04.980
 being anything like a replacement for Earth.

53:04.980 --> 53:07.300
 So it is good for humanity to have these other pockets

53:07.300 --> 53:10.020
 of our civilization that can expand out beyond Earth,

53:10.020 --> 53:13.620
 but Mars is not in its current state,

53:13.620 --> 53:15.780
 a good home for humanity.

53:15.780 --> 53:17.420
 Too many perchlorates in the soil,

53:17.420 --> 53:19.580
 you can't use that soil to grow crops.

53:19.580 --> 53:21.820
 Atmosphere is too thin, certainly can't breathe it,

53:21.820 --> 53:25.420
 but it's also just really thin compared to our atmosphere.

53:25.420 --> 53:26.780
 A lot of different challenges that would have

53:26.780 --> 53:29.700
 to be fundamentally changed on that planet

53:29.700 --> 53:33.380
 to make it a good home for a large human civilization.

53:33.380 --> 53:37.940
 How does a large civilization of humans get built on Mars?

53:37.940 --> 53:42.540
 And where do you think it starts being difficult?

53:42.540 --> 53:44.980
 So can you have a small base of like 10 people,

53:44.980 --> 53:47.820
 essentially, kind of like the International Space Station

53:47.820 --> 53:51.380
 kind of situation, and then can you get it to 100,

53:51.380 --> 53:53.220
 to 1,000, to a million?

53:53.220 --> 53:55.620
 Are there some interesting challenges there

53:55.620 --> 53:58.900
 that worry you, saying that Mars is just not a good backup

53:58.900 --> 54:00.980
 at this time for Earth?

54:00.980 --> 54:04.060
 I think small outposts, absolutely, like McMurdo, right?

54:04.060 --> 54:06.540
 So we have these models of really extreme environments

54:06.540 --> 54:08.740
 on Earth in Antarctica, for example,

54:08.740 --> 54:10.360
 where humans have been able to go

54:10.360 --> 54:13.460
 and make a sustainable settlement.

54:13.460 --> 54:18.460
 McMurdo style life on Mars, probably feasible in the 2030s.

54:18.760 --> 54:21.100
 So we want to send the first human missions to Mars

54:21.100 --> 54:22.660
 and maybe as early as the end of this decade,

54:22.660 --> 54:24.780
 more likely early 2030s.

54:24.780 --> 54:28.060
 Moving anywhere beyond that in terms of a place

54:28.060 --> 54:31.060
 where like an entire human life would be lived,

54:31.060 --> 54:33.460
 where it's not just you go for a three month deployment

54:33.460 --> 54:36.820
 and you come back, that is actually the big challenge line,

54:36.820 --> 54:41.420
 is just saying, is there enough technological sophistication

54:41.420 --> 54:44.540
 that can be brought that far out into space?

54:44.540 --> 54:46.540
 If you imagine your electronics break,

54:46.540 --> 54:48.860
 there's no RadioShack, this dates me a little bit

54:48.860 --> 54:50.340
 that my mind jumps to RadioShack,

54:50.340 --> 54:54.140
 but there's no supply chains on Mars

54:54.140 --> 54:58.100
 that can supply the level of technological sophistication

54:58.100 --> 55:01.100
 for all the products that we rely on, on day to day life.

55:01.100 --> 55:03.940
 So you'd be going back to actually a very simple existence,

55:03.940 --> 55:06.000
 more like pioneer life out West,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.700
 in the story of the US, for example.

55:08.700 --> 55:13.140
 And I think that the future of larger scale gatherings

55:13.140 --> 55:15.180
 of humans in orbit, or sorry, in space,

55:15.180 --> 55:17.660
 is actually gonna be in microgravity,

55:17.660 --> 55:21.260
 floating space cities, not so much trying

55:21.260 --> 55:25.600
 to establish settlements on the surface.

55:25.600 --> 55:29.500
 So you think sort of a significant engineering investment

55:29.500 --> 55:31.420
 in terms of our efforts and money

55:31.420 --> 55:34.420
 should be on large spaceships,

55:34.420 --> 55:39.420
 that perhaps are doing this kind of self assembly,

55:40.040 --> 55:41.960
 all these kinds of things, and doing it in orbit,

55:41.960 --> 55:45.480
 maybe building a giant donut around the planet over time.

55:45.480 --> 55:46.320
 Yeah, that is the goal.

55:46.320 --> 55:48.240
 And I think the current political climate

55:48.240 --> 55:52.340
 is such that you can't get the trillion dollar investment

55:52.340 --> 55:56.760
 to start from scratch and build the sci fi megastructure.

55:56.760 --> 55:58.960
 But if you can build it in fits and starts,

55:58.960 --> 56:00.000
 in little different pieces,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
 which is another advantage of self assembly,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.160
 it's much more like how nature works.

56:04.160 --> 56:07.600
 So it's biomimicry inspired way for humanity

56:07.600 --> 56:09.760
 to scale out in space.

56:09.760 --> 56:12.720
 And whether it's out in space or on Mars,

56:12.720 --> 56:15.320
 the idea that sort of two people fall in love,

56:16.240 --> 56:21.240
 they have sex, a child is born,

56:21.560 --> 56:25.000
 and then that couple has to teach that child

56:25.000 --> 56:27.600
 that they came from Earth.

56:27.600 --> 56:30.560
 I just love the idea that somebody is born on Mars

56:30.560 --> 56:33.400
 or out in space, and you have to be like,

56:33.400 --> 56:36.400
 this is not actually like the original home.

56:36.400 --> 56:38.940
 Just them looking at Earth and being like,

56:38.940 --> 56:40.240
 this is where we came from.

56:40.240 --> 56:42.040
 I don't know, that's really inspiring to me.

56:42.040 --> 56:43.640
 And the child being really confused

56:43.640 --> 56:45.800
 and then wanting to go back to TikTok,

56:45.800 --> 56:47.520
 or whatever they do.

56:47.520 --> 56:49.120
 Whatever they do in that area.

56:49.120 --> 56:50.520
 I mean, there's great sci fi, right,

56:50.520 --> 56:52.960
 about people being born on Mars.

56:52.960 --> 56:55.000
 And because it's a lower gravity environment,

56:55.000 --> 56:56.800
 they're taller, they're more gangly,

56:56.800 --> 56:58.240
 if they were actually able to develop there.

56:58.240 --> 56:59.360
 And then they come back to Earth

56:59.360 --> 57:01.400
 and they're like second class citizens

57:01.400 --> 57:04.080
 because they can't function here in the same way

57:04.080 --> 57:06.080
 because the gravity's too strong for them.

57:06.080 --> 57:07.800
 You see this in series like The Expanse

57:07.800 --> 57:10.120
 with the Belters and these different societies

57:10.120 --> 57:13.840
 that if we were to succeed in having human societies

57:13.840 --> 57:14.960
 grow up in different pockets,

57:14.960 --> 57:17.880
 it's not necessarily going to be easy for them

57:17.880 --> 57:20.360
 to always come back to Earth as their home.

57:20.360 --> 57:21.800
 Yeah, different cultures form,

57:21.800 --> 57:23.440
 which is the positive way of phrasing it.

57:23.440 --> 57:26.700
 But it's also, this human history teaches us

57:26.700 --> 57:29.360
 that we like to form the other.

57:29.360 --> 57:30.760
 So there's this kind of conflict

57:30.760 --> 57:32.040
 that naturally emerges.

57:33.080 --> 57:35.280
 Let me ask another sort of dark question.

57:35.280 --> 57:37.980
 What do you think about coming from a military family?

57:38.880 --> 57:43.360
 There's still sadly wars in the world.

57:43.360 --> 57:46.440
 Do you think wars, military conflicts

57:46.440 --> 57:51.340
 will follow us into space, wars between nations?

57:51.340 --> 57:54.040
 Like from my perspective currently,

57:54.040 --> 57:56.280
 it just seems like space is a place

57:56.280 --> 58:00.120
 for scientists and engineers to explore ideas.

58:00.120 --> 58:02.720
 But the more and more progress you make,

58:02.720 --> 58:05.960
 does it worry you that nations start to step in

58:05.960 --> 58:10.960
 and form, that go out and fall out military conflict,

58:11.640 --> 58:15.620
 whether it's in cyberspace, in space,

58:15.620 --> 58:18.400
 or actual hot war?

58:18.400 --> 58:19.920
 I am really concerned about that.

58:19.920 --> 58:22.040
 And I do think for decades,

58:22.040 --> 58:23.600
 the scientific community in space

58:23.600 --> 58:24.920
 has hung on to this notion

58:24.920 --> 58:28.000
 from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty,

58:28.000 --> 58:30.400
 which is space is the province of all humankind,

58:30.400 --> 58:32.800
 peaceful uses of outer space only.

58:32.800 --> 58:35.000
 But I do think the rise in tensions

58:35.000 --> 58:37.360
 and the geopolitical scene that we're seeing,

58:38.400 --> 58:42.080
 I do harbor a lot of concern about hot wars

58:42.080 --> 58:44.880
 following humanity out into space.

58:44.880 --> 58:49.340
 And it's worth trying to tie nations together

58:49.340 --> 58:51.960
 with more collaboration to avoid that happening.

58:51.960 --> 58:53.760
 The International Space Station is a great example.

58:53.760 --> 58:55.500
 I think it's something like 18 countries

58:55.500 --> 58:57.040
 are party to this treaty.

58:57.040 --> 58:59.360
 It might be less, it might be more.

58:59.360 --> 59:01.120
 And then of course, there's a smaller number of countries

59:01.120 --> 59:02.640
 that actually send astronauts.

59:02.640 --> 59:05.640
 But even at the fall of the Soviet Union

59:05.640 --> 59:07.920
 and through some tense times with Russia,

59:07.920 --> 59:10.720
 the ISS had been a place where the US and Russia

59:10.720 --> 59:13.960
 were actually able to collaborate between Mir and ISS.

59:13.960 --> 59:17.080
 I think it'd be really important right now in particular

59:17.080 --> 59:20.600
 to find other platforms where these hegemonic powers

59:20.600 --> 59:23.480
 in the world and developing world nations

59:23.480 --> 59:26.560
 can come and collaborate on the future of space

59:26.560 --> 59:29.520
 and purposefully intertwine our success

59:29.520 --> 59:31.280
 so that there's a danger to multiple parties

59:31.280 --> 59:32.880
 if somebody is a bad actor.

59:32.880 --> 59:36.480
 So we're now talking as there's a war in Ukraine

59:36.480 --> 59:37.840
 and I haven't been sleeping much.

59:37.840 --> 59:42.840
 I have family, friends, colleagues in both countries.

59:43.120 --> 59:45.480
 And I'm just talking to a lot of people,

59:45.480 --> 59:48.720
 many of whom are crying, refugees.

59:48.720 --> 59:52.640
 And there's a basic human compassion

59:52.640 --> 59:55.760
 and love for each other that I believe technology

59:55.760 --> 59:59.120
 can help catalyze and accelerate.

59:59.120 --> 1:00:00.440
 But there's also science.

1:00:00.440 --> 1:00:02.160
 There's something about rockets.

1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:05.800
 There's something about, and I mean like space exploration

1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:10.800
 that inspires the world about the positive possibilities

1:00:13.800 --> 1:00:15.600
 of the human species.

1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:18.760
 So in terms of Ukraine and Russia and China and India

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:22.840
 and the United States and Europe and everywhere else,

1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:27.840
 it seems like collaborating on giant space projects

1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:30.080
 is one way to escape these wars,

1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:33.720
 to escape these sort of geopolitical conflicts.

1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:34.560
 I mean, there's something,

1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:37.440
 there's so much camaraderie to the whole thing.

1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:42.440
 And even in this little period of human history

1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:45.480
 we're living through, it seems like that's essential.

1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:47.720
 Even through this pandemic,

1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:49.720
 there's something so inspiring about those

1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:52.280
 like SpaceX rockets going up, for example.

1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:57.080
 This reinvigoration of the space exploration efforts

1:00:57.080 --> 1:00:59.520
 by the commercial sector, I don't know.

1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:03.120
 That was, as many of us have,

1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:06.360
 sort of some dark times during this pandemic,

1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:10.120
 just like loneliness and sometimes emotion and anger

1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:13.640
 and just hopelessness and politics.

1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:15.680
 And then you look at those rockets going up

1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:17.120
 and it just gives you hope.

1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:21.360
 So I think that's an understated sort of value

1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:22.920
 of space exploration,

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:26.320
 is the thing that unites us and gives us hope.

1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:29.120
 Obviously also inspires young generations

1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:31.480
 and young minds to also contribute

1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:33.000
 in not necessarily in space exploration

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.400
 but in all of science and literature and poetry.

1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:38.120
 There's something about when you look up to the stars

1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:39.760
 that makes you dream.

1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:40.600
 Very true.

1:01:40.600 --> 1:01:43.560
 And so that's a really good reason

1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:45.040
 to sort of invest in this,

1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:47.120
 whether it's building giant megastructure,

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:48.400
 which is so freaking cool,

1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:52.680
 but also colonizing Mars.

1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:54.960
 Yeah, it's something to look forward to.

1:01:55.960 --> 1:02:00.960
 Something that, and not make it a domain of war,

1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:04.520
 but a domain of human collaboration

1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:06.800
 and human compassion, I think.

1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:09.240
 You're the founder and director

1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:12.240
 of the MIT Space Exploration Initiative.

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:14.440
 It includes a ton of projects.

1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:18.520
 So I just wanted to, they're focused, I guess, on life in space

1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:22.160
 from astrobiology, like we talked about, to habitats.

1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:23.800
 Are there some other interesting projects,

1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:27.440
 part of this initiative that pop to mind

1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:29.280
 that you find particularly cool?

1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:30.280
 Absolutely.

1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:33.320
 One is the future of in space manufacturing.

1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:35.720
 So if we're gonna build large scale space structures,

1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:37.760
 yes, it's great to ship them up from Earth

1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:39.200
 and self assemble them.

1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:41.880
 But what about extrusion in orbit?

1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:43.760
 It's one of the best technologies

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:45.240
 to leverage in microgravity

1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:48.440
 because you can extrude a particularly long beam

1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:51.000
 that would sag in a normal gravity environment,

1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.560
 but might be able to become the basis of a truss

1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:55.080
 or a large scale space structure.

1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:57.920
 So we're doing miniature tests of extrusion

1:02:57.920 --> 1:02:59.280
 and are excited to fly this

1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:01.840
 on the International Space Station in a few months.

1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:04.280
 We are working on swarm robots.

1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:08.840
 We have just announced actually MIT's return to the moon.

1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:11.480
 So my organization is leading this mission for MIT,

1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:12.920
 going back to the surface of the moon

1:03:12.920 --> 1:03:15.480
 as early as the end of this year, 2022,

1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:17.440
 maybe early 2023,

1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:21.640
 and trying to take data from our research payloads

1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:24.440
 at this historic South Pole site

1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:27.120
 where NASA is supposed to send the first humans back

1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:28.200
 on the Artemis III mission.

1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:30.720
 So our hope is to directly support that human mission

1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:32.120
 with our data.

1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:34.400
 How does that connect to the swarm aspects?

1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:35.680
 Does it connect?

1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:37.000
 Yeah, so we're actually gonna fly

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:38.400
 one of the little astro ants.

1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:39.840
 That's the current plan.

1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:42.800
 One of the little swarm robots on the top of a rover.

1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:44.320
 That's part of the mission.

1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:45.640
 Ants riding a rover?

1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:48.160
 Yes, exactly, an ant riding a rover.

1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:49.840
 That rover gets packed in a lander.

1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:52.000
 That lander gets packed in a SpaceX rocket.

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.880
 So it's a whole nesting dolls situation

1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:55.440
 to get to the moon.

1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:57.200
 Mother of robot dragons.

1:03:57.200 --> 1:03:58.640
 Yes, exactly.

1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:01.560
 So this one, a swarm of one?

1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:02.720
 Swarm of one, exactly.

1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:03.720
 We're testing out.

1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:05.480
 It's a tech demonstration mission,

1:04:05.480 --> 1:04:06.840
 not a true swarm.

1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:07.680
 Yeah, there they are.

1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:09.200
 Those are the astro ants.

1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:11.600
 Wow, and this was a distributed system,

1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:14.200
 and in theory, you could have a ton of these.

1:04:14.200 --> 1:04:15.880
 Yes, these could also be centralized.

1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:17.400
 So they have wireless technology

1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:19.840
 that could also talk to a central base station

1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:22.520
 and will be assessing kind of case by case

1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:23.880
 whether it makes sense to operate them

1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:25.120
 in a decentralized swarm

1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:27.800
 or to command them in a centralized swarm.

1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:32.200
 Each robot is equipped with four magnetic wheels

1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:35.680
 which enable the robot to attach to any magnetic surface

1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:37.760
 so you can operate basically in any environment.

1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:41.000
 He tested the, we tested the mobility of all robots

1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:44.840
 on different materials in a microgravity environment.

1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:46.960
 On the vomit comet prior to going to the moon.

1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:48.360
 That must look so cool.

1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:50.720
 So they're basically moving along different

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:52.120
 like metallic surfaces.

1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:53.160
 Yeah, exactly.

1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:56.480
 It's interesting when you, just a minute ago

1:04:56.480 --> 1:04:58.360
 talking about the reflection of

1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:01.920
 how space can be so aspirational and so uniting.

1:05:01.920 --> 1:05:03.720
 There's a great quote from Bill Anders

1:05:03.720 --> 1:05:05.320
 from the Apollo 8 mission to the moon,

1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:08.280
 which is he, it's the Earthrise photo that was taken

1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:09.720
 where you see the Earth coming up

1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:11.080
 over the horizon of the moon.

1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:12.840
 And the quote is something along the lines of

1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:15.200
 we came all the way to discover the moon

1:05:15.200 --> 1:05:17.880
 and what we really discovered was the Earth.

1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:20.080
 This really powerful image looking back.

1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:22.360
 And so we're also trying to think for our lunar mission

1:05:22.360 --> 1:05:24.560
 we realized we're a very privileged group at MIT

1:05:24.560 --> 1:05:26.280
 to get the opportunity to do this.

1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:29.000
 How could we bring humanity along with us?

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.080
 And so one of the things we're still testing out

1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:32.760
 I don't know if we're gonna be able to swing it

1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:35.560
 would be to do something like a Twitch plays Pokemon

1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:36.880
 but with the robot.

1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:39.560
 So let a lot of people on earth actually control the robot

1:05:39.560 --> 1:05:42.000
 or at least benefit from the data that we're gathering

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.040
 and try to release the data openly.

1:05:44.040 --> 1:05:45.560
 So we're exploring a couple of different ideas

1:05:45.560 --> 1:05:48.360
 for how do we engage more people in this mission.

1:05:48.360 --> 1:05:51.440
 That would be surreal to be able to interact

1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:53.920
 in some way with the thing that's out there.

1:05:53.920 --> 1:05:54.760
 Exactly.

1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:55.600
 On another surface.

1:05:55.600 --> 1:05:56.600
 Direct connection.

1:05:56.600 --> 1:05:57.720
 Direct connection.

1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:01.320
 I think about artificial intelligence in that same way

1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:04.840
 which is like building robots

1:06:04.840 --> 1:06:07.360
 puts a mirror to us humans.

1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:09.320
 It makes us like wonder about like

1:06:09.320 --> 1:06:10.520
 what is intelligence?

1:06:10.520 --> 1:06:11.640
 What is consciousness?

1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:14.560
 And what is actually valuable about human beings?

1:06:14.560 --> 1:06:18.320
 When AI system learns to play chess better than humans

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:19.760
 you start to let go of this idea

1:06:19.760 --> 1:06:22.800
 that humans are special because of intelligence.

1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:24.680
 It's something else.

1:06:26.280 --> 1:06:29.160
 It's maybe the flame of human consciousness.

1:06:29.160 --> 1:06:32.680
 It's the capacity to feel deeply

1:06:32.680 --> 1:06:36.360
 to sort of to both suffer and to love all those things.

1:06:36.360 --> 1:06:39.800
 And that somehow AI to me sort of puts a mirror to that.

1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:41.880
 You mentioned HAL 9000.

1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:46.400
 You have to bring it up with these swarm bots

1:06:46.400 --> 1:06:50.840
 crawling on the surface of your cocoon in space.

1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:52.440
 I mean, all right.

1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:56.680
 Let me steel man the HAL 9000 perspective here.

1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:57.520
 Okay.

1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:02.120
 The poor guy just wanted to maintain the mission

1:07:02.120 --> 1:07:03.200
 and the astronauts were,

1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:05.680
 I mean, I don't know if people often talk about that

1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:10.080
 but like doctors have to make difficult decisions too.

1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:11.600
 When there's limited resources

1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:14.040
 you actually do have to sacrifice human life often

1:07:14.040 --> 1:07:16.680
 because you have to make decisions.

1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:20.120
 And I think HAL is probably making that kind of decision

1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:22.800
 about what's more important,

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:26.640
 the lives of individual astronauts or the mission.

1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:30.200
 And I feel like AI and other humans

1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:33.000
 will need to make these decisions.

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:37.160
 And it also feels like AI systems will need to help

1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:38.920
 make those decisions.

1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:40.200
 I don't know.

1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:42.680
 I guess my question is about

1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:46.000
 greater and greater collective intelligence by systems.

1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:51.560
 Do you worry about that?

1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:54.720
 What is the right way to sort of solve this problem

1:07:54.720 --> 1:07:56.000
 keeping a human in the loop?

1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:57.480
 Do you think about this kind of stuff

1:07:57.480 --> 1:08:00.040
 or are they sufficiently dumb now the robots

1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:03.480
 that that's not yet on the horizon to think about?

1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:04.840
 I think it should be on the horizon.

1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:06.560
 It's always good to think about these things early

1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:09.280
 because we make a lot of technical design decisions

1:08:09.280 --> 1:08:11.160
 at this phase working with swarm robots

1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:12.600
 that it would be better to have thought

1:08:12.600 --> 1:08:13.920
 about some of these questions early

1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:16.320
 in the life cycle of a project.

1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:18.600
 There is a real interest in NASA right now

1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:21.640
 thinking about the future of human robot interaction, HRI,

1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:22.920
 and what is the right synergy

1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:25.800
 in terms of level of control for the human

1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:29.120
 versus level of dependence or control for the robot.

1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:33.560
 And we're beginning to test out more of these scenarios.

1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:36.080
 For example, the Gateway Space Station,

1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:37.920
 which is meant to be in orbit around the moon

1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:40.680
 as a staging base for the surface operations,

1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:43.640
 is meant to be able to function autonomously

1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:46.360
 with no humans in it for months at a time

1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:47.800
 because they think it's gonna be seasonal.

1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:50.160
 They think we might not be constantly staffing it.

1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:51.800
 So this will be a really great test of,

1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:53.480
 I don't know that anybody's yet worried

1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:55.280
 about HAL 9000 evolving,

1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:58.800
 but certainly just the robustness of some of these AI systems

1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:01.840
 that might be asked to autonomously maintain the station

1:09:01.840 --> 1:09:06.080
 while the humans are away or detection algorithms

1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:07.960
 that are gonna say, if you had a human pilot,

1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:09.920
 they might see debris in orbit and steer around it.

1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:11.280
 There'll be a lot of autonomous navigation

1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:12.800
 that has to happen.

1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:14.160
 That'll be one of the early test beds

1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:16.640
 where we'll start to get a little bit closer to that future.

1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:19.400
 Well, the HRI component is really interesting to me,

1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:24.760
 especially when the I includes like almost friendship

1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:27.560
 because people don't realize this, I think,

1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:29.840
 that we humans long for connection.

1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:32.320
 And when you have even a basic interaction

1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:35.280
 that's just like supposed to be just like serving you

1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:37.680
 or something, you still project,

1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:42.680
 it's still a source of meaning and connection.

1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:47.040
 And so you do have to think about that.

1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:51.520
 I mean, HAL 9000, the movie maybe doesn't portray it

1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:53.800
 that way, but I'm sure there's a relationship there

1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:56.240
 between the astronauts and the robot,

1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:57.800
 especially when you have greater and greater level

1:09:57.800 --> 1:09:58.720
 of intelligence.

1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:02.960
 And maybe that addresses the happiness question too.

1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:06.320
 Yeah, I think there's a great book by Kate Darling,

1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:08.200
 who's one of my colleagues at MIT.

1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:09.480
 Yeah, she's amazing.

1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:11.520
 She's already been on this podcast,

1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:14.760
 but we talk all the time and we're supposed to talk

1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:16.200
 and we've been missing each other

1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:18.000
 and we're gonna make it happen soon.

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:18.840
 Yeah.

1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:20.520
 Come down to Texas, Kate.

1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:22.320
 All right, anyway, yeah, she's amazing.

1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:25.160
 She has this book, her whole work is about this.

1:10:25.160 --> 1:10:26.520
 Connection with robots, yeah.

1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:28.440
 This beautiful connection that we have with robots,

1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:30.600
 but I think it's greater and greater importance

1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:32.240
 when it's out in space,

1:10:32.240 --> 1:10:34.920
 because it could help alleviate some of the loneliness.

1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:35.760
 Right.

1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:37.360
 One of the projects in the book that I gave you,

1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:39.040
 which is this catalog of the projects

1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:40.760
 that we've worked on over the last five years,

1:10:40.760 --> 1:10:43.960
 is this social robot that was developed at the Media Lab.

1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:46.320
 And we, one of the first years in 2017

1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:47.920
 that we flew a zero G flight,

1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:49.680
 we took the social robot along

1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:50.760
 and tried to do a little bit

1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:53.000
 of a very scaled down human study

1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:54.080
 to look at these questions,

1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:56.880
 because you do imagine that we would form a bond,

1:10:56.880 --> 1:10:58.840
 a real bond with the social robots

1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:01.600
 that might be not just serving us on a mission,

1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:04.480
 but really be our teammates on a future mission.

1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:06.640
 And I do think that that could have a powerful role

1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:08.680
 in the mental health and just the stability of a crew

1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:10.880
 is to have some other robot friends come along.

1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:13.320
 What do you, by the way, the book you mentioned

1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:18.320
 is into the Anthropocosmos,

1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:22.000
 a whole space catalog from the space catalog.

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:22.840
 Get that reference.

1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:25.240
 Yeah, so call out to Earth catalog,

1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:26.320
 a whole space catalog

1:11:26.320 --> 1:11:29.440
 from the MIT Space Exploration Initiative.

1:11:30.440 --> 1:11:31.880
 What about the happiness?

1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:33.920
 You said that that's one of the problems

1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:35.880
 of when you're out in space.

1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:37.480
 How do you keep humans happy?

1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:38.760
 Again, asking for a friend.

1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:40.920
 Yes, I mean, one of the big challenges

1:11:40.920 --> 1:11:43.440
 is you can't just open a window

1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:45.920
 or walk out a door and blow off steam, right?

1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:49.280
 You can't just go somewhere to clear your head.

1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:52.760
 And in that sense, you need to build habitats

1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:56.920
 that are homes that really care for the humans inside them

1:11:56.920 --> 1:11:59.240
 and have, whether it's biophilia

1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:02.040
 and a place where you can go and feel like you're in nature

1:12:02.040 --> 1:12:06.920
 or a VR headset, which for some people is a poor simulacrum

1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:09.200
 but is maybe better than nothing.

1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:10.280
 You need to be thinking

1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:12.920
 about these technological interventions

1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:14.960
 that are gonna have to be part of your home

1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:17.720
 and be part of your maybe day to day ritual

1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:20.760
 to keep you steady and balanced and happy

1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:22.840
 or feeling fulfilled.

1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:25.600
 What about other humans, relationship with other humans?

1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:28.000
 Do those get weird

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.360
 when you get past a certain number of humans?

1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:31.600
 I'm not an expert in this area

1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:33.040
 but an anecdote that I'll share.

1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:36.240
 My understanding is that NASA has still not decided

1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:38.400
 whether it's better to send married couples

1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:41.040
 or single crew members in terms of,

1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:43.040
 you want some level of stability,

1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:45.560
 you don't wanna have the drama of romantic relationships

1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:47.600
 like you're alluding to before,

1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:50.600
 but they can't decide because married couples also fight

1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:52.080
 and have a really tough dynamic.

1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:54.400
 And so there's a lot of open questions still to answer

1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:57.520
 about what is the ideal psychological makeup of a crew?

1:12:57.520 --> 1:12:59.800
 And we're starting to test some of these things

1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:01.720
 with the civilian crews that are growing up

1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:04.120
 with Inspiration4, like last fall with SpaceX

1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:07.360
 and Axe One that's gonna fly in a few days here in March.

1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:10.920
 As we begin to lengthen the time of those civilian crews,

1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:12.440
 I think we'll start to learn a little bit more

1:13:12.440 --> 1:13:15.800
 about just average everyday human to human dynamics

1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:18.280
 and not the astronauts that are themselves selected

1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:21.600
 to be perfect human specimens, very good to work with,

1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:23.040
 easy to get along with.

1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:26.360
 I wish you collected more data about this pandemic

1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:29.240
 because I feel like it's a good rough simulation

1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:30.440
 of what it'd be like out in space.

1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:33.520
 A lot of people are locked down, some married couples,

1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:35.360
 I think a lot of marriages broke up,

1:13:35.360 --> 1:13:38.400
 a lot of marriages got closer together.

1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:41.120
 So it's like, and then the single people,

1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:43.120
 some of them went off the cliff

1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:45.680
 and some of them discovered their new happiness

1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:46.840
 and meaning and so on.

1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:50.080
 It's a beautiful little experiment, a painful one.

1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:52.580
 Is there a thorough way to really test that?

1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:56.720
 Because it's such a costly experiment

1:13:58.560 --> 1:13:59.800
 to send humans up there,

1:13:59.800 --> 1:14:01.560
 but I guess you can always return back to Earth

1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:02.760
 if it's not working out.

1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:04.600
 That's what we hope, that's what you hope.

1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:06.960
 You don't have like a Apollo 13 situation

1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:08.040
 that doesn't quite make it back.

1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:11.920
 But yeah, this is also why Mars is such a challenge.

1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:13.560
 The moon is only three days away.

1:14:13.560 --> 1:14:15.280
 That's a lot quicker to recover from

1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:17.040
 if there's a psychological problem with the crew

1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:19.400
 or any type of maintenance problem, anything.

1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:23.680
 Three years is such a challenge

1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:25.020
 compared to these other domains

1:14:25.020 --> 1:14:26.240
 that we've been getting more used to

1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:27.960
 in terms of human spaceflight.

1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:30.760
 So this is a question that we will need to have explored more

1:14:30.760 --> 1:14:33.000
 before we start really sending crews to Mars.

1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:38.000
 So you're a young scientist, do you think in your lifetime

1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:43.480
 you will go out into orbit,

1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:47.360
 you will go out beyond into deep space

1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:50.380
 and potentially step, you,

1:14:50.380 --> 1:14:53.320
 I don't know if you can call yourself a civilian.

1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:54.740
 I don't know if that's what you count as,

1:14:54.740 --> 1:14:59.740
 but you as a curious ant from MIT land step on Mars.

1:15:03.660 --> 1:15:04.500
 Yes.

1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:07.080
 That's a firm, that's a firm.

1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:07.920
 Are you coming back?

1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:08.980
 Firm, yes, yeah, I'm coming back.

1:15:08.980 --> 1:15:12.080
 I don't want that one way mission, I want the two way mission.

1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:14.220
 But yes, I mean, I think we're already talking

1:15:14.220 --> 1:15:16.240
 about a pretty near term opportunity

1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:17.900
 where I could send graduate students

1:15:17.900 --> 1:15:19.140
 to the International Space Station.

1:15:19.140 --> 1:15:24.140
 Yeah, not a sacrifice, but send graduate students.

1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:25.840
 For the experience.

1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:26.960
 For the experience.

1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:29.440
 Send graduate students to the ISS to do their research.

1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:31.720
 I do think you and I both would have an opportunity

1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:35.640
 to go to a lunar base of some sort within our lifetime.

1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:39.620
 And there's a good chance if we really wanted to,

1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:41.760
 we might have to really advocate for it,

1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:43.280
 apply to an astronaut program.

1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:45.120
 There will be some avenues for humans

1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:46.800
 in our lifetime to go to Mars.

1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:51.080
 What's the bar for like health?

1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:53.380
 Do you think that bar will keep getting lower and lower

1:15:53.380 --> 1:15:55.320
 in terms of how healthy, how athletic,

1:15:55.320 --> 1:15:57.880
 like how the psychological profile,

1:15:57.880 --> 1:15:59.000
 all those kinds of things?

1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.600
 Yeah, for one, we're gonna build more robust habitats

1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:03.360
 that don't depend on astronauts

1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:05.320
 being so impeccably well trained.

1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:08.280
 So we're gonna make it better for inclusion

1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:10.480
 and just opening access to space.

1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:12.800
 But there's a fantastic group called Astro Access

1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:15.480
 that is already helping disabled space flyers

1:16:15.480 --> 1:16:18.480
 do zero G flights and potentially get access to the ISS.

1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:19.840
 And some of the things that we think of

1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:24.800
 as disabilities on earth are hyper abilities in space.

1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:27.520
 You don't need really powerful legs in space.

1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:30.760
 What you'd really benefit from having is a third arm,

1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:32.360
 more ways to kind of move yourself around

1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:33.640
 and grip and interact.

1:16:33.640 --> 1:16:38.040
 So we are already seeing a much more open minded approach

1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:40.840
 to who gets to go to space and Astro Access

1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:43.440
 is a wonderful organization doing some of that work.

1:16:43.440 --> 1:16:47.640
 I'm hoping introversion will also be a superpower in space.

1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:50.000
 Okay, well, first I'd love to get your opinion

1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:52.640
 on commercial space flight, what SpaceX,

1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:54.200
 what Blue Origin are doing.

1:16:54.200 --> 1:16:57.720
 And also another question on top of that is,

1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:01.360
 because you've worked with a lot of different kinds

1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:03.240
 of people, culturally, what's the difference

1:17:03.240 --> 1:17:07.960
 between SpaceX or commercial type of efforts

1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:10.800
 NASA and MIT?

1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:11.760
 And academia.

1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:12.720
 Academia.

1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:14.440
 Yeah, so the first part of your question,

1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:18.360
 I am thrilled by all of the commercial activity in space.

1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:20.000
 It has really empowered our program.

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:23.480
 So instead of me waiting for five years to get a grant

1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:24.600
 and get the money from the grant

1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:26.920
 and only then can you send a project to space,

1:17:26.920 --> 1:17:29.640
 I go out and I fundraise a lot like a startup founder

1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:32.440
 and I directly buy access to space

1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:33.600
 on the International Space Station

1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:36.160
 through SpaceX or NanoRacks, same with Blue Origin

1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:38.720
 and their suborbital craft, same with Axiom now.

1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:42.480
 Axiom's making plans for their own commercial space station.

1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:44.200
 It's not out of the realm of possibility,

1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:48.360
 but in a few years, I will rent lab space in orbit.

1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:50.920
 I will rent a module from the Axiom space station

1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:54.000
 or the orbital reef, which is the Blue Origin space station

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:56.840
 or NanoRacks is thinking about Starlab Oasis.

1:17:56.840 --> 1:17:58.000
 There's probably some other companies

1:17:58.000 --> 1:17:59.040
 that I'm not even aware of yet

1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:00.880
 that are doing commercial space habitats.

1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:02.800
 So I think that's fabulous

1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:04.800
 and really empowering for our research.

1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:06.320
 Is it affordable?

1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:09.800
 So like loosely speaking, does it become affordable

1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:13.800
 for like MIT type of research lab?

1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:18.200
 Does it, or does it need to be a multi university

1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:20.800
 like a gigantic effort, a consortium thing?

1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:22.800
 One of the reasons we're spinning out Aurelia

1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:24.640
 is we actually realized it's cheap enough.

1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:26.640
 It doesn't even have to be MIT.

1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:29.640
 And we wanted to start democratizing access

1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:30.960
 to these spaceflight opportunities

1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:33.040
 to a much broader swath of humanity.

1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:36.640
 Could you take a Khan Academy educational course

1:18:36.640 --> 1:18:38.800
 about, hey, students around the world,

1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:40.720
 this is how you get ready for a zero G flight.

1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:43.280
 And by the way, come fly with us next year,

1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:44.800
 which is something we're gonna do with Aurelius.

1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:48.120
 We're gonna bring much more just kind of day to day folks

1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:50.280
 on zero G flights and get them access

1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:52.600
 to engaging in the space industry.

1:18:52.600 --> 1:18:54.720
 So it's become cheap enough

1:18:54.720 --> 1:18:57.000
 and the prices have dropped enough to consider even that.

1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:57.960
 So that's amazing.

1:18:57.960 --> 1:18:59.360
 It definitely doesn't have to be a consortium

1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:00.880
 of universities anymore.

1:19:00.880 --> 1:19:02.040
 Depends on what you wanna fly.

1:19:02.040 --> 1:19:03.440
 If you wanna fly James Webb,

1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:05.880
 a huge telescope that's decades in the making,

1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:08.920
 sure, you need a NASA allocation budget.

1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:10.520
 You need billions.

1:19:10.520 --> 1:19:12.480
 But for a lot of the stuff in the book

1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:13.600
 and our research portfolio,

1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:16.000
 it's actually becoming far more accessible.

1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:17.520
 So that's a commercial.

1:19:17.520 --> 1:19:21.200
 What about NASA and MIT academia?

1:19:21.200 --> 1:19:25.720
 Yeah, I think people have been worried about NASA

1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:28.400
 the last few years because in some people's minds,

1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:31.600
 they are ceding ground to these commercial efforts,

1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:34.360
 but that's really not what's happening.

1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:37.560
 NASA empowered these commercial efforts

1:19:37.560 --> 1:19:40.080
 because they wanna free themselves up to go to Mars

1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:43.000
 and go to Europa and continue being

1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:46.000
 that really aspirational force for humanity

1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.760
 of pushing the boundary, always pushing the boundary.

1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:50.840
 And if they were anchored in low earth orbit,

1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:53.200
 maintaining a space station indefinitely,

1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:54.800
 that's so much a part of their budget

1:19:54.800 --> 1:19:57.120
 that it was keeping them from being able to do more.

1:19:57.120 --> 1:19:59.000
 So it actually is really fantastic for NASA

1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:00.920
 to have grown this commercial ecosystem

1:20:00.920 --> 1:20:03.040
 and then that frees NASA up to go further.

1:20:03.040 --> 1:20:05.400
 And in academia, we like to think that we will be able

1:20:05.400 --> 1:20:09.480
 to do the provocative next generation research

1:20:09.480 --> 1:20:13.120
 that is going to unlock things at that frontier.

1:20:13.120 --> 1:20:14.920
 And we can partner with NASA.

1:20:14.920 --> 1:20:15.960
 We can go through a program

1:20:15.960 --> 1:20:18.160
 if we wanna send a probe out really far,

1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:19.560
 but we can also partner with SpaceX

1:20:19.560 --> 1:20:22.720
 and see what human life in a SpaceX Mars settlement

1:20:22.720 --> 1:20:24.880
 might look like and how we could design for that.

1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:27.600
 Speaking of projects, maybe are there other projects

1:20:27.600 --> 1:20:30.120
 that pop to mind from the Space Exploration Initiative

1:20:30.120 --> 1:20:32.800
 or maybe stuff from the book that you can mention?

1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:34.280
 Something super cool.

1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:35.800
 I mean, everything we've been talking about is cool,

1:20:35.800 --> 1:20:37.800
 but just something that pops to mind again.

1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:40.520
 Yeah, so we talked about life in space

1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:42.680
 and you might need more arms than legs.

1:20:42.680 --> 1:20:44.800
 One of the projects by Valentina Sumini

1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:48.680
 was a air powered robotics tail.

1:20:48.680 --> 1:20:50.400
 So it's a soft robotics tail

1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:53.000
 that essentially has a little camera on the back end of it,

1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.680
 can do computer vision and knows where to grapple.

1:20:55.680 --> 1:20:56.840
 So it's behind you.

1:20:56.840 --> 1:20:59.320
 It grapples onto something and holds you in space

1:20:59.320 --> 1:21:00.440
 and then you can actually free up

1:21:00.440 --> 1:21:02.080
 both of your hands to work.

1:21:02.080 --> 1:21:03.400
 So we're already starting to think about

1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:07.040
 the design of bionic humans or prosthetics

1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:09.240
 or things that would make you kind of like a cyborg

1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:11.600
 to augment your capabilities

1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:13.160
 when you're in a space environment.

1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:14.600
 How would you control something like that?

1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:17.960
 So it's kind of like a, I mean, you can't call it a leg,

1:21:17.960 --> 1:21:20.280
 but whatever, it's a. An additional appendage.

1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:21.760
 Appendage, so how would you,

1:21:21.760 --> 1:21:23.840
 what are ideas for controlling something like that?

1:21:23.840 --> 1:21:26.560
 Yeah, so right now it's super, yeah, there you go.

1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:27.400
 That's cool.

1:21:27.400 --> 1:21:29.720
 Right now it's super manual.

1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:32.400
 It's basically just like a kind of a set pattern

1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:34.160
 of inflating as we're testing it.

1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:35.960
 But in the future, if we had a Neuralink,

1:21:35.960 --> 1:21:38.000
 I mean, this is something that you could imagine

1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:39.000
 directly controlling,

1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:41.360
 just thinking thoughts and controlling it.

1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:42.560
 That's a ways away.

1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:45.360
 Yeah, so we talked about on the biology side,

1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:47.800
 astrobiology, there's probably agriculture stuff.

1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:51.240
 Is there other things that kind of feed the ecosystem

1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:53.160
 of out in space for survival

1:21:53.160 --> 1:21:56.200
 or the robotics architectures, the self assembly stuff?

1:21:56.200 --> 1:21:59.000
 So kind of combining something we were talking about,

1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.040
 you can form these relationships with objects

1:22:01.040 --> 1:22:02.640
 and anthropomorphize.

1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:04.840
 One of the things that we're thinking about for agriculture

1:22:04.840 --> 1:22:08.720
 created by Manwe and Somu, so two students at MIT,

1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:10.880
 was this little, it looks like a planet,

1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:13.160
 but it's inspired by, I think, a Mandala

1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:15.000
 or Nepalese spinning wheel.

1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:16.680
 And you plant plants on the inside

1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:19.160
 and the astronaut has to spin it every day

1:22:19.160 --> 1:22:20.920
 to help the plants survive.

1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:22.520
 So it's a way to give the astronauts

1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:23.960
 something to care about,

1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:26.400
 something that they are responsible for keeping alive

1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:29.120
 and can really invest themselves in.

1:22:29.120 --> 1:22:30.600
 And it's not necessary, right?

1:22:30.600 --> 1:22:33.560
 We have other ways to grow in orbit,

1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:35.120
 hydroponics, liquid medium,

1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:37.480
 trying to keep the liquid around the plant roots is hard

1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:39.080
 because there's no gravity to pull it down

1:22:39.080 --> 1:22:40.440
 in a particular direction.

1:22:40.440 --> 1:22:42.680
 But what I loved about this project was they said,

1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:45.600
 sure, we have ways that the plants could grow on their own,

1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:48.040
 but the astronauts might want to care for it

1:22:48.040 --> 1:22:49.680
 in the same way that we have little plants

1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:52.680
 that come to be important to us, little plant friends.

1:22:52.680 --> 1:22:54.480
 So there's AgriFuge, that's an early model

1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:58.040
 of this manually spinning plant habitat.

1:22:58.040 --> 1:23:01.520
 I guess this is the best of academic research

1:23:01.520 --> 1:23:03.520
 is you can do these kinds of wild ideas.

1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:04.520
 Wild ideas, yeah.

1:23:04.520 --> 1:23:07.240
 Well, I get to spend quite a bit of time

1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:12.000
 with Mr. Elon Musk and he's very stressed,

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.520
 especially about Starship

1:23:14.520 --> 1:23:16.520
 and all those kinds of engineering efforts.

1:23:17.800 --> 1:23:20.600
 What do you think about how damn hard it is

1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:23.520
 to get out of space?

1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:25.680
 Like, are we humans gonna be able to do this?

1:23:26.920 --> 1:23:28.880
 I don't know, I think it feels like

1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:31.400
 it's an engineering problem, it's a scientific problem,

1:23:31.400 --> 1:23:33.400
 but it's also just a motivation problem

1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:35.400
 for the entire human species.

1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:39.520
 And you also need to have superstar researchers

1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:40.800
 and engineers working on it.

1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:42.920
 So you have to get like the best people in the world,

1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:47.200
 inspire them and starting from a young age and kind of.

1:23:47.200 --> 1:23:48.920
 Almost inculcating us into why we do it.

1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:50.360
 I mean, I guess that's why it's exciting.

1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:52.480
 You don't know if we're gonna be able to pull this off.

1:23:52.480 --> 1:23:56.280
 Like, we could like fail miserably.

1:23:56.280 --> 1:23:57.760
 And that, I suppose, I mean,

1:23:57.760 --> 1:23:59.960
 that's where the best of engineering is done

1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:02.880
 is like success is not guaranteed.

1:24:02.880 --> 1:24:06.320
 And even if it happens, it might be very painful.

1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:07.200
 I think that's what's so special

1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:08.920
 about what Elon is doing with SpaceX

1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:12.000
 is he takes these risks and he tests iteratively

1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.880
 and he'll, we'll see the spectacular failures

1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:17.480
 on the path to a successful Starship.

1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:18.720
 It's something that, you know, people have said,

1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:19.960
 why isn't NASA doing that?

1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:22.440
 Well, that's cause NASA is doing that with taxpayer dollars

1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:25.120
 and we would all revolt if we saw NASA failing

1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:26.200
 at all these different stages.

1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:27.600
 But that level of, you know,

1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:30.200
 spiral engineering theory of development

1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:31.560
 isn't super impressive.

1:24:31.560 --> 1:24:32.760
 And it's a really interesting approach

1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:34.360
 that SpaceX has taken.

1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:37.920
 And I think between people like Elon and Jeff Bezos

1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:41.520
 and Firefly and NASA and ESO, we are gonna get there.

1:24:41.520 --> 1:24:43.160
 They're building the road to space.

1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:45.000
 These trailblazers are doing it.

1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.760
 And now part of the challenge is to get the rest

1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:52.000
 of the public to understand that it's happening, right?

1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:53.600
 A lot of people don't know that we're going back

1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:55.400
 to the moon, that we're gonna send the first woman

1:24:55.400 --> 1:24:57.720
 to the moon within a few years.

1:24:57.720 --> 1:24:58.640
 A lot of people don't know

1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:00.680
 that there are commercial space stations in orbit,

1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:03.320
 that it's not just NASA that does space stuff.

1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:07.040
 So we have a big challenge to get more of humanity excited

1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:08.480
 and educated and involved again,

1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:09.840
 kind of like in the Apollo era

1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:12.360
 where it was a big deal for everybody.

1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:15.120
 Well, a lot of that is also one of the big impressive things

1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:18.560
 that Elon does, I think, extremely well

1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:21.280
 is the social media, is the getting people excited.

1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:24.200
 And I think that actually, he's helped NASA

1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:26.520
 step their game up in terms of social media.

1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:28.680
 There's something about, yeah, the storytelling,

1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:33.680
 but also not like, you know, like authentic

1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.200
 and just real and raw engineering.

1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:40.520
 There's a lot of excitement for that humor and fun also.

1:25:40.520 --> 1:25:42.560
 All of those things you realize,

1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:46.080
 the thing that make up the virality of the meme

1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:48.680
 is beautiful, you have to kind of embrace that.

1:25:48.680 --> 1:25:52.280
 And to me, this kind of,

1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:56.200
 I criticize a lot of companies based on this.

1:25:56.200 --> 1:25:59.320
 I talked to a bunch of CEOs and so on,

1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:01.000
 and it's just like, there's a caution,

1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:04.600
 like let us do this like press conference thing

1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:06.760
 where when the final product is ready

1:26:06.760 --> 1:26:08.160
 and it's overproduced,

1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:11.520
 as opposed to the raw, the gritty just showed off.

1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:14.000
 I mean, something that I think MIT is very good at doing

1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:17.560
 is just showing the raw, by nature, the mess of it.

1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:18.920
 And the mess of it is beautiful

1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:21.760
 and people get really excited and failure is really exciting.

1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:23.920
 When the thing blows up and you're like, oh shit,

1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:27.080
 that makes it even more exciting when it doesn't blow up.

1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:29.040
 And doing all of that on social media

1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:31.680
 and showing also the humans behind it,

1:26:31.680 --> 1:26:35.240
 the individual young researchers or the engineers

1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:38.480
 or the leaders where everything's at stake.

1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:40.840
 I don't know, I think I'm really excited about that.

1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:43.840
 I do want MIT to do that more for students

1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:47.240
 to show off their stuff and not be pressured

1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:51.080
 to do this kind of generic official presentation,

1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:54.480
 but show their, become a YouTuber also.

1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:55.960
 Like show off your raw research

1:26:55.960 --> 1:26:58.120
 as you're working on it in the early days.

1:26:58.120 --> 1:26:59.480
 I hope that's the future.

1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:02.280
 Things like, I was teasing about TikTok earlier,

1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:07.280
 but these kinds of things I think inspire young people

1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:11.240
 to show off their stuff, to show their true self,

1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:12.080
 the rawness of it,

1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:13.880
 because I think that's where engineering is best.

1:27:13.880 --> 1:27:16.120
 And I think that will inspire people

1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:18.920
 about all the cool stuff we could do out in space.

1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:20.240
 I should say, I couldn't agree more.

1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:21.920
 And I actually think that this is why we need

1:27:21.920 --> 1:27:24.680
 a real life Starfleet Academy right now.

1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:27.080
 It was the place where the space cadets got to go

1:27:27.080 --> 1:27:31.360
 to learn about how to engage in a future of life in space.

1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:33.840
 And we can do it in a much better way.

1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:35.120
 There are a bunch of groups that traditionally

1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:37.840
 haven't thought that they could engage in aerospace,

1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:38.920
 whether it's because you were told

1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:40.680
 you had to be into math and science.

1:27:40.680 --> 1:27:42.160
 Now we need space lawyers,

1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:44.240
 we need space artists like Grimes, right?

1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:48.120
 We need really creative, profoundly interesting people

1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:51.560
 to wanna see themselves in that future.

1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:53.200
 And I think it's a big challenge to us

1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:55.440
 in the space industry to also do some more diversity,

1:27:55.440 --> 1:27:56.520
 equity and inclusion,

1:27:56.520 --> 1:27:58.920
 and show a broader swath of society

1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:00.360
 that there's a future for them

1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:01.960
 in this space exploration vision.

1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:03.160
 Let me push back on one thing.

1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:04.480
 We don't need space lawyers.

1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:05.320
 I'm just kidding.

1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:06.680
 Okay, it's a joke.

1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:07.760
 We do, we do, we do.

1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:09.400
 Okay, we do.

1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:11.400
 The lawyers are great, I love them.

1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:13.840
 Okay, let me ask a big, ridiculous question.

1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:17.120
 What is the most beautiful idea to you

1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:19.200
 about space exploration?

1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:22.560
 Whether it's the engineering, the astrobiology,

1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:27.560
 the science, the inspiration, the human happiness,

1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:30.200
 or aliens, I don't know.

1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:35.200
 What do you, like, inspires you every day

1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:39.560
 in terms of its beauty, in terms of its awe?

1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:43.280
 As a ex physicist, what I've always found so profound

1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:47.080
 is just that at really, really small scales,

1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:48.320
 like particle physics,

1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:51.520
 and really, really big scales, like astrophysics,

1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:53.360
 there are similarities in the way

1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:55.560
 that those systems behave and look,

1:28:55.560 --> 1:28:59.440
 and there's a certain beautiful symmetry in the universe

1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:01.120
 that's just kind of waiting for us

1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:04.280
 to tie together the physics and really understand it.

1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:07.760
 That is something that just really captivates me,

1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:08.880
 and I would love to,

1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:09.920
 even though I'm now much more

1:29:09.920 --> 1:29:12.480
 on the applied space exploration side,

1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:14.240
 I really try to keep up with what's happening

1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:15.160
 in those physics areas,

1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:18.360
 because I think that will be a huge answer for humanity

1:29:18.360 --> 1:29:21.500
 along the lines of, are we alone in the universe?

1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:24.200
 One of the fascinating things about you

1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:28.120
 is you have a degree in physics, mathematics,

1:29:28.120 --> 1:29:31.360
 and philosophy, and now, I don't know,

1:29:31.360 --> 1:29:34.280
 would you call it aerospace engineering maybe kind of thing?

1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:36.940
 So you have at a foot in all of these worlds,

1:29:36.940 --> 1:29:41.940
 the theoretic, the beauty of that world,

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:44.680
 and the philosophy somehow is in there,

1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:48.380
 and now the very practical, pragmatic implementation

1:29:48.380 --> 1:29:50.880
 of all these wild ideas,

1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:53.320
 plus your incredible communicator, all of those things.

1:29:53.320 --> 1:29:56.120
 What did you pick up from those different disciplines?

1:29:56.120 --> 1:29:57.540
 Or maybe I'm just romanticizing

1:29:57.540 --> 1:29:59.400
 all those different disciplines,

1:29:59.400 --> 1:30:02.760
 but what did you pick up from the variety

1:30:02.760 --> 1:30:06.200
 of that physics, mathematics, philosophy?

1:30:06.200 --> 1:30:07.880
 What I loved about having this chance

1:30:07.880 --> 1:30:10.120
 to do a liberal arts education

1:30:10.120 --> 1:30:13.400
 was trying to understand the human condition,

1:30:13.400 --> 1:30:16.440
 and I think more designers for space exploration

1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:17.720
 should be thinking about that,

1:30:17.720 --> 1:30:19.800
 because there's so much depth of,

1:30:19.800 --> 1:30:21.200
 like we were talking about,

1:30:21.200 --> 1:30:24.420
 issues and opportunities around human connection,

1:30:24.420 --> 1:30:27.060
 human life, meaning in life.

1:30:27.060 --> 1:30:29.400
 How do you find fulfillment or happiness?

1:30:29.400 --> 1:30:31.160
 And I think if you approach these questions

1:30:31.160 --> 1:30:33.240
 just purely from the standpoint of an engineer

1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:35.360
 or a scientist, you'll miss some of what

1:30:35.360 --> 1:30:38.240
 makes it a life worth living.

1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:40.360
 And so I love being able to combine

1:30:40.360 --> 1:30:41.760
 some of this notion of philosophy

1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:43.660
 and the human condition with my work,

1:30:43.660 --> 1:30:45.240
 but I'm also a pragmatist,

1:30:45.240 --> 1:30:47.140
 and I didn't want to stay just purely

1:30:47.140 --> 1:30:49.920
 in these big picture questions about the universe.

1:30:49.920 --> 1:30:52.280
 I wanted to have an impact on society,

1:30:52.280 --> 1:30:55.940
 and I also felt like I had such a wonderful childhood

1:30:55.940 --> 1:31:00.940
 and a really fantastic setup that I owe society some work

1:31:01.360 --> 1:31:04.400
 to really make a positive impact

1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:05.640
 for a broader swath of citizens.

1:31:05.640 --> 1:31:07.820
 And so that kind of led me from the physics domain

1:31:07.820 --> 1:31:10.340
 to thinking about engineering and practical questions

1:31:10.340 --> 1:31:11.240
 for life in space.

1:31:11.240 --> 1:31:13.960
 In physics, was there a dream?

1:31:13.960 --> 1:31:16.120
 Are you also captivated by this search

1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:19.400
 for the theory of everything that kind of unlocks

1:31:19.400 --> 1:31:23.580
 the deeper and deeper, in the simple, elegant way,

1:31:23.580 --> 1:31:25.300
 the function of our universe?

1:31:25.300 --> 1:31:27.160
 Do you think that'll be useful for us

1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:30.360
 for the actual practical engineering things

1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:31.520
 that you're working on now?

1:31:31.520 --> 1:31:32.360
 It could be.

1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:35.200
 I mean, I worked at CERN for two summers in undergrad,

1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:37.560
 and we were looking for supersymmetry,

1:31:37.560 --> 1:31:40.040
 which was one of these alternatives to the standard model.

1:31:40.040 --> 1:31:41.640
 And it was sad because my professors

1:31:41.640 --> 1:31:43.200
 were getting sadder and sadder

1:31:43.200 --> 1:31:44.520
 because they weren't finding it.

1:31:44.520 --> 1:31:47.080
 They were excluding what we would call this parameter space

1:31:47.080 --> 1:31:50.000
 of finding these supersymmetric particles.

1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:53.120
 But the search for what that theory of everything could be,

1:31:53.120 --> 1:31:55.480
 or a grand unified theory that kind of answers

1:31:55.480 --> 1:31:58.360
 some of the holes within the standard model of physics

1:31:58.360 --> 1:32:02.320
 would presumably kind of unlock a better understanding

1:32:02.320 --> 1:32:05.480
 of certain fundamental physical laws

1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:08.000
 that we should be able to build a better understanding

1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:10.760
 of engineering and day to day services from that.

1:32:10.760 --> 1:32:13.140
 It might not be an immediately obvious thing.

1:32:13.140 --> 1:32:15.160
 When we discovered the Higgs boson,

1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:16.600
 I was there at CERN that day.

1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:19.840
 It was July 4th, 2012 that it was announced.

1:32:19.840 --> 1:32:22.240
 We all waited like nerds overnight in line

1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:23.800
 to get into the announcement chamber.

1:32:23.800 --> 1:32:25.760
 I'd never waited for even like a Harry Potter premiere

1:32:25.760 --> 1:32:27.760
 in my life, but we waited for this announcement

1:32:27.760 --> 1:32:30.840
 of the Higgs boson to get into the chamber overnight.

1:32:30.840 --> 1:32:33.840
 But did that immediately translate

1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:35.680
 to technology for engineering?

1:32:35.680 --> 1:32:39.200
 No, but it's still a really important part

1:32:39.200 --> 1:32:41.560
 of our understanding of these fundamental laws of physics.

1:32:41.560 --> 1:32:43.160
 And so I don't know that it's always immediate,

1:32:43.160 --> 1:32:44.660
 but I think it is really critical knowledge

1:32:44.660 --> 1:32:46.020
 for humanity to seek.

1:32:46.880 --> 1:32:50.680
 It might just shake up understanding of the world.

1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:52.880
 What scares me is it might help us create

1:32:52.880 --> 1:32:54.160
 more dangerous weapons.

1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:57.680
 So, and then we'll figure out that great filter situation.

1:32:57.680 --> 1:33:00.800
 And I still believe that human compassion and love

1:33:02.120 --> 1:33:04.280
 is actually the way to defend against all these greater

1:33:04.280 --> 1:33:07.740
 and greater and more impressive weapons.

1:33:07.740 --> 1:33:10.600
 Let me ask a weird question in terms

1:33:10.600 --> 1:33:12.520
 of you disagreeing with others.

1:33:12.520 --> 1:33:15.640
 What important idea do you believe is true

1:33:15.640 --> 1:33:20.400
 that many others don't agree with you on?

1:33:20.400 --> 1:33:22.160
 Maybe, it's a tough question.

1:33:22.160 --> 1:33:23.800
 You might have to think about that one,

1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:26.320
 but whether it's very specific,

1:33:26.320 --> 1:33:28.800
 like which material to use or something

1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:30.680
 about a particular project,

1:33:30.680 --> 1:33:35.200
 or it could be grand priorities on missions.

1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:36.920
 I think one you actually mentioned is interesting

1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:40.640
 is like the thing we should be looking for

1:33:40.640 --> 1:33:43.000
 is like colonization of space

1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:45.040
 versus colonization of planets.

1:33:45.040 --> 1:33:45.880
 Meaning like.

1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:47.540
 Yes, it's probably my best hot take

1:33:47.540 --> 1:33:49.080
 that people would disagree with me on

1:33:49.080 --> 1:33:51.840
 is life in floating cities

1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:54.840
 as opposed to life on the surface.

1:33:54.840 --> 1:33:58.320
 How do you envision that like spread of humans?

1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:00.720
 Cause you said at the beginning of the conversation,

1:34:00.720 --> 1:34:03.760
 something about like scale, increasing the scale

1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:05.560
 of basically humans in space.

1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:09.480
 Are they just like in, they're in orbit

1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:11.640
 and then they get a little farther and farther out.

1:34:11.640 --> 1:34:15.760
 Like, do you see this kind of floating cities

1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:17.460
 just getting farther and farther from earth?

1:34:17.460 --> 1:34:18.960
 They can always kind of return,

1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:22.000
 but like if you look a few centuries from now,

1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.240
 do you just see us, all these like floating cities.

1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:25.080
 Like Amoeba.

1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:25.900
 Yeah.

1:34:25.900 --> 1:34:30.640
 And it just kind of envelops the space around us

1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:31.920
 in these like neighborhoods.

1:34:31.920 --> 1:34:32.760
 Yeah, in these neighborhoods.

1:34:32.760 --> 1:34:36.760
 It's like rural and there's like giant structures

1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:38.960
 and there's small pirate structures

1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:39.800
 and that kind of stuff.

1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:40.620
 Pirate structures, yeah.

1:34:40.620 --> 1:34:43.400
 I think low earth orbit might come to look like that.

1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:45.680
 And it's a really interesting regulatory challenge

1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:49.200
 to make sure that there's some cross purposes.

1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:51.620
 So the more cool space cities we have in orbit,

1:34:51.620 --> 1:34:53.800
 the more shiny objects in the night sky,

1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:55.320
 the worse it is for astronomers

1:34:55.320 --> 1:34:58.080
 in a really kind of overly simplified case.

1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:00.840
 So there's some pushback to this like Amoebaing

1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:05.080
 where we just grow kind of incongruously

1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:08.000
 or indiscriminately as an Amoeba in low earth orbit.

1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.640
 Beyond that though, I think we'll grow in pockets

1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:12.200
 where there are resources.

1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:15.840
 So we won't just expand around the gravity well of earth.

1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:18.600
 We'll do some development around the moon,

1:35:18.600 --> 1:35:20.200
 some development around asteroids,

1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:21.760
 some development around Mars,

1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:23.300
 because there'll always be purposes

1:35:23.300 --> 1:35:25.480
 for which we wanna go down to a physical object

1:35:25.480 --> 1:35:28.460
 and study it or extract something or learn from it.

1:35:28.460 --> 1:35:32.000
 But I think we'll grow in fits and starts in pockets.

1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:35.140
 Some of the coolest pockets are the gravity balanced pockets

1:35:35.140 --> 1:35:37.800
 like the Lagrange points, which is where we just sent,

1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:41.440
 we not me personally, but NASA just sent James Webb,

1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:44.000
 the big telescope, I think it's at L2.

1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:44.840
 So.

1:35:44.840 --> 1:35:46.480
 What's the nice feature about those pockets?

1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:48.480
 So it's a stable orbit.

1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:50.520
 There are several different Lagrange points.

1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:52.400
 And so it just requires less energy

1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:55.200
 to stay where you're trying to stay.

1:35:55.200 --> 1:35:57.480
 Yeah, that's fascinating.

1:35:57.480 --> 1:35:59.840
 What's also fascinating is the interaction

1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:04.440
 between nations on that regard.

1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:06.480
 Like who owns that?

1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:09.200
 Would you say in those floating cities,

1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:13.080
 do you envision independent governments?

1:36:13.080 --> 1:36:14.520
 That was gonna be my next answer to you,

1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:17.480
 which pushed me harder for a more provocative question

1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:19.320
 where I might disagree with other people.

1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:22.720
 I don't yet have my own opinions fully formed on this,

1:36:22.720 --> 1:36:24.280
 but we are trying to figure out right now

1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:25.840
 what happens to the moon

1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:29.820
 with all of these first come first served actors

1:36:29.820 --> 1:36:32.360
 just arriving and setting precedents

1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:34.480
 that might really affect future access.

1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:37.260
 And one example is property rights.

1:36:37.260 --> 1:36:40.080
 We do want companies that have the expertise

1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:41.880
 to go to the moon and mine stuff

1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:45.960
 that will help us develop a human settlement there

1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:49.200
 or a gateway, but companies need to know generally

1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:50.800
 that they have rights to a certain area

1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:52.900
 or that they have some legal right to sell things

1:36:52.900 --> 1:36:53.740
 that they're getting.

1:36:53.740 --> 1:36:55.760
 Does that mean we're gonna grant property rights

1:36:55.760 --> 1:36:58.760
 on the moon to companies who has the right

1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:00.720
 to give that right away?

1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:02.760
 So there's a bunch of really kind of gnarly questions

1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:03.580
 that we have to think about,

1:37:03.580 --> 1:37:04.920
 which is why I think we need space lawyers.

1:37:04.920 --> 1:37:07.600
 Maybe that's the true provocative answers.

1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:09.040
 I think we need space lawyers.

1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:12.020
 I mean, yeah, yeah, I mean, but those questions,

1:37:12.020 --> 1:37:14.580
 again, as you said eloquently,

1:37:14.580 --> 1:37:17.120
 will help us answer questions about here on Earth.

1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:18.240
 We hope so, yeah.

1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:20.920
 It is a little strange.

1:37:20.920 --> 1:37:23.100
 I mean, it's obvious, but it's also strange

1:37:23.100 --> 1:37:25.640
 if you look at the big picture of it all

1:37:25.640 --> 1:37:28.940
 that we draw these like borders around geographical areas

1:37:28.940 --> 1:37:32.120
 and we say, this is mine, like,

1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:34.160
 and then we fight wars over what's mine

1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:39.160
 and not, it seems like there's possible alternatives,

1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:42.920
 but also it seems like there needs to be a public ownership

1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:45.880
 of some parts, like, what is it?

1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:47.280
 Central Park in New York.

1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:50.460
 Is there something like preserving?

1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:52.400
 The commons.

1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:53.240
 Yeah, the commons.

1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:54.080
 The commons.

1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:57.320
 That's why we titled the book Into the Anthropocosmos.

1:37:57.320 --> 1:37:59.680
 We know it's a long and kind of a mouthful,

1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:02.360
 but this notion of the Anthropocene,

1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:04.900
 we have a lot of commons problems in humanity.

1:38:04.900 --> 1:38:07.000
 How are we treating the Earth, global climate change?

1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:09.180
 How are we gonna treat and behave in space?

1:38:09.180 --> 1:38:12.880
 How can we be responsible stewards of the space commons?

1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:15.120
 And I would love to see an approach to the moon

1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:18.340
 that is commons based, but it's hard to know

1:38:18.340 --> 1:38:21.960
 who would be the protector or the enforcer of that.

1:38:21.960 --> 1:38:25.120
 And if it's, which it will be probably in the early days,

1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:28.080
 a lot of companies sort of working on the moon,

1:38:28.080 --> 1:38:30.840
 working on Mars, working out in space,

1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:33.080
 it feels like there still needs to be

1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:37.400
 a civilian representation of like the greater effort

1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:38.680
 or something like that.

1:38:38.680 --> 1:38:40.160
 Like where there should be a president,

1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:42.840
 there should be a democracy of some kind

1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:43.880
 where people can vote.

1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:45.320
 Some representative government.

1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:49.200
 Those are all, again, the same human questions.

1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:54.000
 What advice would you give to a young person today

1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:57.840
 thinking about what they wanna do with their life, career?

1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:01.540
 So somebody in high school, somebody in college,

1:39:01.540 --> 1:39:03.300
 maybe somebody that looks up to the stars

1:39:03.300 --> 1:39:07.120
 and dreams to one day, take a one way ticket to Mars

1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:09.900
 or to contribute something to the effort.

1:39:09.900 --> 1:39:12.800
 I'd say you should feel empowered

1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:16.080
 because it's really the first time in human history

1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:19.940
 that we're at this cusp of interplanetary civilization.

1:39:19.940 --> 1:39:22.240
 And I don't think we're gonna lapse back from it.

1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:25.200
 So the future is incredibly bright for young people

1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:26.680
 that even younger than you and I,

1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:28.560
 who will actually really get a chance to go to Mars

1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:29.400
 for certain.

1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:32.800
 The other thing I would say is be open minded

1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:34.360
 about what your own interests are.

1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:36.480
 I don't think you anymore have to be shoehorned

1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:39.200
 into a particular career to be welcomed

1:39:39.200 --> 1:39:41.320
 into the future of space exploration.

1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:43.800
 If you are an artist and that is your passion,

1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:47.400
 but you would love to do space art or if not space art,

1:39:47.400 --> 1:39:49.920
 use your artistry to communicate a feeling

1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:51.880
 or a message about space.

1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:54.400
 That's a role that we desperately need

1:39:54.400 --> 1:39:56.080
 just as much as we need space scientists

1:39:56.080 --> 1:39:57.880
 and space engineers, so.

1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:00.200
 Well, when you look at your own life,

1:40:00.200 --> 1:40:02.800
 you're an incredibly accomplished scientist,

1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:05.000
 young scientist, but you know,

1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:08.960
 and you hopped around from physics to aerospace.

1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:11.640
 So going from the biggest theoretical ideas

1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:14.280
 to the biggest practical ideas.

1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:15.760
 Is there something from your own journey

1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:17.720
 you can give advice to,

1:40:17.720 --> 1:40:22.320
 like how to end up doing incredible research at MIT?

1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:26.680
 Maybe the role of the university and college

1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:29.440
 and education and learning, all that kind of stuff.

1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:33.120
 I'd say one piece of advice is find really good teammates

1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:35.280
 because I get to be the one that's talking to you,

1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:38.920
 but there are 50 graduate students, staff and faculty

1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:41.640
 that are part of my organization back at MIT.

1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:43.160
 And I'm actually, you guys can't see it on camera,

1:40:43.160 --> 1:40:45.560
 but I'm sitting here with my co founder and COO,

1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:48.920
 Danielle DeLotte, and that is really what makes

1:40:48.920 --> 1:40:52.560
 these large scale challenges for humanity possible

1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:55.120
 is really fantastic teams working together

1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:57.360
 to scale more than what I could do alone.

1:40:57.360 --> 1:40:58.600
 So I think that that's an important model

1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:00.360
 that we don't talk about enough in academia.

1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:03.680
 There's a big push for this like lone wolf genius figure

1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:06.000
 in academia, but that's certainly not been the case

1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:06.840
 in my life.

1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:09.440
 I've had wonderful collaborators and people

1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:10.680
 that I work with along the team.

1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:12.560
 Also cross disciplinary.

1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:13.680
 Absolutely, yeah.

1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:15.320
 Cross disciplinary, interdisciplinary,

1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:17.240
 whatever you wanna call it, but.

1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:19.280
 Artists, where do artists come in?

1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:20.200
 Do you work with artists?

1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:21.040
 We do.

1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:22.120
 We have an arts curator

1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:24.160
 on the space exploration initiative side.

1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:26.560
 She helps make sure partly around that communication

1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:27.600
 challenge that we talked about,

1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:29.560
 that we're not just doing zero G flights

1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:32.720
 and space missions, but that we take our artifacts

1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:35.440
 of this sci fi space future to museums

1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:38.000
 and galleries and exhibits.

1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:41.760
 She pushed me to make sure her name is Shinglu.

1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:44.440
 She pushed me for our first ISS mission.

1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:46.720
 I was just gathering all the engineering payloads

1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:48.600
 that I wanted to support for the students to fly,

1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:49.800
 including my own work.

1:41:49.800 --> 1:41:50.640
 And she said, you know what?

1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:52.920
 We should do an open call internationally

1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:55.920
 for artists to send something to the ISS.

1:41:55.920 --> 1:41:57.760
 And we found out it was the first time.

1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:00.120
 We were the first ever international open call

1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:01.840
 for art to go to the ISS.

1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:04.080
 And that was thanks to Shing, an artist bringing

1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:05.520
 a perspective that I might not have thought

1:42:05.520 --> 1:42:08.000
 about prioritizing, so.

1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:09.040
 Yeah, that's awesome.

1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:11.080
 So when you look out there,

1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:12.920
 it's the flame of human consciousness.

1:42:12.920 --> 1:42:15.040
 There does seem to be something quite special

1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:16.760
 about us humans.

1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:21.760
 Well, first of all, what do you think it is?

1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:23.000
 What's consciousness?

1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.840
 What are we trying to preserve here?

1:42:27.080 --> 1:42:32.080
 What is it about humans that should be preserved

1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:33.880
 or life here on earth?

1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:37.880
 What gives you hope to try to expand it out

1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:38.960
 farther and farther?

1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:43.140
 Like, what makes you sad if it was all gone?

1:42:43.140 --> 1:42:46.180
 I think we're a remarkable species

1:42:46.180 --> 1:42:49.820
 that we are aware of our own thoughts.

1:42:49.820 --> 1:42:52.060
 We are meta aware of our own thoughts

1:42:52.060 --> 1:42:52.900
 and of ourselves.

1:42:52.900 --> 1:42:54.580
 And we're able to speak on a podcast

1:42:54.580 --> 1:42:56.940
 about our meta awareness, about our own thoughts.

1:42:56.940 --> 1:42:58.020
 About our own thoughts, yeah.

1:42:58.020 --> 1:42:59.220
 Turtles all the way down.

1:43:00.900 --> 1:43:03.140
 I think that that is a really special gift

1:43:03.140 --> 1:43:04.740
 that we have been given as a species

1:43:04.740 --> 1:43:07.660
 and that there's a worth to expanding

1:43:07.660 --> 1:43:09.540
 our circles of awareness.

1:43:09.540 --> 1:43:12.140
 So we're very aware of, as an earth based species,

1:43:12.140 --> 1:43:13.700
 we've become a little bit more aware

1:43:13.700 --> 1:43:15.980
 of the fragility of earth and how special a place it is

1:43:15.980 --> 1:43:18.100
 when we go to the moon and we look back.

1:43:18.100 --> 1:43:21.940
 What would it mean for us to have a presence

1:43:21.940 --> 1:43:26.180
 and our purpose in life as a inter solar system species

1:43:26.180 --> 1:43:28.540
 or eventually an intergalactic species?

1:43:28.540 --> 1:43:30.160
 I think it's a really profound opportunity

1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:34.500
 for exploration, for the sake of exploration.

1:43:34.500 --> 1:43:36.300
 A real gift for the human mind.

1:43:36.300 --> 1:43:41.020
 Yeah, for anything, we're curious creatures.

1:43:41.020 --> 1:43:43.220
 You see, you do believe we might one day

1:43:43.220 --> 1:43:46.340
 become intergalactic civilizations.

1:43:46.340 --> 1:43:47.700
 Long, long time from now.

1:43:47.700 --> 1:43:49.980
 We have a lot of propulsion challenges

1:43:49.980 --> 1:43:51.500
 to answer to get that far.

1:43:51.500 --> 1:43:53.140
 So you have a hope for this.

1:43:53.140 --> 1:43:54.740
 Yeah.

1:43:54.740 --> 1:43:57.580
 Another big ridiculous question building on top of that.

1:43:57.580 --> 1:44:00.220
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

1:44:00.220 --> 1:44:03.820
 This individual life of ours, your life,

1:44:03.820 --> 1:44:06.300
 that unfortunately has to come to an end

1:44:06.300 --> 1:44:08.060
 as far as we know for now.

1:44:08.060 --> 1:44:09.180
 Yeah.

1:44:09.180 --> 1:44:13.900
 And our life here together, is there a why?

1:44:13.900 --> 1:44:18.900
 Or do we just kinda like let our curiosity carry us away?

1:44:20.740 --> 1:44:21.580
 Oh, interesting.

1:44:21.580 --> 1:44:25.380
 Is there a single kind of driving purpose why

1:44:25.380 --> 1:44:28.020
 or can it just be curiosity based?

1:44:28.020 --> 1:44:30.700
 I certainly feel, and this is not the scientist

1:44:30.700 --> 1:44:34.080
 in me talking, but just more of like a human soul talking.

1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:38.420
 I certainly feel some sense of purpose

1:44:38.420 --> 1:44:39.580
 and meaning in my life.

1:44:39.580 --> 1:44:40.580
 And there's a version of that

1:44:40.580 --> 1:44:43.340
 that's a very local level within my family,

1:44:43.340 --> 1:44:44.860
 which is funny because this whole conversation

1:44:44.860 --> 1:44:47.060
 has been big, grand space exploration themes.

1:44:47.060 --> 1:44:48.140
 But you asked me this question

1:44:48.140 --> 1:44:50.060
 and my first thought is what really matters to me,

1:44:50.060 --> 1:44:53.480
 my family, my biological reproducing unit.

1:44:53.480 --> 1:44:57.900
 But then there's also another purpose,

1:44:57.900 --> 1:44:59.780
 like another version of the meaning in my life

1:44:59.780 --> 1:45:02.420
 that is trying to do good things for humanity.

1:45:02.420 --> 1:45:04.980
 So that sense that we can be individual humans

1:45:04.980 --> 1:45:06.740
 and have our local meaning,

1:45:06.740 --> 1:45:08.620
 and we can also be global humans.

1:45:08.620 --> 1:45:10.500
 Maybe someday like the Star Trek utopia

1:45:10.500 --> 1:45:12.460
 will all be global citizens.

1:45:12.460 --> 1:45:14.440
 I don't wanna sound too naive.

1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:17.260
 But there is I think that beauty to a meaning

1:45:17.260 --> 1:45:20.100
 and a purpose of your life that's bigger than yourself,

1:45:20.100 --> 1:45:21.960
 working on something that's bigger and grander

1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:23.640
 than just yourself.

1:45:23.640 --> 1:45:25.140
 The deepest meaning is from

1:45:25.140 --> 1:45:28.020
 the local biological reproduction unit.

1:45:28.020 --> 1:45:31.260
 And then it goes to the engineering scientific,

1:45:32.140 --> 1:45:35.240
 what is it, corporate like company unit

1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:37.380
 that can actually produce and compete

1:45:37.380 --> 1:45:38.620
 and interact with the world.

1:45:38.620 --> 1:45:41.340
 And then there's the giant human unit

1:45:41.340 --> 1:45:43.980
 that's struggling with pandemics.

1:45:43.980 --> 1:45:45.180
 And commons.

1:45:45.180 --> 1:45:49.220
 And together struggling against the forces of nature

1:45:49.220 --> 1:45:50.820
 that keeps wanting to kill us.

1:45:50.820 --> 1:45:52.920
 Yeah, there'd be nothing like an alien invasion

1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:54.980
 to unite the planet, we think.

1:45:54.980 --> 1:45:57.980
 I can't wait, bring it on aliens.

1:45:57.980 --> 1:46:00.660
 Listen, your work, you're an incredible communicator,

1:46:00.660 --> 1:46:01.900
 incredible young scientist there.

1:46:01.900 --> 1:46:04.860
 It's huge honor that you would spend your time with me.

1:46:04.860 --> 1:46:07.740
 I can't wait what you do in the future.

1:46:07.740 --> 1:46:10.980
 And thank you for representing MIT so beautifully,

1:46:10.980 --> 1:46:11.820
 so masterfully.

1:46:11.820 --> 1:46:12.800
 You're an incredible person.

1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:13.640
 Thank you for talking to me.

1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:14.660
 Thank you so much for having me.

1:46:14.660 --> 1:46:15.660
 It's been an absolute pleasure.

1:46:15.660 --> 1:46:17.620
 It's a great conversation.

1:46:17.620 --> 1:46:19.140
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

1:46:19.140 --> 1:46:20.700
 with Ariel Ekblah.

 And now let me leave you with some words from Seneca,

1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:31.200
 the Roman stoic philosopher.

1:46:31.200 --> 1:46:36.200
 There is no easy way from earth to the stars.

1:46:36.200 --> 1:47:03.200
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
