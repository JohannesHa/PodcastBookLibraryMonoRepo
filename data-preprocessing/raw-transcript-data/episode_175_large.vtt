00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
 The following is a conversation with Yannis Papas, a comedian who cohosted the podcast

00:05.360 --> 00:12.160
 History Hyenas that I came across when I was researching the Battle of Crete from WWII.

00:12.160 --> 00:18.840
 He and his cohost were hilarious in their rants about history and about life.

00:18.840 --> 00:23.840
 The chemistry they have is probably the best of any cohosted comedy podcast or even podcast

00:23.840 --> 00:26.420
 in general that I've ever heard.

00:26.420 --> 00:32.620
 As of a few weeks ago, unfortunately, History Hyenas is no more, at least for now, because

00:32.620 --> 00:35.560
 all good things must come to an end.

00:35.560 --> 00:41.720
 But Yannis hosts a new podcast called Long Days with Yannis Papas, plus he has a comedy

00:41.720 --> 00:45.240
 special on YouTube for free.

00:45.240 --> 00:51.040
 Quick mention of our sponsors, WineAxis, Blinkist, Magic Spoon, and Indeed.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.760
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:54.760 --> 00:59.680
 As a side note, let me say that some of you have noticed that I have not spoken with too

00:59.680 --> 01:03.920
 many computer scientists, physicists, biologists, or engineers recently.

01:03.920 --> 01:08.520
 The reason has to do mostly with the risk aversion of many of these folks in the time

01:08.520 --> 01:12.480
 of COVID, especially as they get closer to taking the vaccine.

01:12.480 --> 01:17.340
 I'm tested several times a week and still some people are just more willing than others

01:17.340 --> 01:20.960
 to have an in person conversation in these times.

01:20.960 --> 01:26.080
 I only do these podcasts in person because I look for the possibility of a genuine human

01:26.080 --> 01:27.080
 connection.

01:27.080 --> 01:30.300
 I'm willing to sacrifice a lot for that.

01:30.300 --> 01:35.260
 Maybe it's silly, but I look for the magic that Charles Bukowski writes about in his

01:35.260 --> 01:36.800
 poem Nirvana.

01:36.800 --> 01:42.160
 The magic that is somehow in the air on those rare occasions when two people meet, talk,

01:42.160 --> 01:47.880
 and you notice that while on the surface you may be worlds apart, you're still somehow

01:47.880 --> 01:50.800
 woven from the same fabric.

01:50.800 --> 01:55.800
 I've had that with many guests, Jim Keller comes to mind, but many others as well.

01:55.800 --> 02:01.280
 I'm an AI person, machine learning, robotics, computer science is my passion.

02:01.280 --> 02:05.400
 Trust me, I can't wait to be having more technical conversations again, but I will

02:05.400 --> 02:11.280
 also continue to mix in comedians, musicians, historians, and of course, wise all seeing

02:11.280 --> 02:19.600
 sages like Giannis Papas and Tim Dillon, just to keep it, as Tim likes to say, fun.

02:19.600 --> 02:26.200
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Giannis Papas.

02:26.200 --> 02:32.400
 You've cohosted, until recently, an amazing history comedy podcast called The History

02:32.400 --> 02:33.840
 Hyenas.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.880
 So you're a bit of a student of history?

02:35.880 --> 02:38.440
 Yeah, an F student of history.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.440
 F student.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.880
 Okay, I thought it was more like a D minus.

02:40.880 --> 02:41.880
 D minus, yeah.

02:41.880 --> 02:42.880
 Okay.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.560
 Still got to repeat the grade if you get all D minuses.

02:44.560 --> 02:49.140
 I actually had a.67 GPA average my freshman year and I had to do it again.

02:49.140 --> 02:53.200
 This podcast is going to be the spectrum of human intelligence.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.040
 It runs the gamut from there to here.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.000
 So this is going to set the low bar.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.880
 I'm barely sliding into human, I'm closer to chimp.

03:00.880 --> 03:08.560
 And I bring that up that you're also friends with the great, the powerful Tim Dillon.

03:08.560 --> 03:14.680
 So let's talk about power and the corrupting effects of power.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.880
 Sometimes I look at Tim Dillon as he grows in power.

03:16.880 --> 03:19.520
 Oh, I thought you meant in size.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.800
 Well, size, I think they're correlated.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
 Yeah.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.240
 I saw him, I've been in Austin a couple of days, I saw him once, we had eight meals in

03:26.240 --> 03:27.240
 one day.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.240
 Eight meals.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.240
 Yeah.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.360
 So I feel like I've been here longer than I have just because of the meals with Dillon.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.360
 Kid likes biscuits and barbecue.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.360
 Okay.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.200
 So he's more like, see, I was imagining Putin or somebody like that.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.880
 He's more like the North Korean dictator.

03:39.880 --> 03:40.880
 Okay.

03:40.880 --> 03:41.880
 Yeah.

03:41.880 --> 03:42.880
 All right.

03:42.880 --> 03:43.880
 They get along great, those two.

03:43.880 --> 03:44.880
 Yeah.

03:44.880 --> 03:48.540
 I mean, Tim Dillon and King Jong Un would be like, they could make like a buddy cop

03:48.540 --> 03:49.540
 movie.

03:49.540 --> 03:50.540
 They would get along like Lethal Weapon.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.160
 That would be a good pitch movie.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.160
 Great podcast.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.160
 Yeah.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.160
 That would be a great podcast.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.160
 Yeah.

03:56.160 --> 03:57.160
 So much to talk about.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.360
 So many similar ideas about the world.

03:59.360 --> 04:05.280
 So what do you think the world would look like if Tim Dillon was given absolute power?

04:05.280 --> 04:10.960
 He seems like a person that's an interesting study of the corrupting effects of power.

04:10.960 --> 04:11.960
 Yeah.

04:11.960 --> 04:12.960
 You don't want to give him power.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.560
 You don't want, I don't even want him wearing a suit.

04:15.560 --> 04:19.500
 Like I want a guy who's as thoughtful and educated as you wearing a suit.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.200
 Like cause you know, suits corrupt you.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.960
 You put that suit on, you start feeling that power.

04:22.960 --> 04:23.960
 You start.

04:23.960 --> 04:24.960
 Definitely.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.960
 It's like, you know, yeah.

04:25.960 --> 04:26.960
 I don't even want Tim Dillon in a suit.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.040
 Power would, he would kill people.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.960
 He'd get rid of anything that he deemed.

04:30.960 --> 04:34.200
 I mean, if you made a lobster roll and it wasn't up to Tim Dillon's standard, he would

04:34.200 --> 04:35.200
 have you executed.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.440
 The entire restaurant staff is just gone.

04:38.440 --> 04:41.280
 He would have people below his food standard execute.

04:41.280 --> 04:45.960
 There'd be programs, not of people who are political dissidents, but of people who don't

04:45.960 --> 04:47.300
 meet his food standard.

04:47.300 --> 04:50.480
 His cuisine standard is high and he's usually right.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.480
 Do you think power does corrupt people?

04:52.480 --> 04:53.480
 Yes.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.720
 Like one of the reasons we mentioned offline Joe Rogan, he's been an inspiration to me

04:56.720 --> 05:02.520
 cause he gets, he gets, if you get power, just more famous and famous and yes, probably

05:02.520 --> 05:07.340
 a bit of power in terms of influence and he's still pretty much the same guy.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.200
 I'm not sure that's going to be true for everybody.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.480
 Do you ever think, ask yourself that question?

05:11.480 --> 05:12.480
 Yeah.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.480
 He's a rare breed.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.440
 He's like a benign king.

05:15.440 --> 05:19.200
 Most people I meet who are like really powerful are like douchebags and that's how they got

05:19.200 --> 05:20.200
 there.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.880
 I think that's, psychopaths have the advantage because they don't have feelings and Joe's

05:23.880 --> 05:24.880
 a rare example.

05:24.880 --> 05:29.720
 He's just a powerhouse of will and he, I do think about that.

05:29.720 --> 05:30.720
 Yeah.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.880
 I think I should be stopped right now.

05:32.880 --> 05:37.240
 Just stop me right now because yeah, power for me, I would, when people get power, they

05:37.240 --> 05:38.240
 indulge.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.240
 It doesn't change anyone.

05:39.240 --> 05:44.080
 It just reveals your darkest, you know, people aren't supposed to have anything they want.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.540
 You got to be able to struggle for everything.

05:45.540 --> 05:48.360
 So I would have a harem, I'd be like a Roman dictator.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.360
 Yeah.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.360
 I'd be like a Roman emperor.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.360
 I mean, people called them emperors.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.360
 They were dictators.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.360
 The most effective leaders are dictators.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.140
 I hope we get back to that.

05:55.140 --> 05:56.140
 Democracy hasn't worked.

05:56.140 --> 06:00.040
 I'm ready for a secession of Caesars and I want to start with AOC.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.680
 That's true.

06:02.680 --> 06:03.680
 Dictators get the job done.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.680
 They do.

06:04.680 --> 06:05.680
 They do.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.280
 At a certain point you got, that's why social workers can only get you so far.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.520
 You need action.

06:08.520 --> 06:14.160
 I was a social worker for five years and all you do is ask about medications and you don't

06:14.160 --> 06:15.160
 solve anything.

06:15.160 --> 06:21.740
 I do ask myself of that, like, cause I'm more in the tech space of constructing systems

06:21.740 --> 06:23.840
 that prevent me from being corrupt.

06:23.840 --> 06:27.800
 Cause right now I'm all about love and all about those kinds of things.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.980
 But I wonder, you said like, it just reveals the darkness.

06:31.980 --> 06:35.500
 The problem is we might not be aware of our own darkness.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.600
 I have the same feeling about money actually.

06:37.600 --> 06:44.480
 I've been avoiding thinking about money, like basically constructing my moral system, my

06:44.480 --> 06:46.080
 moral compass around money.

06:46.080 --> 06:54.600
 It's like the moment I feel a little too happy about the idea of owning some cool shiny thing,

06:54.600 --> 06:58.800
 I started to think, okay, I'm not going to own that shiny thing cause I'm afraid of the

06:58.800 --> 07:00.160
 slippery slope of it.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.160
 Yeah.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.160
 You ever think about that kind of stuff?

07:02.160 --> 07:03.160
 Yeah.

07:03.160 --> 07:11.160
 The thing about the capitalist system is it puts sort of a profit motive above beauty.

07:11.160 --> 07:15.840
 And you notice when you see certain cities, especially in the old days where like buildings

07:15.840 --> 07:20.760
 used to be beautiful and now they're just like boxes, they throw a kid up and it's just

07:20.760 --> 07:24.240
 for all profit margin.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.880
 It's the illusion of permanence that, you know, it's like, oh, let me get as much money

07:27.880 --> 07:28.880
 as I can.

07:28.880 --> 07:29.880
 You're like, yeah.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.720
 You know, my dad used to say, you know, everyone, it's a cliche, but you can't take it with

07:32.720 --> 07:33.720
 you.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.120
 So it's kind of, it's, it's comical to me that we're here trying to get this infinite

07:37.120 --> 07:38.120
 amount.

07:38.120 --> 07:41.600
 Like it's like Sisyphus, we're all trying to climb this hill, but I mean, the rock's

07:41.600 --> 07:42.600
 going to fall on us.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.000
 So I think that's a healthy outlook.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
 Yeah.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.160
 My dad always used to say before he passed, you know, he would say, you can't, you have

07:48.160 --> 07:51.840
 to survive not only physically, but you have to survive emotionally.

07:51.840 --> 07:56.120
 I think a lot of people forget about the emotional part of a survival.

07:56.120 --> 08:01.800
 You have to survive emotionally and humor and, and, and understanding reality in its

08:01.800 --> 08:04.080
 objective context helps with that.

08:04.080 --> 08:11.480
 Accepting reality as this ephemeral thing that you're really just a part of, but not

08:11.480 --> 08:15.120
 as significant as your ego wants you to believe is a, is a start.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.320
 That's a good foundation for surviving emotionally.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.320
 What's that mean?

08:19.320 --> 08:20.320
 Surviving emotionally?

08:20.320 --> 08:23.440
 Like what, what's an ideal life look like while you're thriving?

08:23.440 --> 08:25.100
 You can't take things too seriously.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.600
 You can't, because they're ephemeral.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.600
 They're not permanent.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.600
 Nothing's permanent.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.600
 Your bank account's not permanent.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.600
 Your abilities aren't permanent.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.600
 Nothing's permanent.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.080
 Your abilities aren't permanent.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.080
 Your memory's not permanent.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.080
 Your, your, your dick getting hard is not permanent.

08:38.080 --> 08:43.120
 Can I curse on this or is this go out to, yeah, you can curse to your heart's content.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.120
 Okay.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.120
 Yeah.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.120
 I mean, gender's not even permanent anymore.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.720
 I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna change maybe and live my second half as another gender

08:48.720 --> 08:51.240
 just to have, I'm bored with this gender.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.420
 So it's like nothing is permanent.

08:53.420 --> 08:59.360
 And so accepting that emotionally is a good start to being more flexible.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.640
 You gotta be flexible.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.240
 Like my dad used to say, anything too stiff snaps.

09:03.240 --> 09:07.040
 You gotta, you know, it's a cliche and people have said it a bunch of different ways, but

09:07.040 --> 09:08.040
 Bruce Lee's right, man.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.040
 Be water.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.040
 Be water.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.040
 Yeah.

09:11.040 --> 09:18.000
 Bukowski has this quote about love, that love is a fog that fades with the first light of

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
 reality.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.920
 So he's, he's a romantic, that guy.

09:21.920 --> 09:25.160
 But that even love is a thing that just doesn't last very long.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.160
 No.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.600
 Um, you know, some people would disagree with that.

09:28.600 --> 09:32.280
 Maybe it morphs, like, like, like water, it changes, right?

09:32.280 --> 09:37.280
 It might not be, it might not be this, cause he's mostly just, uh, loved like prostitutes,

09:37.280 --> 09:38.280
 I think.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.280
 So,

09:39.280 --> 09:40.280
 The best kind of love.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.280
 Yeah.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.280
 No demand.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.280
 No, uh, responsibilities.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.280
 Yeah.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.280
 It's a financial transaction.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.280
 Yeah.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.020
 Uh, ephemeral as ever.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.960
 You mentioned your dad.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.760
 He passed away, uh, two, uh, a year and a half ago.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.760
 Yeah.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.320
 What did you learn from him?

09:56.320 --> 09:57.720
 I love my dad.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.720
 My dad, I would say my dad was my, my hero.

10:00.720 --> 10:05.840
 He was just, uh, my dad really embodied those values and I think, um, for better or worse,

10:05.840 --> 10:06.840
 it's made me who I am.

10:06.840 --> 10:13.400
 He's, he, uh, my dad was, was a painter, he was a lawyer, he was, uh, he was, uh, you

10:13.400 --> 10:15.320
 know, a Lieutenant in the military.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.320
 New Yorker.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.320
 New Yorker.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.320
 Born and bred Brooklyn.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.080
 His dad, his dad, you know, uh, surprise owned a diner.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.280
 So that's, that's sort of the Greek passport.

10:24.280 --> 10:27.320
 That's the immigration passport for Greeks into America.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.480
 And, um, yeah, my dad played football.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.440
 He just, my dad did what he wanted.

10:31.440 --> 10:35.320
 He lived as he wanted at all costs and I think I got that from him for better or worse.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.920
 I think it's hurt me in my pursuits.

10:37.920 --> 10:44.920
 Uh, if you consider money and fame, uh, to be paramount, you know, I, I've always done

10:44.920 --> 10:47.760
 what I wanted and if I stopped wanting to do it, I just stopped doing it.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.880
 I think I got that from my dad.

10:48.880 --> 10:52.120
 So maybe for better or worse, that's what I learned from him.

10:52.120 --> 10:55.980
 But that's a real currency, you know, feeling like you're in love with what you're doing

10:55.980 --> 10:59.440
 when you're doing it, maybe perhaps that's worth more than money.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.120
 I don't know.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.120
 You miss him?

11:02.120 --> 11:03.120
 Yeah.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.120
 Every day.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.120
 Every day.

11:05.120 --> 11:08.880
 But I'm happy that, uh, he, he got 91 years.

11:08.880 --> 11:09.880
 It's very rare.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.200
 I mean, he smoked for 60 years.

11:12.200 --> 11:16.160
 Talk about like a guy who was an outlier and he smoked like 60 years, like packs.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.360
 I mean, and he didn't die from that.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.360
 He died.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.560
 He had a prostate cancer, which is the way men should go.

11:21.560 --> 11:22.680
 Your dick should give out.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.160
 It should start from the dick.

11:24.160 --> 11:29.440
 I mean, we focus so much of our life on the dick that that's the way that's a successful

11:29.440 --> 11:33.280
 life and that's why every man eventually gets prostate cancer because that is the universe's

11:33.280 --> 11:38.080
 way of saying like the thing you focused on the most is you put the most energy into is

11:38.080 --> 11:42.240
 the thing that's spent and it's going to, your, your rotting is going to start there.

11:42.240 --> 11:47.320
 So that's a successful life and it just spread all over his body and he slowly died.

11:47.320 --> 11:50.760
 I was with him when he died and that meant a lot to me because me and my brother weren't

11:50.760 --> 11:55.520
 talking at the time cause we're Greeks, we're, we're talking again, but that's how it is.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.520
 You got a few brothers, right?

11:56.520 --> 12:01.260
 I got two brothers, but I wanted to make sure I was with him when he died and I got lucky

12:01.260 --> 12:03.960
 and I was in the room with him when he died.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.400
 You were in the room with your brother and you weren't.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.480
 No, my brother wasn't there.

12:07.480 --> 12:08.600
 We were kind of doing shifts.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.680
 I was, I was there.

12:09.680 --> 12:14.080
 I spent the night, the dad, my, the night my dad died, he died in the early in the morning

12:14.080 --> 12:19.600
 and I heard the death rattle last breath and it was just, I think it was, uh, I, he knew

12:19.600 --> 12:24.540
 I was there and, uh, I think that just probably meant something to him and I'm just glad I

12:24.540 --> 12:25.540
 was there.

12:25.540 --> 12:30.600
 Does that make you sad that, uh, life is ephemeral, like you said, that, that you die?

12:30.600 --> 12:31.600
 Yeah.

12:31.600 --> 12:32.600
 What do you think about your own death?

12:32.600 --> 12:33.880
 You meditate on that?

12:33.880 --> 12:40.440
 I think it, I think the actual, if there is a point to life, it's to, um, hopefully not

12:40.440 --> 12:43.920
 fear death, to accept reality.

12:43.920 --> 12:44.960
 I think that's important.

12:44.960 --> 12:50.320
 I think so much goes awry in the human condition when we lose touch with reality.

12:50.320 --> 12:55.440
 Every, uh, political system that's led to mass murder and everything, I think because

12:55.440 --> 13:02.520
 it's because the, the tenants of those political philosophies ended up being utopian.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.920
 They were detached from reality, detached from nature.

13:05.920 --> 13:11.000
 And so I think it's, it's very important to accept and acknowledge your own mortality.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.080
 I think it's the foundation for what makes a good person, a moral person, um, a contributing

13:16.080 --> 13:18.440
 member of society because it's true.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.400
 True things should be the foundation of all things.

13:21.400 --> 13:26.220
 If, if, if what you believe is based on illusion, you're going to end up doing destruction.

13:26.220 --> 13:30.280
 Whether that destruction is on a scale of one to 10, you are going to be destructive

13:30.280 --> 13:31.280
 because it's not real.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.280
 It's a fantasy.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.280
 It doesn't exist.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.940
 See, the thing is the truth is about, I don't think you can ever reach truth.

13:36.940 --> 13:40.720
 Truth is about like constantly digging and to push back on your idea that you should

13:40.720 --> 13:41.880
 accept death.

13:41.880 --> 13:47.040
 I think the more honest response to death, so the least honest is to run away from it,

13:47.040 --> 13:51.980
 create illusions that help you imagine that there's not a death.

13:51.980 --> 13:59.680
 Uh, the next is to accept it, but the real honest one is to fear it because I, I, I mean,

13:59.680 --> 14:04.960
 I'm, I'm with, uh, Ernest Becker is a philosopher, uh, wrote a book called Denial of Death.

14:04.960 --> 14:10.560
 He says that the, like much of the human condition is based in the fear of mortality.

14:10.560 --> 14:15.080
 That we like, that's, that's the creative force of the human energy.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.320
 Like Freud said, do you want to sleep with your mother?

14:17.320 --> 14:20.240
 He said, no, that's not what motivates you.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.480
 Maybe his mom wasn't hot though.

14:21.480 --> 14:26.280
 I mean, or he wasn't Greek because apparently at a poll, we found that we found that all

14:26.280 --> 14:27.280
 things good and bad.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.280
 Yeah.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.280
 Thanks.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.280
 Thanks for that.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.280
 Thanks.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.280
 I just don't know if his mom was a looker or not.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.280
 I mean, I'd have to Google it.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.280
 All right.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.280
 Yeah.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.000
 I'll look up on Google images.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
 Yeah.

14:38.000 --> 14:44.440
 But I think the honest, as he says, the thing that we run away from is that there's a terror.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.920
 He calls it like terror.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.600
 Uh, there's something called terror management theory.

14:48.600 --> 14:54.040
 That's some philosophers after him followed on that we're basically trying to run away

14:54.040 --> 15:00.040
 from this fear and acceptance is actually creating an illusion for yourself.

15:00.040 --> 15:03.560
 Like you can actually accept something as terrifying as this.

15:03.560 --> 15:07.320
 So he's more with the stoics, the stoic constantly meditate on their death.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.480
 I mean, they, what does that mean?

15:09.480 --> 15:15.640
 I mean, it's kind of, it's, you know, acceptance of death isn't a thing you do like on a Monday

15:15.640 --> 15:22.280
 and then you're done is a thing you constantly have to meditate on, like reminding yourself

15:22.280 --> 15:23.840
 like this ride is over.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.280
 It could be over today.

15:25.280 --> 15:29.360
 And that's something you're, if you think about every single day, it gives you an appreciation

15:29.360 --> 15:34.920
 of Woody Allen movies, at least it gives you appreciation of basically everything, including

15:34.920 --> 15:39.680
 Woody Allen movies, which shows you how deep your appreciation for life could be.

15:39.680 --> 15:44.480
 I've actually haven't been following much about what Woody Allen's, but apparently he's

15:44.480 --> 15:47.000
 been a troublemaker through most of his life.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
 He's yeah.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.600
 I mean, you know, he's caused a little bit of strife.

15:49.600 --> 15:53.400
 He's left a little, uh, yeah, he's left a little confusion in his wake for sure.

15:53.400 --> 15:58.040
 But I mean, you know, that's another one separate the art from the artist.

15:58.040 --> 16:02.800
 He's got, I mean, the guys will go down in history as the greatest he's made, I mean,

16:02.800 --> 16:06.880
 maybe a year and they're all, you can always find something good about each movie, like

16:06.880 --> 16:08.440
 the dialogue or whatever.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.980
 Um, I love what you're saying.

16:09.980 --> 16:12.480
 It's interesting, but the only thing I would say to push back a little bit since we're

16:12.480 --> 16:17.560
 playing a little table tennis here is, um, I don't know if it's a choice to fear death.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.720
 That's more of an, it seems more instinctual.

16:19.720 --> 16:24.440
 It seems like something that nature wants you to do because I've been in positions where

16:24.440 --> 16:25.480
 I thought I was going to die.

16:25.480 --> 16:31.960
 Like I've been shot and I had those moments and then nature also, uh, you know, kicks

16:31.960 --> 16:36.280
 in an instinct, which is acceptance where you kind of, I don't know, it's a chemical

16:36.280 --> 16:37.280
 release or whatever.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.960
 I don't know, you know, we're all, we're robots basically.

16:39.960 --> 16:44.320
 So some sort of chemical is released that protects you, but there is an acceptance.

16:44.320 --> 16:48.640
 I don't know how much, uh, of it was a conscious choice, probably very little.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.520
 Um, and that's the point I'm making is it's, it's instinctual.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.640
 We don't really have a choice in fearing death.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.520
 Otherwise there would be no progression.

16:55.520 --> 17:02.840
 We wouldn't all life seems to want to survive, uh, not by choice, but by instinct.

17:02.840 --> 17:07.360
 So he, he argues that the fear is not the instinctual of, it's not the animalistic stuff.

17:07.360 --> 17:11.960
 That's the thing that makes us special is the, what humans are able to do is to have

17:11.960 --> 17:14.120
 a knowledge that we're going to die one day.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.720
 Animals don't have that animals.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.720
 Fear is instinctual.

17:16.720 --> 17:19.620
 It's like, Holy shit, what's that sound over there?

17:19.620 --> 17:25.360
 He says, we're actually able to contemplate the fact that this ride ends and that that

17:25.360 --> 17:29.400
 kind of cognitive construct is difficult for us to deal with.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.480
 Like what the hell does that mean?

17:31.480 --> 17:38.880
 Like just to, just to think about, it's going to be over at a certain point, it's just over

17:38.880 --> 17:39.880
 lights out.

17:39.880 --> 17:46.920
 Like it's very difficult to kind of load that into whatever this like little brain we got.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.160
 Like, what does that actually mean?

17:49.160 --> 17:51.480
 Maybe that's what gives everything meaning.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.480
 Yeah.

17:52.480 --> 17:56.720
 Because if everything lasted forever, if, uh, if this went on ad infinitum, there would

17:56.720 --> 17:57.720
 be no meaning to it.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.640
 I'd be like, Hey, if I don't see you tomorrow, I'll see in a million years, there would be

18:00.640 --> 18:01.640
 no meaning.

18:01.640 --> 18:02.640
 There'll be no urgency.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.640
 There would be no feelings.

18:03.640 --> 18:07.760
 There'd be no, uh, nothing of magnitude or superficiality.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.960
 It would all just be this kind of, it would be torture.

18:10.960 --> 18:13.960
 It would actually, that would actually be torture to be here forever.

18:13.960 --> 18:17.680
 I mean, I'm already sick of this place and I'm just in my forties.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.680
 Like I'm done.

18:18.680 --> 18:19.680
 I'm sick of me.

18:19.680 --> 18:20.680
 I'm sick of everything.

18:20.680 --> 18:27.440
 You know, a lot of people, when they talk about mortality, they consider, they consider

18:27.440 --> 18:33.840
 mortality appealing because you get a chance to do basically all these things you might

18:33.840 --> 18:38.460
 not get a chance to do otherwise, like all the kinds of travel broadly, explore, read

18:38.460 --> 18:43.240
 every book, explore every idea, do every hobby, all those kinds of things.

18:43.240 --> 18:50.760
 The idea I was talking to mentioned, uh, the reality of being immortal would be more likely,

18:50.760 --> 18:57.600
 I like this idea, more likely would be you just sitting there doing nothing because,

18:57.600 --> 19:03.280
 and putting off all that travel and exploration to later because you'll always have time.

19:03.280 --> 19:07.080
 And so what you're going to have, what actual immortality would look like for a bunch of

19:07.080 --> 19:09.680
 humans is people sitting there doing nothing.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.800
 It would be like a Greek caffineer just sitting around drinking coffee.

19:12.800 --> 19:13.800
 I love it.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.800
 Yeah.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.280
 I mean, it's a lazy man's paradise.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.280
 Yeah.

19:17.280 --> 19:21.320
 But it's so interesting because that, that's, that rings true to me for what humans are

19:21.320 --> 19:27.040
 like is we'll basically just put off all those exciting adventures and just be lazy, become

19:27.040 --> 19:30.520
 lazier and lazier and lazier because you'll always have a chance to do all the exciting

19:30.520 --> 19:33.720
 things and we'll just get, we'll basically become Tim Dillon.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.720
 We just sit there and have a podcast and that's it.

19:36.720 --> 19:37.720
 He works hard.

19:37.720 --> 19:38.720
 Um, yeah.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.480
 I mean, that sounds actually like heaven, dude.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.640
 That's speaking to my heart really.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.720
 I mean, I'm at heart, I'm a very lazy person.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.680
 I always try to find ways to lie down.

19:47.680 --> 19:51.460
 Like if I'm sitting, I'll figure out a way to kind of contort myself to later.

19:51.460 --> 19:54.000
 That's an interesting thing to like in, yeah.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.360
 If you can always push something off, yeah, that, I like that.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.360
 I think that's heaven.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.360
 And um,

20:02.360 --> 20:03.600
 See, we just changed your mind.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.880
 You kind of like the immortality.

20:04.880 --> 20:05.880
 Yeah.

20:05.880 --> 20:06.880
 I kind of like it.

20:06.880 --> 20:07.880
 No.

20:07.880 --> 20:08.880
 So there'll be no thirsts.

20:08.880 --> 20:09.880
 No.

20:09.880 --> 20:10.880
 You can always put it off.

20:10.880 --> 20:11.880
 You don't want to bang this girl.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.920
 You're like, ah, put it off.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.680
 But now I'm thinking about Muslim heaven and they may be offering the best deal.

20:16.680 --> 20:23.160
 I mean, if it was an expo and they had a booth, I may go with them because they offer, they

20:23.160 --> 20:26.240
 offer 62 or 72, but then I'd get sick of them.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.080
 I'd want to, I don't know.

20:28.080 --> 20:33.300
 I always wondered like, are you given the 62 virgins or you choose, can you create them

20:33.300 --> 20:36.540
 like an avatar, like a video game, or are you just given?

20:36.540 --> 20:39.280
 I don't know what the number, why it's important to have that high number.

20:39.280 --> 20:44.800
 First of all, I think it's a mistranslation about the virgins, but outside of that, outside

20:44.800 --> 20:48.160
 of that, I feel like the conversation is really important.

20:48.160 --> 20:52.400
 I don't think they ever specify like what kind of books these girls read.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.920
 Like what are they, what are they into?

20:54.920 --> 20:59.080
 Like the quality of the conversation, I think if you're talking about eternity, the quality

20:59.080 --> 21:03.000
 of the intellect and the conversation and the personalities is way more important.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.120
 And the Greeks have an ancient, ancient expression, pat metronaros stone, which my mother always

21:07.120 --> 21:10.680
 used to say, which is everything in moderation, nothing in excess.

21:10.680 --> 21:16.620
 So trying to always get the status quo and uh, yeah, that many women, eventually it's

21:16.620 --> 21:19.560
 like the magic Johnson effect, Isaiah Thomas effect.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.480
 It's just too much and you're going to end up, you're going to end up banging a dude

21:22.480 --> 21:23.480
 is what I'm saying.

21:23.480 --> 21:27.740
 You're going to get sick of it cause it's too much and there's going to be a eunuch

21:27.740 --> 21:29.720
 that finds its way into your harem.

21:29.720 --> 21:33.840
 That's been proven throughout history, every empire, when you have all that power.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.980
 And again, this goes back to power corrupting.

21:35.980 --> 21:40.560
 If you have, if there's no struggle, there's no meaning, there's the value is from the

21:40.560 --> 21:43.040
 journey, the, the working hard to struggle.

21:43.040 --> 21:47.800
 And if it's just given to you because you're a Sultan or you're Alexander the Great or

21:47.800 --> 21:50.960
 whatever, you're going to get bored and you're going to bang a dude.

21:50.960 --> 21:54.000
 That's it's, I think that's a scientific axiom actually.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.600
 Eventually you'll get bored and bang a dude.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.320
 Yeah, but I think it won't stop there.

21:57.320 --> 21:59.240
 I think you'll go to animals, you go to robot.

21:59.240 --> 22:02.980
 I mean, eventually it all ends up in robots and then the robots rebel and then the humans

22:02.980 --> 22:03.980
 will be destroyed.

22:03.980 --> 22:04.980
 Yeah.

22:04.980 --> 22:05.980
 I'm sorry.

22:05.980 --> 22:12.320
 If, if we're speaking truth, you said the value of life, one of the highest ideals is

22:12.320 --> 22:13.320
 to seek truth.

22:13.320 --> 22:14.320
 I think if we're being honest.

22:14.320 --> 22:15.320
 Can I ask you a quick question?

22:15.320 --> 22:16.320
 Yes.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.200
 If you, if you live in a small, I come from small islands, right?

22:18.200 --> 22:20.480
 And so there's a stereotype that that's where they bang animals.

22:20.480 --> 22:24.320
 But if you come from a very small community, you know, an island or something, and you

22:24.320 --> 22:28.040
 have the choice of banging a family member or an animal, which one is worse on the moral

22:28.040 --> 22:29.040
 scale?

22:29.040 --> 22:31.760
 Because you're technically not related to the animal.

22:31.760 --> 22:32.760
 Right.

22:32.760 --> 22:33.760
 This is interesting.

22:33.760 --> 22:37.280
 I mean, these are human constructs, these ideas, but yet for me personally, taboo would

22:37.280 --> 22:40.720
 be more taboo to, uh, to, to have sex with a family member.

22:40.720 --> 22:41.720
 Yeah.

22:41.720 --> 22:42.720
 I mean, animal.

22:42.720 --> 22:43.720
 I mean, okay.

22:43.720 --> 22:44.720
 It's good to know where you stand on that.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.720
 I think if viewers, you know, if they didn't have, they didn't know they had that question.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.800
 I just, they just learned a little bit about you.

22:49.800 --> 22:50.800
 And now I know.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.240
 I look forward to the internet clipping that out.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.240
 Yeah.

22:54.240 --> 23:01.400
 I mean, there, there is, listen, uh, in some, outside of, outside of that, I do think about

23:01.400 --> 23:02.400
 that a lot.

23:02.400 --> 23:06.840
 I think it's kind of ridiculous, uh, about morality connected to animals in terms of

23:06.840 --> 23:10.000
 all the, the, the factory farming and so on.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.600
 It seems like that's one of the things we'll look, cause I love meat, but I kind of feel

23:14.600 --> 23:21.160
 bad about it and, and bad in a way where I think if we look like a hundred years from

23:21.160 --> 23:28.400
 now, we'll look back at this time as like one of the great like tortures and injustices

23:28.400 --> 23:30.480
 that we humans have committed.

23:30.480 --> 23:34.960
 And I mean, all that has to do with the sex with the animal has to do with consent and

23:34.960 --> 23:37.720
 about the experience of suffering of animals.

23:37.720 --> 23:42.480
 The reason I think about that personally a lot, cause I think about robotics, I think

23:42.480 --> 23:50.540
 about creating artificial consciousnesses, uh, or artificial like beings that have some

23:50.540 --> 23:52.280
 elements of the human nature.

23:52.280 --> 23:55.560
 And then you start to think like, well, what does it mean to suffer?

23:55.560 --> 24:00.860
 What does it mean for entity to exist such that it deserves rights?

24:00.860 --> 24:05.120
 This is something that the founding fathers were thinking about, like, you know, all men

24:05.120 --> 24:06.120
 are created equal.

24:06.120 --> 24:11.560
 What does it, which, who is included in the men who, who's not in that, in that sentence

24:11.560 --> 24:14.440
 and our animals included in that are robots.

24:14.440 --> 24:18.240
 I honestly think that there will be a civil rights movement for robots in the future.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.960
 I don't, I don't know.

24:19.960 --> 24:23.040
 Is that the Turing test, the way you try to, is that what they call it where you're trying

24:23.040 --> 24:28.920
 to see if AI can think like a human or whatever, or feel like a human?

24:28.920 --> 24:34.640
 Well, it's a, the Turing test closely defined as more about talk like a human.

24:34.640 --> 24:39.720
 So you can, you can imagine systems that are able to, you can have a conversation like

24:39.720 --> 24:46.360
 this and I would be a robot for example, but that doesn't mean I would do in a, in society.

24:46.360 --> 24:50.880
 That doesn't mean I deserve rights or that doesn't mean I would be conscious.

24:50.880 --> 24:55.840
 It doesn't mean that I would be able to suffer and to experience pleasure and dream and all

24:55.840 --> 24:57.840
 those kinds of human things.

24:57.840 --> 25:01.300
 The question isn't whether you're able to talk, which is passed in the Turing test.

25:01.300 --> 25:08.760
 The question is whether you're able to feel, to be, I mean, I go back to suffering.

25:08.760 --> 25:14.560
 The thing that the, that our documents protect us against is suffering.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.280
 Like we don't want humans to suffer.

25:17.280 --> 25:25.280
 And if a robot can suffer, that discussion starts being about like, well, shouldn't we

25:25.280 --> 25:27.420
 protect them?

25:27.420 --> 25:29.040
 Currently we don't protect animals.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.420
 We protect that dog.

25:30.420 --> 25:31.420
 There's laws.

25:31.420 --> 25:34.080
 There's actual legislation that protects dogs for torture places.

25:34.080 --> 25:35.080
 Yeah.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.080
 And you know what?

25:36.080 --> 25:38.860
 Dogs is something I don't think people really understand enough about.

25:38.860 --> 25:39.920
 It's one of my obsessions.

25:39.920 --> 25:45.980
 So they, they, my dad always used to say those, he goes, those things are, those things are

25:45.980 --> 25:47.340
 basically human.

25:47.340 --> 25:51.080
 And I mean, they dream, they have anxiety.

25:51.080 --> 25:55.200
 And what people often overlook about dogs is without dogs, we wouldn't be here.

25:55.200 --> 26:03.980
 We would not have ever evolved from hunter gatherer to agrarian to, you know, civilization.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.180
 We wouldn't have cities.

26:05.180 --> 26:06.180
 We wouldn't have anything.

26:06.180 --> 26:10.620
 I mean, they are our partner in survival and they are a magical animal.

26:10.620 --> 26:14.280
 There's no, there's no animal that was, it was like destiny almost.

26:14.280 --> 26:19.180
 I mean, a malleable animal, there's no animal that's that malleable that in a few generations

26:19.180 --> 26:22.680
 you can tailor to a specific job that you need.

26:22.680 --> 26:28.300
 And without that animal, without dogs doing that animal, protecting our crops from, from,

26:28.300 --> 26:32.940
 you know scavengers and stuff like that, you know, the list goes on.

26:32.940 --> 26:34.100
 We wouldn't be here.

26:34.100 --> 26:41.860
 So we, that's an often overlooked fact that human evolution was not done in a vacuum just

26:41.860 --> 26:42.860
 with humans.

26:42.860 --> 26:44.260
 Without dogs, we would have never evolved.

26:44.260 --> 26:46.460
 I mean, we weren't the apex predator for most of our existence.

26:46.460 --> 26:47.460
 We weren't even the apex predator.

26:47.460 --> 26:51.500
 I mean, we're getting eaten by hyenas, which is my favorite animal and you know, that's

26:51.500 --> 26:54.420
 kind of an injustice to, I mean, I'm kind of mad at dogs.

26:54.420 --> 26:59.980
 We deserve to get eaten by hyenas, but without dogs, we wouldn't be here and dogs, dogs deserve

26:59.980 --> 27:00.980
 the protection.

27:00.980 --> 27:01.980
 So do horses.

27:01.980 --> 27:06.220
 They fucking lugged us around for thousands of years and now these fucking German psychopaths

27:06.220 --> 27:07.920
 are eating them or whatever.

27:07.920 --> 27:11.820
 We should not eat horse meat just on like, be a good dude, man.

27:11.820 --> 27:15.740
 These things lugged us around for generations, they're beautiful, you know, ride them or

27:15.740 --> 27:16.740
 I don't know.

27:16.740 --> 27:19.980
 I don't know, but it rubs me the wrong way that we eat horses.

27:19.980 --> 27:24.780
 Yeah, the horses one is interesting and one of my favorite books is Animal Farm by Orwell

27:24.780 --> 27:31.460
 and the horses don't get a good ending in that, I kind of, my spirit animal I suppose

27:31.460 --> 27:36.480
 is the horse from Animal Farm, Boxer, where he says, I will work harder.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.900
 That's his motto.

27:37.900 --> 27:41.300
 I work really hard at stupid things.

27:41.300 --> 27:45.180
 That's basically what I, I just hit my head against the wall for no reason whatsoever.

27:45.180 --> 27:47.980
 But that probably fulfills, you have a big brain, you were probably born with a big brain

27:47.980 --> 27:48.980
 that kind of fulfills.

27:48.980 --> 27:50.380
 It's killing neurons.

27:50.380 --> 27:51.380
 It's exercise for you.

27:51.380 --> 27:52.380
 Yeah.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.380
 Yeah.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.940
 Don't you think some animals deserve to be eaten though?

27:54.940 --> 27:55.940
 Kind of like.

27:55.940 --> 27:56.940
 Hyenas.

27:56.940 --> 27:57.940
 Come on, dude.

27:57.940 --> 28:00.140
 I mean, you gotta respect the hyena.

28:00.140 --> 28:03.020
 Okay, so let's look, first of all, let me just comment on the dog thing.

28:03.020 --> 28:08.460
 There is like conferences on dog cognition from a perspective of people that study psychology,

28:08.460 --> 28:12.340
 cognitive science, neuroscience, dogs are fascinating.

28:12.340 --> 28:15.980
 The way they move their eyes, they're able to, they're the only other animal besides

28:15.980 --> 28:18.880
 humans, they're able to communicate with their eyes.

28:18.880 --> 28:23.300
 They can look at a thing and look back at you and look back at the thing to communicate

28:23.300 --> 28:27.080
 that we're all like through our eyes, communicate that we're collaborating.

28:27.080 --> 28:31.620
 So every other animal uses their eyes to actually look at things.

28:31.620 --> 28:35.420
 The dogs use it to like communicate with you, with us humans.

28:35.420 --> 28:36.420
 It's fascinating.

28:36.420 --> 28:38.620
 There are a lot of other elements of dogs that are amazing.

28:38.620 --> 28:42.900
 Yeah, I mean, if it wasn't for them, they're the ones, they were our first alarm system

28:42.900 --> 28:43.900
 for predators.

28:43.900 --> 28:44.900
 They would defend us.

28:44.900 --> 28:46.420
 I mean, the Basenji is one of the most ancient dogs.

28:46.420 --> 28:49.780
 I mean, they're tiny, but they're fearless and they would chase off lions.

28:49.780 --> 28:54.500
 Like there'd be packs of them and they chase off lions and protect the tribes.

28:54.500 --> 28:59.020
 I even get tingles like thinking about dogs because I have a dog, I love my dog.

28:59.020 --> 29:02.820
 And there's something about when you're walking with your dog off leash in the woods, there's

29:02.820 --> 29:09.180
 something about it that's like, that tugs at that millions of years of evolution, like

29:09.180 --> 29:13.900
 that gut, you know, it's like, I had a Finnish friend of mine, he's a comic, Tommy Valamies

29:13.900 --> 29:18.480
 once told me, he was like, he was like, the gut, he's like, I believe in it.

29:18.480 --> 29:21.860
 Like that gut, you know, when you have that feeling, he's like, always trust that because

29:21.860 --> 29:25.760
 that is million, those are all your ancestors.

29:25.760 --> 29:30.820
 That's the survival instinct of all your ancestors at the beginning of time, you know, telling

29:30.820 --> 29:34.100
 you like, Hey, something's off here, something's, you know, so don't get in the car with Ted

29:34.100 --> 29:38.300
 Bundy is what I'm saying, ladies, how fucking stupid, who, how can you fall for that?

29:38.300 --> 29:40.660
 You know, he's got a fucking sling on, don't get in.

29:40.660 --> 29:41.660
 Yeah.

29:41.660 --> 29:42.660
 Follow the gut.

29:42.660 --> 29:46.260
 My question to you, are psychopaths essentially robots?

29:46.260 --> 29:51.620
 So first of all, let's not, you're using the word robot in a derogatory way that I, I'm

29:51.620 --> 29:52.620
 triggered by.

29:52.620 --> 29:53.620
 Okay.

29:53.620 --> 29:54.620
 So I feel offended.

29:54.620 --> 29:59.420
 You should be because you know what, people are always scared of robots, but I actually,

29:59.420 --> 30:05.180
 I have, I've made the sort of, uh, I, I've made it to say, Hey, I've, I thought about

30:05.180 --> 30:07.660
 it and like robot, robots have been nothing but helpful.

30:07.660 --> 30:09.500
 It's the people we should be scared of.

30:09.500 --> 30:15.180
 Again, we're kind of missing the most destructive thing is us because it's, but robots are helpful.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.020
 I mean, this is a fucking robot.

30:17.020 --> 30:20.480
 You know, I went on hotel tonight, I'm already booked up, you know, I got my, I can change

30:20.480 --> 30:24.580
 my flight if, if this barbecue with Rogan goes 16 hours, which whatever Rogan wants

30:24.580 --> 30:25.580
 to do, I'll do it.

30:25.580 --> 30:29.380
 If he wants to kick me in the chest, I'll let him kick me in the chest, whatever.

30:29.380 --> 30:30.380
 Robots are helpful.

30:30.380 --> 30:31.380
 No?

30:31.380 --> 30:32.380
 Yeah.

30:32.380 --> 30:35.060
 Uh, tanks and autonomous weapons systems don't kill people.

30:35.060 --> 30:36.060
 People kill people.

30:36.060 --> 30:37.060
 Yeah.

30:37.060 --> 30:38.060
 That's yeah.

30:38.060 --> 30:39.060
 Yeah.

30:39.060 --> 30:42.060
 The NRA is about to collect that for you.

30:42.060 --> 30:44.460
 Uh, a lot of love for dogs.

30:44.460 --> 30:45.460
 I appreciate it very much.

30:45.460 --> 30:49.540
 And at the same time, you have the other thing that people seem to have love for, which is

30:49.540 --> 30:50.660
 cats.

30:50.660 --> 30:56.140
 And on the flip side of everything you've said, I'm trying to understand what have cats

30:56.140 --> 30:58.040
 ever done for human civilization?

30:58.040 --> 30:59.420
 They keep rodents away.

30:59.420 --> 31:01.380
 The domesticated cat is very important.

31:01.380 --> 31:02.380
 Keeps the rodents away.

31:02.380 --> 31:03.380
 Yeah.

31:03.380 --> 31:04.380
 That's what they were domesticated for.

31:04.380 --> 31:10.100
 I mean, they're psychopathic killers who ended up killing, uh, innocent, um, neighborhood

31:10.100 --> 31:18.140
 chipmunks and, and birds, uh, they really affect the, uh, the balance of the local ecosystem.

31:18.140 --> 31:22.780
 But if you have love for cats too, not as much as dogs, I mean, dogs are, like you said,

31:22.780 --> 31:23.780
 they look at humans.

31:23.780 --> 31:26.980
 I actually read an article that some people were theorizing they're smarter than chimps

31:26.980 --> 31:29.100
 because of the way they can work with humans.

31:29.100 --> 31:33.860
 And there was one border collie that spoke like 300 words, like a quarter, like a lang,

31:33.860 --> 31:35.500
 almost part of the language.

31:35.500 --> 31:36.780
 And their nose is like a mat.

31:36.780 --> 31:38.380
 I mean, that's like magic, dude.

31:38.380 --> 31:43.340
 If you can smell in my ass to what I had for breakfast from miles away, that's intelligence.

31:43.340 --> 31:44.340
 That's intelligence.

31:44.340 --> 31:48.760
 I mean, in some ways that their nose, if you were to put it on a scale, maybe their nose

31:48.760 --> 31:51.980
 is more intelligent than our brain for what it does.

31:51.980 --> 31:54.940
 You know, it's like, I mean, dude, they can smell you from miles away.

31:54.940 --> 31:57.340
 You ever see a dog just like sniffing, catching?

31:57.340 --> 32:01.900
 I mean, it's smelling like, I don't remember the, the, the date on it, but it's like, they

32:01.900 --> 32:06.340
 have like millions of receptors or something where we only, you know, thank God we don't

32:06.340 --> 32:07.340
 have their nose.

32:07.340 --> 32:13.700
 That would be, that would make sex weird, be a little too intense.

32:13.700 --> 32:18.060
 I think you mentioned when you were talking about Woody Allen separating the, the art

32:18.060 --> 32:19.460
 from the artist.

32:19.460 --> 32:24.780
 So that brings to mind Vladimir Putin.

32:24.780 --> 32:25.780
 How about that transition?

32:25.780 --> 32:26.780
 I don't know.

32:26.780 --> 32:29.140
 I'm so sorry.

32:29.140 --> 32:36.220
 But if you look at just powerful leaders throughout history, Stalin, Hitler, but even modern ones

32:36.220 --> 32:40.580
 like Putin, and we're talking about power.

32:40.580 --> 32:42.280
 How do you explain them?

32:42.280 --> 32:50.580
 You said that power reveals, not corrupts, but do you think there's some element to which

32:50.580 --> 32:55.340
 power corrupted Hitler, power corrupted Stalin after he gained power?

32:55.340 --> 32:56.860
 And the same with Putin.

32:56.860 --> 33:01.780
 When Putin gained power in 2000, do you think the amount of power that he was in possession

33:01.780 --> 33:04.420
 with for many years, do you think that corrupted him?

33:04.420 --> 33:07.900
 I mean, we're joking about dictators get the job done.

33:07.900 --> 33:16.680
 There is some sense in certain countries where a dictator is the only thing that can stabilize

33:16.680 --> 33:19.380
 a nation.

33:19.380 --> 33:24.780
 The counter argument to that for democracies is like, yeah, but that's a short term solution

33:24.780 --> 33:26.140
 for a long term problem.

33:26.140 --> 33:29.140
 So you want to embrace chaos with democracy.

33:29.140 --> 33:30.520
 That might be violent.

33:30.520 --> 33:35.540
 There might be a lot of just constant changing of leadership.

33:35.540 --> 33:42.060
 There might be a lot of corruption in the short term, but if you stay strong with the

33:42.060 --> 33:47.860
 ideals of democracy, then you'll be ultimately create something that as beautiful and stable

33:47.860 --> 33:51.580
 as the United States.

33:51.580 --> 33:55.660
 The sad thing is, is I don't know if history tells that story.

33:55.660 --> 33:59.740
 It's like I said, you look at Greece, you look at Rome, democracy kind of failed.

33:59.740 --> 34:07.460
 The majority of Rome, the most successful empire that we've had, was a dictatorship

34:07.460 --> 34:10.760
 for most of its run.

34:10.760 --> 34:14.460
 But I do believe in a republic, which is sort of a limited democracy.

34:14.460 --> 34:17.060
 I do believe in what we have here.

34:17.060 --> 34:18.060
 I believe in common law.

34:18.060 --> 34:23.700
 I believe in individual rights.

34:23.700 --> 34:26.580
 But yeah, I think you said it.

34:26.580 --> 34:27.580
 Nobody could have said it better.

34:27.580 --> 34:28.580
 Yeah.

34:28.580 --> 34:29.580
 It's a short term solution.

34:29.580 --> 34:35.840
 You look at Saddam Hussein, he kind of, when we took him out, then there was a lot of infighting

34:35.840 --> 34:43.100
 that happened that he was kind of keeping at bay because he was a strong man, dictator.

34:43.100 --> 34:46.220
 Well, he's an interesting one, sorry to interrupt.

34:46.220 --> 34:50.140
 From my understanding, I'm sure people will correct me, but when Saddam Hussein first

34:50.140 --> 34:54.720
 came to power, he was, he's quite progressive.

34:54.720 --> 35:03.200
 So like the, as far as I understand, the signs of an evil dictator weren't exactly there.

35:03.200 --> 35:07.340
 So again, there's, I don't know if power revealed or power corrupted.

35:07.340 --> 35:11.280
 Or that could have been the initial subterfuge to kind of get everybody, you know, Hitler

35:11.280 --> 35:13.260
 also is a champion of the people.

35:13.260 --> 35:14.260
 It's built some new roads.

35:14.260 --> 35:15.880
 It's with psychopaths too.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.060
 And that's why it's interesting to me.

35:17.060 --> 35:20.460
 I'm not sure if power corrupts psychopaths.

35:20.460 --> 35:23.720
 And now that we know that we can do these CAT scans and brain scans, we know that they're

35:23.720 --> 35:25.760
 born that way.

35:25.760 --> 35:33.640
 Power definitely corrupts people who have the capacity to feel and for empathy.

35:33.640 --> 35:34.640
 Power I'm not sure.

35:34.640 --> 35:41.340
 I don't think power corrupts people who were born psychopathic with that condition or sociopaths

35:41.340 --> 35:46.680
 who had, who, you know, who were closer to psychopath and then had some traumatic life.

35:46.680 --> 35:52.220
 You know, I just think, you know, the best way to get away with whatever nefarious thing

35:52.220 --> 35:56.400
 you want to do to feel, I guess the only thing psychopaths can feel is that excitement, is

35:56.400 --> 35:58.960
 to pretend to be the opposite of what you are.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.720
 That's what, that's what killers do.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.720
 That's what the worst people, look at Bill Cosby.

36:02.720 --> 36:08.720
 I mean, he was, what better way to hide, you know, it's like what wokeness is now.

36:08.720 --> 36:11.880
 It's like, I'm such a great person and then you're like, are you?

36:11.880 --> 36:16.140
 It's a great, the best way to hide is to pretend to be the opposite of what you are.

36:16.140 --> 36:17.140
 Just like Ted Bundy.

36:17.140 --> 36:18.840
 I'm just an innocent, helpful guy.

36:18.840 --> 36:21.540
 And then boom, next thing you know, you're getting your tit bit off.

36:21.540 --> 36:22.640
 That's really well said.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.820
 It's actually kind of funny because I talk about love a lot.

36:25.820 --> 36:32.180
 And I think the people that kind of look at me with squinty eyes, they wonder like how

36:32.180 --> 36:35.280
 many bodies are in that closet, you know what I mean?

36:35.280 --> 36:40.320
 Like there's something about the duality of like, we're so skeptical as a culture.

36:40.320 --> 36:48.000
 Like if somebody is just like, seems to be kind of, sort of, I don't know, positive and

36:48.000 --> 36:50.960
 all that kind of, you know, how do I put it?

36:50.960 --> 36:55.320
 Just simple, simple minded in the positivity they express.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.960
 They think like, okay, there's some demons in there.

36:57.960 --> 36:58.960
 Yeah.

36:58.960 --> 37:01.520
 Especially if you're a New Yorker, we don't trust any, the nicer you are, the more skeptical

37:01.520 --> 37:02.520
 we are.

37:02.520 --> 37:03.520
 Yeah.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.520
 I've struggled with that down here.

37:04.520 --> 37:07.480
 And they're like, nah, dude, just, I wanted to show you the best tacos, man.

37:07.480 --> 37:10.040
 And I'm like, did you really, what do you want?

37:10.040 --> 37:13.240
 Because in New York, it's like, if anyone's nice to you, they want something.

37:13.240 --> 37:18.000
 And that's, the pro side to that is it makes you very street smart.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.640
 The downside to that is it makes you way too cynical.

37:20.640 --> 37:21.640
 Yeah.

37:21.640 --> 37:26.080
 I've definitely experienced that here in Texas, but people are super, super nice.

37:26.080 --> 37:32.520
 And they're like, do all this cool shit for you and you wonder, what's the angle?

37:32.520 --> 37:33.520
 What are we doing here?

37:33.520 --> 37:35.720
 You mentioned hyenas as your favorite animal.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.760
 I forgot to ask you, what the hell were you thinking?

37:39.760 --> 37:41.640
 Why is a hyena is your favorite animal?

37:41.640 --> 37:42.640
 Yeah.

37:42.640 --> 37:45.560
 It's a fascinating animal.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.080
 Let's look at the whole animal kingdom.

37:47.080 --> 37:52.960
 Like why is it, where do you put, so you like dogs, love my favorite, your favorite is dogs,

37:52.960 --> 37:56.680
 but they're kind of outside the animal kingdom because you're thinking about wolves.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.480
 So the animal kingdom is in nature.

37:59.480 --> 38:00.960
 Dogs escaped nature.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.520
 They kind of did.

38:02.520 --> 38:06.120
 Uh, together with humans, like in a collaborative way, exactly.

38:06.120 --> 38:11.400
 So within nature, within the animal kingdom, what, who's, uh, why not lions?

38:11.400 --> 38:14.320
 Because lions are predictable.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.920
 Lions are just, you know, they're regal and kind of, they bore me.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.180
 It's like the hot chick.

38:18.180 --> 38:19.640
 It's like, we get it.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.640
 You were born the best.

38:21.640 --> 38:22.640
 Yeah.

38:22.640 --> 38:28.240
 You know, I like a scrappy, by any means necessary, intelligent and cunning.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.280
 But aren't they dishonest?

38:30.280 --> 38:31.280
 Yeah.

38:31.280 --> 38:33.440
 And that's why I like them.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.440
 Yes.

38:34.440 --> 38:35.440
 They're dishonest.

38:35.440 --> 38:36.440
 They employ chicanery.

38:36.440 --> 38:42.360
 They, uh, they're, and that's just a sign of how intelligent they are and how self reliant

38:42.360 --> 38:44.720
 they are and how brutal they are.

38:44.720 --> 38:50.120
 Um, they're brutally honest in how much they lie, you know, because it's just, they're

38:50.120 --> 38:52.000
 trying to get the job done.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.680
 You know, lions are just like, they're, they're too gifted.

38:55.680 --> 38:59.520
 Everyone hates the fucking, you know, if I went to school with you, I'd be like, of course,

38:59.520 --> 39:00.520
 Lex knows the fucking answer.

39:00.520 --> 39:01.520
 Yeah.

39:01.520 --> 39:02.520
 Lex was born smarter than me.

39:02.520 --> 39:03.520
 Yeah.

39:03.520 --> 39:06.560
 You know, and you'd probably hate me because I was the kid always seeking attention and

39:06.560 --> 39:09.320
 making people, it's like, that's not interesting.

39:09.320 --> 39:12.560
 The guy that claws his way to the top and those are hyenas.

39:12.560 --> 39:16.120
 They're also fascinating just by, uh, merely who they are.

39:16.120 --> 39:19.560
 I mean, they're not related to any other animal.

39:19.560 --> 39:23.520
 They're more closely related to cats than they are dogs, even though they look like

39:23.520 --> 39:24.520
 a dog.

39:24.520 --> 39:25.520
 Yeah.

39:25.520 --> 39:28.760
 They're, but they're very, like very tangentially related even to cats.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.840
 So they're their own kind of thing, which is kind of mysterious.

39:31.840 --> 39:36.440
 I don't think they fully figured out and uh, they, the pseudo penis thing is the, is the,

39:36.440 --> 39:37.440
 I mean,

39:37.440 --> 39:38.440
 Can you explain the pseudo penis?

39:38.440 --> 39:39.440
 Yeah.

39:39.440 --> 39:42.080
 So the, it's a matriarchal society by the way.

39:42.080 --> 39:46.320
 So that's the unique in and of itself that this, we're talking about an apex predator

39:46.320 --> 39:49.980
 that is a matriarchal, much like, uh, you know, the praying mantis.

39:49.980 --> 39:51.380
 It's very rare though.

39:51.380 --> 39:55.920
 And they are fucking brutal and vicious and the women are bigger and they let their cubs

39:55.920 --> 39:59.800
 fight, a lot of fratricide and they do that because they're like, Hey, you're weaker.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.560
 I let your brother kill you.

40:01.560 --> 40:05.760
 And uh, the women have penises, the women have pseudo penises that they give birth out

40:05.760 --> 40:10.600
 of and the birth is violent, but they, they roll around with just huge pieces.

40:10.600 --> 40:15.600
 They're glue guns are just fucking swinging, you know, and the women are just run the show

40:15.600 --> 40:21.800
 and uh, it's just cool that they have these pseudo penises.

40:21.800 --> 40:23.360
 It's almost romantic the way you describe it.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.440
 They have the strongest bite force.

40:25.440 --> 40:26.840
 They they pulverize bone.

40:26.840 --> 40:29.480
 Like when they eat an animal, the animal's gone.

40:29.480 --> 40:30.660
 There's no bones.

40:30.660 --> 40:31.800
 They eat everything.

40:31.800 --> 40:34.480
 They can pulverize their bite is so powerful.

40:34.480 --> 40:36.720
 They pulverize bone and eat it.

40:36.720 --> 40:40.360
 So if they consume an animal, it, the animal was there and then the animal's gone.

40:40.360 --> 40:44.280
 There's no nothing for the vultures there to, uh, to, to, to grab.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.280
 Yeah.

40:45.280 --> 40:50.240
 I'm going to have to revisit the hyenas because my experience with the heinous was from, uh,

40:50.240 --> 40:57.520
 first of all, history is your show, uh, has rebranded them for me, but, uh, the lion king,

40:57.520 --> 41:05.200
 which is, uh, a cartoon, I guess, that, uh, I get emotional at every time I, I hope that

41:05.200 --> 41:09.640
 probably a father issues, every guy probably just, you just have feelings.

41:09.640 --> 41:10.640
 You're a good guy.

41:10.640 --> 41:11.640
 I mean, everyone has feelings.

41:11.640 --> 41:12.640
 Yeah.

41:12.640 --> 41:13.640
 Yeah.

41:13.640 --> 41:14.640
 That one gets everybody.

41:14.640 --> 41:15.640
 I don't know.

41:15.640 --> 41:20.120
 I get, I get every father son movie, like blow with Johnny Depp, uh, and, uh, really

41:20.120 --> 41:21.120
 Yoda.

41:21.120 --> 41:22.120
 Damn.

41:22.120 --> 41:23.120
 That's a good movie.

41:23.120 --> 41:29.560
 And whenever there's like, um, like the disappointment in the father that his son has become like

41:29.560 --> 41:36.040
 this incredibly successful drug lord that then ends up with nothing in, in, in prison,

41:36.040 --> 41:41.120
 uh, just the sadness of them communicating through letters, man, it gets me every time,

41:41.120 --> 41:47.120
 but, but, you know, uh, there, the hyenas are not presented that well in that, um,

41:47.120 --> 41:50.040
 No, they're usually portrayed as like, uh, it's, it's really, it's, it's, it's, it's

41:50.040 --> 41:53.400
 really sad that they're portrayed that way as lions.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.120
 Like lions aren't dicks.

41:55.120 --> 41:56.120
 Lions are dicks.

41:56.120 --> 42:00.900
 They, the, the, the, the alpha lions will kill the cubs of another rival.

42:00.900 --> 42:02.560
 They do all types of dick shit.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.560
 Yeah.

42:03.560 --> 42:06.120
 And, um, yeah, it's, uh, the hyenas are more interesting.

42:06.120 --> 42:10.440
 Like they'll just roll in like a hyena will like, like you said, the lie, you know, cause

42:10.440 --> 42:13.880
 when you watch the Serengeti, you know, animals will hang out with each other.

42:13.880 --> 42:15.320
 They're like by water.

42:15.320 --> 42:20.680
 So one hyena will just kind of roll in and pretend like it's not hungry and then bang.

42:20.680 --> 42:23.840
 They'll use any means necessary to take an animal down.

42:23.840 --> 42:26.760
 Like lions will just use brute strength.

42:26.760 --> 42:31.080
 Hyenas use cunning and you can even go on the internet and find, uh, memes of this where

42:31.080 --> 42:35.820
 hyenas will grab the big animal by the balls and just like, we'll sneak up behind it and

42:35.820 --> 42:37.000
 bite its balls.

42:37.000 --> 42:42.040
 And you'll watch an animal 10 size, 10 times the size of the hyena just slowly go down.

42:42.040 --> 42:44.760
 It's brutal, but it's fucking hilarious.

42:44.760 --> 42:51.960
 So I, I think that's, uh, I don't know if you follow the channel, um, nature's metal

42:51.960 --> 42:56.040
 that, that one weighs heavy on me.

42:56.040 --> 43:03.740
 Um, with the hyenas on the balls, I it's tough to, to intellectualize it.

43:03.740 --> 43:11.000
 It's tough to think that the entirety of life on earth has this history of, uh, predators

43:11.000 --> 43:17.240
 being violent, just like just the murder that we come from.

43:17.240 --> 43:18.240
 It's crazy.

43:18.240 --> 43:23.860
 I, it, uh, just like when we're talking about meditating on death, I actually, I keep following

43:23.860 --> 43:28.040
 and unfollowing that Instagram channel because like sometimes it's too much.

43:28.040 --> 43:32.880
 Like I can't, I can't continue with the day after like seeing the brutality, the honest

43:32.880 --> 43:34.880
 brutality of that.

43:34.880 --> 43:36.580
 I don't know how to make sense of it.

43:36.580 --> 43:40.200
 It's important to acknowledge, I think, cause that it's real and we do come from that.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.800
 We are, we evolve from that.

43:42.800 --> 43:43.800
 It's important.

43:43.800 --> 43:44.800
 We still do that.

43:44.800 --> 43:45.800
 We're just hidden from it.

43:45.800 --> 43:48.960
 You know, when you go to the supermarket and get your slab of meat, you know, you're so

43:48.960 --> 43:51.760
 disconnected from where that meat came from.

43:51.760 --> 43:57.460
 It came from that and often that's uglier to watch than because there's some honesty,

43:57.460 --> 44:02.020
 you know, the, the, the, the nature channels only show, uh, that's why we have so much

44:02.020 --> 44:03.380
 sympathy with the prey.

44:03.380 --> 44:06.380
 And this is where I think the same thing with mafia movies, they don't show what the mafia

44:06.380 --> 44:07.380
 really does.

44:07.380 --> 44:08.420
 They glorify the good parts.

44:08.420 --> 44:11.720
 That's why I like state of grace cause it's really just shaking down old people and fucking

44:11.720 --> 44:12.720
 being dicks.

44:12.720 --> 44:16.400
 It's not driving nice cars and being like, you know, so, and, and animal channels do

44:16.400 --> 44:17.400
 the same thing.

44:17.400 --> 44:22.160
 They only show when the cheetah gets it because that's, that's the exciting part.

44:22.160 --> 44:27.840
 But what most people don't know is that those predators strike out almost always a majority

44:27.840 --> 44:30.000
 of the time, the prey wins.

44:30.000 --> 44:35.400
 And so if you saw that and put it in context, you might not hate it as much when the predator

44:35.400 --> 44:39.560
 actually gets the little fawn or whatever, because it's so many fawns got away.

44:39.560 --> 44:42.000
 It's so hard to capture your prey.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.680
 And you know, we, we don't have the, the, the, they no, no documentary is going to sit

44:46.680 --> 44:51.720
 around and show you the 99 times the cheetah didn't catch.

44:51.720 --> 44:52.720
 Thank you for this perspective.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.000
 It's murder is difficult.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.920
 So like this is the, they never talk about for people who murder how difficult that is

44:59.920 --> 45:05.000
 like to trap somebody, to convince them to come back to your place, give it some respect,

45:05.000 --> 45:06.560
 put some respect on Ted Bundy's name.

45:06.560 --> 45:07.560
 Yeah.

45:07.560 --> 45:11.500
 It's not easy to convince somebody to get in your Volkswagen Beagle and, and the cleanup.

45:11.500 --> 45:15.280
 And then you have to kind of plan ahead because you want to keep doing the murder, mass murder.

45:15.280 --> 45:19.240
 You gotta learn how to saw them up, put them in duffel bags, bury, you gotta learn to dig,

45:19.240 --> 45:20.240
 you gotta learn how to hide.

45:20.240 --> 45:21.240
 You gotta learn to lie.

45:21.240 --> 45:25.360
 I mean, it's a lot that goes into it that we need to put a little respect on.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.360
 Yeah.

45:26.360 --> 45:27.360
 Yeah.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.520
 And you have to figure out which tools work the best for the sawing and all those kinds

45:29.520 --> 45:30.520
 of things.

45:30.520 --> 45:33.400
 Um, um, so thank you for the perspective.

45:33.400 --> 45:38.400
 That's what I was hoping we would bring to this table.

45:38.400 --> 45:42.640
 So you, um, uh, you got a little bit Greek in you.

45:42.640 --> 45:50.880
 Uh, one of the episodes on, on a history hyenas, you talked about the battle of Crete where

45:50.880 --> 45:58.800
 the Greeks, your people in, uh, uh, in 19, I guess 41 and the early stages of the world

45:58.800 --> 46:02.640
 war II, there's one of the most epic battles of the war.

46:02.640 --> 46:09.560
 Uh, in fact, in 1941 in a speech made at the Reichstag, Hitler paid tribute to the bravery

46:09.560 --> 46:15.880
 of the Greek saying, it must be said, uh, for the sake of historical truth that amongst

46:15.880 --> 46:22.880
 all our opponents, only the Greeks fought with the endless courage and defiance of death.

46:22.880 --> 46:23.880
 So okay.

46:23.880 --> 46:24.880
 What do you make of this battle?

46:24.880 --> 46:27.220
 What do you make of the spirit of the Greek people?

46:27.220 --> 46:33.080
 This is one of the closest things to me because my mother was actually on the island of Crete

46:33.080 --> 46:35.920
 during this, the first aerial invasion in history.

46:35.920 --> 46:37.320
 A lot of people don't know that.

46:37.320 --> 46:39.400
 So this is a very significant battle.

46:39.400 --> 46:44.800
 Um, first time there was an invasion from the sky, um, and, uh, my mother was a little

46:44.800 --> 46:48.340
 girl and she lived through four years of a Nazi occupation there.

46:48.340 --> 46:51.880
 So my mother was a human rights lawyer and everything, but she just always hated Germans.

46:51.880 --> 46:53.240
 It's just what it is.

46:53.240 --> 46:55.400
 She hated Germans and she never got over it.

46:55.400 --> 46:59.120
 So the most progressive, open minded woman just could not get over this.

46:59.120 --> 47:04.440
 Um, it's a monumental battle that a lot of historians in retrospect have now looked back

47:04.440 --> 47:10.320
 on and said, because the Nazis, first off, you got to take it back to when Hitler instructed

47:10.320 --> 47:11.320
 Mussolini.

47:11.320 --> 47:12.320
 Cause let's be honest, Mussolini was Hitler's bitch.

47:12.320 --> 47:13.320
 You know what I mean?

47:13.320 --> 47:17.480
 It was like, if it, well, you know, if it was fantasy island, Hitler was the fucking

47:17.480 --> 47:19.720
 and the, and Mussolini was boss, the plane.

47:19.720 --> 47:25.260
 Mussolini ever say no to Hitler or even maybe it's always like, yes, yes, yes, we will do

47:25.260 --> 47:26.260
 it.

47:26.260 --> 47:29.320
 And, uh, it's like, yeah, it takes, you have to take Greece.

47:29.320 --> 47:37.160
 And so, um, yeah, so Italy being much bigger than Greece, Greece is a tiny country, nine,

47:37.160 --> 47:38.160
 10 million.

47:38.160 --> 47:45.080
 So Italy invaded Greece, um, you know, um, and Aukey day's a big, it's a big holiday

47:45.080 --> 47:46.080
 for Greeks.

47:46.080 --> 47:52.960
 And this speaks to the spirit Greeks in fight until we have a common enemy and then we unite,

47:52.960 --> 47:58.440
 you see it throughout history, Sparta and Athens, you see it in Greek families where

47:58.440 --> 47:59.440
 the brothers will fight.

47:59.440 --> 48:03.940
 But then as soon as we have a common enemy, we unite and maybe it's an overactive brain.

48:03.940 --> 48:07.720
 We think too much, our traditions, philosophy, and we overthink things and we fight with

48:07.720 --> 48:10.880
 each other and take things personally, we're ultra passionate.

48:10.880 --> 48:17.040
 But when Italy said, Hey, we're going to move troops through, you know, uh, a Greek said

48:17.040 --> 48:23.320
 Aukey, which means no, and that was, um, and then Italy attacked and, uh, we beat the shit

48:23.320 --> 48:24.320
 out of them.

48:24.320 --> 48:28.600
 A much bigger country, much, uh, more well equipped country.

48:28.600 --> 48:32.680
 Greece beat the shit of them, kicked them back into Albania, actually not only repelled

48:32.680 --> 48:36.520
 them, actually like conquered some ground in Albania, pushed them back.

48:36.520 --> 48:41.400
 And then Hitler was like, fuck, you know, I was planning my March to Russia, uh, but

48:41.400 --> 48:45.120
 I have to go down because he basically said to Mussolini, like, you know, you're basically

48:45.120 --> 48:46.120
 bitch slapped.

48:46.120 --> 48:49.400
 I'm like, I got to do this myself because you're such a fucking bitch.

48:49.400 --> 48:51.160
 So then the Nazis invaded Greece.

48:51.160 --> 48:54.080
 Obviously they took the mainland with fight and shot out.

48:54.080 --> 48:57.200
 The Greeks never give credit to the British and New Zealand and Australian troops that

48:57.200 --> 48:58.200
 were there.

48:58.200 --> 49:03.040
 You know, they were a large part of this, the majority of it, but the Greeks fight dude,

49:03.040 --> 49:04.040
 civilians.

49:04.040 --> 49:07.680
 I mean, they fought, you know, the Ottomans were there 400 years.

49:07.680 --> 49:08.680
 You go to Greece.

49:08.680 --> 49:09.680
 Now there's no evidence.

49:09.680 --> 49:13.640
 There's virtually no evidence of them ever being there.

49:13.640 --> 49:14.800
 That's the Greek spirit.

49:14.800 --> 49:17.320
 Kick them out and we kicked out hummus too.

49:17.320 --> 49:18.960
 So it's like their culture's gone.

49:18.960 --> 49:19.960
 You're gone.

49:19.960 --> 49:21.960
 Cause Greeks are, uh, it's philoptimo.

49:21.960 --> 49:22.960
 It's called philoptimo.

49:22.960 --> 49:23.960
 And it's a real thing.

49:23.960 --> 49:26.440
 Philoptimo is a, it's very little translate.

49:26.440 --> 49:33.000
 You can't translate it, but it's kind of like honor, loyalty, friendship, uh, altruism.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.520
 It's a, it's, you can't define it, but Greeks know it and we're taught it from our, from

49:36.520 --> 49:38.700
 our, uh, families.

49:38.700 --> 49:39.700
 It's a vibe, man.

49:39.700 --> 49:43.760
 It's a Greek cultural thing and we're an old culture and philoptimo is what it's called

49:43.760 --> 49:44.920
 philoptimo.

49:44.920 --> 49:50.440
 And it's, um, it's love, it's passion and it comes out and it comes out.

49:50.440 --> 49:57.300
 And so, um, so Hitler had to postpone his invasion of, um, of, uh, Russia went down

49:57.300 --> 50:01.060
 the island of Crete took 10 days to conquer.

50:01.060 --> 50:07.200
 It's an island to put that in perspective, the country of France fell in three or four

50:07.200 --> 50:08.200
 days.

50:08.200 --> 50:09.340
 I can't even remember cause they fucking just rolled over.

50:09.340 --> 50:10.340
 So what is it?

50:10.340 --> 50:13.400
 What does a couple of hours matter when you're that much of a fucking pussy?

50:13.400 --> 50:14.400
 Okay.

50:14.400 --> 50:19.480
 What is a couple out in 12 hour fucking three or four days, the island of Crete took the

50:19.480 --> 50:22.300
 Germans 10 days to conquer.

50:22.300 --> 50:28.100
 And because of that, and because of the Greek resistance, Hitler had to postpone his invasion

50:28.100 --> 50:29.760
 of Russia to winter.

50:29.760 --> 50:34.360
 And of course that was, you know, that was his downfall just as it was Napoleon's and

50:34.360 --> 50:37.060
 a never dude, never try to invade Russia.

50:37.060 --> 50:39.020
 They got millions of people to throw at death.

50:39.020 --> 50:42.200
 Every time you read about Russians in history books, like, and a million died.

50:42.200 --> 50:46.300
 I mean, it's like, you just guys throw millions of people at the problem and don't fuck with

50:46.300 --> 50:50.100
 that Russian winter and don't fuck with Russian people, dude, they're tough.

50:50.100 --> 50:53.500
 People in New York know that you don't go to fucking sheep set bay and start talking

50:53.500 --> 50:54.500
 shit.

50:54.500 --> 50:56.620
 You'll end up in a fucking car trunk and they'll brutally murder you.

50:56.620 --> 50:58.620
 I do not fuck with Russians.

50:58.620 --> 50:59.620
 Amen.

50:59.620 --> 51:03.180
 And then there's a, I mean, there's a lot of people, a lot of historians argue that

51:03.180 --> 51:07.740
 that battle was because of the Russian winter because of delaying the Russian invasion,

51:07.740 --> 51:10.380
 but also psychologically delaying the invasion.

51:10.380 --> 51:17.020
 It was the first time, I think it was the first time the Germans failed, not, or didn't

51:17.020 --> 51:23.120
 succeed like they wanted to early in the war, which is a little like psychologically the

51:23.120 --> 51:26.700
 impact of that I think is immeasurable.

51:26.700 --> 51:33.220
 And also a lot of people argue from a military strategy perspective that the, just like you

51:33.220 --> 51:39.800
 said, it was an aerial attack and that Hitler didn't think that the, that kind of attack

51:39.800 --> 51:42.300
 would then be useful for the rest of the war.

51:42.300 --> 51:47.380
 So that's, that's a really part where, whereas it might've been very useful.

51:47.380 --> 51:51.700
 So it's a, it's really interesting how these little battles can steer the directions of

51:51.700 --> 51:52.700
 war.

51:52.700 --> 51:57.780
 Of course, me growing up in the Soviet Union, we didn't hear much about this battle.

51:57.780 --> 52:00.020
 Just like you said, millions of Soviets died.

52:00.020 --> 52:03.900
 All those people in history that you read about dying, those are all civilians, but

52:03.900 --> 52:08.860
 I mean, not all, but a very large number of them are civilians and their stories, obviously

52:08.860 --> 52:15.060
 that's the rooted, the literature, the poetry, the music, just the way people talk, the way

52:15.060 --> 52:20.360
 they drink vodka, the way they love, the way they hate, the way they fear.

52:20.360 --> 52:24.260
 That's all like rooted in World War II and World War I.

52:24.260 --> 52:32.020
 And so, but we never kind of think about Europe and we certainly, growing up, didn't think

52:32.020 --> 52:34.220
 about their role in the United States.

52:34.220 --> 52:39.220
 All this, there's plenty of stories of heroism in the Soviet Union, enough to, enough for

52:39.220 --> 52:40.220
 many lifetimes.

52:40.220 --> 52:45.580
 So, but it was fascinating to read from a Greek perspective, cause I, you know, I don't

52:45.580 --> 52:50.860
 have many Greek friends, I hope you didn't change that.

52:50.860 --> 52:54.540
 This is the beginning of a love affair of your people.

52:54.540 --> 52:55.540
 Yeah.

52:55.540 --> 52:59.620
 But likewise, the Americans don't hear about the Soviet contribution to the end of World

52:59.620 --> 53:04.820
 War II because obviously we became, you know, enemies after that because of the two systems.

53:04.820 --> 53:08.500
 But yeah, without the Russians, World War II wouldn't have been won either.

53:08.500 --> 53:09.500
 Yeah.

53:09.500 --> 53:10.500
 The stories are written by the victors.

53:10.500 --> 53:11.500
 That's really interesting.

53:11.500 --> 53:16.420
 I, just looking at the, at history, you wonder what's missing.

53:16.420 --> 53:21.020
 I'll tell you what's missing that I know for a fact, cause my dad told, my dad told me

53:21.020 --> 53:23.740
 combat's hell and he would tell me the reality of what it's really like.

53:23.740 --> 53:28.020
 Guys pissing themselves, calling for their mother, the fog of war, obviously, fratricide

53:28.020 --> 53:29.020
 happens all the time.

53:29.020 --> 53:30.020
 It's pandemonium.

53:30.020 --> 53:33.900
 I mean, there's skill involved, but I mean, there's no, like it's a lot of it is just

53:33.900 --> 53:34.900
 luck.

53:34.900 --> 53:39.020
 My dad said, he, my dad won three, he got, you know, medals, braille, purple hearts,

53:39.020 --> 53:40.020
 all that shit.

53:40.020 --> 53:42.300
 And he said, the reason was, is cause you can't, he always said, this is another thing.

53:42.300 --> 53:44.940
 He told me, you can't pin a medal on a dead guy.

53:44.940 --> 53:47.940
 So it's like, those are the guys who deserve it, but you can't pin a medal.

53:47.940 --> 53:55.020
 You can't do the pomp and, and I'll tell you one thing is that it is written by the victors

53:55.020 --> 53:57.500
 and all these leaders, they say we're in the front.

53:57.500 --> 53:58.900
 We're not in the front.

53:58.900 --> 53:59.900
 We're not in the front.

53:59.900 --> 54:02.260
 Whenever the history books say he led his troops into battle.

54:02.260 --> 54:06.100
 It's like, did he really, did he, so then how did he live?

54:06.100 --> 54:09.380
 Cause they put like kids in the front, you know, it's like nobody limps back from the

54:09.380 --> 54:15.980
 front with like a injury, you know, that's, that's army PR, you know, whenever you read,

54:15.980 --> 54:20.140
 you know, 27 soldiers died, 14 were injured.

54:20.140 --> 54:21.940
 The word injured is PR.

54:21.940 --> 54:22.940
 That's like injured.

54:22.940 --> 54:25.100
 Was he, did he sprain his ankle?

54:25.100 --> 54:28.860
 Did he need, did he get carried off the court or, you know, he was maimed.

54:28.860 --> 54:34.300
 I mean, he was like, his leg was blown off, you know, it's like, so, uh, I think that,

54:34.300 --> 54:37.180
 you know, Alexander the Great was just kind of in the back on his horse and just kind

54:37.180 --> 54:40.940
 of, he had his eunuch blow him a few times and he was like, is it bad up there?

54:40.940 --> 54:43.940
 And then like after that he was like, okay, my scribe, give me my scribe.

54:43.940 --> 54:44.940
 Okay.

54:44.940 --> 54:46.180
 When you write this down, can you put me in the front?

54:46.180 --> 54:47.180
 Yeah.

54:47.180 --> 54:50.660
 And I was just making me a big hero and I was in there and then he, you know, he just

54:50.660 --> 54:54.460
 blew his, you know, he had sex with his eunuch and rode off into the sunset because there's

54:54.460 --> 54:57.220
 just no way you survive in the front, especially warfare back then.

54:57.220 --> 54:59.140
 I mean, it's like brutal.

54:59.140 --> 55:02.820
 Then again, you have like, uh, Genghis Khan.

55:02.820 --> 55:07.340
 The sense I got that he was a little bit up on the front, at least the first.

55:07.340 --> 55:08.340
 Yeah.

55:08.340 --> 55:09.340
 Or is that also, is he a little bit Alexander the Great?

55:09.340 --> 55:10.340
 Give me my scribe.

55:10.340 --> 55:11.340
 Yeah.

55:11.340 --> 55:12.340
 It's all lore.

55:12.340 --> 55:13.880
 I mean, you ever play the game of telephone?

55:13.880 --> 55:16.900
 You know, it's like, you know, there's no video cameras back then.

55:16.900 --> 55:21.700
 So shit just get, turns into myth, you know, and, uh, there's no way he was in the front.

55:21.700 --> 55:23.660
 There's no way he wouldn't have lived.

55:23.660 --> 55:28.540
 You know, he was probably good on horseback cause those, those dudes were good on horseback.

55:28.540 --> 55:30.220
 But it was like game of Thrones back then.

55:30.220 --> 55:33.780
 You had all these different people and they kind of, yeah, the, the, the Mongols were

55:33.780 --> 55:34.780
 wild dude.

55:34.780 --> 55:39.020
 They are actually said like, um, they started like they were more adaptable to the horse

55:39.020 --> 55:43.340
 because they were so good on horseback that kids started to be born like kind of bow legged

55:43.340 --> 55:44.500
 like to fit the horse.

55:44.500 --> 55:45.500
 It's wild.

55:45.500 --> 55:47.620
 And they would stretch their heads and shit like that.

55:47.620 --> 55:49.020
 They wrap them and stretch their heads.

55:49.020 --> 55:56.100
 So they find like Mongol skulls and they look like cone heads and they were brutal and vicious

55:56.100 --> 56:00.740
 and they would maraud and rape and all the fun stuff that, you know, when, you know,

56:00.740 --> 56:04.300
 when you visit other places back then, there's no tchotchke stops and souvenir shops.

56:04.300 --> 56:08.580
 What you do is you take women and those are the tokens, you know, you burn a few huts

56:08.580 --> 56:10.340
 different.

56:10.340 --> 56:11.980
 Tourism was different back then.

56:11.980 --> 56:12.980
 Yeah.

56:12.980 --> 56:15.940
 That's another difficult thing.

56:15.940 --> 56:21.060
 So we're talking about nature and predators to think about the long stretch of history

56:21.060 --> 56:28.780
 where we're just murder and we made so much progress, I guess, in the past couple of centuries.

56:28.780 --> 56:31.380
 The United States is a shining example of that.

56:31.380 --> 56:35.740
 But do you think also that it's that effect that we were, a lot of good things had to

56:35.740 --> 56:37.980
 happen too or else we wouldn't be here.

56:37.980 --> 56:42.780
 So do we just focus, isn't it like a car crash effect that like we're, you know, the rubber

56:42.780 --> 56:46.300
 neck that everyone pulls over to see a car crash, are we just only focusing on the negative

56:46.300 --> 56:48.660
 things of history because they're just more exciting to us?

56:48.660 --> 56:51.420
 Like it's just not, it's boring to be like, yeah, and then there was a bunch of villagers

56:51.420 --> 56:55.020
 and they ate every day and danced and loved.

56:55.020 --> 56:56.020
 Yeah.

56:56.020 --> 57:01.740
 I wonder, I wonder how different those people were, you know, like they might've had the

57:01.740 --> 57:09.580
 same exact loves and fears and like they perhaps had the same kind of brilliant ideas in their

57:09.580 --> 57:11.220
 head, if not more brilliant.

57:11.220 --> 57:16.300
 And we kind of think about like this moment in history is like the most special moment.

57:16.300 --> 57:20.420
 Like we're doing the coolest shit that we're doing the most amazing building and most amazing

57:20.420 --> 57:21.420
 things.

57:21.420 --> 57:25.620
 But maybe they were building amazing things in their different way with like less technological,

57:25.620 --> 57:30.260
 but in the space of ideas, in the space of just all the different, the camaraderie and

57:30.260 --> 57:35.260
 the space of like concepts, mathematics, all those kinds of things.

57:35.260 --> 57:36.260
 Yeah.

57:36.260 --> 57:37.940
 I mean, Greece, you look at the architecture, it still stands up.

57:37.940 --> 57:42.780
 I mean, all the government, but it's still arguably, I mean, as far as objective beauty,

57:42.780 --> 57:47.060
 it's hard to argue that Greco Roman, it's just something about it with the, with the

57:47.060 --> 57:48.060
 columns.

57:48.060 --> 57:50.420
 It's just, it's powerful.

57:50.420 --> 57:54.340
 It's I don't know, even Ayn Rand would probably appreciate it.

57:54.340 --> 57:59.220
 She doesn't, no, no, no.

57:59.220 --> 58:04.380
 So in your history, hyenas that unfortunately has come to an end, we're talking about empires

58:04.380 --> 58:08.340
 coming to an end, all empires fall.

58:08.340 --> 58:11.620
 That one, it may rise again.

58:11.620 --> 58:12.620
 Empires might rise again.

58:12.620 --> 58:13.620
 Who knows?

58:13.620 --> 58:14.620
 Who knows?

58:14.620 --> 58:20.580
 I, I'm obviously a fan, so I hope it does rise again, but you've seemed to develop your

58:20.580 --> 58:22.500
 own language.

58:22.500 --> 58:26.580
 Can you, you know, it's what it is.

58:26.580 --> 58:28.500
 What is, what is that?

58:28.500 --> 58:34.220
 What the hell, is this some kind of medical condition or can you, can you explain like

58:34.220 --> 58:39.900
 the linguistic essentials that catch us up to the linguistic essentials that people need

58:39.900 --> 58:43.060
 to know to understand the way you speak?

58:43.060 --> 58:47.900
 You know, Leopold and Loeb, you know the story of those two, they murdered that kid and they

58:47.900 --> 58:48.900
 had this weird relationship.

58:48.900 --> 58:53.760
 Anyway, it's an interesting thing to Google, Leopold and Loeb, these two guys who ended

58:53.760 --> 58:57.380
 up murdering a kid because they developed their own language with each other and this

58:57.380 --> 59:00.860
 own reality and this weird thing and they wanted to know what it's like to murder a

59:00.860 --> 59:01.860
 kid and they murder a kid.

59:01.860 --> 59:07.340
 It's a famous story in American lore and history or whatever, famous case.

59:07.340 --> 59:10.460
 But this phenomenon, yeah, me and Chris got together.

59:10.460 --> 59:15.580
 It wasn't as dark as Leopold and Loeb, we didn't murder a kid, but we murdered a podcast.

59:15.580 --> 59:18.980
 Or at least stabbed it a few times.

59:18.980 --> 59:24.360
 Yeah, it's, it was something in the organic chemistry of me and Chris that I think we'll

59:24.360 --> 59:31.940
 both end up appreciating even probably more than we do now that it's mysterious.

59:31.940 --> 59:39.900
 I got to be honest with you, it's, it was a thing that it wasn't conscious, wasn't intentional.

59:39.900 --> 59:45.860
 It was something that happened in the music of our energies that just went.

59:45.860 --> 59:50.020
 Like when you hear someone sing or when a jazz band hits a rhythm or even when I'm on

59:50.020 --> 59:54.180
 stage and I just catch a rhythm, it's like, dude, I didn't make a choice there.

59:54.180 --> 59:55.180
 I don't know what that is.

59:55.180 --> 1:00:00.020
 I don't know how to explain it, but it comes from somewhere else and I don't know what

1:00:00.020 --> 1:00:01.020
 it is.

1:00:01.020 --> 1:00:02.020
 It's beyond my comprehension.

1:00:02.020 --> 1:00:07.900
 But with Chris, there was this magical chemistry that, you know, I have chemistry with a lot

1:00:07.900 --> 1:00:11.540
 of people and it can be funny and I feel zero chemistry here.

1:00:11.540 --> 1:00:12.540
 This is great.

1:00:12.540 --> 1:00:13.540
 Yeah.

1:00:13.540 --> 1:00:17.100
 It's a little bit more intelligent than what me and Chris did.

1:00:17.100 --> 1:00:21.660
 But you know, me and Chris, I think we connected on the funny bone.

1:00:21.660 --> 1:00:26.900
 Like I, he, I found him so funny and we found the same things funny.

1:00:26.900 --> 1:00:33.360
 And from that, these organic expressions came from some part of our brains that was created

1:00:33.360 --> 1:00:34.360
 from this chemistry.

1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:38.520
 And yeah, we just developed this language and this cult following and people were really

1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:40.260
 upset when we ended.

1:00:40.260 --> 1:00:44.380
 But it was the right thing to end because like all things that end, it was kind of done

1:00:44.380 --> 1:00:46.540
 a few episodes even before we finished.

1:00:46.540 --> 1:00:52.380
 And I think we pulled the plug before it started rolling downhill, like all, you know, like

1:00:52.380 --> 1:00:59.100
 all great flings, you know, there's your long relation, long marriages are boring and comfortable.

1:00:59.100 --> 1:01:05.540
 The one you really like fucking always ends abruptly and sadly and, but you always look

1:01:05.540 --> 1:01:07.540
 back and you jerk off to it.

1:01:07.540 --> 1:01:10.580
 And so you guys made love and we made, yeah.

1:01:10.580 --> 1:01:16.100
 So it's like, it was like a hot fling with me and him and it was intense and we burned

1:01:16.100 --> 1:01:17.940
 the candle at both ends.

1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:24.060
 And it was, I think that podcast was meant to be three years and maybe people will go

1:01:24.060 --> 1:01:27.140
 back and appreciate it and listen to it over and over again.

1:01:27.140 --> 1:01:31.460
 And I think the new things we do, people will love, I'm doing long days now, that podcast

1:01:31.460 --> 1:01:32.460
 and people seem to enjoy it.

1:01:32.460 --> 1:01:35.180
 I've been really enjoying the long days on YouTube.

1:01:35.180 --> 1:01:41.500
 I just found myself just like staring at you ranting for, same with Tim Dillon, I really

1:01:41.500 --> 1:01:45.660
 enjoyed the, whatever those rants are, the genius of just one thing after the other.

1:01:45.660 --> 1:01:50.860
 But definitely the chemistry, almost as a study, I remember the reason I first started

1:01:50.860 --> 1:01:57.540
 listening to it, I was trying to get a perspective on certain historical moments.

1:01:57.540 --> 1:01:58.540
 Like it was interesting.

1:01:58.540 --> 1:02:00.420
 I tuned in to learn history.

1:02:00.420 --> 1:02:01.420
 Yeah.

1:02:01.420 --> 1:02:08.820
 I came for the history and like stayed for the chaos and the crack open and clean out.

1:02:08.820 --> 1:02:14.620
 And yeah, this, it was almost, I listened to Rogan like this sometimes.

1:02:14.620 --> 1:02:23.940
 I'll relisten to an episode to try to understand why was this so fun to listen to?

1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:26.420
 It's almost like trying to analyze humor or something like that.

1:02:26.420 --> 1:02:32.860
 But it's nice from a conversational perspective, like why was this so easy to listen to?

1:02:32.860 --> 1:02:37.060
 And with History of Hyenas, like why is the chemistry so good?

1:02:37.060 --> 1:02:39.300
 It's so, it's weird.

1:02:39.300 --> 1:02:40.300
 It's weird.

1:02:40.300 --> 1:02:44.300
 Cause there's not many podcasts like, I don't know any with the chemistry like that.

1:02:44.300 --> 1:02:45.300
 It's interesting.

1:02:45.300 --> 1:02:54.300
 And it's kind of sad that the fling with a prostitute in Vegas has to end, you know?

1:02:54.300 --> 1:02:55.300
 But that's what makes it special.

1:02:55.300 --> 1:02:58.340
 It's the Bukowski thing with the fog.

1:02:58.340 --> 1:03:03.260
 The British Office, one of my favorite shows was that it ended very quick.

1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:05.940
 It's only a couple of seasons or something like that.

1:03:05.940 --> 1:03:09.800
 And that was tragic, but that took guts to just end it.

1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:13.260
 Given all the money you could have made, given all the, you just end it.

1:03:13.260 --> 1:03:14.980
 And that's what makes it truly special.

1:03:14.980 --> 1:03:15.980
 Yeah.

1:03:15.980 --> 1:03:17.380
 And I'll tell you, man, I'll just emphasize it.

1:03:17.380 --> 1:03:19.980
 Cause I marvel at it too.

1:03:19.980 --> 1:03:24.940
 Cause as a guy who tries to always figure out what the causes of things, I gotta be

1:03:24.940 --> 1:03:25.940
 honest, man.

1:03:25.940 --> 1:03:29.580
 Looking back on that, even with retrospective wisdom, you know, that 2020 hindsight, we've

1:03:29.580 --> 1:03:35.620
 been done a couple of months now, it's something that I can't explain.

1:03:35.620 --> 1:03:38.000
 It's something that I don't know how you quantify it.

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.620
 I don't know how you describe it.

1:03:40.620 --> 1:03:41.620
 It's musical.

1:03:41.620 --> 1:03:44.580
 It's really kind of rhythmic.

1:03:44.580 --> 1:03:48.580
 Maybe like a Netflix show about history.

1:03:48.580 --> 1:03:52.620
 That's in the future with the two of you.

1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:59.220
 You guys will meet like the way you meet with a fling like a decade from now at a diner

1:03:59.220 --> 1:04:05.780
 and you're both way fatter and uglier and then you just reminisce over some cigarettes

1:04:05.780 --> 1:04:06.780
 and coffee.

1:04:06.780 --> 1:04:07.780
 It could be.

1:04:07.780 --> 1:04:08.780
 Yeah, it could be.

1:04:08.780 --> 1:04:09.780
 Yeah.

1:04:09.780 --> 1:04:13.220
 It's definitely a classic podcast that people can go back and appreciate.

1:04:13.220 --> 1:04:16.060
 It's fast paced and it was unique.

1:04:16.060 --> 1:04:21.140
 What was it like to research for, I mean, it was really scholarly, the depth of research

1:04:21.140 --> 1:04:23.000
 that you performed.

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:29.780
 It sometimes felt like you almost read an entire Wikipedia article beforehand.

1:04:29.780 --> 1:04:30.780
 Or like.

1:04:30.780 --> 1:04:31.780
 Exactly true.

1:04:31.780 --> 1:04:38.340
 We were, we were one fan, we attracted such funny people to that podcast and the fans

1:04:38.340 --> 1:04:43.300
 were so funny and one fan called us nicknamed as Wikipedia sluts.

1:04:43.300 --> 1:04:44.420
 And so it just stuck.

1:04:44.420 --> 1:04:45.420
 Yeah.

1:04:45.420 --> 1:04:46.420
 We just would read Wikipedia.

1:04:46.420 --> 1:04:48.860
 I would do a lot more research than Chris.

1:04:48.860 --> 1:04:52.580
 And so I would actually, you know, once in a while he'd get into it too.

1:04:52.580 --> 1:04:58.300
 But for very interesting episodes, I got some subject matter would just pull me in.

1:04:58.300 --> 1:05:01.500
 Like Bernie Madoff, just to think of one that was recent, it was one of our last ones.

1:05:01.500 --> 1:05:06.260
 And I think one of our better episodes and I'm glad that it kind of ended after that

1:05:06.260 --> 1:05:09.860
 because it was rare to, I think we started to slip a little bit.

1:05:09.860 --> 1:05:13.980
 I got fascinated and I got, I did a lot of research for Bernie Madoff, but usually, yeah,

1:05:13.980 --> 1:05:15.580
 we'd pull up Wikipedia and we'd have fun.

1:05:15.580 --> 1:05:17.900
 We were sort of the antithesis of Dan Carlin.

1:05:17.900 --> 1:05:24.220
 I mean, you went to Dan Carlin for accuracy and thoughtfulness and you went to us for,

1:05:24.220 --> 1:05:26.220
 it was a hang with history.

1:05:26.220 --> 1:05:30.500
 That's why history hyenas was such an appropriate name because it was, it was a little bit of

1:05:30.500 --> 1:05:31.500
 history.

1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:35.500
 Some, some episodes were more hyena, more wild and a little history and some were a

1:05:35.500 --> 1:05:38.220
 little more dense, like the battle of Crete and less hyena.

1:05:38.220 --> 1:05:41.860
 So you were, you were always going to get both, you're either going to get a majority

1:05:41.860 --> 1:05:42.860
 of one or the other.

1:05:42.860 --> 1:05:43.860
 Yeah.

1:05:43.860 --> 1:05:44.860
 And Dan Carlin is the lion, I guess.

1:05:44.860 --> 1:05:45.860
 Yeah.

1:05:45.860 --> 1:05:48.260
 And you guys, predictably good.

1:05:48.260 --> 1:05:49.260
 Yeah.

1:05:49.260 --> 1:05:53.340
 I mean, what, what are your thoughts about, I mean, he's a storyteller too.

1:05:53.340 --> 1:05:57.220
 He gets a lot of criticism for the, from the historians, quote unquote.

1:05:57.220 --> 1:05:59.060
 That's why he likes to knock.

1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:04.500
 He keeps saying he's not a historian, but what's your, what are your thoughts about

1:06:04.500 --> 1:06:06.180
 the hardcore history with Dan Carlin?

1:06:06.180 --> 1:06:15.060
 Like, was he an inspiration to the podcast you were doing or, or like an account, like

1:06:15.060 --> 1:06:20.140
 a, almost like a reverse psychology inspiration where you wanted to do some kind of opposing

1:06:20.140 --> 1:06:27.700
 type of podcast in history or was history always just like a, a launching pad to just

1:06:27.700 --> 1:06:29.940
 talk shit about human nature?

1:06:29.940 --> 1:06:31.020
 More of the latter.

1:06:31.020 --> 1:06:33.420
 I wasn't even aware of his podcast when we started.

1:06:33.420 --> 1:06:34.420
 Oh, interesting.

1:06:34.420 --> 1:06:35.420
 Yeah.

1:06:35.420 --> 1:06:39.020
 And so we, it was just very organic, again, like the chemistry, me and Chris became very

1:06:39.020 --> 1:06:40.220
 good friends.

1:06:40.220 --> 1:06:41.900
 We started the podcast.

1:06:41.900 --> 1:06:45.820
 First we did a web series called Bay Ridge Boys, which has its sort of little cult following.

1:06:45.820 --> 1:06:48.300
 We did like five episodes and ended it.

1:06:48.300 --> 1:06:53.260
 And then we did the podcast and hi, hyenas were my favorite animal and I talk about them

1:06:53.260 --> 1:06:57.060
 passionately and I told Chris about them and then he started appreciating them and we both

1:06:57.060 --> 1:06:58.060
 love history.

1:06:58.060 --> 1:06:59.060
 I majored in history.

1:06:59.060 --> 1:07:00.060
 It's one of the things I love.

1:07:00.060 --> 1:07:01.060
 I go to museums all the time.

1:07:01.060 --> 1:07:03.420
 I go to his, I do history tours, so does he.

1:07:03.420 --> 1:07:07.540
 And so it was just sort of a natural, let's do a history podcast and it gave us something

1:07:07.540 --> 1:07:12.740
 to talk about each episode to sort of lean our, you know, hang our hats on and, and riff

1:07:12.740 --> 1:07:13.900
 off of.

1:07:13.900 --> 1:07:15.500
 So it had nothing to do with dance.

1:07:15.500 --> 1:07:17.380
 What I think about dance, I think it's great.

1:07:17.380 --> 1:07:24.700
 I think even if he's inaccurate in the opinions of the historical community, it starts conversations,

1:07:24.700 --> 1:07:25.780
 which is good.

1:07:25.780 --> 1:07:28.460
 It's like this thing where people go, oh, it's dangerous rhetoric.

1:07:28.460 --> 1:07:32.500
 It's like, no, rhetoric only becomes dangerous when education fails.

1:07:32.500 --> 1:07:35.500
 What's going on in America is education has failed.

1:07:35.500 --> 1:07:39.460
 So if you call someone online dangerous, it's not him that's dangerous.

1:07:39.460 --> 1:07:41.700
 It's the fucking stupid people that's dangerous.

1:07:41.700 --> 1:07:42.700
 And it's the fault of this country.

1:07:42.700 --> 1:07:44.320
 We didn't listen to Aristotle.

1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:50.060
 The future of a civilization depends on public education and we failed.

1:07:50.060 --> 1:07:51.060
 Education has failed.

1:07:51.060 --> 1:07:53.140
 Kids are, kids are not interested in shit.

1:07:53.140 --> 1:07:59.980
 And so in some sense, those dance podcasts and podcasts can be incredibly educational.

1:07:59.980 --> 1:08:07.740
 Because he's a, the storytelling that pulls you in ultimately leads to you internalizing

1:08:07.740 --> 1:08:11.620
 these stories and like remembering them and thinking through them and all those kinds

1:08:11.620 --> 1:08:15.180
 of things that is much more powerful than you book on history.

1:08:15.180 --> 1:08:16.180
 That's accurate.

1:08:16.180 --> 1:08:18.740
 I think often it inspires you to go learn more.

1:08:18.740 --> 1:08:19.740
 So it's like, I know we did that.

1:08:19.740 --> 1:08:23.060
 I mean, you know, I, people would go, Hey, I went and learned about this because they

1:08:23.060 --> 1:08:27.340
 knew with us, there was no pretense, which was great that we had no standard.

1:08:27.340 --> 1:08:32.220
 So it's like, nobody came to us for historical accuracy, but I was kind of turned on by the

1:08:32.220 --> 1:08:37.660
 fact that it inspired people to go learn about this stuff or to at least know like Battle

1:08:37.660 --> 1:08:42.100
 of Crete, like you said, a very underappreciated battle.

1:08:42.100 --> 1:08:47.980
 Even Winston Churchill said from here on, we will no longer say that Greeks fight like

1:08:47.980 --> 1:08:49.580
 heroes, but heroes fight like Greeks.

1:08:49.580 --> 1:08:54.660
 I mean, it was a monumental battle and you know, not talked about enough.

1:08:54.660 --> 1:09:00.300
 And I, our podcast would inspire people to go actually learn more, to go listen to Dan

1:09:00.300 --> 1:09:04.020
 Carlin or to go pick up a book or to do research on their own.

1:09:04.020 --> 1:09:10.060
 And so I think podcasts, Dan Carlin's obviously much more accurate than us, but it's good

1:09:10.060 --> 1:09:13.460
 that people are going to podcasts like yours and to learn shit.

1:09:13.460 --> 1:09:16.860
 Joe was, is really like the progenitor of that.

1:09:16.860 --> 1:09:22.360
 I mean, you know, having intellectuals on and getting the public interested with this

1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:27.420
 new medium in, in people who are intelligent.

1:09:27.420 --> 1:09:28.420
 It's nice.

1:09:28.420 --> 1:09:33.820
 Cause you know, what the mainstream press pushes out is horseshit, gorgeous horseshit.

1:09:33.820 --> 1:09:37.300
 It's got a beautiful veneer, but no substance.

1:09:37.300 --> 1:09:39.460
 And so this, this is a nice pushback.

1:09:39.460 --> 1:09:40.460
 Yeah.

1:09:40.460 --> 1:09:41.860
 The authenticity of Joe's show.

1:09:41.860 --> 1:09:46.620
 I mean, I'm through, I started listening from the very beginning, you know, doing my in

1:09:46.620 --> 1:09:51.900
 grad school, you know, like a technical person and he just pulled me in.

1:09:51.900 --> 1:09:57.980
 And made me curious to learn about all kinds of things and use my own critical reasoning

1:09:57.980 --> 1:10:02.740
 skills on some of the bullshit guests he's had and some of the most inspiring guests

1:10:02.740 --> 1:10:03.740
 he's had.

1:10:03.740 --> 1:10:08.740
 And so I teach you to think, can you, I don't know much about Bernie Madoff as a small tangent.

1:10:08.740 --> 1:10:10.900
 Can you, can you tell me who the hell is Bernie Madoff?

1:10:10.900 --> 1:10:13.380
 Oh, Bernie Madoff is the GOAT.

1:10:13.380 --> 1:10:16.900
 The greatest thief of all time, dude.

1:10:16.900 --> 1:10:22.180
 Hedge fund guy, ran a hedge fund and pulled, stole the most money in the history of America.

1:10:22.180 --> 1:10:29.180
 I mean a con artist and he does, people obviously he's become, he's a household name because

1:10:29.180 --> 1:10:34.060
 of the magnitude of his crime, but you got to appreciate, again, you got to appreciate

1:10:34.060 --> 1:10:39.620
 what went into this and how long he was able to pull it off by tricking the smartest and

1:10:39.620 --> 1:10:43.220
 richest people in the world and a brilliant scam.

1:10:43.220 --> 1:10:47.460
 The con man, con man is short for confidence man.

1:10:47.460 --> 1:10:53.220
 And it came from, yeah, a con man, basically they exude confidence and they trick people

1:10:53.220 --> 1:10:56.340
 by playing on their ego and blind spots.

1:10:56.340 --> 1:11:00.540
 And the word comes from a guy, I can't remember where, but what he used to do, I can't remember

1:11:00.540 --> 1:11:03.860
 the guy's name, whatever, you can Google it, con man.

1:11:03.860 --> 1:11:04.860
 But it's very interesting.

1:11:04.860 --> 1:11:08.380
 The first con man that is on record, what he would do, he would go to very rich people

1:11:08.380 --> 1:11:11.100
 and he'd be very well dressed, right?

1:11:11.100 --> 1:11:16.740
 And he'd go, I bet you, you don't have the confidence to give me your watch.

1:11:16.740 --> 1:11:19.700
 And he would play on the egos of these very powerful and rich people and they would give

1:11:19.700 --> 1:11:23.340
 them the watch for some reason, some sort of reverse psychology bullshit.

1:11:23.340 --> 1:11:27.540
 And he'd take the watch and he would just steal it because basically saying like, you

1:11:27.540 --> 1:11:29.660
 don't have the confidence to give me the watch because you don't, I don't know, you don't

1:11:29.660 --> 1:11:30.660
 think I'm going to give it back.

1:11:30.660 --> 1:11:31.740
 And he would just take it.

1:11:31.740 --> 1:11:35.460
 So Bernie Madoff was a very sophisticated con man.

1:11:35.460 --> 1:11:39.100
 And again, we were talking about people pretending to be the opposite of what they are.

1:11:39.100 --> 1:11:46.440
 And he hid his thievery in how available he was to his clients, how he would show up at

1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:50.020
 every bar mitzvah, every birthday, he was always available for their phone calls.

1:11:50.020 --> 1:11:52.340
 And he played on their egos.

1:11:52.340 --> 1:11:56.620
 He made it so people wanted to invest in him, like they were competing.

1:11:56.620 --> 1:11:58.380
 He made it very exclusive.

1:11:58.380 --> 1:12:00.020
 He wouldn't just take anyone.

1:12:00.020 --> 1:12:04.140
 And there was a method behind that madness because he wanted the whales that wouldn't

1:12:04.140 --> 1:12:07.860
 notice that he had this pyramid scheme going.

1:12:07.860 --> 1:12:11.780
 And so what he would do is he would just rob from the richer and he just kept, it was like

1:12:11.780 --> 1:12:15.820
 he'd pay back the richer with the guy who was a little, and it was a pyramid scheme.

1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:20.380
 And he was able to do it for so long and steal so much money.

1:12:20.380 --> 1:12:24.320
 And he would win people over with the scheme because with that scheme, he was the only

1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:30.340
 guy who could provide, who could guarantee like a 1% return even during times of recession.

1:12:30.340 --> 1:12:35.580
 And because he was such a good con man, he hijacked people's reasoning with his charm.

1:12:35.580 --> 1:12:36.860
 And that's what con artists do.

1:12:36.860 --> 1:12:37.860
 That's what psychopaths do.

1:12:37.860 --> 1:12:38.860
 They're so fucking charming.

1:12:38.860 --> 1:12:41.260
 They get you in that Volkswagen Beetle.

1:12:41.260 --> 1:12:45.060
 Because if they use their reasoning for one second, they'd go, hey, nobody can provide

1:12:45.060 --> 1:12:46.860
 1% returns during recessions.

1:12:46.860 --> 1:12:48.180
 How the fuck is this guy doing it?

1:12:48.180 --> 1:12:49.500
 I'll tell you how he's doing it.

1:12:49.500 --> 1:12:51.740
 He's stealing from another guy to pay you.

1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:52.900
 You fucking idiot.

1:12:52.900 --> 1:12:54.860
 So charisma is essential to that.

1:12:54.860 --> 1:13:00.060
 Maybe you can help explain something to me, something I have been affected by.

1:13:00.060 --> 1:13:02.660
 I'm getting way too loud for your listeners, there's going to be comments like, tell this

1:13:02.660 --> 1:13:03.660
 guy to calm down.

1:13:03.660 --> 1:13:07.260
 I'm sorry, I'm Greek, I'm positive.

1:13:07.260 --> 1:13:09.620
 No, that's beautiful.

1:13:09.620 --> 1:13:10.980
 I love it.

1:13:10.980 --> 1:13:15.060
 Something that I have been thinking about and have encountered indirectly is Jeffrey

1:13:15.060 --> 1:13:16.820
 Epstein.

1:13:16.820 --> 1:13:24.420
 And I have a sense because of MIT, because of all the other people that have been touched,

1:13:24.420 --> 1:13:30.620
 the wrong term, by Jeffrey Epstein in the sense that literally and figuratively.

1:13:30.620 --> 1:13:37.820
 And it always felt to me like there's not a deep conspiracy, I don't know, but it felt

1:13:37.820 --> 1:13:44.340
 to me like it's not some deeply rooted conspiracy where like Eric Weinstein thinks that there's

1:13:44.340 --> 1:13:50.860
 some probability that Jeffrey Epstein is a front for like an intelligence agency, whether

1:13:50.860 --> 1:13:57.660
 it's Israeli or the CIA, I don't know, but is a front for something much, much bigger.

1:13:57.660 --> 1:14:02.540
 And then I always thought that he's just, maybe you can correct me, but more of the

1:14:02.540 --> 1:14:10.220
 Bernie Madoff variety, where he's just a charismatic guy who maybe is psychopathic in some sense,

1:14:10.220 --> 1:14:16.860
 so you know, also a pedophile, but just charismatic and is able to convince people of that 1%

1:14:16.860 --> 1:14:23.540
 of any idea that in the case of scientists is able to convince these people that their

1:14:23.540 --> 1:14:25.380
 ideas matter.

1:14:25.380 --> 1:14:29.860
 So one thing scientists don't really, you know, despite what people say, I don't think

1:14:29.860 --> 1:14:32.020
 they care about money as much as people think.

1:14:32.020 --> 1:14:35.140
 I mean, people are ridiculous when they think that, yeah, that's why people get into science

1:14:35.140 --> 1:14:36.140
 for the money.

1:14:36.140 --> 1:14:37.140
 Yeah, right.

1:14:37.140 --> 1:14:41.220
 The personalities that get into science are obsessed with minutia and they do the scientific

1:14:41.220 --> 1:14:42.220
 method.

1:14:42.220 --> 1:14:43.220
 You know how boring that is?

1:14:43.220 --> 1:14:46.620
 Like you have to have a love for it in order to do it.

1:14:46.620 --> 1:14:52.420
 But the thing, what drives you is for your ideas to be then heard.

1:14:52.420 --> 1:14:57.060
 Like when a rich guy comes over, probably super charismatic, is going to tell you that

1:14:57.060 --> 1:15:03.020
 your ideas, especially for some of these outsiders at MIT, at Harvard, at Caltech, all these

1:15:03.020 --> 1:15:13.540
 like sort of big science, like physics, biology, artificial intelligence, computing fields,

1:15:13.540 --> 1:15:19.420
 to hear somebody say that your ideas are brilliant and ideas matter, it's pretty powerful, especially

1:15:19.420 --> 1:15:21.420
 when you've been an outsider.

1:15:21.420 --> 1:15:26.920
 Like he's talked to a bunch of people who had outsider ideas.

1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:34.220
 You know, the big negative for me of modern academia is that most people, actually like

1:15:34.220 --> 1:15:38.660
 most communities, most people think the same and there's just these brilliant outsiders

1:15:38.660 --> 1:15:41.620
 and the outsiders are just derided.

1:15:41.620 --> 1:15:47.700
 And so when you have Jeffrey Epstein, like a hyena, sorry, sorry, sorry, going on the

1:15:47.700 --> 1:15:52.180
 outside and picking off these brilliant minds that are the outsiders, he can use charisma

1:15:52.180 --> 1:15:59.540
 to convince them to collaborate with him, to take his funding and then thereby he builds

1:15:59.540 --> 1:16:07.500
 a reputation, like slowly accumulates these people that actually results in a network

1:16:07.500 --> 1:16:12.180
 of like some of those brilliant people in the world, you know, and then pulls in people

1:16:12.180 --> 1:16:16.700
 like Bill Gates and I don't know, political figures.

1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:19.300
 I tend to believe that one person can do that.

1:16:19.300 --> 1:16:20.300
 Yeah.

1:16:20.300 --> 1:16:22.860
 I mean, look at Hitler, charisma is blinding.

1:16:22.860 --> 1:16:27.820
 I think that's what Kahneman, speaking of Bernie Madoff, that's one of their major tools

1:16:27.820 --> 1:16:31.700
 is flattery, glib, superficial charm.

1:16:31.700 --> 1:16:33.380
 It creates those blind spots.

1:16:33.380 --> 1:16:34.580
 People want to hear how great they are.

1:16:34.580 --> 1:16:36.460
 They want to be flattered.

1:16:36.460 --> 1:16:42.580
 It takes your defenses down, plays to our ego, how much we're all just pieces of garbage

1:16:42.580 --> 1:16:44.140
 and want to hear how great we are.

1:16:44.140 --> 1:16:46.580
 We want that love from our mother and our father.

1:16:46.580 --> 1:16:52.460
 That's Freudian and they know because they're not burdened with that need, they're not burdened

1:16:52.460 --> 1:16:59.220
 with that empathy or emotions and they just see things very calculatively.

1:16:59.220 --> 1:17:04.300
 They play, they know that we're prey in their game and they use that against us and that

1:17:04.300 --> 1:17:09.760
 is why someone who is not that intelligent, like Hitler, can probably convince a lot more

1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:14.100
 intelligent people, you know, and that's why we can't give Tim Dillon power because then,

1:17:14.100 --> 1:17:15.860
 you know, he already stands on a stage.

1:17:15.860 --> 1:17:19.460
 I mean, if we let that guy, I mean, he will just take over a country and everyone who

1:17:19.460 --> 1:17:21.740
 can't cook well will be eliminated.

1:17:21.740 --> 1:17:22.740
 So it's like...

1:17:22.740 --> 1:17:25.020
 I wonder why he keeps complimenting me when we're in private.

1:17:25.020 --> 1:17:26.020
 Exactly.

1:17:26.020 --> 1:17:27.020
 Be careful.

1:17:27.020 --> 1:17:29.060
 He looks at me just, I like your suit.

1:17:29.060 --> 1:17:30.540
 I like the cut of your jib.

1:17:30.540 --> 1:17:31.540
 Yeah, definitely.

1:17:31.540 --> 1:17:32.540
 You gotta be careful of that kid.

1:17:32.540 --> 1:17:33.540
 He's Hitler.

1:17:33.540 --> 1:17:35.700
 But it's crazy to think about...

1:17:35.700 --> 1:17:36.700
 Clip that, please.

1:17:36.700 --> 1:17:37.700
 Internet.

1:17:37.700 --> 1:17:40.980
 I mean, Quentin Tarantino said it to Pat, I mean, in his script, personality goes a long

1:17:40.980 --> 1:17:41.980
 way, dude.

1:17:41.980 --> 1:17:48.420
 I mean, personality can usurp common sense and reason of the smartest people.

1:17:48.420 --> 1:17:52.840
 These absolute smartest people can be hypnotized.

1:17:52.840 --> 1:17:54.900
 It's sort of like a sexy woman.

1:17:54.900 --> 1:18:00.180
 It's like, you can just, you can be tricked because we have such a blind spot for, you

1:18:00.180 --> 1:18:02.220
 know, for flattery.

1:18:02.220 --> 1:18:03.860
 Yeah, I wonder.

1:18:03.860 --> 1:18:08.900
 I think there's a BBC documentary on, I think it's called something like Charisma, Hitler's

1:18:08.900 --> 1:18:10.700
 Charisma or something like that.

1:18:10.700 --> 1:18:15.420
 It was quite, I mean, that one focused more about the power of the speeches.

1:18:15.420 --> 1:18:21.740
 But I wonder if most of the success or the rise of Hitler and the Third Reich had to

1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:27.820
 do with the charisma of Hitler when he's alone in a room with somebody, with the generals,

1:18:27.820 --> 1:18:28.820
 just one on one.

1:18:28.820 --> 1:18:34.980
 Like, I wonder if that's the essential element of just being able to just look into a person's

1:18:34.980 --> 1:18:41.980
 eyes, like flatter them or whatever is needed to earn their trust and then convince them

1:18:41.980 --> 1:18:43.540
 of anything you want.

1:18:43.540 --> 1:18:44.540
 Right.

1:18:44.540 --> 1:18:45.540
 Yeah.

1:18:45.540 --> 1:18:46.540
 I mean, you're right.

1:18:46.540 --> 1:18:49.820
 Because that's the one piece of history we don't have.

1:18:49.820 --> 1:18:50.820
 We don't know.

1:18:50.820 --> 1:18:53.180
 We do know that the kid crushed.

1:18:53.180 --> 1:18:55.060
 I mean, he was a headliner.

1:18:55.060 --> 1:18:58.340
 He got up there and his hair would flop.

1:18:58.340 --> 1:19:00.780
 I mean, he crushed it.

1:19:00.780 --> 1:19:04.260
 Yeah, there's certain elements about nationalism and pride that are really powerful.

1:19:04.260 --> 1:19:10.980
 Like a lot of us humans, I think, long for that, for the feeling of belonging.

1:19:10.980 --> 1:19:18.380
 And when some charismatic leader makes us feel like we belong to a group, the amount

1:19:18.380 --> 1:19:23.500
 of evil we can do to other humans because of that, it's endless.

1:19:23.500 --> 1:19:26.760
 Nobody wants to look and nobody wants to do the work to be better or look at where they

1:19:26.760 --> 1:19:27.760
 messed up.

1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:29.180
 Why does it always have to be the Jews that escape?

1:19:29.180 --> 1:19:32.580
 You know, it's like, get over it, guys.

1:19:32.580 --> 1:19:34.620
 I mean, it's like they killed Jesus.

1:19:34.620 --> 1:19:35.620
 You get over it.

1:19:35.620 --> 1:19:36.620
 Yeah.

1:19:36.620 --> 1:19:37.620
 Okay.

1:19:37.620 --> 1:19:38.620
 It's a long time ago.

1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:39.620
 I mean, move on.

1:19:39.620 --> 1:19:40.620
 I'm Jewish.

1:19:40.620 --> 1:19:41.620
 I understand because we do run the central banks.

1:19:41.620 --> 1:19:42.740
 And the weather.

1:19:42.740 --> 1:19:43.740
 And the weather.

1:19:43.740 --> 1:19:44.740
 Yeah.

1:19:44.740 --> 1:19:45.740
 Don't forget about the weather.

1:19:45.740 --> 1:19:46.740
 That's a big one.

1:19:46.740 --> 1:19:47.740
 That's a funny one that people created.

1:19:47.740 --> 1:19:48.740
 Like, who gives a shit?

1:19:48.740 --> 1:19:49.740
 What is the weather?

1:19:49.740 --> 1:19:50.740
 Like, what's the importance of the weather?

1:19:50.740 --> 1:19:51.740
 All right.

1:19:51.740 --> 1:19:52.740
 The Jews made it rain outside.

1:19:52.740 --> 1:19:53.740
 Good.

1:19:53.740 --> 1:19:54.740
 You got to fuck.

1:19:54.740 --> 1:19:55.740
 You know, they made it snow.

1:19:55.740 --> 1:19:56.740
 Okay.

1:19:56.740 --> 1:19:57.740
 You get a day off.

1:19:57.740 --> 1:19:58.740
 Thank the Jews.

1:19:58.740 --> 1:19:59.740
 Yeah.

1:19:59.740 --> 1:20:00.740
 It's like, yeah, there's certain conspiracies that make me like flat earth.

1:20:00.740 --> 1:20:01.740
 Like, what's the motive?

1:20:01.740 --> 1:20:04.260
 What's the motivation for lying that the earth is round?

1:20:04.260 --> 1:20:05.260
 Like, what's the conspiracy?

1:20:05.260 --> 1:20:06.260
 Yeah.

1:20:06.260 --> 1:20:07.260
 What does anyone get out of that?

1:20:07.260 --> 1:20:08.260
 Yeah.

1:20:08.260 --> 1:20:09.260
 What is exactly the profit?

1:20:09.260 --> 1:20:10.260
 What's the strategy?

1:20:10.260 --> 1:20:17.300
 Do you have any, from a historical perspective or just a human perspective, conspiracy theories

1:20:17.300 --> 1:20:18.300
 you connect with?

1:20:18.300 --> 1:20:22.420
 Or you're not necessarily conspiratorial?

1:20:22.420 --> 1:20:26.060
 I'm not necessarily conspiratorial.

1:20:26.060 --> 1:20:30.580
 Nobody cares that much.

1:20:30.580 --> 1:20:36.420
 But then, you know, what happens is you find out this one or this two, and you start questioning

1:20:36.420 --> 1:20:37.420
 everything.

1:20:37.420 --> 1:20:38.420
 And you start questioning everything, man.

1:20:38.420 --> 1:20:42.540
 It's like, you know, the Vietnam War started, that was a lie.

1:20:42.540 --> 1:20:43.540
 That was a false flag.

1:20:43.540 --> 1:20:45.960
 And then next thing you know, everything's a false flag.

1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:49.860
 There are some strange things on 9 11.

1:20:49.860 --> 1:20:52.100
 You know, there's some strange things from a scientific perspective.

1:20:52.100 --> 1:20:58.120
 I'm no scientist, but it's like, you know, yeah, three steel framed skyscrapers falling

1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:00.580
 on the same day in the same way.

1:21:00.580 --> 1:21:03.580
 A lot of people say, oh, they were hit by planes.

1:21:03.580 --> 1:21:04.780
 It's like, yeah, but that's not why they fell.

1:21:04.780 --> 1:21:13.180
 They fell because of fires and usually, not usually, all the time, except for three times.

1:21:13.180 --> 1:21:17.140
 And there was buildings that have burned for longer than that.

1:21:17.140 --> 1:21:21.180
 And there might be good explanations, but the lack of transparency, it's like, I feel

1:21:21.180 --> 1:21:22.260
 like government.

1:21:22.260 --> 1:21:23.260
 And building seven's weird.

1:21:23.260 --> 1:21:27.660
 I mean, the way it kind of died, just a neat, just a neat, the physical, I mean, you're

1:21:27.660 --> 1:21:28.660
 a scientist.

1:21:28.660 --> 1:21:34.380
 Is that, well, I don't, I, is there resistance from the steel and free fall, not all scientists

1:21:34.380 --> 1:21:35.380
 know everything.

1:21:35.380 --> 1:21:36.380
 I'm just a computer guy.

1:21:36.380 --> 1:21:40.980
 Cause I had some questions I wanted to ask you about my biology, but yeah, so exactly.

1:21:40.980 --> 1:21:41.980
 I don't understand biology.

1:21:41.980 --> 1:21:43.980
 I don't understand the melting point of steel.

1:21:43.980 --> 1:21:49.560
 I don't, but I'm just the common sense human that looks at government and institutions

1:21:49.560 --> 1:21:51.520
 when they try to communicate.

1:21:51.520 --> 1:21:56.240
 And there's a certain human element where you can sense that there's dishonesty going

1:21:56.240 --> 1:21:57.240
 on.

1:21:57.240 --> 1:22:01.100
 And dishonesty might not be deeply rooted in a conspiracy theory and something malevolent.

1:22:01.100 --> 1:22:06.980
 It might just be rooted more likely to me in a basic fear of losing your job.

1:22:06.980 --> 1:22:10.500
 So when you have a bunch of people that are afraid of losing their job, you know, and

1:22:10.500 --> 1:22:16.660
 they just don't want to like the origins of the virus, whether it came from a lab or not,

1:22:16.660 --> 1:22:22.020
 you know, that's a pretty, I know a lot of biologists behind a closed doors that, that

1:22:22.020 --> 1:22:25.620
 say it's very likely it was leaked from the lab.

1:22:25.620 --> 1:22:29.340
 But like, they don't want to talk about it because there's not good evidence either way.

1:22:29.340 --> 1:22:32.060
 It's mostly you're just using common sense.

1:22:32.060 --> 1:22:35.620
 So they're waiting for good evidence to come out in either direction.

1:22:35.620 --> 1:22:40.980
 But just like nobody in positions of institutional, like centralized power wants to just honestly

1:22:40.980 --> 1:22:46.540
 say, we don't know, or on the point of masks or all those kinds of things to say, you know,

1:22:46.540 --> 1:22:47.760
 here's the best evidence we have.

1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:49.220
 We're not sure we're trying to figure that out.

1:22:49.220 --> 1:22:53.780
 We're desperately trying to figure that out or just like honesty, especially in the modern

1:22:53.780 --> 1:22:56.820
 day, that's the hope I have for the 21st centuries.

1:22:56.820 --> 1:23:00.140
 People seem to detect bullshit much, much better because of the internet.

1:23:00.140 --> 1:23:01.140
 Yeah.

1:23:01.140 --> 1:23:02.140
 Internet.

1:23:02.140 --> 1:23:03.140
 Yeah.

1:23:03.140 --> 1:23:04.140
 Yeah.

1:23:04.140 --> 1:23:05.140
 And we seem to...

1:23:05.140 --> 1:23:06.140
 But they also believe crazy shit too.

1:23:06.140 --> 1:23:07.140
 There's no Yang without a Yang, I guess.

1:23:07.140 --> 1:23:12.380
 But I think the conspiracy theories arise only when the people in positions of power

1:23:12.380 --> 1:23:15.340
 and government institutions are full of shit.

1:23:15.340 --> 1:23:19.640
 Like the air will be taken out of the conspiracy theories if the people in elected power would

1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:20.640
 be much more honest.

1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:21.640
 Like just like real.

1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:26.340
 Yeah, people like Andrew Yang, whatever you think about him, just more honest.

1:23:26.340 --> 1:23:29.500
 He just like says whatever the hell comes to mind.

1:23:29.500 --> 1:23:31.780
 By the way, he's running for New York mayor.

1:23:31.780 --> 1:23:32.780
 Mayor, yeah.

1:23:32.780 --> 1:23:34.380
 Do you have opinions?

1:23:34.380 --> 1:23:35.780
 Yeah, it's no good.

1:23:35.780 --> 1:23:37.660
 I like Andrew Yang and it's no good.

1:23:37.660 --> 1:23:39.020
 I'd be honest with you.

1:23:39.020 --> 1:23:40.420
 I'm a lifelong New Yorker.

1:23:40.420 --> 1:23:41.580
 I mean, I'm a New Yorker.

1:23:41.580 --> 1:23:44.340
 Well, you're a New Yorker, so nothing's good.

1:23:44.340 --> 1:23:45.740
 Well, something is good.

1:23:45.740 --> 1:23:46.740
 Okay.

1:23:46.740 --> 1:23:49.140
 Let's be honest about New York.

1:23:49.140 --> 1:23:51.140
 It's a very socially liberal place.

1:23:51.140 --> 1:23:52.900
 It is the head of the snake.

1:23:52.900 --> 1:23:54.420
 New York is the country.

1:23:54.420 --> 1:23:58.460
 If New York, when New York's not doing good, country's not doing good.

1:23:58.460 --> 1:24:01.540
 It's the most important city, DC, New York.

1:24:01.540 --> 1:24:02.540
 It's really Rome.

1:24:02.540 --> 1:24:03.540
 Be honest.

1:24:03.540 --> 1:24:04.540
 It's, maybe I'm biased.

1:24:04.540 --> 1:24:05.540
 I don't know.

1:24:05.540 --> 1:24:06.540
 No.

1:24:06.540 --> 1:24:07.540
 Yeah.

1:24:07.540 --> 1:24:10.940
 We just, New Yorkers, we walk around everywhere and we go, this is just like New York, but

1:24:10.940 --> 1:24:11.940
 not New York.

1:24:11.940 --> 1:24:17.660
 It's, but New York needs, and I'm a guy who leans left.

1:24:17.660 --> 1:24:20.220
 You know, I just, I lean left and that's just what it is.

1:24:20.220 --> 1:24:21.220
 A dictator?

1:24:21.220 --> 1:24:22.220
 Is that where you're going?

1:24:22.220 --> 1:24:23.220
 No, we need.

1:24:23.220 --> 1:24:24.220
 Are we going back to Stalin again?

1:24:24.220 --> 1:24:25.220
 We need, it's a money town.

1:24:25.220 --> 1:24:26.500
 Let's be, come on, man.

1:24:26.500 --> 1:24:29.740
 I mean, New York is a money town.

1:24:29.740 --> 1:24:36.620
 And Wall Street, and then when AOC and her cronies at the local level rejected that Amazon

1:24:36.620 --> 1:24:40.260
 thing, you're going like, what do you think makes cities?

1:24:40.260 --> 1:24:42.340
 What's going to create jobs in the 21st century?

1:24:42.340 --> 1:24:43.340
 What do we need?

1:24:43.340 --> 1:24:44.340
 More nail salons?

1:24:44.340 --> 1:24:45.340
 Yeah.

1:24:45.340 --> 1:24:46.340
 More pizza places?

1:24:46.340 --> 1:24:49.740
 I mean, we're living in the tech revolution and you know, whatever your opinions are

1:24:49.740 --> 1:24:53.580
 about Jeff Bezos, that's the world, tech.

1:24:53.580 --> 1:24:54.740
 And they want you to come here.

1:24:54.740 --> 1:24:56.140
 Of course you give them tax breaks.

1:24:56.140 --> 1:24:58.340
 That's why companies go anywhere.

1:24:58.340 --> 1:25:04.220
 She's so fucking utopian and that progressive wing is so utopian and that always ends in

1:25:04.220 --> 1:25:06.720
 disaster because it's not rooted in reality.

1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:09.560
 It doesn't accept the reality that people are self interested.

1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:13.920
 Now they're going to do this 14%, 15% tax hike on people making a million dollars more.

1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:16.340
 In New York City, a million dollars is not that much.

1:25:16.340 --> 1:25:18.120
 So people are going to flee New York.

1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:19.900
 The tax base is going to flee.

1:25:19.900 --> 1:25:21.900
 New York's going to fall to shit like it did before.

1:25:21.900 --> 1:25:25.620
 So you're saying it basically needs a more capitalist front, like capitalistic type of

1:25:25.620 --> 1:25:26.620
 thinker.

1:25:26.620 --> 1:25:27.620
 Yes.

1:25:27.620 --> 1:25:31.260
 Bloomberg, Giuliani when he was still sane and his hair wasn't melting off his face.

1:25:31.260 --> 1:25:32.260
 Prosecutor.

1:25:32.260 --> 1:25:34.580
 You need a tough, I mean, I don't know what's happened to that guy.

1:25:34.580 --> 1:25:35.580
 He's lost it.

1:25:35.580 --> 1:25:36.580
 But it's fun.

1:25:36.580 --> 1:25:37.580
 Yeah.

1:25:37.580 --> 1:25:38.580
 It's fun to watch.

1:25:38.580 --> 1:25:39.580
 Yeah.

1:25:39.580 --> 1:25:40.580
 It's fun to watch him be just like, uh, Trump's lackey.

1:25:40.580 --> 1:25:41.580
 Like, yeah, boy, whatever you want, boss.

1:25:41.580 --> 1:25:43.620
 I'll just say whatever you want, boss.

1:25:43.620 --> 1:25:49.300
 But New York is a money town that needs a money guy and sort of more of a Republican.

1:25:49.300 --> 1:25:53.680
 I have to say on the local level, as more of a guy who leans left, I'll just be honest.

1:25:53.680 --> 1:25:58.140
 It's a tough city that needs a tough mayor, not some guy who's going like, I understand

1:25:58.140 --> 1:25:59.460
 we all need free money.

1:25:59.460 --> 1:26:03.780
 You know, Andrew Yang I think is right in the big picture because all the real jobs

1:26:03.780 --> 1:26:04.780
 are somewhere else.

1:26:04.780 --> 1:26:07.860
 You look at those Asian cities, you go like, oh, that's what our cities used to look like

1:26:07.860 --> 1:26:09.540
 at the industrial revolution.

1:26:09.540 --> 1:26:12.340
 You know, there was like, there was jobs and people were making things here.

1:26:12.340 --> 1:26:15.140
 Now you look at those cities in Asia and you're going like, wow.

1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.620
 And then you go to Detroit and you're like, yeah, we're done.

1:26:17.620 --> 1:26:19.920
 You go to Cleveland, you go, we were done.

1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:22.420
 So I don't actually, it's, it's funny.

1:26:22.420 --> 1:26:27.400
 The reason I really like Andrew Yang is I've learned a lot every time he talks, like it's

1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:28.880
 not his opinions.

1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:33.180
 He's just giving a lot of data, like information, which I just start a podcast.

1:26:33.180 --> 1:26:34.180
 Don't run for mayor.

1:26:34.180 --> 1:26:35.180
 Yeah, that's true.

1:26:35.180 --> 1:26:36.180
 He already has a podcast.

1:26:36.180 --> 1:26:37.180
 I think Yang speaks.

1:26:37.180 --> 1:26:38.180
 Who doesn't?

1:26:38.180 --> 1:26:39.180
 Who does it?

1:26:39.180 --> 1:26:40.180
 Who does it now?

1:26:40.180 --> 1:26:41.180
 That's the way we communicate.

1:26:41.180 --> 1:26:43.700
 I don't even talk to people unless it's on a podcast.

1:26:43.700 --> 1:26:44.700
 What?

1:26:44.700 --> 1:26:48.420
 Listen, man, I'm a, I'm not going to criticize that because there is something like I talked

1:26:48.420 --> 1:26:55.580
 to my dad on a podcast for four hours and I'm not sure I would ever talk to him in the

1:26:55.580 --> 1:26:57.500
 way we talked without the podcast.

1:26:57.500 --> 1:26:58.500
 What does he do?

1:26:58.500 --> 1:26:59.500
 Uh, physicist.

1:26:59.500 --> 1:27:00.500
 Oh shit.

1:27:00.500 --> 1:27:05.020
 But like, yeah, it's a episode 100.

1:27:05.020 --> 1:27:14.740
 And you know, I, uh, the, the way I recorded that podcast is I tried to put my ego aside.

1:27:14.740 --> 1:27:18.100
 It's actually really tough to talk to your dad, especially because you're giving him

1:27:18.100 --> 1:27:19.100
 a platform.

1:27:19.100 --> 1:27:24.660
 Uh, especially, so at that time there's already a bit of a platform for this podcast.

1:27:24.660 --> 1:27:30.660
 And so there's this, as a son, you think like, oh, here it goes with this bullshit again.

1:27:30.660 --> 1:27:34.620
 Like that's the natural son thought you have.

1:27:34.620 --> 1:27:39.180
 But at the same time, I wanted to, the way I thought about it is in 20 years when I look

1:27:39.180 --> 1:27:43.660
 back, like I want to do a conversation where I'm happy with it, you know?

1:27:43.660 --> 1:27:46.020
 So I want to make him shine.

1:27:46.020 --> 1:27:51.220
 But I also called him out on like, why were you so distant, like, like all of that kind

1:27:51.220 --> 1:27:52.220
 of stuff.

1:27:52.220 --> 1:27:53.220
 Yeah.

1:27:53.220 --> 1:27:54.740
 It was very difficult to do, but it was really important to do.

1:27:54.740 --> 1:27:58.100
 And I don't think I'd be able to do it without a, without a microphone.

1:27:58.100 --> 1:27:59.100
 Right.

1:27:59.100 --> 1:28:02.620
 Listen, how often do we sit there and just focus our attention and just look at the other

1:28:02.620 --> 1:28:03.620
 person?

1:28:03.620 --> 1:28:05.780
 I, I don't know, man.

1:28:05.780 --> 1:28:07.340
 This is not even recording right now.

1:28:07.340 --> 1:28:10.540
 I just invited you over.

1:28:10.540 --> 1:28:11.900
 Just so we could actually, you're right.

1:28:11.900 --> 1:28:15.700
 The podcast does make, like I listen, I've been listening to every word you've been saying.

1:28:15.700 --> 1:28:19.740
 And if we weren't doing a podcast, I might be looking at my phone or being self conscious

1:28:19.740 --> 1:28:23.660
 about something else or nervous or anxious, especially with people close to you.

1:28:23.660 --> 1:28:29.620
 I mean, that was, I recommend that actually for people to talk to their family on a podcast

1:28:29.620 --> 1:28:31.300
 or like a fake or not.

1:28:31.300 --> 1:28:32.300
 That's really powerful.

1:28:32.300 --> 1:28:37.260
 It made me realize that there's a clear distinction between the conversations we usually have

1:28:37.260 --> 1:28:43.340
 with humans and those we have when a podcast is being recorded.

1:28:43.340 --> 1:28:46.060
 What the fuck were we talking on before that?

1:28:46.060 --> 1:28:49.220
 I knew you were going to lose your train of thought on that one because that's a big one.

1:28:49.220 --> 1:28:50.660
 There's a motion behind that one.

1:28:50.660 --> 1:28:53.900
 A podcast with dad is going to take, that's going to take you to a place that took you

1:28:53.900 --> 1:28:54.900
 to a place.

1:28:54.900 --> 1:28:57.260
 It took you outside of interviewer.

1:28:57.260 --> 1:28:58.260
 New York.

1:28:58.260 --> 1:28:59.260
 It went to a place.

1:28:59.260 --> 1:29:00.260
 New York and Yang.

1:29:00.260 --> 1:29:01.260
 Yeah.

1:29:01.260 --> 1:29:02.260
 In New York and Yang.

1:29:02.260 --> 1:29:07.140
 That's what really surprised me about, I like the psychoanalysis that you just threw in

1:29:07.140 --> 1:29:08.140
 there.

1:29:08.140 --> 1:29:09.140
 Yeah.

1:29:09.140 --> 1:29:10.140
 I knew that.

1:29:10.140 --> 1:29:11.140
 Yeah.

1:29:11.140 --> 1:29:12.140
 That took you to a place.

1:29:12.140 --> 1:29:13.140
 So Andrew Yang mentioned.

1:29:13.140 --> 1:29:14.140
 Do you respect me now, dad?

1:29:14.140 --> 1:29:15.140
 MIT, is it enough?

1:29:15.140 --> 1:29:16.140
 Fucking million people listening to this.

1:29:16.140 --> 1:29:17.140
 I got 14 Rogans.

1:29:17.140 --> 1:29:18.140
 Is it enough, dad?

1:29:18.140 --> 1:29:19.140
 I'm creating robots.

1:29:19.140 --> 1:29:20.140
 Is it enough for you?

1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:21.140
 It's never enough.

1:29:21.140 --> 1:29:26.140
 That's what drives you probably.

1:29:26.140 --> 1:29:27.300
 That's probably what drives me.

1:29:27.300 --> 1:29:30.500
 That's what gives meaning to life is it's never enough.

1:29:30.500 --> 1:29:33.380
 And I hope to pass that on to my kids one day.

1:29:33.380 --> 1:29:34.380
 That nothing's ever enough.

1:29:34.380 --> 1:29:36.380
 Whether they're robot or human, right?

1:29:36.380 --> 1:29:37.380
 Your kids.

1:29:37.380 --> 1:29:38.380
 Most likely.

1:29:38.380 --> 1:29:39.380
 Let's be honest.

1:29:39.380 --> 1:29:40.380
 Robot.

1:29:40.380 --> 1:29:41.380
 You might call one of your robot.

1:29:41.380 --> 1:29:42.380
 Do you love your robot?

1:29:42.380 --> 1:29:43.380
 Are you starting to love your...

1:29:43.380 --> 1:29:44.380
 Is it going to be like that Pygmalion thing?

1:29:44.380 --> 1:29:45.380
 You create them and then they kill you.

1:29:45.380 --> 1:29:46.380
 But even while they're killing you, you got a tear.

1:29:46.380 --> 1:29:47.380
 The tear.

1:29:47.380 --> 1:29:48.380
 A slow one.

1:29:48.380 --> 1:29:49.380
 One tear.

1:29:49.380 --> 1:29:50.380
 One tear.

1:29:50.380 --> 1:29:51.380
 And just.

1:29:51.380 --> 1:29:52.380
 Yeah.

1:29:52.380 --> 1:29:53.380
 Why are you doing this Frankenstein?

1:29:53.380 --> 1:29:54.380
 Why?

1:29:54.380 --> 1:29:55.380
 Why?

1:29:55.380 --> 1:29:56.380
 But I loved you.

1:29:56.380 --> 1:29:57.380
 Those would be the last words out of my mouth.

1:29:57.380 --> 1:30:03.940
 I just want to mention something on the, that it costs $400,000.

1:30:03.940 --> 1:30:11.380
 Over $400,000 per year to support one person in prison in New York.

1:30:11.380 --> 1:30:15.380
 Like when I heard that number, it was really confusing to me.

1:30:15.380 --> 1:30:21.300
 Like that it costs that much, 400K per person.

1:30:21.300 --> 1:30:27.260
 And it was really refreshing to hear a politician describe a particular problem with data.

1:30:27.260 --> 1:30:31.060
 That this is this prison industrial complex, whatever the hell it is.

1:30:31.060 --> 1:30:33.940
 And whether the solution, it's unclear what the solution is.

1:30:33.940 --> 1:30:39.500
 I think he has solutions, but just the honesty of presenting that information was refreshing.

1:30:39.500 --> 1:30:43.060
 And I'm not sure a capitalistic person would solve that.

1:30:43.060 --> 1:30:44.980
 Those kinds of problems he might make worse.

1:30:44.980 --> 1:30:48.780
 And I'm not, I'm a huge fan of capitalism.

1:30:48.780 --> 1:30:56.180
 I think the free market is the way we make progress in this world, but it seems to go

1:30:56.180 --> 1:30:58.460
 wrong in certain directions.

1:30:58.460 --> 1:31:01.780
 Like the military industrial complex, the prison industrial complex, anything that ends

1:31:01.780 --> 1:31:04.280
 with industrial complex.

1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:06.260
 And so I'm not sure.

1:31:06.260 --> 1:31:14.420
 I'm not sure if all of the problems, you're basically saying, let's put New York's problems

1:31:14.420 --> 1:31:16.700
 aside.

1:31:16.700 --> 1:31:20.660
 We need to have New York shine first to do what it does best.

1:31:20.660 --> 1:31:21.660
 Essentially.

1:31:21.660 --> 1:31:22.660
 Yeah.

1:31:22.660 --> 1:31:26.300
 And then we will fix them, well, and then we can focus on the problems.

1:31:26.300 --> 1:31:29.380
 But if you just say like, here's a problem, here's a problem, here's a problem, let's

1:31:29.380 --> 1:31:32.760
 make sure we have the safety net that protects us against all of these kinds of problems.

1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:38.260
 That's not going to, that's going to kill the city, the spirit of the city that is in

1:31:38.260 --> 1:31:42.820
 your biased opinion, the Rome of the world.

1:31:42.820 --> 1:31:44.580
 That said, a lot of people are fleeing New York.

1:31:44.580 --> 1:31:46.700
 Yeah, that's why I say it.

1:31:46.700 --> 1:31:51.800
 That's the reality of the situation is, you know, I'm all for the public good, but yeah,

1:31:51.800 --> 1:31:56.700
 there needs to be a back to that Greek expression, pan metroniris, and I also think the free

1:31:56.700 --> 1:31:58.820
 market is responsible for progress.

1:31:58.820 --> 1:32:02.100
 I think it's the most natural thing, the thing that's most aligned with human nature, which

1:32:02.100 --> 1:32:03.860
 is self interest.

1:32:03.860 --> 1:32:07.860
 And which I'm not to the extent that Ayn Rand would, but I do believe people are mostly

1:32:07.860 --> 1:32:13.140
 self interested, especially with one gun to the head, morals are out the window, you know,

1:32:13.140 --> 1:32:14.140
 it's about survival.

1:32:14.140 --> 1:32:18.940
 So, you know, create a system that respects that and acknowledges that, but socialism

1:32:18.940 --> 1:32:25.580
 works very well, at least right now, as a check as to temper the excesses of capitalism

1:32:25.580 --> 1:32:31.760
 and in certain scenarios is the more appropriate system, you know, in a vacuum.

1:32:31.760 --> 1:32:38.700
 So one being prisons or, you know, you know, governance, you know, parks.

1:32:38.700 --> 1:32:44.000
 Maybe even, well, and this is a difficult one, but in healthcare, healthcare, it's unclear

1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:45.000
 what to write.

1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.000
 There's a lot of debates there.

1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:47.000
 Yeah.

1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:48.000
 Doctors want boats.

1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:49.000
 Yeah.

1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:50.980
 So I guess you're voting for AOC you're saying.

1:32:50.980 --> 1:32:54.980
 No, I'm not voting for AOC, but I do, it's just a tough one.

1:32:54.980 --> 1:32:55.980
 That's a tough one.

1:32:55.980 --> 1:33:01.740
 But ultimately, the Hippocratic Oath, it's like, how do you turn people away, man?

1:33:01.740 --> 1:33:02.840
 How do you do that to people?

1:33:02.840 --> 1:33:13.580
 It's like, it's a tough thing to reconcile helping people, curing people with the marketplace.

1:33:13.580 --> 1:33:16.620
 It's just, I can understand why that one's so tough.

1:33:16.620 --> 1:33:19.980
 And then you got hypochondriacs, of course, who drain the system, you know, like people

1:33:19.980 --> 1:33:26.660
 who are having anxiety, like me who had COVID and called 14, you know, I called 14 ambulances.

1:33:26.660 --> 1:33:31.380
 So and then of course we're fat and the free market made us fat because it played the marketing

1:33:31.380 --> 1:33:34.500
 made us want all this junk food and that's a burden on the healthcare system.

1:33:34.500 --> 1:33:35.500
 So we got to do something about that.

1:33:35.500 --> 1:33:36.500
 We got to get creative.

1:33:36.500 --> 1:33:37.500
 We need new thinkers.

1:33:37.500 --> 1:33:38.500
 I'll be one of them.

1:33:38.500 --> 1:33:41.020
 When you go to a fast food restaurant, you stand on a scale.

1:33:41.020 --> 1:33:44.060
 If you're over a certain thing, you can't be served.

1:33:44.060 --> 1:33:45.620
 It's good for the healthcare system.

1:33:45.620 --> 1:33:49.620
 You know, you just handed a salad and say, sorry, this burger is illegal for right now.

1:33:49.620 --> 1:33:56.100
 If you achieve these certain BMI goals, then you can, you can have this burger, but right

1:33:56.100 --> 1:33:57.100
 now you can't.

1:33:57.100 --> 1:33:58.100
 And that's where the state's important.

1:33:58.100 --> 1:33:59.100
 Yeah.

1:33:59.100 --> 1:34:00.100
 Okay.

1:34:00.100 --> 1:34:01.100
 To regulate our freedoms.

1:34:01.100 --> 1:34:02.100
 No slurpees.

1:34:02.100 --> 1:34:03.100
 I'm with you Bloomberg.

1:34:03.100 --> 1:34:04.820
 Well, I'm with you to go along.

1:34:04.820 --> 1:34:06.300
 I think the salads are too expensive.

1:34:06.300 --> 1:34:07.380
 They should be subsidized.

1:34:07.380 --> 1:34:11.940
 If you, if you go to like a fast food joint, the burger is always going to be cheaper than

1:34:11.940 --> 1:34:12.940
 the salad.

1:34:12.940 --> 1:34:13.940
 And this does not make sense.

1:34:13.940 --> 1:34:14.940
 We should run on this platform.

1:34:14.940 --> 1:34:19.980
 I'll be your vice president or ban burgers for, for people of a certain weight and make

1:34:19.980 --> 1:34:21.100
 salads cheap.

1:34:21.100 --> 1:34:22.300
 Three day work weeks.

1:34:22.300 --> 1:34:23.300
 Why has that not happened yet?

1:34:23.300 --> 1:34:24.300
 Wait, wait.

1:34:24.300 --> 1:34:25.300
 Okay.

1:34:25.300 --> 1:34:26.300
 Where are you going with this one?

1:34:26.300 --> 1:34:27.300
 Dude, good for the economy.

1:34:27.300 --> 1:34:28.300
 Stimulates the economy, right?

1:34:28.300 --> 1:34:32.380
 More shifts, creates more jobs, more people spending because they have more leisure time,

1:34:32.380 --> 1:34:34.940
 boosts the leisure economy, you know?

1:34:34.940 --> 1:34:38.580
 Why are we still doing the five day work week that, that was, that was tempered from the

1:34:38.580 --> 1:34:39.580
 seven day work week.

1:34:39.580 --> 1:34:43.460
 That was, so the seven, it used to be seven day work week, it used to be like, and people

1:34:43.460 --> 1:34:46.780
 who are just these libertarians, it's like, come on dude, what, what is this fresh, are

1:34:46.780 --> 1:34:47.780
 we freshmen in college?

1:34:47.780 --> 1:34:48.780
 Yeah.

1:34:48.780 --> 1:34:50.300
 You're going to, we're going to talk about Ayn Rand next.

1:34:50.300 --> 1:34:51.580
 Like let's talk about reality.

1:34:51.580 --> 1:34:52.580
 Okay.

1:34:52.580 --> 1:34:53.580
 And human nature.

1:34:53.580 --> 1:34:54.580
 People are fucking greedy.

1:34:54.580 --> 1:34:55.580
 They lie.

1:34:55.580 --> 1:34:59.580
 They, you know, there's no end to up, which is one of my favorite expressions.

1:34:59.580 --> 1:35:00.580
 No end to up.

1:35:00.580 --> 1:35:01.580
 No end to up.

1:35:01.580 --> 1:35:02.580
 There's no end to up.

1:35:02.580 --> 1:35:03.580
 Can we dissect that?

1:35:03.580 --> 1:35:04.580
 Yeah.

1:35:04.580 --> 1:35:05.580
 From a Randian perspective.

1:35:05.580 --> 1:35:08.620
 There's no end to up, which is, uh, you just keep going.

1:35:08.620 --> 1:35:09.620
 It's never enough.

1:35:09.620 --> 1:35:10.620
 Oh, never enough.

1:35:10.620 --> 1:35:11.620
 Oh, it's never enough.

1:35:11.620 --> 1:35:12.620
 No end to up.

1:35:12.620 --> 1:35:13.620
 No end to up more.

1:35:13.620 --> 1:35:16.060
 And you know, you have to reconcile your fact that you're going to die.

1:35:16.060 --> 1:35:25.540
 So like this no end up thing is that balance is, is just as valuable as progress.

1:35:25.540 --> 1:35:30.780
 So we have to reconcile those two things and put them on a seesaw and figure out how to

1:35:30.780 --> 1:35:34.260
 get two people who have the equal weight to keep it like that.

1:35:34.260 --> 1:35:35.260
 And that's the goal.

1:35:35.260 --> 1:35:38.780
 And it constantly vacillates, uh, according to the time you sometimes you need a little

1:35:38.780 --> 1:35:39.780
 more socialism.

1:35:39.780 --> 1:35:40.860
 Sometimes you need a little more capitalism.

1:35:40.860 --> 1:35:43.340
 You gotta, you gotta, you gotta fly the plane, man.

1:35:43.340 --> 1:35:45.060
 You gotta fly the plane, dude.

1:35:45.060 --> 1:35:52.300
 What's your, um, looking back at history, is there a moment, time period in history,

1:35:52.300 --> 1:35:54.940
 a person in history that's most fascinating to you?

1:35:54.940 --> 1:35:57.980
 You mentioned Bernie Madoff, maybe second to Bernie Madoff.

1:35:57.980 --> 1:36:01.620
 Is there in a battle of Crete, is there something that you've always been curious about?

1:36:01.620 --> 1:36:04.860
 Even if it's something you haven't actually researched that well yet, just something that

1:36:04.860 --> 1:36:09.100
 pulled at your curiosity that, uh, instructed the way you think about the world.

1:36:09.100 --> 1:36:15.660
 An individual or an event or an event, individual, uh, you know, yeah.

1:36:15.660 --> 1:36:18.700
 Moment in history or a person in history.

1:36:18.700 --> 1:36:25.980
 Um, there's a few, but, uh, you know, queen Elizabeth, uh, the Elizabethan era, you know,

1:36:25.980 --> 1:36:33.420
 the sun never sets in the British empire, very successful empire, uh, what an absolute

1:36:33.420 --> 1:36:40.220
 success story that is, is for a leader and a woman, um, can you tell a little bit about

1:36:40.220 --> 1:36:41.220
 her story?

1:36:41.220 --> 1:36:42.220
 I actually don't know much about the British empire.

1:36:42.220 --> 1:36:43.220
 Yeah.

1:36:43.220 --> 1:36:44.220
 She had a good run.

1:36:44.220 --> 1:36:47.500
 I think it's like 70 years, you know, as a Shakespeare, they, you know, the, oh, I guess

1:36:47.500 --> 1:36:52.580
 what's the word, Pax Romana, the, the, uh, the period of Rome that it was at peace and

1:36:52.580 --> 1:36:56.380
 they flourished like a couple of emperors like Trajan or some good ones.

1:36:56.380 --> 1:37:00.260
 And I think he was part of the Pax Romana that sort of just a peace and a comfortable

1:37:00.260 --> 1:37:06.420
 flourishing time and England, uh, had sort of that in their empire under her successful

1:37:06.420 --> 1:37:07.420
 reign.

1:37:07.420 --> 1:37:08.420
 She murdered her cousin.

1:37:08.420 --> 1:37:12.420
 She, you know, the movies, there's, uh, you know, um, Kate Blanchett plays her and, and

1:37:12.420 --> 1:37:13.500
 does so.

1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:18.420
 And she didn't win the Oscar because fucking Gwyneth Paltrow put a, put a British accent

1:37:18.420 --> 1:37:19.660
 on in Shakespeare in love.

1:37:19.660 --> 1:37:20.660
 It's a tragedy.

1:37:20.660 --> 1:37:21.660
 Why do I know this?

1:37:21.660 --> 1:37:22.660
 Because I'm not a full man.

1:37:22.660 --> 1:37:27.980
 I'm a comedian, which means I do skits and I perform, um, and I, uh, Kate Blanchett's

1:37:27.980 --> 1:37:30.020
 incredible actress at great movies.

1:37:30.020 --> 1:37:34.260
 She was just so, and here's the thing, she, she never got married.

1:37:34.260 --> 1:37:42.620
 She was, she was so, um, astute at public relations and, and, and, and imagine how strong

1:37:42.620 --> 1:37:47.860
 you got to be as a woman to lead the greatest empire maybe known to man at the time and

1:37:47.860 --> 1:37:50.180
 to do so, so successfully.

1:37:50.180 --> 1:37:54.020
 How Machiavellian you have to be, how idealist you have to be, how much of a good marketer

1:37:54.020 --> 1:37:55.020
 you have to be.

1:37:55.020 --> 1:37:56.400
 Propaganda machine was on point.

1:37:56.400 --> 1:37:58.180
 She was married to England.

1:37:58.180 --> 1:38:01.460
 She was adored the way she adorned herself.

1:38:01.460 --> 1:38:04.780
 You walked in, you're like, holy men, God just walked in here.

1:38:04.780 --> 1:38:06.100
 And of course she got fucked.

1:38:06.100 --> 1:38:07.600
 I mean, who doesn't fuck?

1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:08.820
 We all fuck.

1:38:08.820 --> 1:38:10.660
 Even robots one day will fuck.

1:38:10.660 --> 1:38:16.880
 But she was, she, she did that propaganda thing and historians aren't, uh, haven't,

1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:20.440
 they haven't decided this, but I believe she fucked.

1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:24.940
 And I believe she did that as a tool of propaganda.

1:38:24.940 --> 1:38:26.340
 I'm married to England.

1:38:26.340 --> 1:38:31.180
 So you, oh, you're, you're directly referring to like using sex as a way to manipulate people.

1:38:31.180 --> 1:38:35.860
 Well, she, her, she was known as like the, the Virgin queen.

1:38:35.860 --> 1:38:37.940
 And uh, and her thing was like, I'm married to England.

1:38:37.940 --> 1:38:40.900
 Like I can't be distracted by man or woman, blah, blah, blah.

1:38:40.900 --> 1:38:42.260
 She never had any kids, nothing.

1:38:42.260 --> 1:38:49.260
 I think she did that as a tool of manipulation, which you need.

1:38:49.260 --> 1:38:53.420
 Rulers need to, you know, Obama made you feel good and then he went and bombed, carpet bombed

1:38:53.420 --> 1:38:54.420
 everywhere.

1:38:54.420 --> 1:38:58.220
 You need to feel good about your guy, no matter how evil they are.

1:38:58.220 --> 1:39:00.380
 And she was fucking a dictator.

1:39:00.380 --> 1:39:03.700
 But when you look back at her, everyone's like, oh my God, she was so great.

1:39:03.700 --> 1:39:08.240
 The horror and the shit that she had to do, she didn't put that in the history books,

1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:11.980
 but that's what probably was part of what made her successful.

1:39:11.980 --> 1:39:17.360
 And um, she's a fascinating character to, to ponder because she was so successful and,

1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:20.200
 and England flourished so much.

1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:23.460
 And it's just fascinating to me because she was the great Virgin queen.

1:39:23.460 --> 1:39:28.660
 And can you think of, there's no other woman who was that, I mean, Angela Merkel, I mean,

1:39:28.660 --> 1:39:29.660
 come on.

1:39:29.660 --> 1:39:33.940
 I mean, there's nobody who comes close and defeating the Spanish Armada, I think that

1:39:33.940 --> 1:39:34.940
 happened under her.

1:39:34.940 --> 1:39:39.500
 I mean, I'm no professional, but I mean, the, the woman crushed.

1:39:39.500 --> 1:39:40.500
 And uh,

1:39:40.500 --> 1:39:44.180
 Do you think it's more effective to lead by love, which just sounds like what she did

1:39:44.180 --> 1:39:46.380
 from the PR perspective or by fear?

1:39:46.380 --> 1:39:48.100
 Where do you, where do you land on that?

1:39:48.100 --> 1:39:49.100
 That's a great question.

1:39:49.100 --> 1:39:52.100
 Um, I'm not, we got to ask Joe.

1:39:52.100 --> 1:39:58.100
 Well, yeah, this is interesting cause I think leading in the 21st century in whatever ways

1:39:58.100 --> 1:39:59.380
 is different.

1:39:59.380 --> 1:40:01.580
 I think it's very difficult to lead by fear.

1:40:01.580 --> 1:40:08.900
 I mean, um, that's why I find Putin fascinating and like really fascinating.

1:40:08.900 --> 1:40:14.260
 Like is he a relic of another era or is he something that will still be necessary in

1:40:14.260 --> 1:40:16.500
 the coming decades for certain nations?

1:40:16.500 --> 1:40:19.780
 I think he's a, I don't think he's a relic from another era.

1:40:19.780 --> 1:40:23.980
 I think his background, I think he is who you think he is because his background was

1:40:23.980 --> 1:40:25.460
 in espionage.

1:40:25.460 --> 1:40:28.340
 His background was in subterfuge and espionage.

1:40:28.340 --> 1:40:33.620
 I think I've said the word subterfuge maybe 10 times now, but he, uh, like big words,

1:40:33.620 --> 1:40:34.620
 intellectuals.

1:40:34.620 --> 1:40:35.980
 I just sitting here with you.

1:40:35.980 --> 1:40:37.820
 It's my, it's time to flex.

1:40:37.820 --> 1:40:41.140
 Um, but he, um, he's very good at that, right?

1:40:41.140 --> 1:40:45.660
 Like, uh, controlling people with psychology and even if you look at the way he sort of

1:40:45.660 --> 1:40:51.980
 used the internet and, um, has sort of been, you know, gotten in to the citizens of other

1:40:51.980 --> 1:40:56.660
 countries opinions and it's very KGB.

1:40:56.660 --> 1:41:00.980
 He also looks great without a shirt on a pony on a horse on a horse.

1:41:00.980 --> 1:41:01.980
 Yeah.

1:41:01.980 --> 1:41:02.980
 Yeah.

1:41:02.980 --> 1:41:06.380
 I thought he would choose a pony cause a pony smaller makes him would, uh, would you, would

1:41:06.380 --> 1:41:09.500
 you put queen Elizabeth as the greatest leader of all time?

1:41:09.500 --> 1:41:10.500
 Probably.

1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:11.500
 Yeah.

1:41:11.500 --> 1:41:16.420
 If you look at Elizabeth as a woman and you look at, uh, you look at the, the length of

1:41:16.420 --> 1:41:21.080
 the reign, I think it's like 70 something years or something like that, that she reigned

1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:23.300
 success man, success.

1:41:23.300 --> 1:41:28.580
 She used the church, she used public psychology, Shakespeare, the greatest playwright of all

1:41:28.580 --> 1:41:34.460
 time, uh, under her reign, you know, people were going to plays and, and, uh, it was a,

1:41:34.460 --> 1:41:40.140
 it was a success front and she was marauding everywhere else marauding and culling resources

1:41:40.140 --> 1:41:44.540
 for the empire and just say a absolute successful.

1:41:44.540 --> 1:41:46.940
 It's even, uh, a token of her success.

1:41:46.940 --> 1:41:48.580
 We don't consider her a dictator.

1:41:48.580 --> 1:41:49.580
 Yeah.

1:41:49.580 --> 1:41:51.660
 She's a dictator, you know, she was queen.

1:41:51.660 --> 1:41:55.500
 I, this is my thing I love about the feudal system that these fucking countries still

1:41:55.500 --> 1:41:56.620
 have feudal systems.

1:41:56.620 --> 1:42:03.360
 They're celebrating a horrible thing, divine right of Kings oppression, Kings were dictators

1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:05.380
 and now they have fucking ceremonial.

1:42:05.380 --> 1:42:07.780
 Why don't we have a ceremonial Fuhrer?

1:42:07.780 --> 1:42:08.780
 What is in German?

1:42:08.780 --> 1:42:09.780
 He doesn't do any of the bad stuff.

1:42:09.780 --> 1:42:13.220
 He just rolls around and does, I mean, it's like, what the fuck?

1:42:13.220 --> 1:42:15.860
 There's no difference between a Hitler and a fucking King.

1:42:15.860 --> 1:42:17.780
 They did the same horrible shit.

1:42:17.780 --> 1:42:22.100
 Why not a fucking ceremonial conqueror, Alexander the Great walks in, rapes a little bit, but

1:42:22.100 --> 1:42:23.100
 it's all fun.

1:42:23.100 --> 1:42:24.100
 It's for ceremony.

1:42:24.100 --> 1:42:25.100
 He represents the country.

1:42:25.100 --> 1:42:26.820
 Macedonia is Greek.

1:42:26.820 --> 1:42:32.900
 It's interesting to see that, uh, some you're starting to see a bit of that in Russia was

1:42:32.900 --> 1:42:40.180
 Stalin, actually the celebration of a, of a man that helped win the great patriotic war.

1:42:40.180 --> 1:42:41.180
 Yeah.

1:42:41.180 --> 1:42:42.180
 Right.

1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:44.940
 So like you, you're already starting to see that it's very possible in history books,

1:42:44.940 --> 1:42:50.100
 you'll be seen as maybe like a Genghis Khan type of character and you forget the millions

1:42:50.100 --> 1:42:51.860
 that he tortured.

1:42:51.860 --> 1:42:55.620
 So you're one of the most successful and brilliant people the world has ever seen.

1:42:55.620 --> 1:42:59.660
 So you're the good person to ask, uh, for advice.

1:42:59.660 --> 1:43:04.300
 You know, there's a lot of young people that look up to you, uh, God bless their souls

1:43:04.300 --> 1:43:05.300
 and hearts.

1:43:05.300 --> 1:43:06.700
 Made the right choice.

1:43:06.700 --> 1:43:08.820
 What advice would you give to a young person?

1:43:08.820 --> 1:43:14.720
 Maybe to yourself, to a young version of yourself, you know, and just how to live a successful,

1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:16.560
 a good life.

1:43:16.560 --> 1:43:18.220
 Be doggedly you.

1:43:18.220 --> 1:43:25.140
 I think the magic happens when you are stubbornly doggedly you and you meet other people who

1:43:25.140 --> 1:43:30.540
 are doing the same and, um, the real magic of life, the real true currency in this ephemeral

1:43:30.540 --> 1:43:35.700
 life is sort of the communication that happens between people.

1:43:35.700 --> 1:43:40.620
 Uh, that's the real currency, friendships, love, it's, it's cliche, but it's a, I think

1:43:40.620 --> 1:43:45.300
 the meaning of life is to experience, to experience love.

1:43:45.300 --> 1:43:49.220
 And, uh, I think, uh, people often mistake, maybe it's because of Hollywood films and

1:43:49.220 --> 1:43:54.860
 things like that, that love is a feeling, but it's not, it's an action.

1:43:54.860 --> 1:43:59.380
 So, uh, that took me a while to learn and I think that's why I've made decisions since

1:43:59.380 --> 1:44:01.860
 that I think have been good for me and healthy for me.

1:44:01.860 --> 1:44:03.380
 Love is an action.

1:44:03.380 --> 1:44:08.140
 People can say things, you can feel things, um, that doesn't mean they're necessarily

1:44:08.140 --> 1:44:09.140
 real.

1:44:09.140 --> 1:44:10.260
 It's all chemical reactions.

1:44:10.260 --> 1:44:17.180
 It's all, um, tied to our immaturity and, uh, psychological issues and, uh, survival,

1:44:17.180 --> 1:44:24.100
 but action when some, when you do things, when you act out of love and you, the, that's,

1:44:24.100 --> 1:44:25.300
 that's what it's about.

1:44:25.300 --> 1:44:31.380
 Is there, uh, times when you were younger where you were kind of dishonest with who

1:44:31.380 --> 1:44:36.700
 you are to yourself in terms of like, what, what kind of things did you have to do to,

1:44:36.700 --> 1:44:41.900
 to shake yourself up and be like, okay, I thought, um, I thought I'm going to be a scientist,

1:44:41.900 --> 1:44:44.180
 but instead I realized I'm going to do this.

1:44:44.180 --> 1:44:45.180
 Yeah.

1:44:45.180 --> 1:44:46.180
 My parents were funny.

1:44:46.180 --> 1:44:47.180
 Yeah.

1:44:47.180 --> 1:44:50.580
 My, my comedy is a hard, hard thing to explain to, uh, you know, an immigrant mother who

1:44:50.580 --> 1:44:55.540
 came here and under Nazi occupied Crete and became a human rights lawyer and lawyer.

1:44:55.540 --> 1:44:59.460
 And, uh, my brother's a lawyer and my father was a lawyer, you know, clawed his way up.

1:44:59.460 --> 1:45:04.140
 His dad was a, was a, um, so your disappointment, um, the black sheep.

1:45:04.140 --> 1:45:05.140
 Yeah.

1:45:05.140 --> 1:45:11.820
 My brother went to Oxford Georgetown law at Brown, you know, has a master's in pot, you

1:45:11.820 --> 1:45:13.020
 know, law degrees.

1:45:13.020 --> 1:45:17.580
 My mother has followed up for law degrees, uh, you know, uh, she was on the human rights

1:45:17.580 --> 1:45:22.700
 commission in New York up for a judgeship under Dinkins, um, wrote a, you know, um,

1:45:22.700 --> 1:45:24.740
 she was the editor of Unitar.

1:45:24.740 --> 1:45:27.940
 She wrote a seminal piece on the human rights of children for the United Nations.

1:45:27.940 --> 1:45:30.260
 Um, and, uh, yeah, it was a comedian.

1:45:30.260 --> 1:45:31.540
 I was always a fuck up.

1:45:31.540 --> 1:45:35.780
 And, uh, the thing that I was best at, the only thing I was ever decent at was just like

1:45:35.780 --> 1:45:36.780
 making people laugh.

1:45:36.780 --> 1:45:37.780
 I don't know why.

1:45:37.780 --> 1:45:41.660
 I don't know where that comes from, but, uh, was there ever a question or did, was there

1:45:41.660 --> 1:45:44.020
 a moment where you decided this is what I'm going to do?

1:45:44.020 --> 1:45:45.900
 There was a moment after I graduated college.

1:45:45.900 --> 1:45:46.900
 Yeah.

1:45:46.900 --> 1:45:51.020
 I was just thinking about all types of stuff that other people imposed on me.

1:45:51.020 --> 1:45:55.180
 And, um, I was honest with myself and once I figured out it was an actual career path,

1:45:55.180 --> 1:46:00.220
 I wasn't even aware back then the internet wasn't huge, you know, late 99, 2000 it wasn't

1:46:00.220 --> 1:46:01.220
 big yet.

1:46:01.220 --> 1:46:02.980
 So I didn't, I thought Robin Williams was just like an actor.

1:46:02.980 --> 1:46:04.980
 I didn't know there was comedy clubs and all.

1:46:04.980 --> 1:46:07.820
 So once I learned that I was just like, I tried it.

1:46:07.820 --> 1:46:09.900
 I suffer from massive anxiety.

1:46:09.900 --> 1:46:12.340
 I remember the first time I did comedy, my arms went numb.

1:46:12.340 --> 1:46:14.220
 I started having a massive panic attack.

1:46:14.220 --> 1:46:15.300
 I have my first set.

1:46:15.300 --> 1:46:16.300
 I can show it to you.

1:46:16.300 --> 1:46:17.860
 I suggest I just come video.

1:46:17.860 --> 1:46:18.860
 Yeah.

1:46:18.860 --> 1:46:19.860
 I'm video.

1:46:19.860 --> 1:46:20.860
 Thank you.

1:46:20.860 --> 1:46:21.860
 Thank you.

1:46:21.860 --> 1:46:22.860
 Thank you.

1:46:22.860 --> 1:46:23.860
 And the reason why I kept saying thank you is because I forgot my old jokes.

1:46:23.860 --> 1:46:24.860
 I was so scared.

1:46:24.860 --> 1:46:26.740
 And then they laughed because of the amount of times I said thank you.

1:46:26.740 --> 1:46:31.300
 And then once they laughed, I was, I remembered the whole thing and I did the five minutes

1:46:31.300 --> 1:46:32.500
 and I remember getting off.

1:46:32.500 --> 1:46:37.360
 And for a person who never felt like he had a place anywhere, nothing ever felt right.

1:46:37.360 --> 1:46:39.580
 That felt like, okay, I found it.

1:46:39.580 --> 1:46:41.220
 This is what I'm supposed to do.

1:46:41.220 --> 1:46:42.220
 This is it.

1:46:42.220 --> 1:46:45.260
 It was the only time in my life I felt that I haven't felt that sense.

1:46:45.260 --> 1:46:46.660
 Never felt it before.

1:46:46.660 --> 1:46:48.600
 So that's the only thing I can do.

1:46:48.600 --> 1:46:53.500
 And yeah, I had that, you know, it's funny cause there's a similar experience like immigrant

1:46:53.500 --> 1:46:59.500
 family and the world tells you to do certain things and you think that's right, but, but

1:46:59.500 --> 1:47:07.860
 then you put yourself in situations by luck probably where it's like, oh, this, this,

1:47:07.860 --> 1:47:08.940
 this feels right.

1:47:08.940 --> 1:47:11.220
 I don't know what this means, but this feels right.

1:47:11.220 --> 1:47:17.300
 I think the biggest moment like that for me was, I don't know what to make of it exactly,

1:47:17.300 --> 1:47:23.980
 but when I met Spot, the robot, the legged robot, it was like five years ago, it felt

1:47:23.980 --> 1:47:31.540
 like this, the depth of fascinating ideas that are yet to be explored with this thing.

1:47:31.540 --> 1:47:32.540
 This felt like a journey.

1:47:32.540 --> 1:47:38.140
 It was like a door that opened and I was like, I don't want to be a professor.

1:47:38.140 --> 1:47:43.260
 At that point I realized I don't want to do sort of a generic stuff.

1:47:43.260 --> 1:47:44.940
 I want to do something crazy.

1:47:44.940 --> 1:47:46.820
 I want to do something big.

1:47:46.820 --> 1:47:48.620
 That's the reason I stepped away from MIT.

1:47:48.620 --> 1:47:51.800
 That's the reason I have this burning desire to do a startup.

1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:53.060
 That's the reason I came to Austin.

1:47:53.060 --> 1:47:54.060
 Yeah.

1:47:54.060 --> 1:47:57.660
 I don't know what the hell it all means, but you just kind of follow that.

1:47:57.660 --> 1:47:58.660
 That's awesome.

1:47:58.660 --> 1:48:00.360
 That sounds like you're following what's doggedly you.

1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:06.760
 And also I think I just to, just to piggyback off it, I think that means no matter what

1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:12.100
 it is, because I think our, the American dream is sold like, Hey, if you're not Beyonce or

1:48:12.100 --> 1:48:14.100
 if you're not famous, you're not worth it.

1:48:14.100 --> 1:48:15.300
 I hate that.

1:48:15.300 --> 1:48:19.560
 And that's what I love so much about certain countries like Sweden, it's like where everyone

1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:22.560
 has healthcare and stuff like that because everyone's a little is valued more.

1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:26.780
 It's like whatever, if you want to be a doorman, do it like it's all the same.

1:48:26.780 --> 1:48:28.280
 Prince was not happy.

1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:33.160
 There's no, just because you're rich or famous, you're still the same guy with your possessions

1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:34.860
 are a lot little, you know?

1:48:34.860 --> 1:48:37.380
 It's like, I have met some doormen.

1:48:37.380 --> 1:48:42.020
 I have met some tax cappers that I lie to you not are more fascinating.

1:48:42.020 --> 1:48:47.060
 I have comedians are horrible people, so I want to get away from all of them.

1:48:47.060 --> 1:48:52.540
 I have very few friends, Paul Verzi, Tim Dillon, who are comedians because they're awful, awful

1:48:52.540 --> 1:48:53.540
 people.

1:48:53.540 --> 1:48:58.300
 Some of the people who you know the most, who are the most famous are not who they say

1:48:58.300 --> 1:48:59.300
 they are.

1:48:59.300 --> 1:49:00.300
 Usually that's the case.

1:49:00.300 --> 1:49:04.660
 They're putting on that public facade because they're fucking sociopaths and they're horrible

1:49:04.660 --> 1:49:08.220
 people and some of the most beautiful people I've met and the most interesting people I've

1:49:08.220 --> 1:49:10.020
 met have regular jobs.

1:49:10.020 --> 1:49:13.380
 There is no shame in any fucking job.

1:49:13.380 --> 1:49:16.340
 We don't all have to be rappers with like rims.

1:49:16.340 --> 1:49:17.340
 It's just a weird thing.

1:49:17.340 --> 1:49:18.340
 Yeah.

1:49:18.340 --> 1:49:22.340
 Fame is a drug and yeah, comedians, I agree with you.

1:49:22.340 --> 1:49:28.460
 There's some part of me that knows that there'll be a moment in my life when I'm standing there

1:49:28.460 --> 1:49:37.860
 with like a sword or a knife in my stomach and looking at Tim Dillon's smiling face saying

1:49:37.860 --> 1:49:41.820
 you shouldn't have trusted me, you stupid fuck.

1:49:41.820 --> 1:49:46.180
 So on that note, Yannis, I've been a huge fan of yours.

1:49:46.180 --> 1:49:51.660
 I love what you're doing with Long Days Now, your new podcast, and I obviously love all

1:49:51.660 --> 1:49:56.540
 the stuff you've done before with History of Hyenas, the chemistry you have with yourself

1:49:56.540 --> 1:49:57.540
 is also fun to watch.

1:49:57.540 --> 1:49:58.540
 So man, I'm a huge fan.

1:49:58.540 --> 1:50:00.860
 It's a huge honor that you come down here.

1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:01.860
 Thanks so much for talking to me.

1:50:01.860 --> 1:50:03.380
 It means so much to me to hear you say that.

1:50:03.380 --> 1:50:04.380
 I really appreciate it.

1:50:04.380 --> 1:50:07.420
 I'm a big fan of yours and having me on has been amazing and just thank you, man.

1:50:29.100 --> 1:50:32.980
 And now let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.

1:50:32.980 --> 1:50:37.180
 Revolutions are the locomotives of history.

1:50:37.180 --> 1:50:56.460
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
